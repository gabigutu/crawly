		<shortDescription>Charming classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story has made it to the screen three times so far -- HERE COMES MR. JORDAN with Robert Montgomery, HEAVEN CAN WAIT with Warren Beatty, and DOWN TO EARTH with Chris Rock. This one is the best of the three with Claude Rains stealing all his scenes -- a knack he had in most of his films. The movie deals with premature death, reincarnation, murder, and other serious topics, but all of it is handled with a charmingly light touch. This is a delightful classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my favorite film because of the comic and dramatic acting. Robert Montgomery is able to switch between Farnsworth and Joe Pendelton in a split second When he switches to Murdoch, you have a slight difference in speech and walk between Murdoch and Joe. The James Gleason scene in the gym with Montgomery is perfection. I love Claude Rains facial expressions and Edward Everett Horton's bumbling. The dectective's line (I believe he is William McBride, a great comic actor of the 1940's), "Where's the body" is one that I use as a joke with my husband often. The remakes of this film don't come close to the original. "Down to Earth", the one with Chris Rock, was just terrible. This plot has been borrowed often. It is the first film that every dealt with this subject and will remain a classic forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood would probably be better off in looking to its past than at its future. The late 30s and early 40s produced a string of films that will not be equaled, or surpassed in a very foreseeable future.Take this film. It has been re-adapted a couple of times and sadly to say, those new movies pale in comparison. There are no stars with the caliber of a Robert Montgomery, Claude Rains, Edward Everett Horton, or Evelyn Keyes, actually, or in the horizon. To get actors of this caliber in a film today, would be a monumental task to accomplish.This film, an adaptation of a stage work, translates to the screen with such ease that is hard to surpass. Directed by Alexander Hall, with panache, is a pleasure to sit through it and enjoy.The cast is absolutely flawless. The great Robert Montgomery is very charming in his triple 're-incarnation'. Claude Rains is perfect, as is Edward Everett Horton as heavenly figures on earth. Evelyn Keyes is so beautiful. How about Rita Johnson? She cuts such a sophisticated figure. John Emery is oily enough as the evil secretary Abbott. And James Gleason's appearance has the right amount of know how and bewilderment in understanding the situation.This picture makes us realize how ahead of her time the brilliant Edith Head was. Her costumes are a perfect touch to enhance the appearance of the stars of that era. Wow! What style and sophistication she had! No one can come close to her.This is an original to be savored by discerning film aficionados.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was watching it, randomly switching channels.Opening scene is this introduction, that you read and it came across as a serious balls-to-the-wall drama. It gained my curiosity as to what kind of movie could be taking itself THIS seriously! Next scene is Montgomery boxing, playing a sax, and flying an airplane. It was funny, the banter was excellent, and I was laughing out loud.10 mins later he dies!The movie had so many 180' turns in it, but they all flow and keeps the viewers on their toes, at least it did me. I literally cried at times, and then the next scene had me hurting with laughter. The supporting cast, especially; Edward Everett Horton, James Gleason, and Evelyn Keyes were magnificent! This has now become one of my favorite movies! I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fulfilling Your Destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his second of two Oscar nominations Robert Montgomery was loaned to Columbia Pictures for Here Comes Mr. Jordan, a very charming fantasy about a man who fulfills his destiny in many different ways in many different bodies.I'm not sure how theologically sound this is, but apparently they make mistakes in heaven. Of course when you've got a new heavenly retriever on the job like Edward Everett Horton anything is possible.He snatches prize fighter Robert Montgomery from a private plane that's about to crash. Only problem is that Montgomery wasn't supposed to die in the crash. What to do, send for Claude Rains in the title role as the heavenly fixer, Mr. Jordan.Montgomery goes through two different bodies after that in an effort to give him the life span that the heavenly records are supposed to have for him. In one of those guises he meets Evelyn Keyes for whom he falls big time and she him. Of course there's a problem because Montgomery is a millionaire, married to Rita Johnson who with his private secretary, John Emery is trying to kill him.Through all of this lending his confused elfin charm is James Gleason as Montgomery's fight manager. Seems as though Gleason had a destiny also, to manage a heavyweight champion. Gleason got his career role in Here Comes Mr. Jordan as he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Donald Crisp for How Green Was My Valley. The film itself was Columbia's entry in the Best Picture category, but also lost to How Green Was My Valley.This was Robert Montgomery's second Oscar nomination and the movie going public accepted him as good natured, saxophone playing pug Joe Pendleton a lot better than the homicidal maniac in Night Must Fall his first and other Oscar nomination. This time Montgomery lost to Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.My favorite in this film however is the wise and patient Claude Rains as Mr. Jordan. One thing the film does do is that the end will have you wondering whether the whole thing really was Montgomery's destiny. Some of Rains's expressions will keep you guessing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a body need a body.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boxer Joe Pendleton is killed in an airplane crash, while training for a championship match, however Joe wasn't to die for sometime far into the future. In order to make things right, Mr. Jordan (in charge of all arrivals for the hereafter) searches for another body that Joe can use until his time is up. The body of financier Bruce Farnsworth is the selection after he is killed by his wife and secretary in order to continue their romance and get ahold of his finances. Betty Logan appears to get Farnsworth to settle the matter concerning her father, who was sent to prison in a deal swindled by Farnsworth, and Joe frees her father, but falls for her as well. In the meantime, Joe (as Farnsworth- everyone sees Joe as Farnsworth but Joe sees himself as his true being-) starts training for the championship fight (it was Joe's natural destiny to become champ), with the help of Joe's trainer, Max Corkle. This upsets Julia Farnsworth, who then decides to make certain that Joe/Farnsworth is killed. Joe and Mr. Jordan work to make sure Joe can find another body in order to become boxing champ, bring Julia and Abbott to justice, and keep the romance alive between Joe &amp; Betty. This film has such a beautiful charm (even though it seems hokey at times, but it has the ability to bridge gaps between audiences easily. An excellent script, crisp direction, and excellent performances by the cast (Gleason standing out as the befuddled trainer Corkle.) The ending is both brilliant and touching. Rating, 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heaven Can't Wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During a flight in a personal airplane, a young boxer by the name of Joe Pendleton crashes into a wooded area - just within the first ten minutes of the beginning of Here Comes Mr. Jordan. Unfortunately, a heavenly escort prematurely plucks his body from the plane before the actual crash, thereby rendering Joe body-less, yet technically alive. Joe's body is promptly cremated, so his new friend, Mr. Jordan, promises Joe a new form and they begin a search for a replacement. The 1941 film centers around Joe Pendleton, an affable man and a capable boxer, who is on his way to a fight whenever he meets his untimely death. With the help of Mr. Jordan, Joe attempts to reverse his misfortune with a new body and a fresh opportunity to enter the title fight. Along the way, however, he meets the unexpected: a beautiful, independent, and charmingly belligerent woman that he falls hopelessly in love with. The film centers around Joe's struggle to realize his dream of winning a title fight, however, it is truly a romantic comedy with themes that tend to focus on love and the fulfillment of our dreams. The makers of the film use Joe's different forms to impart their view that love is a connection between two people, while the body is simply a shell and love is a faceless awareness that sees through physical realities. Don't be turned off by this seemingly heavy theme, because Joe's constant wisecracks and frequent squabbles with the man who took him from his body keep the film light and enjoyable. Despite the occasional sluggish scene, this timeless film offers enough clean-cut comedy and bearable romanticism to warrant a viewing. It deals with an important subject without taking any importance away from keeping the film light and fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Here Comes Mr. Jordan" stars Robert Montgomery as Joe Pendleton, a prize fighter who, hurtling toward earth in his damaged plane, is taken to heaven prematurely by a new heavenly worker (Edward Everett Horton). Upon reaching the gates, it appears that the book states that Joe isn't scheduled to head skyward until 1991. An attempt to return his spirit to his body fails since Joe was cremated; Joe ends up in the body of a business tycoon, Farnsworth, just drowned by his wife and male secretary, except Farnsworth is suddenly not dead. Joe as Farnsworth meets Bette (Evelyn Keyes) and falls in love with her while wreaking havoc with the man's money and business and continuing to aggravate his wife and secretary. Then Mr. Jordan comes to him with some really bad news.This is a delightful movie, and though "Heaven Can Wait," its '70s remake, was very enjoyable, how could it be as good or better when Claude Rains and Robert Montgomery are in the original? Montgomery, who for years did light comedy as an elegant leading man, is wonderful as a streetwise prizefighter. James Gleason, as Joe's manager Corkle, has some great comic moments when he meets up with Farnsworth and Farnsworth claims to be the dead Joe. Evelyn Keyes is lovely in the ingénue role, and Rita Johnson makes an excellent murderous wife. Claude Rains played the devil in another film, and as Mr. Jordan apparently works with the Head Honcho on the other side. He exudes warmth and calmness and performs beautifully opposite the more volatile Montgomery characters.This film was released before Pearl Harbor, but everyone knew the U.S. would be entering the war. Thus began a spate of these films - "A Guy Named Joe," "Heaven Can Wait," "The Bishop's Wife," "Angel on my Shoulder," "It's a Wonderful Life," "Down to Earth," and others. The fascination with death, angels, destiny, and souls was understandably rampant as reflected by Hollywood from 1941-1948 as people sought to understand what happened to their loved ones."Here Comes Mr. Jordan" is one of the really fine examples of this genre, with beautiful performances and story. I shed some tears at the end. Perhaps you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boxer Joe Pendleton (Robert Montgomery) is all set to fight to become the Champion. Unfortunately he's in a plane crash and a collector (Edward Everett Horton) "takes" his soul to Heaven. But the collector acted too quickly...Joe WASN'T supposed to die! The Head Collector Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains) gets him the temporary body of Bruce Farnsworth--whose wife and secretary are trying to kill. And he falls in love with Bette Logan (Evelyn Keyes). How long will he be in Farnsworth---and will he want to leave and will he live? I caught this on TV when I was a kid in the 1970s. I loved it! Soon after I saw the lousy 1978 remake "Heaven Can Wait" with Warren Beatty as Pendleton (he's no Montgomery). I just saw it again and I still love it!The plot is pretty silly but the whole film is done with a very light touch and the cast pulls it off. Nobody seems to be taking it too seriously (which is good). Montgomery is very good in his role--if a little too over the top at times. Keyes is sweet and charming--she does wonders with the "good girl" role. Horton is very funny as one of the collectors and Rains is just fantastic as Mr. Jordan--a perfectly done performance (no surprise coming from Rains). More screen time with Jordan could have helped. But as it is it's just very good. I'm only giving it an 8--it's funny...but not enough. The jokes made me smile once in a while, but that's about it. A huge hit in it's day.This (understandably) won two Academy Awards for Best Story and Screenplay. It was nominated for Best Picture, Actor, Supporting Actor, Director and Cinematography.Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Pendleton dies prematurely when a heavenly messenger takes him before his time. This film examines how that messenger and his supervisor try and placate Mr. Pendleton with other bodies. This is a charming, fun, almost innocent film from a bygone era. Robert Montgomery is very good as the saxaphone-playing boxer who outwardly seems rough but inwardly has a heart of gold(okay, it gave me cliches too). The cast in this film excels. Montgomery is ably assisted by Claude Rains, James Gleason, Evelyn Keyes, and, my personal favourite, Edward Everett Horton. Rains plays the heavenly Mr. Jordan trying to fix Horton's heavenly blunder. Rains is as always very good, and his scenes in particular bring a warm glow to the screen. My favourite moments, however, are the scenes with rains and Horton talking "shop" and the ones with Horton and Montgomery bantering back and forth. Horton is a forgotten mine of comedic ability. Many reviewers seem obligated to make comparisons between this film and its most famous remake Heaven Can Wait. I like them both. Both films have qualities that exceed the other. Why we have to say one is better solely because it is older(or newer) is beyond me sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Is The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Montgomery &amp; Claude Rains carry this film. There are several other good people in the cast but the main stars are the glue. The story here has been redone twice now, Chris Rock the latest &amp; Heaven Can Wait earlier. Neither remake has the charm of this one.The story here is one of the strengths. It relies on light comedy &amp; romance plus situations to carry the film. They do so quite well as the actresses in this are not as well known now as the actors, &amp; they are clearly in support. This film has had a recent restoration which pretty much has made it as originally released.Claude Rains is an angel here, but he could play almost any role. It isn't too long after this that he is memorable in Casablanca. While it is obvious Rains worked hard in perfecting all the roles he played, he often brings them off making it look easy. In this case, he makes the angel role believable enough that you wonder if he might be there now, waiting for all of us when we go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Out for Overzealous Angels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Harry Segall's play, "Heaven Can Wait," Alexander Hall's 1941 original film adaptation boasts some fine performances, although the overall effort is pale in comparison to Warren Beatty's 1978 update. Boxer Joe Pendleton's soul is prematurely pulled from his body by an overeager angel, played by Edward Everett Horton, who wanted to save him from the pain of impending death in a plane crash. When Mr. Jordan, an angelic corporate manager, realizes the mistake, he tries to compensate with a comparable body to replace Pendleton's, which has been cremated."Here Comes Mr. Jordan" falls in the supernatural genre that attempts to reassure viewers that the afterlife is comfortingly similar to the physical world. Robert Montgomery gives a fine performance as Pendleton, who is choosy about his replacement body, because he has aspirations to a boxing championship. When he tries out murdered millionaire Bruce Farnsworth's body, he becomes involved with a young woman in trouble, a scheming wife and secretary, and his incredulous boxing manager from the Pendleton days. Hall keeps the pacing brisk, and the film is a tight 94 minutes. Besides Montgomery, James Gleason is fine as the manager, and Horton plays the discretely coded gay character as well as ever. Claude Rains as Mr. Jordan is right for the role, although restrained. Unfortunately, for those familiar with "Heaven Can Wait," the Beatty remake, the roles of the wife and secretary are lackluster in comparison to the inspired turns by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin. Evelyn Keyes as Betty also suffers when compared to Julie Christie.The general tone of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" is more serious than that of its remake, and viewers may prefer the hilarity of Grodin and Cannon to the straight performances by Rita Johnson and John Emery in the original. However, the film's mood shift may owe to the differing historical periods. Perhaps a world on the verge of World War II was looking for reassurance that lost loved ones would live on, while viewers in the late 1970's approached the same subject matter as escapist romantic fancy. Either way, the story remains durable and entertaining, and both versions were showered with Oscar nominations. Take your pick, or, better yet, watch them both and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun yet marred by a remarkably depressing "happy" ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As wonderful as this original version is, it and all its remakes have one horrible, gaping plot hole. WARNING: NOT-SO-HEAVENLY SPOILER BELOW...Does it bother anyone else that in the end, Joe Pendleton is erased? I don't mean he dies and goes to Heaven like presumably every other soul in the movie's universe. I mean, because of Edward Everett Horton's foul-up (and Claude Rains's heavenly cover-up), Pendleton ends up in the body of K.O. Murdoch with no memory of his previous life as Pendleton. In fact, he is Murdoch, although he still looks like Robert Montgomery (no doubt "Quantum Leap" was inspired by this, four decades later).Sure, he has some faint residual feelings of Pendleton's that make him hire James Gleason to be his manager, and he and Evelyn Keyes will no doubt fall in love. But the Joe Pendleton who grew up and lived his life and knew both of them before his memory was erased...PERMANENTLY CEASES TO EXIST. Pendleton is the only guy in all Creation who never gets into Heaven, thanks to of a bureaucratic mistake. He'd have one helluva lawsuit, if only he had any memory of how badly he got ripped off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here Comes Mr. Jordan is directed by Alexander Hall and adapted from Harry Segall's play by Sidney Buchman &amp; Seton Miller. It stars Robert Montgomery, Evelyn Keyes, Claude Rains, Rita Johnson, Edward Everett Horton and James Gleason. Photography is by Joseph Walker and Friedrich Hollaender scores the music. Plot sees Montgomery as boxer Joe Pendleton, who during a journey in a small plane finds himself crashing towards the earth but then suddenly finds that he is in heaven. Turns out that his soul was saved before the crash impact by angel 7013 (Horton) who assumed that he wouldn't have survived the crash. Bad call, tho, because it wasn't Pendleton's time, he's not due to die for another 50 years! So superior angel Mr. Jordan (Rains) escorts him back to Earth, but the trouble is is that Joe's body has been cremated by his boxing manager Max (Gleason), so the search is on for a new body for Joe to exist in. First stop; a murder victim!Fun and appealing comedy that offers up dry observations on the afterlife and keeps its romantic plot strand on the warm side of the bed. It's that the makers can marry up the comedy to the romance so well that makes the film so utterly beguiling. The characters are easily to warm too, so as the plot delightfully twists and turns, we are happy to run with them into each well written corner. The film is also very well casted, with Montgomery bullish without over doing it, and Rains elegant and enjoying his role. But the joys come in the support cast with Horton all prissy as the over zealous 7013 and Gleason playing it spot on as the bemused and incredulous manager. Bonus, too, is that the ending offers up a two fold resolution that shows a better hand than many other comedies of the era.Uncynical if a touch routine, Here Comes Mr. Jordan is heartily recommended fare to the classic comedy seeker. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry Warren, but the original remains the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're keeping score..."Here Comes Mr. Jordan" was remade in 1978 as "Heaven Can Wait" and again in 2001 as "Down to Earth." It inspired a sequel, the 1947 movie also entitled "Down to Earth" and that sequel itself as remade in 1980 as "Xanadu." Whew! Doubtless it has served as the inspiration for several other films and TV shows as well. For all that, however, the original remains the best. Sorry, Warren.Oh, did I mention it was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Robert Montgomery) and Best Supporting Actor (James Gleason)? It won two awards for its writing. Yes, it was pretty popular in its day.The plot now may seem overly-familiar, but that's only because of all the shows that have been inspired by it since. Boxer Joe Pendleton is killed in a plane crash, but oops, not really. He was taken to Heaven too soon and now must somehow be returned to Earth in a different body to live out his days.Snappy writing, fast paced direction and excellent acting combine to make this a very fun ride. There aren't a lot of belly laughs here, but you will likely find yourself smiling all the way through to the end. And then you might find yourself brushing away a tear at that ending. All in all it truly defines what people mean when they say "They don't make 'em like that anymore."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this fun romantic comedy-fantasy. I'm not big on Robert Montgomery, and his first scenes boxing in the ring (with a little paunch!)and then speaking in that trying-to-be-low-class accent made him seem miscast, but he grew on me as the film went on, and I really enjoyed his performance. It's one of his best.I just love the the premise of the film, and the fantasy-yet-reality of it all. The script, taken from the hit stage play HEAVEN CAN WAIT, is sharp, witty and runs along with a nice pace. Claude Rains gives an excellent performance as the title character, he is completely memorable and it's another one of his classic supporting roles. Gleason and Everett Horton also do some good work, and even if Rita Johnson is a bit stiff as Mrs Farnsworth (and why on earth is she is on the front cover of the Columbia DVD with Montgomery and Rains when it is the lovely Evelyn Keyes who is the leading lady? Were they too lazy to correct this glaring error?) she sure makes you detest her! Keyes, who I'm only familiar with as Suellen O'Hara, gives a nice performance in a role that doesn't really ask for her to do much except look pretty and slowly fall for Montgomery.It's a great oft-overlooked classic, with important, thought-provoking, moving themes of life, death and love. Above all, it's just great fun, mixing light comedy with romance and questioning our existence without being heavy-handed at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boxer Joe Pendleton is days away from his championship bout when his private plane goes down and the agents of death take him away to heaven. Unfortunately for Joe, the agent acted too fast and, had he waited he would have seen Joe recover the crashing aircraft and make it away safely. Problem is in the time taken to sort this out (which has involved top agent Mr Jordan), Joe's earthly remains have been cremated with no chance of him just being returned to his body. So begins a search for another body for Joe, a search that ultimately leads to millionaire Farnsworth ? who has just been murdered by his wife and her lover.Looking at the basic plot (and even the detail of the ending) it does strike me as rather amazing that this did get made as a studio picture because it does have a dark streak to it that could easily have undercut any comedy, whimsy or romance and alienated the audience. Watching it again recently it does still surprise me that it pulls it off but somehow it is light, funny and with plenty of charm and somehow even the rather ambiguous ending comes off as lifting and happy. A big part of this for me is the cast because they get the delivery just right ? in particular Robert Montgomery. Some have said that Rains dominates his scenes but I totally disagree, Montgomery owns the film because the tough but kind nature of his character is the engine that drives it to success. He is note perfect and his performance kept me with the tone of the film. Rains is nearly as good but is more of a cool presence in each scene.Hall's direction holds it together and makes the tone so that we never lose the slight hint of darkness but prevents it ever getting in the way of the comedy and fantasy of the piece. Here Comes Mr Jordan has been remade several times recently and you can see why because this original is charming and fresh with solid comedy and whimsy held together by a couple of great performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you think about it, "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" almost seems sacrilegious. How could God and all his Angels make a mistake and summon somebody before their time? Mind you, organized religion doesn't enter into director Alexander Hall's comedy and God is never taken to task for this mistake. Still, makes you wonder if the real title could have been: "Heaven Made A Mistake." No way, not under the Production Code Administration. Interestingly enough, the play on which the film was based was entitled "Heaven Can Wait." Later, Warren Beatty would remake the Montgomery version but as a gridiron star instead of a boxer. Nevertheless, this body-swapping comedy boasts a nice-guy performance by Robert Montgomery as a prizefighter who likes to fly but crashes in an accident.An overzealous angel, Messenger 7013 (Edward Everett Horton of "Arsenic and Old Lace"), claims Joe Pendleton by mistake, whisking him out of a plane before it crashed, and our hero winds up in the clouds about to board another plane. Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains of "Casablanca") intervenes when he discovers that Joe wasn't schedule to die for another 50 years. Charitably, Mr. Jordan gives Joe a second chance. However, he is particularly upset after he learns that he won't be receiving his original body. As it turns out, Joe's fight manager Max Corkle (James Gleason of "Meet Joe Doe"), had him cremated! So Joe has no options. The unhappy Joe takes a lot of talking to before he agrees to accept another body. Hall and scenarists Sidney Buchman and Seton I. Miller indulge in quite a bit of exposition not only to explain Joe's predicament to him but also to us. Joe winds up in a body that is above his social class. They thrust Joe into 'the overcoat' of Wall Street tycoon Bruce Farnsworth and a business intrigue subplot kicks into gear. It seems that Farnsworth's duplicitous wife Julia (Rita Johnson of "Honolulu") has been cheating on him with his secretary, Mr. Abbott (John Emery of "Spellbound"), and these two initially drowned her sleepy husband in his own private bath. At the same time, our hero feels sympathetic toward the plight of the daughter of a man that Farnsworth swindled in the Stock Market. Much to the chagrin of his board of trustees and his wife, Joe admits in the guise of Farnsworth that he swindled Bette Logan's father. When Joe isn't straightening everything out for Bette, he struggles to convince Max that he is really Joe in Farnsworth's body. Joe still wants to compete in the boxing championship that he was training for in the first scenes. The black &amp; white comic fantasy is ideal for a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most romantic moment in Hollywood history... unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even today, 70+ years after this film was made, with this reviewer (having seen it maybe a dozen time) now in his dotage, I will still occasionally bump into another cinephile, no matter male or female, who will recall this film for that one unforgettable scene where Montgomery's character, Joe Pendelton, finally gets a replacement body that suits him, and his angel (played by Claude Rains) gives him a merry sendoff by removing the memory of everything that happened in the film before that. To balance the cosmos, so to speak. Unfortunately, this also removed his memory of a girl he'd met in an earlier body (one that did not work out) so it seems that now, the course of true love is thwarted. But is it? In a long corridor inside the stadium where Montgomery's character, in his last (and final) body, has just finished a prize fight, as Montgomery passes by the girl he once was in love with (ie, in another body before his memory was diddled with); and the girl, convinced the man she'd loved (ie, Montgomery in an earlier body) was dead, passes him going the other way. Of course she does not recognize him (new body, new name); and he does not recognize her (aforesaid angelic diddling). But as they pass as strangers, the lights in the corridor momentarily go out. And when the lights come back on, each stops, aware that just for a moment, in the dark, they recognized something about the other that was not obvious to the eye. And then the girl suggests that maybe they should go have a coffee and talk about the experience. And I swear I get misty-eyed just writing about this scene, that's how powerful it is, and I promise you that none of the 700 remakes has captured it properly. In fact, the tears are welling up so fast I am going to have to go out and shoot a deer just to remind myself what a manly man I am. Oh, in case I forgot, superb film, superb performances, based on a brilliant stage play, Claude Rains riding shotgun, mesmerizing and unforgettable. There, I think I covered all the bases. Actually deserves a 20 and I mean to talk to the IMDb about making a special rating system for this film. They listen to me, they really do...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Here Comes Mr. Jordan" made in 1941 and remade two more times, both with Warren Beatty in 1978 with "Heaven Can Wait" and the Chris Rock "Down to Earth" in 2005. This one is the best, although Warren Beatty's version is respectable. Robert Montgomery shines as Joe Pendleton, a tough-talking boxer who dies while piloting his own plane. But his death has been a "mistake" or so says "Mr. Jordan" (Claude Rains) who seems to rule over heaven and decide whose time it is or isn't. Well, Joe gets sent back to earth, with the able assistance of his heavenly/ghostly friend, but his old body is -- well, gone. It all gets quite complicated and hilarious, with Joe inhabiting the body of a rich man, and then a fighter. He falls big time for the lovely Evelyn Keyes (who could blame him). All Joe wants is a chance to compete in the big boxing match that was denied him with his death. This is, hands down, Robert Montgomery's best performance (although his performance in "Night Must Fall" in 1937 comes pretty close). He is spot-on as the tough boxer with a soft side, and his expressions and gestures are perfect, as is his New York accent. Montgomery had already been in Hollywood a long time by 1941, starting in the last days of silent films and transitioning to sound. Claude Rains is wonderful as Mr. Jordan, James Gleason plays his role to the hilt, as Joe's befuddled boxing manager. But these are supporting players, and this is Robert Montgomery's movie all the way -- and he does not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is often the supporting actors who make a film great, and such is the case for "Jordan". In particular, James Gleason turns in a fine performance. This is not to say that Robert Montgomery does not - his is a competent (and often mordant) portrayal of the dead pugilist. I first saw this film on the island of Corsica, sitting in an open field on a bomb crate. It was well received by us fliers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this film for the last forty or so years.If it's on or I know it's going to be on,I'll make time to watch. One of the few movies where you will be sucked in from the very opening shots.It's a shame James Gleason didn't win as Best Supporting Actor. He played the mostly compassionate, caring and befuddled Max Corkle to perfection, and the last looks on his face when he realizes that "Joe" doesn't remember is classic. Donald MacBride should have some kind of mention as the detective searching for a body ("Where's the body?") or playing the suspicious hotel manager in Cary Grant-Irene Dunne's masterpiece His Favorite Wife.The man had facial expressions unequaled in today's Hollywood. Gleason was under-appreciated as an actor. Catch him as taxi driver in The Bishop's Wife. As far as a film full of treasures, this is the one to hold on to and treasure. Every single performance is a joy and done to perfection and not the least of which is Robert Montgomery's quick change between characters. Not only do I suggest watching but buying and sharing it with another generation of movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Extremely slight film-version of Harry Segall's play "Heaven Can Wait" stars Robert Montgomery as a boxer who receives an unexpected transfer of his soul by a novice angel who thought the boxer was to die in a plane accident. Exposition-heavy fantasy keeps stressing the same trivial points over and over, and Montgomery is rather tepid in the lead (the whole film depends upon his performance, but Montgomery hasn't that much charisma as an actor to carry the weight). Some sweet scenes, but the rest is innocuous. Remade by Warren Beatty (as "Heaven Can Wait") in 1978; there's something about this material that none of the writers were able to solve: the circumstances of the plot work against our sympathies for several supporting characters, who are ultimately left out of the happy ending. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here Comes Mr. Jordan is a nearly faultless example of Hollywood fantasy. The incredible plot works because the film is so wonderfully written and directed with standout performances from just about every cast member. In particular, Claude Rains delivers one of the most outstanding turns of his legendary career as the title character, conveying just the right combination of sympathy and authority as the angel who has to figure out a way to make things right. Robert Montgomery's performance is likewise excellent as our protagonist, and it's great to see Montgomery's character develop as he struggles to find his niche in his new life (afterlife?). The rest of the cast is outstanding as well, and the story moves along from one memorable moment to the next with an irresistible charm. As a comedy, the film delivers a host of hilarious moments but never descends to slapstick, relying instead on clever dialog and character interplay. Throw in some romance, a would-be murder, and a nice message about how things will somehow be made to work out for the best even when we as humans can't see a way, and you have a knockout movie that will continue to delight movie fans for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here comes Mr. Jordan (1941) - A Soul that Shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this film for the first time, I liked it a lot. But I only considered the film as an enjoyable comedy. When I watched the second time, I realized so many interesting things we don't notice throughout the movie. When we look into Sidney Buchman and Seton Miller's wonderful screenplay, then we see that there are several interesting dialogue and ideas in the film.Here is an example of an interesting dialogue. Mr. Jordan says to Joe "Finance is merely a matter of heart being in the right place." Mr. Jordan also says to Joe "But eventually, she will see the soul of Joe Pendleton, because that is never lost. That will always shine through Joe. No matter what overcoat you put on." I think this dialogue covers the main message of the movie. Many people becomes sad about the ending, because they think Joe no longer exists.I think this is because they are confused about the message of the film. When I watched the film for the first time, I got a little confused too. But after the second viewing, I understood the film much more. Although Mr. Jordan gave the body of Murdock and his memory, still the soul belongs to Joe. Only Joe exists. Murdock is dead. The body of Murdock and Murdock's memory is nothing but an overcoat for the soul of Joe to live for the rest of his life. In the end, we see that the soul of Joe Pendleton shining through the overcoat of Murdock. That's one of the reasons why Betty was attracted to him in the end. And this is also one of the reasons why Max Corkle becomes his coach in the end. Through the saxophone, we realize that it is Joe's soul inside Murdock's body. In the end, we see nothing but the beauty of the message left for us.We also have to appreciate what Screenwriter Sidney Buchman did to this project. Harry Cohn wanted to make this film as a low budget. But Sidney Buchman pushed Harry Cohn to give a high budget for this film. And Buchman also insisted Harry Cohn to get Robert Montgomery for the leading role. Just like Joe Pendleton's Soul, Sidney Buchman's love and true dedication makes this film shine. And I thought Alexander Hall's direction was great. His direction especially at the ending scenes and Frederick Hollander's score makes this film even more special. I thought everyone did a great job playing their roles. I rate this film 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Ain't Got No Body</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's in a name? Well you might ask: In 1941 a minor play by Harry Seagall entitled Heaven Can Wait was adapted for the screen as Here Comes Mr. Jordan. Two years later, 1943, Ernst Lubitsch adapted a play entitled Birthday, by Hungarian playwright Leslie-Bush Fekete for the screen and called it Heaven Can Wait. Confused? You ain't heard nothing yet; 30 years later Warren Beatty remade Here Comes Mr. Jordan under its original title, Heaven Can Wait. Both plays/screenplays had one common element in that both protagonists - Robert Montgomery's Joe Pendleton in the former and Don Ameche's Henry Van Cleave in the latter - died in the opening reels of their respective films but their the resemblance ends. Ameche died of natural causes after a long and full life whilst Montgomery didn't technically die at all. In the prime of his life, whilst alone in and piloting his own private plane it went into a spin and seemed certain to crash; New-Boy-In-Heaven Edward Everett Horton assumed the worst and plucked Joe from the plane. Alas, Joe wasn't due to die for another fifty years and is rightly miffed to find himself in limbo. He demands to see Horton's supervisor, Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains) who soon ascertains that not only is Joe not supposed to die he is also destined to become world heavyweight boxing champion. In theory there's nothing to it; return Joe to earth and let him get on with his life. There's the rub; his manager, Max Corklle (James Gleason) has already had Joe cremated ergo there is no 'body' for him to inhabit. This, of course, is where purists/pedants will come into their own; presumably there would be only a split second between Joe dying in the crash (which, of course, he survived) and his 'soul' being shipped to Heaven, hardly time for Corkle to 1) locate the crashed plane and 2) complete the necessary paperwork for the cremation which would take at least two or three days and 2) if Mr. Jordan has the power to return Joe to earth then surely it is not beyond him to reverse Time the necessary few seconds. Cavilling of this nature apart, the film delivers solid entertainment as Joe - who has the power to choose - selects first the body of millionaire Richard Farnsworth, just as he has been drowned in his bath by his wife and his secretary, and then the boxer he had, as Joe Pendleton, been scheduled to fight, and who is subsequently killed in the ring. If you're not too fussy about plot lines and relish the likes of Claude Rains walking away with the picture you'll enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delightful Hollywood "afterlife" fantasy film, when there was a real vogue for this mini-genre ("Topper", "Ghost &amp; Mrs Muir", "Heaven can Wait"), which peaked later in the 40's with classics such as "It's a Wonderful Life" and "A Matter of Life and Death". Well, to me, you'd have be close to dead not to derive enjoyment from such pleasant froth as this, with Claude Rains (and an almost bouffant hair-do!) in a beautifully pitched performance as the unflappable, all-knowing paternal guardian angel role this time, alongside Robert Montgomery as the likable fighter who gets a second and third chance to get back the life mistakenly denied to him by over-zealous new heavenly recruitment officer Edward Everett Horton. The plot is slight, fantastic and never remotely believable so don't try to solve the various inconsistencies but it hangs together enough until the obligatory happy ending when Evelyn Keyes, in a pleasant ingénue part, sees the real Montgomery in his last incarnation and of course finds true love with him. The minor characters are overplayed in my view, principally James Gleason as Montgomery's fight manager and Donald MacBride as the investigating cop, especially in the denouement in the drawing room which gets just too farcical, while the duo who murder Farnsworth, his scheming wife and her male accomplice, could have done with a bit more cynicism and meanness in their playing. There's not much to report either in the way of special effects, merely Rains and company ghosting through a few walls although the depiction of heaven above billowing clouds all the way to the horizon does linger in the memory. Nice film, though, nice to watch over the Christmas season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "Here Comes Mr. Jordan," I had that experience that happens every so often when you're simply not responding to something the way seemingly every other person on earth has responded to the same thing.I've only heard about what a classic film this is, up there with some of the best, so was disappointed to find that I was restless and somewhat bored with it. The assembly-line approach taken to filmmaking during the studio era could result in masterpieces, but it more often resulted in producing films like this -- a bit flat and uninspired, never offensively bad but rarely breathtakingly good. Robert Montgomery, James Gleason and Claude Rains hit their marks and are easy enough to watch, but little about this film made me laugh or otherwise feel much of anything at all.Grade: B</fullReview>

This film isn't about heaven yet unconfirmed delusion. Heaven is important to me though and it probably is to the average over-American.

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the greatest film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very fortunate to have viewed this multiple-Oscar nominated and winning film from 1941 prior to seeing its retelling in the form of "Heaven Can Wait" (1978). The latter film, which is not that bad, gets trashed a lot for not being the former film, but the script is so good that modern retellings are as inevitable as their never measuring up to this classic among classics.The plot: boxer Joe Pendelton's (Robert Montgomery) plane is spiraling to the ground and certain death for the heavyweight challenger for the title belt. The messenger who collects souls for the afterlife (Edward Everett Horton) decides to spare Joe the pain of death, and yanks him out of the plane without "waiting for the outcome." As it turned out, Joe was not destined to die in the crash, but would have saved the plane at the last moment. The problem is, his body has already been cremated by order of his manager, Max Corkle (James Gleason). What to do? Call Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains) and get the title for the movie at the same time. Mr. Jordan offers Joe a new body, and they return to earth, where Joe continues the life of evil millionaire Bruce Farnsworth, murdered by his scheming wife (Rita Johnson) and personal secretary (John Emery).Farnsworth uses his wealth to buy his way into a title fight, while his murder is replotted. He falls in love with Bette Logan (Evelyn Keys), the daughter of a man in prison for a crime for which he was framed by Farnsworth. The "new" Farnsworth frees Mr. Logan, returns the money he swindled to investors, and causes the price of his company's stock to plunge.Once Corkle is convinced that Farnsworth is Pendleton, he gets in Joe's "corner," but the two of them have to fight battles in two worlds, in a way that conforms with the higher destiny that fates their lives.Younger folks might not appreciate the lack of explosions, special effects, four-letter words (there is, however, a brief mafia subplot that was slightly daring for its day), gratuitous sex, or the dialogue-driven films of the era that did not insult the audience's intelligence, but instead played off of it. This is one of the smartest, well-produced, well-acted, and well-written films you will ever see, and if there were a "super Oscar" ceremony pitting all films of all years against each other, it would likely claim at least one statute. The movie is THAT GOOD. No, it's great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having Claude Rains in any film is a good enough recommendation for me to watch a picture. The title here might be considered an odd one because the Mr. Jordan of the title, portrayed by Rains, is not the principal character. But it's probably fair to say he commands the viewer's attention in any scene he's in, including those with the star of the picture, Robert Montgomery, who's put through his paces as three different people before it's all over.To maintain continuity, Montgomery's original appearance as boxer Joe Pendleton is maintained throughout the story as he assumes different bodies after 'dying' at the very outset. Well actually, he didn't really die in the plane crash; an overzealous angel on his first mission snatched Joe's spirit before the plane hit the ground. It kind of bothered me that Messenger 7013 (Edward Everett Horton) didn't have to serve some sort of penalty for his rather cosmic mistake. Mr. Jordan hit him with a verbal slap on the wrist as it were, but 7013 kept showing up time and again without too much in the way of contrition for his major blunder.However the prospective romance at the heart of the picture between Pendleton and Bette Logan (Evelyn Keyes) is played out rather creatively. In the guise of wealthy businessman Bruce Farnsworth, Montgomery sets things right regarding the five million dollar securities swindle her father was blamed for. Personally I would like to have seen him take a more aggressive response to his scheming wife and business manager after they found out their victim was still breathing. For a split second I lost concentration when Pendleton/ Farnsworth summoned the man with 'Hey Abbott', I thought Costello might show up too.As for the resolution to the story, I don't think I'm alone in feeling that good old boy Joe might have been dealt an unfortunate hand after all with the memory of his former life being erased. Earlier, Mr. Jordan remarked that "In the final reckoning everything will be accounted for". Sadly for Joe Pendleton, he didn't really get another fifty years on his own terms, making me wonder if Mr. Jordan might have considered some other heavenly option.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boxer Robert Montgomery (Joe) is on his way to a fight when his plane crashes and he finds himself under the guidance of heavenly messenger Edward Everett Horton roaming the celestial skies. However, Horton has plucked Montgomery from the plane before the plane actually crashed so Montgomery is still technically alive and must return to Earth. Meanwhile, back on Earth, his body has been cremated after the accident and it falls to Horton's boss Claude Rains (Mr Jordan) to find another body for Montgomery to reside in. Montgomery takes on the persona of a couple of people and is involved in their adventures as he finds his destiny......and love..This film is a comedy fantasy that is both funny and fantastic in it's story that has several plot holes. It doesn't matter, though. The cast are OK and the situations that Montgomery finds himself in are most interesting. His first journey to find a body with Mr Jordan takes him to the residency of Mr Farnsworth who is being murdered in his bath. The revelation of what is happening is a memorable scene, of which there are many including a humorous section where Montgomery is trying to convince his old boxing manager James Gleason (Max Corkle) that he is the dead Joe while in the guise of Mr Farnsworth.The film is played for comedy but it is overdone by Donald MacBride who plays the inspector and James Gleason just makes it on the right side of annoying despite being involved in some genuinely funny scenes. Montgomery starts off as quite a dis-likable character. He's full of himself and needs to show a bit of humbleness when addressing celestial beings. Mr Jordan should have given him a woman's body - I would have.It's a funny film that delivered something better than I had anticipated. Montgomery morphs into Marlon Brando at the end of the film - it's quite odd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Here Comes Mr. Jordan" is a near-perfect romantic-fantasy-comedy about boxer Joe Pendleton (Robert Montgomery) taken to heaven by mistake fifty years before his time and must return to earth in a different body to continue his boxing pursuits. When he returns in the body of a rich man, he falls in love with a troubled woman and desires to help her. The film was remade later as "Heaven Can Wait," which was definitely enjoyable but lacked the same emotion and brilliance of this film. Honestly, I was nearly in tears during parts of this film, because I found some beautiful pictures of my own Christian faith in the story, particularly Mr. Jordan's (Claude Rains) statement that all good things had been ordained for Joe, that no matter what, everything would turn out as had been perfectly planned for him (God is not mentioned, but I couldn't help seeing His hand in this story). The romance was much better in this film than the remake, and I actually cared whether or not the main characters ended up together. It's also entertaining and very funny, and I laughed more here than I did at the other film. Already on my list of favorite films, I cannot recommend this enough for it's humorous, romantic, and inspirational value. Great film! **** out of ****</fullReview>

This is a fairly amusing comedy, although it's not as funny as it could have been. The plot is of course pretty silly but the cast seems to be having a good time. As in "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith" from the same year, Montgomery shows a flair for low-key comedy as the unfortunate boxer. Rains brings a light touch to the role of the Big Kahuna in heaven (God?), a man named Mr. Jordan. Horton and Gleason provide most of the laughs. This was remade as "Heaven Can Wait" in 1978, not to be confused with the great Ernst Lubitsch comedy with that title made in 1943.</fullReview>

It's about Joe Pendleton, a clean cut boxer who dies prematurely, and is accidentally cremated, before the mistake can be corrected. Sound familiar? It should. It's the same plot as its 1978 remake Heaven Can Wait which I reviewed here earlier. Joe's flying to next fight when he dies in a plane crash. Mr. Jordan, the head messenger, informs Joe that he shouldn't be there at least not for the next fifty years. He tells him that he can borrow the body of a millionaire named John Farnsworth, who'd been recently killed by his wife and her lover, now Joe must take over Farnsworth's life, and make everything right. Does he do it? If I told you, I'd have to kill you. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another of those stories Hollywood has always loved to do: fun, "Heavan Can Wait"-type of films where people come back from the dead and are in other bodies or are friendly ghosts like "Topper" (or unfriendly). It almost helps to promote their reincarnation beliefs and other occult "theologies" that so many pagans love to promote.Unlike a number of the others, this film is non-offensive. There are no anti-Christian sentiments, although real Biblical theology is never told in here. Also in Hollywood, all people go to heaven. Anyway, everyone is fun to watch in here, particularly Claude Rains in the starring role. Also featured are two underrated actors of the day: Rita Johnson and James Gleason. The latter stole the film with his humor, as far as I was concerned. Bob Montgomery does a nice job at playing the dumb boxer.It's a charming story and good lightweight entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same story as "Heaven Can Wait", but this one with a boxer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the movies which includes "Heaven Can Wait." An athlete is taken to Heaven by an over ambitious trainee, only to find out it wasn't his time to die. He has 50 more years! When they go back to Earth, to insert him back into his body, they find it has been cremated. So, the search begins for a suitable body, a person due to die any hour.Robert Montgomery is Joe Pendleton, a very decent guy who happens also to be a contender for the boxing World Championship. He is offered the body of wealthy Mr Farnsworth, then being drowned by his unfaithful wife and her lover. He doesn't want any part of that until he meets pretty and kind Bette Logan (Evelyn Keyes of Port Arthur) whose dad was in financial trouble because of Farnsworth. His having a chance to help Bette, and perhaps court her, changes his mind.The title character Mr. Jordan is expertly played by the great Claude Rains, who is the facilitator in Heaven and who finds suitable bodies for mistakes like Pendleton's.SPOILERS. The ending has the same characteristics as the others. Pendleton eventually ends up having the body of another boxer who was shot while in the ring, and his memory of everything preceding it taken away. So he meets Bette and because of who they are, begin again together.(Viewed 12/26/2006 on TCM network.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant fantasy enhanced by Montgomery, Raines and Horton...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A romantic comedy/fantasy is one of the hardest things for any writer/director/producer to pull off with any degree of success, but somehow HERE COMES MR. JORDAN fell into the right hands and it is a remarkably good example of that genre.ROBERT MONTGOMERY, an actor I was never particularly fond of, is at his best here as the rather dim-witted fighter who finds himself in the clouds talking to heavenly messengers when he's plucked from certain death in an airplane crash. It turns out he shouldn't have been taken to the other side by EDWARD EVERETT HORTON, who was new on the job and is chided by CLAUDE RAINS for being overeager to rescue Montgomery from the jaws of death. Rains decides the remedy is to find another human body for Montgomery to reside in--someone else who is on the point of death.Sounds a bit like heavy-handed stuff for a comedy, but it works, thanks to a sparkling script that gives fun roles to Montgomery, Horton, Raines and, in particular, two other supporting characters--JAMES GLEASON as Montgomery's bewildered manager and DONALD MacBRIDE as an equally befuddled inspector confused by all the double talk from Gleason about the switching of bodies.EVELYN KEYES, as a woman infatuated with Montgomery, is excellent, and RITA JOHNSON and JOHN EMERY do well in other supporting roles.Delightful fantasy, not to be missed--but only if you can accept the highly improbable premise which some might find offensive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-Of-A-Kind Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, intellectuals and pseudo-intellectuals alike: this review will not include terms like 'auteur', 'mise en scene' or 'decontextualized'. And thank goodness: HERE COMES MR JORDAN's tale of a goodnatured boxer killed 'before his time' and hastily compensated with another body by heavenly emissaries, is too airy a souffle to hold up under such heavy analysis. It's pure moonshine, a near-perfect example of the kind of breezy, warm-hearted entertainment that the Hollywood studio system (here at its apex) produced on its best days. There isn't a facet of JORDAN that's not wholly artificial; plot, characters, sets - all of them are imported direct from Never-Neverland. Call it DEATH MAKES A LEFT TURN ON A RED LIGHT - but see it. Star Robert Montgomery continues to be unfairly forgotten, at ease before a camera regardless of genre, and he does fine work here in a role that's trickier than it seems; he's ably abetted by the always-watchable pair of Claude Rains and James Gleason. The mix of fantasy, comedy and sentiment could never gel this beautifully had a more harshly realistic tone been adopted. (For proof, see the leadfooted Beatty remake - its aloof, smirky hipness is far more archaic now than the eerie timelessness of JORDAN's unashamed tall corn, still standing 60 years on.) Not that HEAVEN CAN WAIT is the only remake, unofficial or otherwise; JORDAN's premise has been worked harder than a pack mule by now, but every new variation is a progressive diminution from the original. But that's what happens when you try to bottle moonshine twice by design, instead of catching it by chance the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS is the SUPERIOR VERSION....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie. Much superior to the re-make "Heaven Can Wait" with Warren Beatty. A real charmer. Robert Montgomery plays it perfectly. It "works" with a boxer, it doesn't with a Superbowl quarterback. There is chemistry all around in this film. There is very little chemistry in the "loaded" cast of the re-make...See my comments on "Heaven Can Wait" for more detail......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supernatural Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyed this film from beginning to the very end because of the great story dealing with the Spiritual World and the great classic veteran actors like Claude Rains,(Mr. Jordon),"The Invisible Man" and Robert Montogomery, (Joe Pendleton),"The Big House". Evelyn Keys, (Betty Logan) "Gone with the Wind" and Edward Everett Horton,(Messenger 7013), "Pocket Full of Miracles" Joe Pendleton is a prize fighter who is traveling in a plane with his favorite good luck charm which is a soprano saxophone. He meets up with Messenger 7013 on a cloud and is introduced to Mr. Jordon who is the head boss who is in charge of all people leaving their earthly bodies and then destines these souls to other destinations. If you like the supernatural, this is the film for you, with plenty of ghosts walking through walls and many other unbelievable things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute mix of fantasy and mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of you are probably familiar with the story because you've seen the Warren Beaty movie, HEAVEN CAN WAIT--which is a remake of HERE COMES MR. JORDAN. While the stories are very similar, I give the edge to the original though they are both very watchable and fun films.Boxer Joe Pendleton is on an airplane that seems about to crash. So, an angel played by Edward Everett Horton snatches him up just before the inevitable and brings him to the great beyond. However, once there, the boss, Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains), informs them that Pendleton would have survived the crash and was brought to his eternal reward too soon. But, since the body was destroyed due to Horton's incompetence, they have a problem! Well, the only way around it is to stick Pendleton in the body of a person who really does die--sort of an even exchange. But, they don't want a body that's in bad shape, so they pick a guy that was poisoned. The guy whose life and body he takes is a rich guy whose scheming wife had JUST murdered him! To find out how it all works out, give the film a chance.The script is extremely cleaver and the acting exceptional as well. This is a delightful fantasy--the type they just don't write any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Color me "aghast"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive me, but for the first few minutes (I came in on the murder scene and investigation)I gaped aghast. Montgomery came across with bug-eyed incredulity but you have to love that dark double-breasted suit. Evelyn Keyes was no less goo-goo but had that knock out suit with the semi-circular curves on lapel and shoulders. Years later, she would smolder me in a number of films. I guess in 1941 a heavenly "collector" was in uniform looking much like a commercial airline's pilot get up - regional carrier. James Gleason hammed it up; he's much better in lesser roles, e.g., the cab-driver, Sylvester, in THE BISHOP'S WIFE and numerous others. Another hammer was Donald MacBride as the Inspector. I fully expected him to pull his fedora down around his ears. Still, in the end it was fairly amusing in spots.</fullReview>
