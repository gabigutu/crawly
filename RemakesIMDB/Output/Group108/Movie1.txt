		<fullReview>Chris Rock stars in this remake of Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait (itself a remake of the 1941 film Here Comes Mr. Jordan), a comedy about a man who dies before his time, before he can realize his dreams, and his adventures in his new (albeit temporary) body. In the Beatty version, the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then-Los Angeles Rams. In Rock's hipper version, our lead character is a struggling young - and decidedly low-talent - standup comedian.It's very funny to see the razor-sharp Rock playing a bad comedian. It's kind of like seeing Tom Hanks play a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a non-amateur night. But every time he tries out his material, he's booed off the stage lustily - so much so that his nickname becomes "Booie." His jokes are lame, his delivery painful. In short, Lance is everything that the real Chris Rock isn't.Lance is also a bike messenger, and he's riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when BAM! He's hit by a truck. Ok, so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he was going to get hit anyway. No dice, it appears Lance isn't due in Heaven until 2044. So what to do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), the "manager" of Heaven, reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not-quite-dead Mr. Barton. Trouble is, the body they find is of a greedy, old white man. Turns out this fella (a Mr. Wellington) owns all kinds of things - he's the 15th richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance will turn things around. But of course, while in the body of the affluent Mr. Wellington, Lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker (Regina King). We males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body, but try winning one over while you're an dumpy, old white guy! And it's even worse when she's not impressed by your money. This is Rock's first shot at a lead role, and in my opinion he performs admirably. There's still a lot of the standup comedian in him - and, of course, if he ever wants to get diverse roles, he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script - but this isn't really a bad thing. Rock's personality - his drive, his delivery, his demeanor, and his passion - are what fuel this film. He's clearly having a lot of fun in the role, and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chris Rock needs to stick to stand up comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were some funny moments in this movie, but overall I was unimpressed. I recognize that this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but it really fell short of being funny. Why did they have to bring Rock back as an old white man. The old white man really had nothing to do with the movie. Rock didn't act like an old white man. He didn't look like the old white man (at least not to the audience). He didn't even seem like he was an old white man. Yet no one really cared.Now, I know that this is supposed to be funny, but all I really felt was embarrassed.Chris, until you can become a real actor, go back to stand up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see that one. This one is not so great. The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today. However, I don't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like some really bad "B" movie where people sound like they are in some bad TV sit-com. The situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie. It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad. I don't know how they could release this movie like that. Anyway, the last part isn't to bad, so wait for the video and see it then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not his best film, but it isn't as bad as you'd think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Rock is funny in this film, even if most of the rest of what he's surrounded isn't. Rock has been able to elivate films with his outstanding supporting roles including them in New Jack City, Dogma and Nurse Betty (Betty and Dogma actually getting such a boost by him they got in my top ten lists), but here, he is brought on the second time in a starring role. While he is slightly funnier here than in CB4, he isn't as good as he could've been. What Rock stars in is a remake of a remake that is probably from a play and that might also be a flaw. Rock and his staff of writers (ie Chris Rock show) do what they can with they're script about a flawful comedian named Lance who gets sent up to heaven to early and is sent back in a body for a short while, except the body is white. While many of the scenes with Rock as Lance inside the old white guy aren't laugh out loud funny, they are interesting for me being a Chris Rock fan (seeing a man like the one Chris gets himself into telling his famous Black Mall skit had me thinking while laughing). Not always on the money, to say the least, but it isn't a waste of total time. B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A black variation of "Heaven Can Wait"? Why not "Casablanca" or "The Maltese Falcon"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Rock, apparently desperate for a cozy star-vehicle which would cross his appeal over to white and mainstream black audiences, updates the hit 1978 comedy "Heaven Can Wait" with an urban agenda. He plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident who has his soul removed too soon from his body--consequently, his angels must find another body to place him in, and can only come up with that of a white businessman. Rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" only shows that Rock's eye was on the box-office (this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of Hollywood players). Why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an Evening at the Apollo? Terrific supporting cast (including the usually-reliable Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and terrific Frankie Faison) do what they can, but Rock seems awkward and unsure of himself throughout. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We rented it and I wasn't expecting much in the first place. . It just looked like it would be another one of the endless comedies that come out every year. This one should not have been on the big screen, nor should it have gone straight to video. It was horrible!! I like Chris Rock, his stand up is hilarious, and I loved him as Nat X on Saturday Night Live, and he was good in New Jack City. But if he's going to be an actor, then do some acting. .not that it was bad, but the material was terrible.The story was as predictable as can be. . The worst parts were when they tried to get the audience emotionally involved, they tried to get us to care about these characters. WTF? We don't want "Steel Magnolias" or "Beaches", we want Chris Rock to be funny! He wasn't. . it was LAME. Common sense would dictate that we, the audience, should see rock as the white man, and hear him as the white man, doing the stand up. THAT would have been funny. Anyway, this was pretty damn bad. 5/10 at best.. NOT funny, just a waste of time, but thank god it was pretty short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Down to Earth is a sporadically funny movie starring Chris Rock. I thought the idea was creative (even though it is basically a remake of Heaven Can Wait). Rock is hilarious at times and so are some of the others. However, something is missing and I'm not sure what it is. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film and happen to be a big Chris Rock fan. It just needed a little more. You can probably wait until video to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Rock even understand his own premise for the film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How is this so highly rated? I love Chris Rock and that's why I went to see it but I was so disappointed, if it hadn't had been raining I would have walked out.Chris Rock doesn't seem to understand what the film is about. He is supposed to be playing a unfunny Black comedian reincarnated back into a white businessman who has just been bumped off by his wife and assistant. Even in a comedy you have to bring some sense of reality to make the humor work. His character doesn't change; he continues to act like a black guy, and not just any one but himself, Lance. Of course that's what you'd do?your given a second chance, for no good reason other than heaven making an administrative error, and you use that most precious gift to continue acting in the same dumb way you did before. Why does heaven give him a second chance other than the weak plot demands it? Lance doesn't do anything special to deserve it in his previous life; he just seems to take it for granted he is entitled to it. He never listens to anyone else or any advice, he just talks over everyone in his own self centered pursuit of a woman he glimpsed ten minutes ago.The point of view was all wrong, if it was supposed to be funny seeing a middle-aged white guy talking like a bad black comedian then that's what we should have seen on screen, not Rock except in very brief flashes. The reincarnated Lance shows no sense of having gone through the biggest change anyone can make other than changing sex. There is no awareness of his situation at all. We are supposed to despise the ruthless business man but Rock is an equally irritating replacement character with a different but just as selfish moronic single mindedness in getting the girl. The idea of a young attractive black girl being genuinely in love with a paunchy, balding and pretty ancient old man and kissing him passionately on screen would have just been stomach turning and I am at least glad Rock wouldn't let the cameras stray off him for that.Rock just didn't do anything to make it work. He created an unsympathetic selfish character who acted oblivious to his own situation and the reactions of everyone around him. But worse, he just wasn't funny, which let's face it most of us had gone to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot dies with Lance Barton.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a re-write of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, "Heaven Can Wait", but it is written for the stand-up comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with God's representative, Mr King, to come back to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he fancies Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to turn up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee simply does not work. Also the intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington, fail miserably. Improvements could have been made to the original Beatty plot - which in itself did not masterfully portray the life-after-death idea - but they certainly were not to be found in "Down To Earth".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chris Rock deserves better than he gives himself in "Down To Earth"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Rock deserves better than he gives himself in "Down To Earth." As directed by brothers Chris &amp; Paul Weitz of "American Pie" fame, this uninspired remake of Warren Beatty's 1978 fantasy "Heaven Can Wait," itself a rehash of 1941's "Here Comes Mr. Jordan," lacks the abrasively profane humor that won Chris Rock an Emmy for his first HBO special. Predictably, he spouts swear words from A to Z, but he consciously avoids the F-word. Anybody who saw this gifted African-American comic in "Lethal Weapon 4," "Dogma," or "Nurse Betty" knows he can elicit more laughter with the F-word than Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy put together. Sadly, despite a few witty one-liners, "Down To Earth" hits Rock bottom both as a contrived comedy and an improbable interracial romance."Down to Earth" utterly destroys any good will that the Weitz Brothers generated with their landmark gross-out face "American Pie." This disposable drivel qualifies as a contrived as well as confusing comedy with a thoroughly improbable color-blind interracial romance. Unfortunately, a more than competent cast?among them "The Full Monty's" Mark Addy, Chazz Palminteri of "Analyze This," "SCTV's" Eugene Levy, and newcomer Brian Rhodes as Charles Wellington, Jr.?are wasted in flat-footed, sketchy roles. Hardcore Rock fans will undoubtedly accuse their favorite comedian with trying to fix something that was never broken. Abysmally written by Lance Crouther, Ali Le Roi, Louis CK, and Rock, "Down To Earth" casts Chris as a messenger who rides a bike by day in the Big Apple and gets booed off the stage at night in Harlem's celebrated Apollo Theatre. Poor Lance Barton (Chris Rock) suffers from severe stage fright. Nevertheless, his charitable manager Whitney Daniels (Frankie Faison of "Hannibal") sticks with him through thick and thin. After Lance learns the Apollo Theatre will hold one final amateur night extravaganza, he implores Whitney to get him in the line-up. Excuse me, but if Lance is such a deadbeat stand-up comic, why does the Apollo keep inviting him back? Meanwhile, fate has something else in store for Lance. While pedaling home on his bike, our protagonist spots a pretty lady, Sontee (Regina King of "Jerry Maguire"), crossing the street, but he doesn't see the bus that collides with him and kills him. Wham! Lance Barton levitates skyward with a halo wreathed around his head. In Heaven, which resembles a cruise ship nightclub, Lance learns that an overzealous angel, Mr. Keyes (Eugene Levy of "Stay Tuned"), timed his death 40 years ahead of schedule.Heavenly honcho Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri of "Analyze This"), God's right-hand guy, apologizes and escorts Lance back to earth. The snag is Lance cannot reclaim his corpse, so he must inhabit another body. The best that Mr. Keyes can come up with is ruthless, white, 60-year old tycoon Charles Wellington. Wellington's adulterous wife Amber (Jennifer Coolidge of "American Pie") and his unscrupulous personal aide Winston (Greg Germann of "Sweet November") have just tried to poison him. Reluctantly, before Wellington's body vanishes, Lance accepts it conditionally as a loaner until Keyes can locate a more appropriate body. Meanwhile, Lance-as-Wellington encounters Sontee again. She is a nurse activist protesting his decision to privatize a Brooklyn community hospital that serves the poor. While Regina King brings a surfeit of charisma to her role as a crusading health care worker, she plays a character who bypasses credible motivation in her affairs with Wellington. Although he is no longer black, Lance not only tries to woo Sontee but also win a gig at the Apollo."Down To Earth" features Rock in his most unfunny role. The comedian's reason for making this movie seems questionable. Reportedly, he ate lunch with Warren Beatty and told Beatty that he loved the original script that scenarist Elaine May had penned for Beatty. Initially, Beatty tried the race-reversal gimmick himself in his own version by trying to cast Muhammad Ali in the title role of "Heaven Can Wait." The deal fell through, and Beatty headlined the movie himself. According to Rock, his longtime co-writers and he thought that they could 'annihilate' this classic. Moreover, he justified his choice of "Heaven Can Wait" based on his philosophy to "Do Something you can only do when you're hot." Earlier, Rock rejected a script about a busload of touring rappers, because he saw little opportunity to stretch his image in such an outing. As a lifeless comedian in "Down to Earth," Rock doesn't so much stretch his image as he inverts it for the worst! This half-baked concert film with an annoying plot does as much to cremate his comic reputation as it does the Weitz Brothers! You know a film about a comedian is in dire straits when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes, only the laughter. Similarly, the casting of Mark Addy as Wellington's butler who speaks the Queen's English but is in reality a commoner from Michigan defies logic, too. Addy is an actual Englishman, and he doesn't have to fake an accent; his accent is genuine. The major overriding quandary with "Down to Earth" is the on-again-off-again, look-a-like switcheroo that the characters make so Chris Rock doesn't disappear completely from the sight for more than a few seconds. Although Chris spends half the movie as white guy Wellington, audiences see him largely as Lance, undercutting the comic irony of watching his stocky, bald-headed, Caucasian white, alter-ego perform ghetto humor and chant derogatory hip-hop lyrics. Incredibly, Rock served double-duty as the film's executive producer and one of its four scribes. The mystery is how such a wealth of talent could grind out such an awkward, misguided muddle of a comedy. About the only redeeming feature of "Down to Earth" is Jamshied Sharifi's superb orchestral film score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To enjoy any fantasy comedy, the viewer must be able to suspend disbelief. It is impossible to suspend disbelief for Down to Earth.Why do we see Chris Rock as Chris Rock, when everyone around him sees him as Charles Wellington, rich, fat white man? Why? Because the producers thought they could make more money showcasing Rock, than having us see Rock as Wellington. It ruins much of the movie's attempted humor. For example, when Rock (as Wellington) uses the "N" word, black folks who hear him become furious, and we have to remember that he is supposedly this rich, fat white man.The film does have some funny moments, and Regina King is attractive as the love interest. It could have been really good, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Down to Earth (2001): Dir: Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz / Cast: Chris Rock, Regina King, Chazz Palminteri, Eugene Levy, Mark Addy: Lifeless comedy about bringing down to reality one's standards of living. If one's standards of living regarded viewing this film then living standards went down. Remake of Heaven Can Wait, Chris Rock plays a struggling comedian who dreams of presenting an act at the Apollo nightclub. Upon being hit by a truck he is sent to Heaven but informed that he was taken ahead of his time. They send him back in the body of a white rich man who is not very well liked. He learns that there are plans to murder him. He also falls in love with Regina King who is struggling to keep a hospital opened. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz previously made the much funnier American Pie but this garbage is a major step down and adds none of intelligence of their sexual high school romp. Their handling of the black man white man image of the hero is poorly portrayed. We are given glimpses of the white guy but he is never well established as a character. Rock is reciting his comedy act right from the standard setup right up to his eventual relationship with King. Her function is to be the love interest and nothing more. Chazz Palminteri and Eugene Levy are wasted in flat roles. Heavenly aspects fail because God doesn't make mistakes. No, the mistakes are made by the filmmakers. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not funny, and really weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is really awful. I first saw it in a theater when it was originally released during the big Chris Rock craze that was going on at the time. I was a big fan of his comedy and liked him a lot.I was very disappointed by this movie and wanted to walk out several times. It's bad for many reasons but, the main one is that it's just not funny. This movie is supposed to be a comedy but, there are very few jokes, even in the scenes that contain stand-up. The makers of the movie also missed a lot of opportunities to add funny scenes. Throughout the majority of the film, Chris Rock's character is dead and his soul is inside the body of an older, white guy. Throughout these scenes, we see Chris Rock, and not the white guy which is fine but, we should see the white guy a lot more, especially since that's how everyone else sees him. We only see the way he looks physically a few times and only for a couple seconds each time. There is one scene where the main character is listening to a rap song and starts singing along to it. We see the white guy for a second and it's funny since you wouldn't expect to see someone like that singing along to rap, right? But, we see him so quickly that, the joke isn't even given a chance to exist. The makers of the movie seem way too concerned with having Chris Rock on screen as much as possible.Then there's the ending. I don't want to give away too many details for those who haven't watched the movie but, it's one of the weirdest and flat-out disturbing endings to a movie that I've ever seen. I think viewers are supposed to be satisfied with it but, I don't see how that's possible.I really don't understand how anyone can watch this movie and enjoy it. For anyone who is planning on watching it, please don't. Unless you're one of those people who enjoys watching bad movies in order to make fun of them. In which case, you'll definitely enjoy this one and you'll have plenty to make of fun of here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK and kind of fun in parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently rented this film and noted that some of the first few scenes seem to be taken right out of "Heaven Can Wait." And then I saw the documentary on the DVD and thought, "Oh. It is a remake of 'Heaven Can Wait'." I only wish Warren Beatty could've been in the documentary to make some comments on the remake.I'm not too sanguine about remakes. For myself a remake is done to improve upon something that was lacking in the previous version of the film. The only thing I see that's really improved upon in this movie is the film stock; a crisper and sharper picture than the original. Otherwise the calibur of the humor's about the same, though somewhat racier. And the acting is on par with the original film (though in the original I always had hard time swallowing Beatty playing a pro-football prospect). The racial element adds a bit of a unique twist, and offers some new laughs there. "Heaven Can Wait" was a good comedy, but it wasn't all that funny in the first place, and I think "Down to Earth" adds a touch more obvious humor that was lacking in the first. But it does that at the cost of the more subtle and contemplative humor that was in "Heaven Can Wait."There are a number of guinely funny moments in "Down to Earth." But, like other reviewers have noted, if you like Chris Rock, then odds are you'll like this movie. If you don't, then you should go see something else.My only real problem with the film is that even though it works, in my opinion, it misses an opportunity to really improve upon a fairly good comedy some twenty years prior. Then again, like I said, the first film wasn't all that funny in the first place.There're a couple of "reality checks" that go overlooked (SPOILER; note the relationship developing between the two leads, SPOILER END), and there's some lack of exposition on a couple of the subplots, which make the film seem mildly disjointed here and there.Unlike Roger Ebert I wouldn't give this movie a thumbs down, nor trash it with a smile like Leonard Maltin does with other films, because "Down to Earth" has it's funny moments. But if you're expecting a big gut busting, knee-slapping, hum-dinger, then you better go rent something else. This is just a run in the mill comedy. Nothing special, but worth seeing once.</fullReview>

But this film is pretty lame, the saddest part being the under-utilization of some really talented people like Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge, completely wasted here but SO funny in "Best of Show," which also starred Levy and is incredibly funny! But "Heaven Can Wait" was a lame remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan," the best version of the story, starring Claude Rains and Robert Montgomery. It runs on TCM from time to time and is worth seeing.</fullReview>

Personally theres nothing i could recommend to anyone in this movie..it really didnt make me laugh, it quite frankly bored me...the guy was very irritating and acting is certainly not his strongpoint as with the rest of the cast...to say this movie had a spark of originality is too leanient and its not often i dont watch a whole film but i didnt make it past the 1 hour mark. When i watch a comedy its for pure entertainment and something to raise my spirits, this certainly didnt do it for me...the plain and basic fact was it just wasnt funny!! a comedy failure 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie for the second time tonight and I liked it as much as I did the first time. Granted it's not high art or deep thinking but sometimes it's comforting to sit down in front of the TV and relax to a movie. I would recomend this to anyone who wanted a soft smile and a cute plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was mildly amusing. Nothing really that special. It almost reminded me of "Coming to America" (great film) in the fact that here's a guy who wants the girl who's trying to better the world (in this case save a hospital). The only difference is the later was funny, this is not. Even if you're a Chris Rock fan, I don't think anyone will enjoy this turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific and funny movie starring Chris Rock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DOWN TO EARTH, in my opinion, is a terrific and funny movie starring Chris Rock! It left a big smile on my face! The funniest things about this movie, in my opinion, were Lance's (Chris Rock - DOCTOR DOLITTLE, BOOMERANG) stand-up routines -- Especially the ones he did at the Apollo. If you ask me, that's the perfect place for a stand-up comic to do their routines. I thought that Sontee (Regina King - ENEMY OF THE STATE, A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE) looked absolutely beautiful in all of the dressy clothing she wore -- Especially the attire she wore whenever she and Lance went out on a date. When this movie is for sale on VHS, I'm going to buy it. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Chris Rock and you haven't seen this terrific and funny movie starring him, I recommend it! You're in for a real treat and lots of laughs, so, go out to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Personal comments.... on the horrible-ness of this film..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly and remarkably one of the worst movies ever made (at least after all the editing and watering down for the PG-13 rating). I am not a professional critic, nor trying to be one, but this film strikes me as grotesquely bad in every aspect. Just another one of those totally predictable love stories that, in my opinion, should have gone straight to TV. It is awfully awful, and believe me I tried to make some sense and give the movie and Chris Rock a chance, but.... too bad. Horrible movie. Thank God I didn't go watch it at the cinema.The thing is, I never really thought Chris Rock was that funny. Sure he does have some moments. I have seen some stuff he's done and I think he's funny sometimes. But this movie was so lame. I expected something that was going to make me laugh out loud. Not even the parts that were funny, mostly involving how stupid Chris Rock's WHITE character looked dancing and trying to be cool, gave me anything more than a smirk. And those parts were actually OK. But please save me from the PG-13 rated movies. I really had no idea it was PG-13. I have yet to see a PG-13 movie that can make me laugh out loud. And save us from more bull#%$^ love stories that touch no one's heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Down to Earth" was a disappointing one-liner vehicle for comedian Chris Rock. Chris Rock is funny...but not at his best in this film. The best parts come from one of his staff writers named Wanda Sykes. She steals every scene in which she's in. I really enjoyed her character...I don't think it was much different from her real personality considering that the name of her character is Wanda. Ha! Ha! The concept of this film came from the 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait" which was written by Warren Beatty and Elaine May (Primary Colors). It was a misused concept. To everyone else...Lance (Rock) appears to be an unattractive older white man but we don't get to see very much of what they see. We only see Chris Rock...which gave me the indication that this was a low-concept vehicle for him.I give "Down to Earth"**(C-).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>because that is the only way you won't think this film is a TOTAL waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait", (which was at least worth watching) is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy. It is more a vehicle to give Rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesn't play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man but are shown coming from Rock himself. As he insults Blacks and Whites the chemistry is all wrong. The movie is not funny, poorly shot the acting is weak at best. Go rent "Heaven Can Wait" and a live Rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ingredients are there, but the chef is gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This re-make of "Heaven Can Wait" with Warren Beaty has all the ingredients of being a great comedy in the classic style. The plot was a proven success in "Heaven Can Wait", and the adaption is pretty good itself. One of the best things about one of these comedies is that low brow humor and silly gags are kept to a bare minimum. The cast is pretty good all around, so why is this movie not the top comedy? I don't know. That's right, I'm not sure. All the ingredients are there, but it seems the chef is gone. What I can deduce as the problems are the directing and the final script. The directing wasn't very impressive and the look of the film had much to be desired. I also think the final script was watered down too much. If you really like Chris Rock, it's worth a look. If not, you'll probably want to skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Down To Earth" is out of this world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a combination of charm, wit, humor and romance; "Down To Earth" has ascended to be one of the funniest films I've seen in 2001. This marks the second Chris Rock movie I have seen and I must say I was impressed with his comedic and acting ability because he kept me laughing throughout the film. It is a true pleasure to take a break from the violent action films and watch a light-hearted comedy meant to entertain."Down To Earth" is a very exciting film to watch because Chris Rock's comedy is funny and unpredictable. One the coolest parts of this film was Rock's performance because he knew when to turn off the comedy in the more serious scenes. Furthermore, Rock seemed to fit the part perfectly because his performance looked to pulled off with little effort. This is Chris Rock's breakthrough performance because it proves he is an actor to be reckoned with and not just a one-hit wonder.The intelligence and creativity of the writing was excellent because it was unique and interesting to see how the script would play out on screen. I was also impressed with the element of the dream Rock's character had about performing at the Apollo. It is a true pleasure and welcomed change to see a legitimate underlying plot that made sense rather than one put in to add extra minutes to the movie.The supporting cast of King, Addy, Levy and Palminteri play a huge role in the success of "Down To Earth" because each bring their own exciting personas to the screen. All of these actors come from different genres of film, which makes for an interesting mix of characters.I was extremely impressed with the way each related to one another; furthermore, as with Rock, they seemed to be right at home in their roles because it was pulled off with ease. It is not often that we find a cast who come together from different genres to produce such an exciting and hilarious film."Down To Earth" is the best comedy of the year because it combines fresh and original jokes with touching and charming scenes lacking in the other 2001 comedies. Chris Rock is a tremendous comedic talent that knows how to use it to his advantage; furthermore, it is a true pleasure to watch him.Everything about "Down To Earth" made me smile because it is a truly touching film that isn't holding anything back. Chris Rock rules the screen with his comedy and the writing is out of this world. I wish I could have been part of this film.I can't wait to see Rock's next film because I know he will pull another great comedic performance out of his hat. His comedy, charm and wit made this film worthwhile and deserves all the praise it has received. I give "Down To Earth" a directed verdict of guilty of being the funniest film of the year.</fullReview>

There is a reason that Heaven Can Wait it always checked out in Video store new you...It's a Great Movie. Chris Rock is ok but watered down for the PG crowd.The unfaithful wife and plotting assistant are total mis-cast. Cannon and Grodin were much better. The first 15 minutes seem to have been edited and copied so many times that the film looks like a VHS copy. As a result it's jerky and painful. Is it just me or is the wife in that teal slit dress for at least the first 3 days?Some else posted that this is a family movie. Well just barely. I would recommend HCW way over this. The script is much better and there are some camera shots that are truly great. Not to skip Here Comes Mr. Jordan. This is also a personal favorite.Bottom line, skip this flick and wait for the video but only if you want to see Chris Rock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One gag movie with a lame ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gag movie, and the gag is that a hip, young black guy is in the body of an old, rich white guy. So the old white guy goes around acting hip and cool in public (dancing, rapping etc.) with "comedic" results. Unfortunately, people want to see Chris Rock, so 99% of the time we see him walking around doing these things, not the old man, so it isn't very funny. It would have worked out a whole lot better if they had the actual old, white guy doing the funny stuff (and it is funny when he does, although it is very brief). Chris Rock is a funny guy, and there are some laughs, but the entire gag idea this movie is based on is ruined by all of Rock's screen time, and the stupid ending which makes no sense.*spoiler alert*As you know (assuming you have seen the film), Rock is brought to heaven too early (he would have survived the accident), and is not supposed to die for another 40 years. So at the end, when the angels finally find him a young, black body, they tell him that all his memories will be erased. The angels, the girl he fell in love with, being the old man, being himself, all gone. He will become this new person who's body he is in. Which is completely STUPID. The point of him coming back was heaven's way of correcting the mistake they made. Yet his memory will be erased and he becomes this new guy. So instead of the original Chris Rock character getting a 2nd chance, this other guy who died continues his life (since it will be his memory and life that continues), and only "bits" of the Rock's character will shine through. What is the point then? This new guy gets to live his life, yet the original Rock character who died at the beginning is lost in limbo, or stuck in the body but can't act out as himself? What was the point of giving Rock a new body to live out his remaining 40 years if his memory is erased? It took 4 screenwriters (including Rock and Warren Beatty) to write this, and they never realized it made no sense at the end, and made the entire film pointless? Bah!</fullReview>

Since this is a movie for Chris Rock, Chris Rock is almost always on the screen. I thought some of the funniest moments was when the showed the rich white guy acting like a black comedian.

		<shortDescription>This month just isn't getting any better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the more popular theories currently making its way throughthe entertainment media is that the impending writers' and actors'strike will result in unprecedented awfulness at the cinema. I'dargue that the span of time represented by the strike couldn'tpossibly produce anything worse than what's currently beingreleased during the month of February. Case in point: followinghot on the heels of "Saving Silverman" and "Valentine" comes"Down to Earth," thus completing an unholy trinity of astoundingwretchedness.Directed by Chris and Paul Weitz ("American Pie") with all the styleand grace of two brothers suddenly robbed of sight, hearing, andmotor skills, "Down to Earth" tells the story of Lance Barton (ChrisRock), bicycle messenger by day, aspiring stand-up comedian bynight, who is killed a tenth of a second before his designated timeand is therefore allowed to return to earth in the only body availableto him that he finds acceptable: that of white millionaire CharlesWellington. This body will only be a "loaner" until such time as acorpse that Lance *really* likes turns up. Masterminding thiswhole plot are angels played by the usually reliable Eugene Levyand Chazz Palminteri, both of whom look exceedingly uncomfortable in their pastel-blue tuxedos, and as though theywished they could be anywhere but in this movie.Once Lance is stuck in Wellington's body, the movie can get onwith its real business: hooking Lance / Wellington up with thebeautiful, fiesty Santee (Regina King). This is no easy matter,though, because as it turns out, Wellington is something of aheartless S.O.B who wants to refuse patients' access to a hospitalhe owns, and Santee is an advocate of those patients. But Lance,immediately falling for Santee -- and ignoring the fact that he's nowan overweight, middle-aged white guy -- sees this as a chance towoo Santee, and so he reverses the decisions made by his body'sprevious owner. Limping along with that portion of the plot isanother part that sees Lance struggling (as Wellington) to win aslot as one of the comedians performing at the closing of theApollo Theater. And adding to an already overloaded plate is thescheme hatched by Wellington's cutthroat board of directors tohave their newly philanthropic boss rubbed out.One of the main problems with the movie is the execution of thebig body switcheroo. Palminteri's angel tells Lance that everyonewill see and hear Wellington, but Lance will see and hear himself. We see and hear him as Lance, too, except for when it's supposedto be funny for us not to -- such as when Wellington raps orperforms at a predominantly African-American comedy club. Thisis funny, see, because Lance is black and Wellington is white. That's funny, right? Right? Well, actually, no. I laughed exactlyonce in the movie's 87 minutes, and was immediately ashamed ofmyself. We see Rock because the central conceit of the movie isto play off the issue of race -- in essence, look how funny it is tosee an old white guy doing things stereotypically done by a youngblack guy. And when that's the main reason to make a film,alarms start ringing. In the end, it's insulting to both blacks andwhites.To make matters worse, I have seldom been as embarrassed fora cast as I was while watching this movie. Regina Kingdemonstrated none of the fire she had as Cuba Gooding Jr.'s wifein "Jerry Maguire," stuck instead playing a character that'ssupposedly got an iron will, but who falls in love with a paunchy,jowly, middle-aged white man and repeats the line, "There'ssomething about your eyes" so many times I had to squelch theurge to run home and grab my thesaurus so I could return to thetheater and throw it at the screen. Mark Addy, for me the mostlikable character in "The Full Monty"'s eminently likable cast, playsWellington's butler. The joke is that he's supposed to be anAmerican sporting a British accent to seem more "butler-y." Thisfalls flat, though, because Addy's American accent is cringe-worthy, owing largely, I suspect, to the fact that Addy -- getthis -- isn't American! Wouldn't it make more sense to have anAmerican actor faking a British accent since that's, you know, thecharacter? Jennifer Coolidge, one of the funniest things in "Best inShow," plays Wellington's philandering wife and made me want tocrawl under my seat in a thoroughly humiliating scene where shedecides to act "more black" in order to appeal to her suddenlyafrocentric husband. And Chris Rock, a comedian I find viciously,painfully hysterical, is completely defanged here, uttering lineswhich were greeted by the audience with the kind of silence Iusually only hear immediately following the phrase, "Please bowyour heads." The whole endeavor gave me the same creepyfeeling I got watching Woody Allen paw Elizabeth Shue in"Deconstructing Harry."I'm not sure what to chalk this failure up to, except maybe to thefact that this is the third time this particular story has been told, firstas "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" and most recently with Warren Beattyas "Heaven Can Wait." Remakes are rarely as good as theoriginal, and a second remake only removes the quality of theoriginal by another generation. Ultimately, I left "Down to Earth"wondering only one thing: if the world sees and hears Wellingtonas Wellington, why, when Santee reminisces about conversationsshe had with him, does she hear Chris Rock's voice in her head? Just a thought for this pre-strike February.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Embarrassment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the film "Heaven Can Wait" and I also like Chris Rock (I thought), but this movie shows a strangely charmless side of the comedian when he really needs to be likable for this film to work.A misconceived idea from the get-go, "Down to Earth" at least would have worked comically if it had emulated that old Lily Tomlin/Steve Martin soul-switching comedy, "All of Me." In that movie the filmmakers understood that the comedy is to be found in seeing both sides of the soul switch. An old white comedian should have been cast as the body that Rock inhabits (Steve Martin or Chevy Chase)and the comedy would come from Rock doing what he always does and from seeing a white guy acting like Rock. Seeing Chris Rock essentially just be Chris Rock (he is a HORRIBLE, expressionless actor to boot) throws the comedy off-kilter. We rarely see the white body he inhabits and no humor is derived from his having to navigate his youthful self through a puffy, 53 year old body.It's like it was made by people who had no training in comedy before. Don't they know that filming someone saying funny things and cutting away to people laughing uproariously is a killer of comedy? Don't they know that comedies of misunderstandings and mistaken identity require consistent points of view? I started the film with high hopes but it grew dumber and dumber as it went along, blithely missing every opportunity for real humor. And don't get me started on the "romance". Regina King is wonderful but Rock is such a limited actor that she has nothing to play off of.By the time they got around to recreating the finale that is so touching in the Beatty film and so embarrassingly flat here, I had had it. A totally valueless film and probably not a very smart premise to start with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black guy becomes rich white guy, and rich white guy seems to embrace hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments of this film play off of this. The problem I have is that it doesn't work and almost never works.OK, so no one would expect Lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask. I'll grant that. But at the same time, it goes too far the other direction. I'm supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending things, playing like he's a bastion of hip-hop culture, and people just *accept* him? And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him *as a rich white guy*, even though she doesn't care about his money or power? This is so completely unbelievable it's not even funny.I just couldn't suspend disbelief and I couldn't finish the movie. I added one extra star because it did make me laugh, even hard, a couple of times. But I just couldn't get get past the whole "white guy doing hip hop" thing that has never been well done in any movie I've ever seen that tries it. This was no exception.</fullReview>

In Heaven Can Wait he was an American Football player. In Down to Earth, he's a comedian. However, being a comedian isn't so much what it rides on, it's that he's black, and this is what permeates the film.Hence a movie that's largely populated by humour that plays on the oh-so-funny (supposedly) differences between white and black people, and the culture clash as a black delivery driver takes the body of a rich white man. But for me, the humour is very broad. Like a white businessman singing to black rap music -- it's simplistic, moderately amusing but really nothing special. Take this formula, repeat it many times, and that's this film.Everything else in the movie is put in, but nothing gels. From the murderous lovers who just seem completely irrelevant to the movie, to the non-entity that is Eugene Levy's character (and we know this guy can do some great stuff with his material, if he's given it).Then there was the obligatory romance. There were just so many pointed references as to how she liked his eyes and the person inside -- making it quite clear that a hot, strong woman couldn't like the old fat man that she was seeing. So the comments kept coming, all too cutesey and clever, a wink-wink to the viewers at home. Her character was literally apologising to us for kissing him at times.The movie was very short too, just an hour and fifteen minutes, and all in all the movie just felt half-hearted. It had its small moments, and for me Wanda Sykes stole the show (not that there was a lot of show to steal). But all in all, the movie wasn't anything special. I didn't hate it, and you could watch worse things out there. But certainly you shouldn't feel the need to go out of your way to see it either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a combination of charm, wit, humor and romance; "Down To Earth" has ascended to be one of the funniest films I've seen in 2001. This marks the second Chris Rock movie I have seen and I must say I was impressed with his comedic and acting ability because he kept me laughing throughout the film. It is a true pleasure to take a break from the violent action films and watch a light-hearted comedy meant to entertain."Down To Earth" is a very exciting film to watch because Chris Rock's comedy is funny and unpredictable. One the coolest parts of this film was Rock's performance because he knew when to turn off the comedy in the more serious scenes. Furthermore, Rock seemed to fit the part perfectly because his performance looked to pulled off with little effort. This is Chris Rock's breakthrough performance because it proves he is an actor to be reckoned with and not just a one-hit wonder.The intelligence and creativity of the writing was excellent because it was unique and interesting to see how the script would play out on screen. Another impressive aspect of the movie was the element of the dream Rock's character had about performing at the Apollo. It is a true pleasure and welcomed change to see a legitimate underlying plot that made sense rather than one put in to add extra minutes to the movie.The supporting cast of King, Addy, Levy and Palminteri play a huge role in the success of "Down To Earth" because each bring their own exciting personas to the screen. All of these actors come from different genres of film, which makes for an interesting mix of characters.I was extremely impressed with the way each related to one another; furthermore, as with Rock, they seemed to be right at home in their roles because it was pulled off with ease. It is not often that we find a cast who come together from different genres to produce such an exciting and hilarious film."Down To Earth" is the best comedy of the year because it combines fresh and original jokes with touching and charming scenes lacking in the other 2001 comedies. Chris Rock is a tremendous comedic talent that knows how to use it to his advantage; furthermore, it is a true pleasure to watch him."Down To Earth" made me smile because it is a truly touching film that isn't holding anything back. Chris Rock rules the screen with his comedy and the writing is out of this world. I wish I could have been part of this film.I can't wait to see Rock's next film because I know he will pull another great comedic performance out of his hat. His comedy, charm and wit made this film worthwhile and deserves all the praise it has received. "Down To Earth" receives a directed verdict of guilty of being one of the funniest films of 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Remake, But a Copycat Ripoff of "Heaven Can Wait"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen "Here Comes Mr. Jordan," which is the basis for the great 1978 comedy classic "Heaven Can Wait." "Heaven Can Wait" seemed like an original to me, with a memorable cast, and an amusing storyline and characters. Twenty-three years later came "Down to Earth," which transcends its plot from "Heaven Can Wait's" world of L.A. football to New York's hip-hop and Apollo Club scene. "Down to Earth" literally borrows and imitates "Heaven Can Wait's" characters, scenes, and lines to death. No character from "Heaven Can Wait" is left untouched. Here is a list of all the stars from "Down to Earth" paralleling those from "Heaven Can Wait" in their characters.a) Chris Rock is to Warren Beatty as the hero killed suddenly in bike accidents and summoned to heaven too early. He returns to earth in a substitute body of a ruthless millionaire, murdered at that instant. Once he becomes a better man, his destiny is to go onto the next body.b) Regina King is to Julie Christie as the activist protesting the crimes of the millionaires, then she falls in love with him.c) Chazz Palminteri is to James Mason as the guardian angel guiding the dead man into his destiny. Palminteri is Mr. King. Mason, as we all remember, was Mr. Jordan.d) Eugene Levy is to Buck Henry as the overzealous escort realizing he made a mistake taking the dead man too soon.e) Jennifer Coolidge is to Dyan Cannon as the malevolent wife who does her husband in, then when he sees his reincarnated form, she wants to do him in again. f) Greg Germann is to Charles Grodin as the husband's personal assistant who aids the wife in the murder of her husband. Germann is a lawyer. Grodin was a private secretary.g) Frankie Faison is to Jack Warden as the dead man's boss and confidant. Faison is Rock's manager. Warden was Beatty's football coach. But where is there a character for Vincent Gardenia, who played the police lieutenant investigating the sudden disappearance of the millionaire among the characters in a key scene from "Heaven Can Wait?" Not only wasn't there a Gardenia-like character, but there was no scene of an investigation in "Down to Earth." How careless is that? As for the scenes in "Down to Earth," it sure plays like a scene-by-scene remake. Those who are familiar with "Heaven Can Wait" can easily spot the copycat scenes in "Down to Earth," even the lines. For instance, when Rock puts on the robe of the dead man, he says, "It's Still Me.," just like Beatty. King does everything she can to be a black Julie Christie, even saying, "I see that look in your face. It's in your eyes.," the way Christie passionately said to Beatty. King comes off trying too hard to emulate someone else. Then in one scene, Rock says, "I didn't steal any acts." But what about that of Warren Beatty? Everyone else stole their characters acts. It would be a good idea for Beatty, Christie and the rest of the cast (God bless the souls of Gardenia and Mason, but they had to be tumbling in their graves) to sue the entire cast of "Down to Earth" for film theft. And what would be their punishments? How about Rock seen with an arm around one woman a month in homage to Beatty's playboy days? Or Regina King trying to do a unnecessary version of "Dr. Zhivago," the classic which made Christie a star. We can also expect Ms. King to do unnecessary versions of "Don't Look Now" or "Demon Seed," with the sex scenes less steamy. Or how about Greg Germann working with Saint Bernards, as did Grodin in "Seems Like Old Times" and the "Beethoven" movies. Oh, how about Rock and King doing remakes of "Shampoo" and "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," which starred Beatty and Christie before they made "Heaven Can Wait", when they were an item in the 1970's. As they say, let the curse fit the crime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought, but not like the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a general feeling amongst film fans and critics that 1941s Here Comes Mr. Jordan is the best-yet screen version of Harry Segall's stage piece Heaven Can Wait. Another worthy remake, although not as good as Here Comes Mr. Jordan, was 1978s Heaven Can Wait, which lost some of the original's charm but still had plenty of wonderful ensemble acting. This is the third version of the story I have seen on-screen, and with Heaven Can Wait and Here Comes Mr. Jordan fresh in my memory, I was expecting to hate this picture with a passion. Here Comes Mr. Jordan is among my thirty favorite films ever, and I thoroughly enjoyed its remake.Although simpler at times and less sophisticated, Down to Earth is an attention holder. If it came on tv, I would probably change the chanel after a few minutes, but stuck in the teatre, I was not tempted to walk out (as I often am). Don't get me wrong: I did not like this movie, but it exceeded my expectations. It brought in some funny new twists that if handled by a more pedigree cast and crew could have formed a contemporary classic.Unfortunately, it was made for the masses, and (inexplicably) was quite popular with it theatrical release. Don't go out of your way to see this, but if you have some time to kill, by all means take a look. But be sure to watch the orignal two picture versions to see how it should have been done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Classic Story Gets Dumbed Down For Contemporary Audiences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the other reviews you may already learned that this film is the second remake of 1941's HERE COMES MR. JORDAN which was remade in 1978 as HEAVEN CAN WAIT which is one of the few remakes that's better than the original. But the story takes a big nose dive with this recent remake which is more of a starring vehicle for Chris Rock than any attempt to do a decent remake of a good story. The supportting cast (Regina King (JERRY MAGUIRE), Chaz Palmenteri (A BRONX TALE) and Eugene Levy (AMERICAN PIE)) do their best to rise above this lameness but they're just reminders of their wasted talents. Another thing that p***es me off about this movie is that the filmmakers had some idea that the average moviegoer is so stupid that they had to keep being reminded that Rock's soul is inhabited in the body of a middle aged white man by switching back and forth between the two. The makers of JORDAN and HEAVEN had enough confidence in the intelligence of the audience to not to have to explain that angle to them. Another point is with Rock, who along with Pryor, Carlin, Foxx, Cosby and Kennison, is probably the best stand-up comic ever and has had a few good film moments (NURSE BETTY, NEW JACK CITY and I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA) but this film doesn't help his case (I know this movie made a lot of money. So what.) I just hope his movie career doesn't go the same path as Adam Sandler, another once funny person who now makes sucky movies. Do yourself a favor and rent HEAVEN or maybe even JORDAN and skip this turd.</fullReview>

Greg Germann...ok, but Chris just sucked.So much could've been done with his character in terms of action, dialoque, humor...well everything.The rest of the crew was good.The house was great...beautiful...damn, I wish I lived there.This film needed more action or more comedy with Chazz and Eugene.There could be an entire script with those two alone.Infact...this movie could've done without Chris Rock to begin with.Do I hate Chris Rock??? NO...he just lacks...He shows little emotion except anger for the black nation against white people...it's in every single movie he does...and it's boring as sin.There is soooo much more he could do...Chris Rock is supposed to be the next Eddie Murphy...no way....Eddie Murphy is way better...even when he is rude and obnoxious.I'm quite sure that the producers made their money multiple times over with this release...but for their next venture...do the viewers a favour.If the producers make anotehr film, and they happen to cast Chris Rock...give him some appeal...give him some life and some depth.If the producers make another movie with Chazz...great...looking forward to it. He does good performances...humor, tough guy roles, gripping heart wrenching performances...too bad he's always the heavy.That concludes this comment...Chris if you read this by chance...hope some of this sinks in.</fullReview>

The acting is poor, the script is weak, and the jokes are not funny. The most hillarious moment of the film was actually when Lance became Joe Guy after the car crash, and he tried stopping a taxi but none would halt. And then, realizing who he was, Lance/Joe shouted in joy, "I'm black again! I'm black again!" And I agree with the other commentator who wrote this film has a good ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I'm a little biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know a lot of people didn't like Down to Earth, and one person here even said that Chris Rock is not an actor (which I disagree with). I may be a little biased because I am a HUGE Chris Rock fan, and I think he's the funniest man in comedy today (well, next to George Carlin). Down to Earth, the story of comedian Lance Barton who is killed before he's meant to die and is given the body of a rich white man which he uses to try to win the affections of the girl of his dreams, is basically plotless, but it did have a lot of funny scenes. A particular highlight is when he drives through Harlem in a Rolls-Royce jamming down to Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Gin and Juice" while the black guys in the next car are seeing an old white guy doing this.Granted, I was a little disappointed because Rock and his show's staff wrote this, and I think they could do better than remaking another movie for material. Give them a few more chances before you impugn Chris Rock's movie career entirely. Look at his buddy Adam Sandler. His early self-written stuff ("Billy Madison" to be specific) was downright terrible. But as he got to "The Waterboy" he got the laugh part right, as he did with "Big Daddy", and then once he got to "Little Nicky" it was apparent he finally figured out how to add plots to his films, too. Hopefully it won't take Rock that long to figure all that stuff out, but I'm just trying to say don't count a long-term movie career out for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't post of a review of a movie unless it's underrated, but not in this caseDown to Earth is a remake of "Heaven Can't Wait" The main difference is, instead of a pro football player who dies and comes back as a millionaire, with the dream of being in the Superbowl, its an aspiring comedian Lance Barton (Chris Rock)who dreams of playing at the Apollo.If there was one way to describe this movie, it would be a cheesy and cliche' version of the original. Just by watching the original versions, one can point out where the film makers made their mistakes.The other problem with this film is that Chris Rock can't seem to pull off the delightful "fish out of water" personal that was so masterfully done by Eddie Murphy in films like "Trading Places" and "Beverly Hills Cop". When Murphy toys with expensive gadgets, he's fall out of your seat hilarious, when Chris Rock does it, he seems boring.The story is also too disjointed. You don't seem to be reminded that Barton is an old millionaire until the actor is exposed in a few brief scenes. The movie would have been funnier if we constantly saw the old man acting like Chris Rock (Ex: Bill and Teds' Bogus Journey). The supporting cast is one dimentional, from there greedy stock holders, to the plotting wife. There is nothing positive about this film, and it was not because of a lack of talent. Chris Rock showed his dramatic qualities in "New Jack City" and his comedic abilities in "Lethal Weapon 4"Before thinking about seeing this film, rent the original versions along with Beverly Hills Cop instead.</fullReview>

In this movie I ended up reminding myself several times: "Chris Rock is supposed to be an old white guy".The whole concept does not play as intended: The "illusion" is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all. The fact that all you see is Chris Rock playing a young black guy, because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes, is to much of a challenge for the viewers "suspension of disbelief".</fullReview>

The racial comedy, which in his stand-up act is hilarious, doesn't work here. The staory was just horrible, the jokes were actually pretty lame too. If he would have tried making a movie with a couple jokes thrown in, then ok, it might have worked. Rock though, tried making the whole film based on his comedy routine.

		<fullReview>Young Chris Rock stars as Lance Barton in this "comedy" about a messenger who is also an aspiring comedian. He dies too soon--a heavenly mistake I will put it like that--which is rectified by giving him temporary custody of another body. The body is that of Charles Wellington, a rich older white man. I never saw this movie until the other day, although it is about 11-12 years old as I write this. I was watching Chris Rock on an Oprah Winfrey rerun promoting it. Oprah seemed to really find it hilariously funny, so I bought it. Sorry I did. It is not that funny. Well, it has a few moments here and there. And Wanda Sykes adds to those fleeting moments, but it is just not that funny. I always liked Chris Rock, but even his acting appears stilted. Perhaps he was not too experienced then. You can see that the memorized lines are just coming out of his mouth without much feeling. As I said, I now own this movie. It's on a shelf. I will never view it again. Once was enough. Perhaps I'll toss it in the trash. If you, reading this review, want it, please let me know, you can have it---free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Heaven Can Wait", the 1978 film starring Warren Beatty, is a remake of 1941's "Here Comes Mr. Jordan". 2001's "Down to Earth" is another remake of the same movie. I saw the 1978 version in 2006 and again the following year, but still haven't seen the original, though I certainly still intend to. I rented this most recent film of the three without knowing it was a remake, but knowing that the starring role was played by Chris Rock. Not every film I've seen the comedian in is very good, but I have seen him in some funny ones, such as "Lethal Weapon 4" and "Dogma". Knowing that "Down to Earth" didn't have a very good reputation, I didn't think it would be funny, but found it to be an above average comedy, which I wasn't expecting.Lance Barton is a struggling comedian who unfortunately isn't very funny onstage, due to his stage fright. When his manager, Whitney Daniels, tells him that the Apollo Theater is about to have its final Amateur Night contest before closing down, Lance is determined to land a slot at this show. However, while riding his bike at night, he is distracted by a woman on the street and doesn't see an oncoming truck until it's too late! An angel named Mr. Keyes takes him up to heaven, but it turns that out it was not the comedian's time to die, so the head angel, Mr. King, takes him back to look for a different body to put him in, before anyone knows that the person is dead. After searching for a while, one of Lance's options is Charles Wellington, III, a billionaire tyrant who has just been murdered. Lance decides to temporarily take this body, until a more suitable body is found for him, and being a totally different person than what the businessman was before, this will obviously be an awkward experience! After the intro of this film, we see Chris Rock as Lance Barton going on a rant as if he's been mistaken for a bicycle messenger, even though he really IS one, and this part certainly did make me laugh. I thought maybe this would be the funniest part, and the only one that would actually make me laugh, but I was wrong. While most of the movie isn't exactly laugh-out-loud, there were other times when I laughed, including Lance in the body of Charles Wellington, III doing his stand-up routine, and two scenes with Lance/Charles rapping in public. I also frequently smiled, and rock puts on a decent enough comedic performance to help with the humour. I didn't find Jennifer Coolidge as Mrs. Wellington very amusing, and the romantic scenes with Lance (in Charles' body) and the Sontee Jenkins character played by Regina King may be slightly flawed, but I didn't find anything in the film painfully bad (it's not an extremely juvenile gross-out comedy, you can be sure about that), and the story held my interest.I know a lot of people strongly dislike/hate this movie, and that may include many Chris Rock fans, but despite all the criticism, I cannot give the film any rating lower than six out of ten. If you ask me, even a rating of seven just MIGHT not be excessively generous, even if most of those who have seen this particular 2001 comedy would strongly disagree! Also, coming from Paul and Chris Weitz, the directors of "American Pie" (a much more popular comedy, one which I think is sometimes funny but as a whole is quite overrated), I was expecting "Down to Earth" to be far more puerile and gross than it actually is! If you're a Chris Rock fan, I wouldn't expect this to be the funniest movie you'll ever see him in, but you could still find yourself laughing at least some of the gags (that is obviously NOT a guarantee). In my opinion, this film is definitely better than "Head of State", Rock's 2003 directorial debut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching this hard to digest celluloid, I should say that I was--and am--no Chris Rock fan. Now, after having sat through this torture of a film, I am also no longer a Wanda Sykes fan. This film could have been much better had it been more developed. The viewers are asked to believe the impossible...Chris Rock as a white man, then as a recently deceased comedian who dies in a car crash...not to mention his own death somewhat prematurely, after being scrunched beneath the wheels of a truck as he rode his bike on his messenger service day gig. It seems it would have been sufficient to focus the film around the ups and downs of just being a stand-up comic...the heartbreak of just being in show-biz is still an engrossing subject and will keep you interested. There are too many twists and turns in the film...the humor is forced, the plot and situations are contrived. Though it was based on previous films, such as "Heaven Can Wait" and "Here Comes Mr Jordan", nothing is done to improve upon the inventiveness of those films, and it ends up being a waste of time. All I can say is that at least Chris Rock didn't resort to filthy language, and though I do not care for Chris Rock, I really wanted to like this film, and it did get off to an interesting start. But that auspicious start was not maintained, sadly. It could have been a much better film, had it been handled and delivered differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not saying that just as a Chris Rock fan, I'm saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong. The first flaw was it's everything-works-out ending that everybody saw coming. Flaw number two was I found that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed fake. Finally the acting in this movie was sub-par, with the best actor being Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy. but I saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy. In a heads-up scenario, watch heaven can wait instead, it's better. So for all you Chris Rock fans out there, WATCH THIS MOVIE, you'll enjoy out. He has some good stand-up in this movie.Overall: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great. Also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking.

		<fullReview>Chris Rock is untouchable as a stand-up comic. But as a movie actor his talents leave much to be desired."Down to Earth" is a great example. There were scenes in this movie, when played back, where Mr. Rock can be seen looking at cue cards.That, plus his stilted performance and the lack of interaction with the other cast members.What would have worked better is if the white guy playing Wellington had been seen more using Mr. Rock's voice and mannerisms. That would have made for a more entertaining film.What Mr. Rock should consider as his next movie project would be a recording of one of his concerts. That is where his great talent lies.Mr. Rock, for everyone's sake, please leave movie acting to the professionals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Heaven Can Wait" was a play that was made into a 1941 movie called "Here Comes Mr. Jordan." It was remade in 1978 with Warren Beatty, with the original title, "Heaven Can Wait." That was a great movie. The new remake, "Down to Earth" starring Chris Rock, is not worth watching, even for free, unless you are extremely young or not too picky about watching bad comedies. Chris Rock is a funny guy but he makes some really bad movies, and this is one of them.I find it humorous that one reviewer said the funniest scene was when a white guy got beat up for singing a rap song in public. Yes, that's how bad this movie is. When an old cliche like that can be cited as the funniest scene in the movie. Maybe they should have also had a car crash through a truck full of chickens, and a large plate of glass being carried by two guys.If you haven't seen this one or the 1978 "Heaven Can Wait," you should skip this garbage and see the good one. One of the funniest scenes in Heaven Can Wait was (mild spoiler here) when Dyan Cannon screams because her husband, whom she thought she murdered, turns up alive. Her accomplice, Charles Grodin, explains that she screamed because she saw a mouse. When it is pointed out that there is no mouse present, he says, "It was yesterday. She relives it."Trivia fact: In the 1941 version, the main character Joe Pendleton was a boxer. In the 1978 version, he was a football player for the L.A. Rams, and in the Chris Rock version, his name is changed to Lance Barton and he is a stand-up comedian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to the theater to see this film, I was thinking that it could not possibly be funny because it was only a PG-13 film with Chris Rock and all of Rock's comedy is profane and dirty. I couldnt imagine his humor being without any cursing, sex talk, or racist slurs. But this film was extremely funny. Chris Rock plays a stage comedian who is terrible and believes he will never make it anywhere, but he gets hit by a truck, goes to heaven and learns that the only way he can return to Earth is if he goes back in another person's body. He chooses the body of a rich old man named Charles Wellington (who was poisoned by his wife) and the rest is history. It is simply hilarious everything that happens next. Chris Rock is in Wellington's body, but he still has the same personality as before, so people in the film who knew Wellington are wondering why he is acting so strange. I cannot even explain how funny this is. Even for PG-13 humor, this was hilarious. Definitely see this film even if you don't like Chris Rock. FANTASTIC!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Rock is in the movie, so of course there is going to be the usual amount of humor that when a black guy says it to be black people, its hilarious, but when a white guy says it, its racist and the black people have to raise holy hell about until George Bush himself practically has to get involved.The movie's jokes ARE sometimes funny, but the whole plot wasn't all that good. The cast members are pretty good: Chazz Palmeterri, Eugene Levi, Jennifer Coolidge, Paul Giamatti, and many others are among the victimized actors/actresses who have the misfortune of playing in this stupid movie.Even the soundtrack wasn't that good, most of it is rap, so it should have been, but wasn't. Just like the movie itself. You might laugh, you might like it...if you're stupid. But all in all, DOWN TO EARTH is not a movie to see very often. Maybe after you have seen it once, wait about three years and then see it again, maybe you might like it better the second time around. DOWN TO EARTH gets 2/5.</fullReview>

Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he just can't transfer his talent to this film, which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture.If you haven't watched this film yet, avoid it like the plague.

		<fullReview>Hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of "8"s, this movie's true score.As mentioned before Chris Rock is The King! Previous to going to see this movie I wasn't that over the top about him but now I'm banging on the doors of Chris Rock's website begging him to take me on as his protege. This film is truly funny, if you don't find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it's humour which targets all areas of society including race(predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy... the list goes on.There was one slight disappointment for me however. This was that in going into this film I didn't realise that it was actually a remake of "Heaven Can Wait" another quite good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie I had watched on TV a few weeks ago.. Regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any...you get the picture.Well to the actual plot of the film.Don't spoil the experience for yourself! Don't read the plot! Just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far that have raved mad about it, go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time, go and see it because it's a cinema experience that doesn't leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets. Go see it because it is a good movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DOWN TO EARTH (2001) ** (out of four) or 5/10 rating"Down to Earth" is a remake of a remake and as such it acts like a remake. Mainly the film has been turned into back-to-back Chris Rock standup-comedy hours (edited for content). The 1978 movie "Heaven Can Wait." simply had a better premise (a football player, heck a ram &amp; 2 years ago people were saying that Kurt Warner's real life was basically a remake of the movie. or "Mr. Jordan's premise with a Boxer). So, hollywood and Rock get the idea (while talking to Warren B.) that a stand-up comic would be a great idea for the role. Hmm, ok it seems like a good idea, but just like stand-up comedy, ISN'T IT BEST TO USE SOME FRESH MATERIAL???Instead, they rehash a 22 year old script, change it to fit the profile, and completely morph the characters. Instead of Joe Pendleton/Bruce Farnsworth/Ralph Murdoch (from "Here Comes Mr. Jordan") or Joe Pendleton/Leo Farnsworth/Tom Jarrett (from "Heaven Can Wait") we now have Lance Barton/Mr. Wellington/Joe Guy.The only similarities here are really that the main charter inhabits 3 bodies. There are skeletal remains of the previous scripts (like the millionaire has a death threat, the millionaire falls in love, and the third body saves the day, but in reality--&gt;Down to Earth has changed the storyline into a special effects driven movie. The effects make you believe that Rock is now a white 60+ year old millionaire. Yet, he still acts like a black comedian, They make you believe that Rock is all three characters, yet he doesn't even believe it himself.Basically, Down to Earth can Wait for viewing on TV or video if even that. The good or so-so premise is just to watered down with special affects to be anything special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very little laughs. What is sold as a comedy is delivered as a good morality movie. Chris Rock delivers a good acting role, and is funny when he wants to be. But we do not see enough of what he is supposed to be (old, rich, white guy) and that hurts DOWN TO EARTH. Chris Rock being a good moral and overly positive person is also not the norm of today and does more harm than good.Lance Barton is a black comedian who gets hit by a truck and sent to Heaven. Heaven botches (Lance was not supposed to die yet) so they send him back to Earth in a temporary body until they someone suitable. Lance, more high on morals than brains, picks a rich white man in his early fifties to cover and practice his black jokes until Heaven comes up with somethingA great concept is completely thrown away by unfunny moments and bland characters (the Angels in particular). For an 87 minute movie, it felt like it took forever to finish. The perception of Heaven was not bad, but it does not save DOWN TO EARTH from falling apart. DOWN TO EARTH stinks to high heaven and Chris Rock better get some better material if we ever see his face again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay comedy, that you should only watch once or twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently rented this out, and I got what I expected. I'm not a Chris Rock fan, so it was hard to get adjusted to the humor at first. But once I did it was pretty funny. The plot is after Chris Rock dies, he finds out he wasn't supposed to die yet, so the guys *up there*(Which is how they referred to God and the angels in this movie most of the time)send him back down to earth in the body of a white fat millionares body, who has just been poisoned by his wife. So before the body is found dead, Chris Rock jumps in and experiences life in a whole new way. I especially liked the part where he's singing a black rap song, and he gets beat up for it. But those were the rare times I laughed. I give this movie 2 1/2 stars out of 5. It was an okay comedy that was decent for the night I rented it.(I didn't like the ending though, sorry to say)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Funny But Could've Been a Lot Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie, and that was gonna be the only time. The comedy in this movie was really funny, and Chris Rock is one of the most funniest comedians in Hollywood. But in the movie they could've showed him as the old white man, there was about only 3 times you saw him as the old white man. And you never heard him talking in the voice of the old man, which would've made the movie a lot better. That is the only thing I hated about Down To Earth, everything else was awsome. Go see the movie, and watch it before they buy it. You will thank me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down to Dullsville</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keep in mind, I am a fan of Chris Rock. I've listened to his album "Bigger and Blacker" (and noticed he recycled some material from the stand-up act and used it in the film--Come on, Rock! You're a comedian, you can come up with new material!) and seen his many appearances on talk shows and news programs. Chris Rock is, undoubtedly, a man of great talent. A vulgar, but inspired comedian who has his ear to the ground on a variety of social issues and utilizes them in his acts. So I bet you're expecting a great review out of me!...Well, you were wrong. "Down to Earth" is a mediocre, underdeveloped, self-indulgent vehicle for Rock. It showcases some of his material, some of his (supposed) ability to display heartfelt emotions and spend 90 minutes without uttering a single "f" word. Yes, this is a moderately sanitized PG-13 work, but it's not a comedy that was meant for a PG-13 rating. It's another one of those watered down PG-13 flicks that simply suck up to the MPAA. All the "messages" in this bland comedy are obviously forced and pasted-on. They're as effective as the messages you find at the end of an Adam Sandler flick. Only Sandler is funny and doesn't spend too much time conveying these false messages. "DTO" starts out as a comedy (with funny sequences here and there), but falters into melodrama and cheap sentiment. It almost turns into an after-school special. The whole relationship between Rock and Regina King is moved in a predictable, catered Hollywood fashion. I'm sure Rock (who co-wrote the script) had Regina in mind when writing her character. He was probably thinking to myself, "I got a way I can make the audience feel sorry for my character AND get a kissing scene with Regina King." Their relationship has no spark of any kind. Romantic chemistry (on-screen, at least) is not the comedian's strong point. Throughout the film, you just think to yourself, "He's just feeding her this bulls**t sentiment so he can get into her pants." Nice try, dude. The supporting cast helps to a small degree. Fellow cast member/writer on "The Chris Rock Show" Wanda Sykes is the best of the bunch. She's another talented comedian, who unfortunately got roped into this production. Her character seems like it deserves to be a different movie. I was cracking up when she started cursing into the camera, when interviewed for a TV news program, after getting paint poured on her fur coat by an angry Animal Rights Activist. Eugene Levy is great, as always, but he really isn't given much to work with. My man Chazz Palminteri has a small, forgettable role. But Chazz has that strong presence that causes him to rise above the material, no matter how weak it is. Like I tell my friends, Chazz is one of those actors, if you hand him the stupidest line in movie history, he'll make it sound cool. I don't know his name, but I also got a kick out of that Asian guy who made a big hit at the Appollo. He was hilarious! I think I've seen him in other films; I can be wrong. For some reason, I feel like he's popped up in supporting roles like that before. If anyone knows if he has and where he has, please send me a pm. Mark Addy, who I enjoy in almost everything he does, seems to be bored in this movie. He plays a tight-a** English butler, who--as we find out later, don't worry I'm not giving anything away--is actually a full-blooded American feigning the accent. The problem? Addy does a crappy job at feigning an AMERICAN accent! I love the guy, but anybody who's seen the sequel to "The Flintstones" knows that for a fact. Rock's character is completely bland, though the obvious intention is to make him a likeable, sensitive, caring guy; adverse to his real life stage persona. Unfortunately, Rock pulls it off with the greatest of dullness. And guess what? He plays a stand-up comic! If that's self-indulgent--I don't know what is. Isn't the essence of acting to play someone totally DIFFERENT from yourself? The whole films seems like it was written by Rock and for Rock. He may as well have made this a home video he can keep in the basement, so one lonely night he can sit back on the couch, have a drink and have a few laughs. I'm sure he'll be enjoying it a hell of a lot more than the audience. And here's the film's major flaw: It's a one-joke comedy, and the one joke is badly delivered! Rock is supposed to be in the body of an aging white guy, but what do we see? Chris Rock! (self-indulgent much?) Only on occasion do we see the white guy pop up in badly timed comic moments. But I have to say, watching an old white guy get his groove on to hip-hop music is a joy no matter how many times you've seen it."Down to Earth" is not a bad film, not a good film, it's a bland film. A film that's fairly watchable (on a first viewing, at least) but is thoroughly disappointing, especially if you're a fan like myself. If Rock is reading this, I urge him to--if he's gonna make another PG-13 comedy--please don't water down his act. That's just pitiful. I'm not impressed. My score: 5 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe .Hard to find many laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Down to Earth is another one of those unremarkable American comedy's that tries to get laughs by trying to show how different the black and white cultures by making fun of one of these groups and as always it is the white american upper classes that are the brunt of the laughs....or lack of them. Why is it we never see a white man picking out faults of the black people? well that is easy to answer,that would be seen as racist and would never do! As for the film it ambles on picking up the occasional laugh but the because the the ridiculous senario of as black man dying and going into an old white man's body and then falling in love with a young black woman who sees him as an old white man but still falls for him, it is very hard to believe .Chris Rock look like a promising comedian given a better film to star in but as for Down To Earth, it can go Down to the Video store where it came from. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has one big flaw...it's just not funny. Chris Rock is a funny guy in general, but in this role, he's not. I mean, the movie is about Chris Rock in an old guy's body after he is hit by a bus (a mistake the angel made) so now, the angels must find him a new body, and he is in this old rich guy's body until they find him a better one. The story is just ridiculous. Not that part, but the fact that Rock in the old guy's body, dates a young black woman, played by the annoying Regina King. She doesn't work in this part, because, I'm sorry- she is the furthest thing from sexy...especially with that voice of hers. You have to sit back in amazement as King's character and the old man date and fall in love, while she talks about how she never thought he would be her type, but surprisingly- he is! Is that unbelievable or what? The guy is in his 80's yet we're supposed to watch them fall in love on screen? The other thing that doesn't work is the fact that we only see Rock as the old man a couple of times...so you sort of forget that it's not Rock doing all of this stuff, but instead an old man. This movie falls flat on its face, and it's a shame, because Rock is genuinely a funny guy. The plot is was too ridiculous to stomach, and the way everything is put together (down to the editing) is just all wrong.....2/10</fullReview>

Greg Germann's character could have been more highly developed to add a sense of evil to a film that was too holy. Could have been much better, but considering it's an adaptation of an adaptation, Down To Earth was impressive enough to endure. More of a video rental really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid-50's white mans body. He doesn't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before. He listens to rap music, sings along, and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man. The real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had not seen the movie trailer when I went to see the movie, instead I based my judgments on a friend's opinions. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat on its face.During the movie Rock delivers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy. The movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and it that endeavor it fails. The love story in the movie is straight forward (luckily), but it detracts too much from the movie by making Rock serious and bland. After all, the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy, where laughter should be the primary concern. Not much of that in the movie.The plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole. Some parts were discontinuous altogether. If the supporting cast were meant to be funny, they certainly didn't do a good job. The couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes, which were dry and dull. Rock's first incarnation's couple of underlings were also bland. If there's one thing they did do right, though, they made Rock seem funnier by comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about "Down To Earth," I was pretty excited. I'm a pretty big fan a Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole.First off, Chris Rock. He plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously, this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, it doesn't. Even when he's talking to one other character, he seems to think he's trying to make a roomful of people laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they mostly come during the standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out.Also, the movie was poorly directed. The movie has basically a one-joke plot: old white guy acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this still could have worked, and been quite funny. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy. It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling Chris Rock's jokes, but for most of the time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not nearly as funny. The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like Rock are, in fact, hilarious. If he had been shown more, the movie would have been a lot funnier.Overall, a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that "Down To Earth" is poorly acted, and poorly directed. This one was a pretty big disappointment.Rating: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misses every target it shoots at; unfunny and mislead. * (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DOWN TO EARTH / (2001) * (out of four)By Blake French:"Down to Earth" is such a mislead and desperate comedy it makes sitting home on the couch watching a Chris Rock standup-comedy act on TV look like heaven. Speaking of heaven, the film is based on the 1978 movie "Heaven Can Wait." That was a good movie, and this is good-to demonstrate how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz miss nearly every target. From concept to storytelling, "Down to Earth" fails miserably; this is one incredibly bad production.Chris Rock is a lousy standup comedian, both in his role in this movie and in the real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose manager, (Frankie Faison) even feels sorry for him when he is booed off stage during amateur night at a local theatre. Soon after the script establishes his lack of talent, the character is killed by a speeding truck. Death, played by Eugene Levy, has made a mistake, taking Lance before his number was up. God's assistant (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to let Lance make up the remainder of his time on Earth, as long as he takes the only available body of a 60 year old white millionaire.The old man's name is Mr. Wellington, whose life has problems of its own. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) is having an affair with his assistant (Greg Germann), who is robbing him of his money. But that's all right because Lance, inside Mr. Wellington, has fallen in love with a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King.) Meanwhile, there are plots to kill Wellington, Lance attempting to get a better body, and Sontee's confused feelings dealing with a hospital situation involving Mr. Wellington's finances."Down to Earth" has some good ideas, but they are in a pointless and unconvincing love story filled with contrivances and recycled material. The biggest problem it runs into is how we perceive Lance as Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is the actor with popularity and publicity, so he is not going to be absent from most of this movie; all of the characters see the new Lance as Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. This is convenient for the love story; we believe a young woman would fall for Lance, but in reality, he is actually an old, gray-haired geezer. That is not so convincing.The one-joke comic situation is supposed to be watching an old man doing funny things that are really done by a young black man. But what inspires laughter is when characters run into conflicts without their knowledge. Just look at "There's Something About Mary." In the funny scenes the characters are exposed to awkward experiences, and not at their will. Here, Lance knows he is in an old man's body, and does things old men would not normally do. If Lance did not know the body he was in then that may have had potential.Another problem with the concept: we never knew Mr. Wellington in the first place, so how can we compare Lance in his body when we do not know what he was like originally. To top everything off, Chris Rock needs to be the center of attention here, and makes the character too much like Rock. He recites simple standup routine jokes that are tedious and painful; his dialogue is so obvious, wooden and straightforward. I hated the film's sense of humor. There are so many unfunny jokes and horrible comic situations. It is like watching Chris Rock being Chris Rock, not a character in a movie.Let's emphasize the positives in "Down to Earth." Mark Addy does not do any worse here than he did in "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas." Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are well cast, but they are at the mercy of a scalped script. Those are all the good qualities I can mention at this time, and if you give me another week to recollect, it is not likely that I will come up with any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Earthly comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying Chris Rock is one of my favorite actors/comedians. He is extremely talented. However, DOWN TO EARTH doesn't do him justice. He plays a guy who is trying to be a comedian. Then one night while riding his bike home from an act he sees a woman and is hit by a bus. When he gets to heaven he is told he can have another dead man's body. He chooses an old white guy who knows the woman he was looking at before he dies so he chooses the body. That is when the laughs begin to kick in. Once in the body he raps to DMX, saves a hospital from destruction, and tries to keep his comedic gig. The movie isn't consistently funny throughout, there are some bright spots here and there, but one gets the sense it could have been a whole lot better. Chris Rock, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and Mark Addy are great in their respective roles, but Regina King as the love interest gives a rather weak performance. It's not a great movie, but not a bad one either. If you are a fan of Chris Rock, you'll probably get some laughs out of it. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could you not find this movie funny?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie was very funny. I am a big fan of Chris Rock, and I think that even though he couldn't swear like he does during his stand up, he was still really funny. The whole audience was laughing from the first scene to the last scene, and even leaving the theater. One thing about this movie is that even if you don't think Chris Rock is that funny, you can't help but laugh at this movie. There were no points in the movie that were stale or boring.It's so funny to read the other reviews that people write. I think they are trying to write some scientific breakdown thesis to make them seem highly intelligent or above others in movie maturity. Sorry, but your not. Some people just write lengthy put-down reviews about good movies because otherwise they would have nothing worth reading. Who cares if the story is a remake of some old movie from back in the day. That alone doesn't make it funny or unfunny compared to the original. Sorry, but Siskel &amp; Ebert are not hiring interns. If you want to see a funny movie with a date, by yourself, with your kids (10 or older), with your parents, or with your friend, this is the movie to see. Don't waste your time with Saving Silverman. Ultimate disappointment.To the other reviewers, don't hate - congratulate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not exactly brilliant, but semi-enjoyable comedy about a black wannabe comedian who dies too early and gets temporarily reincarnated in the body of a rich, middle-aged, balding, fat white guy. I have not seen the original versions of this story, and I haven't seen Chris Rock in anything else. (Sorry, his show is on WAY past my bedtime) but I had a few laughs. I guess the full force of Rock's usual material has been toned down, if the film has a PG-13 rating, but some of his observations about the stupidness of the racial divide in America were funny and did hit home. But, even though we see Rock as he sees himself throughout the movie, most of the humor from the actual story comes from knowing that other people see him as this balding, chubby, rich white guy who, once a coldhearted "asshole" who mindlessly closes down hospitals, now suddenly taken to spotting "homeboy" catchphrases and bumping and grinding to gangsta rap, and the moments (too few and far between) when we actually see this white guy, as the rest of the people in the film see him, doing all these things are the laugh-out-loud funniest in the film, even if they are cheap and even if we still hear Rock's voice despite the angels telling him that other people see AND hear the white guy in his own voice. (If we heard his voice, it would probably be even funnier.) I am surprised only one other reviewer mentioned Wanda Sykes' performance as the billionaire's maid who mutters obsceneties about her employer behind his back. Aside from Rock and the billionaire himself, she is the best thing about the film. Although she is a more foul-mouthed throwback to the Hattie McDaniel era (Is that intentional?), like McDaniel, she steals every scene she's in regardless of the stereotype. The rest of the cast, except for Chazz Palementari as the head honcho (aside from the Big G, of course) in Heaven, is embarrassing. The romance with Regina King is unneccasary and totally unbeleiveable. We see ROck in all their scenes, of course, but in the back of my head, I kept thinking, "Rich, old white guy, rich, old white guy." So there's something about his eyes; would she really look at him twice? And Rock is not good enough an actual ACTOR to help much. Jennifer Coolidge is embarrassing as the millionaire's trophy wife, but she can't be blamed with the inane stuff she has to do. Nobody else makes any impression. Still, it is amusing to see a Heaven that looks more like Studio 54 (complete with velvet rope that only admits "certain" people) than our usual perceptions of it, and again Rock has some good moments. At least, at less than 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome, which is more than can be said for a lot of "comedies" these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heaven Is Still Waiting....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Geeze, it's only been twenty-two years since we saw Warren Beatty come back to Earth in a millionare's body and wishes to play quarterback so the then Los Angeles Rams can win the Super Bowl. HEAVEN CAN WAIT was a remake of HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, but with it's funny script and good acting, it was fun. Now a remake of a remake is out, and it's DOWN TO EARTH. And like another remake of a remake (LAST MAN STANDING) you wonder why people even bother. But DOWN TO EARTH does have some enjoyable moments, but not enough to recommend it. Chris Rock (in Warren Beatty's place)stars as Lance Barton, a delivery boy who is trying to become a successful comedian. His agent, Whitney (Frankie Faison, in Jack Warden's role) says that he needs to work on his public skills. As Lance leaves Whitney, he keeps his eyes fixated on Suntee (Regina King, doing Julie Christie) which leads to Lance getting hit by a semi-truck, exactly like HEAVEN CAN WAIT. Lance meets angels Keyes (Eugene Levy, the Buck Henry role) and Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri, the James Mason role) who say that Lance can return to Earth in someone else's body. Yet, unlike HEAVEN CAN WAIT it doesn't explain on why Lance has to choose a different body. In HEAVEN CAN WAIT, Beatty character's body was creamated, Rock's it's part of the rules. So Lance returns in the body of a mega-millionare, with a cheating wife (Jennifer Coolidge-Dyan Cannon) and crooked assistant (Greg Germann-Charles Grodin) who were trying to kill the millionare. With Lance in the body of this powerful man, he tries to win the affection of Suntee by giving more to charity. And Lance in the body of a 55 year old man, who is balding and chubby, he makes a effort to perform at the closing of the Apollo Theater. In the meantime, the wife and assistant try another plan to kill the husband/boss. Seeing HEAVEN CAN WAIT before this, I saw the entire outline of this film before watching it. But what Paramount probably wants those who already seen HEAVEN to enjoy are the jokes. There are some funny jokes in the film that Rock delivers, and I enjoy Chris Rock a lot more than Martin Lawrence. But the best scenes is when Lance is acting like his normal self, weither it's making jokes about black people or head bopping to DMX. Lance sees Lance, the rest of the world sees this old chubby bald man making a fool of himself, which is a riot! And there are some clever jokes about the after life (i.e. Heaven is treated like a exclusive night club, a shabby man tries to get in, and Eugene Levy who's guarding the door tells the slacker to "go to hell." Chris Rock is likable and funny with his role. I also did enjoy love intrest Regina King, mixed up angel Eugene Levy, and manager Frankie Faison. But the other roles are a bit pointless and shallow, including Mark Addy's butler. Addy did succeed with THE FULL MONTY making Hollywood studio films, but it must be a curse, since the films he's appeared in were JACK FROST and FLINTSTONES VIVA ROCK VEGAS. I know that Jennifer Coolidge can do better, it showed in BEST IN SHOW. And Chazz Palminteri should give up comedy and just do straight dramas, leave the laughs to Robert De Niro. It surprised me that this was directed by Chris and Paul Weitz the men behind such funny films as ANTZ and the successful AMERICAN PIE. Both of those films showed intelligence and wit. But now that they have already made their mark in Hollywood, I don't think they are trying as hard anymore. DOWN TO EARTH isn't a bad film, but I can't reccommend it for theaters. Wait about a year from now, and watch some of the funny bits on cable television. Or just keep watching the commercials, they show the funny parts as well. **1/2 (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chris Rocks!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film er I mean movie was just what I needed on a rainy boring day. Chris Rock is the type of comedian that unless you have experienced his stand up, you have no real appreciation for. Rock is the only reason to see this flick. So please if you are not a fan of his, then see something else rather then giving this movie a bad rapport.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A so-so comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a so-so comedy with a lot of good performers in a mediocre film. This is a variation on something you have seen before - only done much better than this. By tone-ing down Chris Rock to get a PG-rating, he seems to be trying too hard and not succeeding. If you've seen the trailer you've practically seen the film and even more because some of the scenes in the trailer are not in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Biggest Sack of Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies, but this movie is just like my summary. The Biggest Sack of Crap ever. In the beginning, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who get stage fright at a Comedy Building called the Apollo. On his way home from a gig, while riding his BIKE he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a Truck. A little while later, he chooses the body of an old, white, and selfish millionaire. Then, he dresses up like the music group Outkast while trying to replay the scene from the original where he comes out as a Jockey. Second, he goes back to the Apollo, and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body and starts dissing the white population and tries to be black. Do you get my drift? This movie is awful it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a sack of crap. Just take my advice, don't even watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just sit back and laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found myself laughing at things that I would have found funny when I was 13. I still find movies like this entertaining, so I urge the viewers to watch this film in a 8th grade state of mind. Worth it for the fact that it doesnt have to make sense, all it has to do is make you laugh.7/10, B-, ** out of ****, 2.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Rock can't act. He needs to stick to stand up because he sucks in movies. He's just too annoying. This movie didn't make me laugh. There were a couple of silly things like the Gin and Juice song in the car that made me smile, but nothing would make you laugh out loud.FINAL VERDICT: Stay away from all Chris Rock films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third version of Harry Segall's play Heaven Can Wait. It was first made into the movie Here Comes Mr. Jordan in 1941. Warren Beatty and Ealine may reworked it into Heaven Can Wait in 1978. Now, Chris Rock and company take their script and make this film as a starring vehicle for him.It really doesn't matter whether it is Robert Montgomery or Warren Beatty or Chris Rock in the title role. The story is solid and it is interesting no matter which version tickles your funny bone.Both Montgomery and Beatty were nominated for Oscars for their work in their respective films. Beatty was also nominated for Best Director and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture. Mr Jordan earned an Oscar for Harry Seagall's story and for the screenplay by Sidney Buchman and Seton I. Miller. It also received Best Picture and best Director nominations. The story has a long history. Unfortunately, the only award for this version is an Image nomination for Regina King (Miss Congeniality 2: Armed &amp; Fabulous, Ray) as the women Rock was in love with.Beside Chris Rock, who I think is the funniest comedian out there, and King, we also see Chazz Paminteri (A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, The Usual Suspects) as "St. Peter": Eugene Levy (A Mighty Wind, Best in Show) as the bumbling assistant; Jennifer Coolidge (A Mighty Wind, For Your Consideration) as the adulterous, murdering wife; Mark Addy (The Full Monty) as the butler; and many more.It was directed by Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy).I don't know why this version didn't click like the other two. Maybe they should have waited a few more years so we would not compare it to the 1978 version. It was worth watching for the story, which never gets old, and the characters. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a mediocre comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Down to Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who gets hit by a truck. He goes to Heaven and he gets to get another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So Lance does a few things in the body of Charles. The movie has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done way better things than this. It will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really laugh-out-loud funny. You'll laugh to yourself and you might giggle, but you definitely won't be rolling on the floor laughing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is Chris Rock in this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Rock can be funny. He proves this in 'Lethal Weapon 4' and a little in the Kevin Smith movies he has starred in. Here he has made a terrible movie, a remake from 'Heaven Can Wait'. His character named Lance is a stand-up comedian, not a very good one, who wants to play in the final show in a theater that will be closed. He also has fallen in love with a girl named Sontee (Regina King) and than he dies. He ends up in heaven and finds out he was not supposed to die yet. The man who manages things in heaven (Chazz Palminteri) explains to him that he can return to earth but only in another body, one that has not been discovered dead yet. He returns as the very rich Charles Wellington III. The problem is that this guy is white and old and Lance still wants to do that final show and get the girl.It is the problem in the movie and the problem I have with the movie. The movie could have some possibilities if the guy really was played by an old white guy acting like a young black guy. Now we just see Chris Rock doing his things which is not very funny. The reactions of people around him are there to make us laugh but it just doesn't work. There are glimpses of Wellington played by an old white guy and it became instantly more funny. That is the problem I have with the comedy.There is also a problem with the old white guy getting the girl. We see Chris Rock kissing the girl and that seems perfectly normal but when you think of the old white guy kissing the same girl you know how wrong this movie has gone. Where Chris Rock is supposed to be the funny guy in the movie, in another movie some things probably would be funny, we have Palminteri and his helper played by Eugene Levy to save some parts of the movie. Just some parts, in the end this is just another stupid comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific and funny movie starring Chris Rock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DOWN TO EARTH, in my opinion, is a terrific and funny movie starring Chris Rock! It left a big smile on my face! The funniest things about this movie, in my opinion, were Lance's (Chris Rock - DOCTOR DOLITTLE, BOOMERANG) stand-up routines, especially the ones he did at the Apollo. If you ask me, that's the perfect place for a stand-up comic to do their routines. I thought that Sontee (Regina King - ENEMY OF THE STATE, A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE) looked VERY beautiful in all of the dressy clothing she wore, especially the attire she wore whenever she and Lance went out on a date. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Chris Rock and you haven't seen this terrific and funny movie starring him, I highly recommend it! You're in for a real treat and a lot of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.</fullReview>
