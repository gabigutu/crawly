		<shortDescription>Pokkiri, 80's American Action is Tamil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pokkiri, 80's American Action is Tamil! I think this is a remake of the Bollywood movie PoKiri. Similar name, but this one stars action superstar Vijay(My Fav Indian actor behind SRK).To go along with Vijay, there is Asin....possibly the most beautiful woman in the world.THis movie is 80's coolness. It has everything an action movie should have. A hero, who MIGHT be a bad guy, who might be a good guy, who might snuff out crime.Great wire work and great action scenes. America can learn from Indian movies. Apparently Indian action film directors were all 80's American movies lovers.Is Vijay a good or bad guy? Will he fulfill his mission? Will Asin stop loving him? This is another must watch, without ruining the plot, this is high on action, with over the top heroes like movies should/used to be.10 out of 10. I prefer this version because of Vijay and Asin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is sure to satisfy action thriller lovers. Plus points. Hero and Villain. Excellent casting. Chemistry between hero and heroine. Hair raising action. Racy script. Foot tapping songs. Excellent screenplay. Comedy except for the water joke. I dnt find any negative points. Everything perfectly placed. One of the biggest grossers. An overall showcase of Vijay. Perfectly planned by the director though its a remake. was better than the original Kannada movie which felt annoying . Hate Kannada movies which has no star value. Music has greatly contributed to the film which adds flavour to the scenes. This movie will be an evergreen one for Vijay and to people even who hate him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect ENTERTAINMENT...........................................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is Pokkiri remake of the Telugu blockbuster with the same title.Prabu Deva has retained most of the scenes with only minor changes.The casting is good.Prakash Raj and Nasser who acted in the original have done justice to their roles in the Tamil version too.Vijay fits the role well and so does Asin.Vadivel does good except for that stupid water joke.The chemistry between Vijay and Prakash Raj is great (just like in Ghilli).The scene where police restrain Prakash Raj from sleeping was fabulous.Songs are not that great.The only thing i didn't like this movie was with Vijay's mannerism in the movie.Most of his reactions in the movie were the same as in the original.I don't know if its the director or Vijay's idea,but it didn't work out well.Those who seen the Telugu version will find this little annoying.But for others - its a TREAT...........................</fullReview>
