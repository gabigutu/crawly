		<shortDescription>A complete Paisa Vasool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, when I saw the promos I had no expectations at all. But after watching Wanted, all I can say that it is a real nice movie. It takes you back to the glorious 80s, where our hero used to beat up dozens of gundas all alone, save his girlfriend from gundas, over the top mannerisms, etc. It is a perfect example of a old wine in a new bottle. The truth is that our Bollywood had lost its innocence, trying too hard to imitate the west, making so called art/serious movies aka parallel cinema. Masala movies were almost finished. But I hope this has revived them again, because the movie was very much enjoyable.Action scenes are OTT at times, but still enjoyable.It has some nice performances, but it is Sallu bhai that carries the movie on his shoulders. No other actor in Bollywood could have pulled the role with such an ease. Because of him you just overlook at the flaws.Ayesha Takia looks stunning and her chemistry with Sallu does work! Vinod is not given enough footage but manages to do well.Mahesh Manjrekar is brilliant. He was just too good at times. Typical corrupt lusty police officers. Scene where he is on his laptop or any other scene... Really good.Prakash Raj deserves special mention. He was just amazing as the DON. Amazing in the jail scenes!The twist in the movie was quite nice and not really expected. (as I haven't seen the original) There are some really funny scenes in first half as well =DThe movie has almost no story, but the screenplay was nice.The only thing that was quite annoying was the amount of unnecessary songs. It got boring, because It was like fight scene - song - fight scene - song... Just like those 80s movies, but quite exaggerated. I wish there were bit less songs.Best scenes:- Lift scene with Salman and Ayesha - All Mughal-e-Azam scenes - In the basketball court - Jail scenes with Don - Radhe asking for Jhanvi phone number in the train - Radhe ignoring Jhanvi - Where Rajeev Shikawat's identity is revealed - The scene where Don meets Srikanth Shikawat (Vinod Khanna)and many more. I can say that most of the scenes (except the scenes with the landlord - the guy was funny in beginning but got annoying by the end) are really good and most of them are memorable.In one word, it is a PAISA VASOOL. Leave your brains at home, watch and enjoy with friends.8/10 (revival of the glorious 80s)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghajini is so 2008......!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first ever movie review on IMDb. I am a huge movie buff but too lazy to post my views about them here. Finally, I am writing for my Superstar, our Superstar, India's Superstar, The Only Superstar - Salman Khan.I just returned from the night show and boy I was entertained. I have been Salman's fan since his very first flick - Maine Pyar Kiya. I think I am his biggest fan alive. Have seen Andaz Apna Apna over 35 times and still watch it whenever I have the time. But, Salman's recent movies were heartbreakingly disappointing. Like many of his other fans too I was praying and hoping that Wanted would deliver much much and much much more.I was not disappointed this time and boy am I happy at that. The movie starts off well and holds its pace throughout. All the characters played their parts well. The songs were good, although I was disappointed at Ishq Vishq being cut off. The fight sequences were mind blowing. Ayesha looked cute as ever. Overall I would give Wanted a 10/10 as it has everything that a Bollywood movie buff and hardcore Salman fan would expect.Some people think that they are too far above the so called "Masses". For them, movies for the masses are not good enough and they feel ashamed to praise such a movie, coz it does not have SRK dancing around a girl in foreign locations. For me, Wanted is a superb film, even if it's for the masses - I am a part of the masses - ain't I. Still these over the moon film critics go to see - "Ayesha Takia's big, big goodies" which for them - "are a treat to watch."Finally, Ghajini (with due respect to it) looks so 2008 now ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of you must be knowing that 'Wanted' is remake of Telugu 'Pokiri'. The Telugu version was itself a great.. so any remake will be delighting. And Prabhu Deva has not made much wear and tear to its original version. That makes 'Wanted' a full entertaining movie. After watching the first show, I expect most will like it and hopefully Salman's wanted will turn out to be a super-hit. Acting was awesome. Most of the crew have performed their role to perfection. Ayesha Takia was at her best. Prakash Raj has proved again and again that he can play any role flawless. Better can be expected from a star like Salman Khan. The bar of expectation risen high enough by a near perfect Mahesh Babu in the original 'Pokiri'. Salman has not done bad anyway. Songs do dishearten. Last but not the least the plot is superb that makes this movie so wonderful. My verdict: a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i watched the movie i expected a lot as i am a big fan of Salman Khan. The story of the movie moves along at a good pace, and you never really guess what is going on until it happens. I don't want to give away too much for those people who haven't watched the movie. Aisha Takia looks sexy as always, in my opinion she is very under rated in the business.is a story that will not be new to most regular bollywood movie watchers the twist is very good.Salman Khan looks very big in the movie and they show him as a Herculean man who can beat up any1. this look suits salman very well.Overall it is a movie which i would recommend it has some good action sequences and the story is also quite entertaining.</fullReview>

A masala film that's aimed at the masses. This is for fans and foes of Salman Khan... Fans, rejoice, Salman is back with a vengeance with WANTED. This is his deadliest performance to date. Foes won't be able to lash out at him or pick on him or launch a vicious tirade this time. The spate of flops should come to a grinding halt with WANTED.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Action and Romantic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a surprise in waiting ? good action movie that will keep you seated in your seat and make you enjoy watching it. A arrogant, ruthless, sharp shooter and a gangster, who works for a "Don," on his own terms and has no emotions, becomes a killing machine as he starts killing his boss's enemies but then he sees a beautiful woman. At the same time he has enemies.Starring Salman Khan, Ayesha Takia, Mahesh Manrekar, Vinod Khanna, Om Puri and Sayaji Shinde, this is directed by Prabhudeva and is produced by Boney Kapoor. The music score is provided by Sajid Wajid while Salim Suleiman also provide a good back ground score. Anil Kapoor and Govinda make a special appearance.The first half contains some comedy along with romance and action and this makes it a good combination to watch but the second half is more action orientated. Salman Khan has suited the role very well and it makes it a change to see him in action after a long time, though he does remove his shirt, while Ayesha Takia, has improved once again. The other actors also make a good contribution to this movie as does Vinod Khanna in a supporting role and whose character really pushes the story to its climax. Some songs are memorable and are worth listening to and the cinematography is also worth watching.Director Prabhudeva has done a good job in directing this romantic, action movie with added small dose of comedy.Some may find this too violent but it is a movie that can be watched with your family and is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prabhudeva's unstoppable force - Salman Khan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanted is Salman Khan's most definitive statement to the film world. If ShahRukh Khan can give an Om Shanti Om and Aamir Khan can give a Ghajini to the masses, he can give something even more explosive and entertaining. Yes, Salman Khan tops other Khans in this South Indian film inspired - action packed explosion that is directed by Prabhudeva, the accomplished choreographer. Salman doesn't have his over-the-top accent or his fake tears to accompany him in this venture that takes him from a tapori to a ruthless terminator of the underworld. Wanted is exaggerated, preposterous and laughable but that is exactly what it was meant to be. Prabhudeva has strong roots in South Indian cinema where action is fast paced with jerky camera motions that send everyone flying high but to incorporate all this into an entertaining movie deserves some pat on his back. He may not be a renowned film maker but he knows exactly what it takes to deliver an explosive action movie and boy does he do it in style!Radhe (Salman Khan) is a tapori who can commit himself to any task for the money involved to the extent that he wouldn't even listen to himself and he means it. Ayesha Takia is his love interest that never gets in his way of killing goons and fighting his way through the day. Where the heroine of a film can easily distract the plot and hero, Prabhudeva manages to keep her role restricted to songs and light hearted relief after a heavy doze of action. Just like his character, Salman Khan is a one man army in the movie. His performance, action and even Prabhudeva - choreographed dancing is the heart and soul of the film. Wanted is easily one of his best performances that has encompassed all that he is capable of doing (excluding comedy). While the romantic breaks and songs are nothing more than a restroom or samosa break for the viewer, the action is relentless and even though it is over-the-top in typical South Indian film style, it is nevertheless, kick-ass and ruthless! If Hollywood can be proud of Tarantino's Kill Bill style of action, then we must be proud of Prabhudeva's version of stylized action. We are not talking about realistic fight sequences or martial arts but of what we remember Sunny Deol's movies for - ruthless, high octane, one man show of just knocking the man down with fists, kicks, guns or whatever comes in our hero's hands. There is no mercy in showcasing blood and gore because when we see Salman Khan all charged up to deliver the other guy straight to hell, we can see him as the Terminator without an automatic weapon. He is an unstoppable force who is not deterred by Police, gangs, underworld, knives, guns or sharp objects. He just flings them right back in Rajnikant style and that is what makes this movie even more enjoyable. Just go watch it with this notion in mind that it is a Rajnikant style action film but made in Bollywood with Salman Khan taking on whatever comes in his way and you shall then be entertained.Prabhudeva leaves no chapter out from the book of 'how to make a masala movie' with a non-stop delivery of excitement with occasional humour, romance, songs, drama, reality, action and unbelievable heroics. He makes Salman perform every ritual that we can expect and not expect. Who knew that the 'sturdy' Salman could dance with such flexibility and style in love me?? He acts fearless against the biggest Don, challenges and embarrasses Policemen, reaches Andheri station even before the train gets there, is available wherever his need arises, shows no mercy to anyone who inflicts harm upon his family or his loved one and yes, of course, he takes his shirt off while doing so as well! The film may be a bit too long and the random songs on international hotspots maybe unwarranted but when we see Salman as an unstoppable force, we know it's clobbering time! Salman hasn't lost his position in Bollywood and with Wanted, he asserts himself in the most convincing manner. The masses will love it because the film was made for them but overall, it's entertainment that comes with its warnings. Prabhudeva, from down South, delivers what many Hindi film directors have failed on countless attempts. An entertaining action flick with all the masala to add to your popcorn.-7.44 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its heart in the right place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not the masterpiece Salman Khan fans proclaim it to be, Wanted is definitely one of the better masala films to come out in ages. I say this not due to the lack of masala films because of the pretentiousness that has overcome Hindi cinema in producing "realistic" cinema, but because Wanted is truly one of the better masala films to come out in the past few years. People have claimed this to be Salman's best performance but I respectfully disagree. This definitely is one his better performances in the past few years, but Salman can be an extraordinary actor under the right circumstances as is evident from Andaz Apna Apna. The actors are all doing what they are supposed to be, but none of them truly excel. However, what truly impressed me about this film is its confidence in what it wants to show us, and its self awareness about how ridiculous it is. This is especially evident during the shining teeth scene as well as the talked about scene with Prakash Raj. I won't spoil them for you here, but take my word for it; THEY ARE FRICKIN HILARIOUS. Secondly, the action scenes as with the rest of the movie are amazingly ridiculous when it comes to realism, but they are ridiculously fun nonetheless.Coming to the flaws, well it is ridiculous and despite it knows it is and even makes fun of itself, there is no denying that it is distracting. Also, the plot is wafer thin. However, the twist in the end in my opinion more than does its share in setting the plot apart. All of this adds up to one thing, Wanted is ridiculously preposterous but what sets it apart is that it knows it. Not only should Salman fans watch this, but so should everyone else to get a real sense of a masala film done right. (In regards with Ghajini VS Wanted that seems to circling the media these days, I believe Wanted to be the better film. Firstly, because as far as I know, it is not a rip off, and secondly, despite they are both unabashed about their OTT ness, Wanted has a sense of self awareness and heart that is unfortunately sorely lacking in Hindi cinema these days.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Entertaining Films of 2009!!! I've only seen the last hour but this...Must Be Watched by Americans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was like an Indian Shoot Em Up. The last hour was ridiculously entertaining. I'm American, I sneaked into this film because I heard an Indian music number and wanted to check it out. I ended up sitting down and watching the final hour of the film because it was immensely hilarious. I walked into a music number and there was another music number about 10 minutes later but that was it, as far as the final hour of the film goes. I have a feeling I missed a lot of the soundtrack, but who cares. I laughed so hard from when I sat down until the end. Don't even get me started at the freeze frame of Salman Khan's face at the end looking at the scrolling credits. Salman Khan's hair blowing randomly as he is killing people in a warehouse was genius. The rape scene was also unintentionally hilarious. The fact they kept calling each other "scoundrel" was quote worthy. This was also pretty violent and bloody for an Indian film. I'm going back to see the first 80 minutes. This movie was top notch entertainment. If you like over the top action and movies that won't bore the crap out of you, I recommend you see this...NOW! Comedy gold times fifteen. HOW DARE YOU NOT FIND THIS COMMENT USEFUL!!!UPDATE: I went to go see the rest of the film and the whole thing was enjoyable. Good chemistry between the leads and Salman Khan looks like a cross between Raul Julia and Javier Bardem. I was convinced it was Raul Julia back from the grave. As Salman was beating everyone up I couldn't resist to yell out "Get 'Em Raul!" Really entertaining film and the intermission was gold. Aladin October 30th, now back to the film. Oh, and the dedication to that random lady at the very start was hilarious and the endless production company logos. GET 'EM RAUL!!!! Next time I go to Bonefish Grill...I'm not ordering the salmon, I'm ordering the Salman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prabhu Deva's 'Wanted' is strictly, strictly, strictly meant for the hoi polloi.Remake of a Telugu hit,'Wanted' reminds of 80's cinema of bollywood. Fights, Violence... Songs, Romance, Emotional Melodrama, ha 'Wanted' is so outdated. But no doubt, a film like 'Wanted' still manages an audience, as mentioned the film is aimed for the masses &amp; only them. The clap-worthy one-liners, the mar-dhard... all this is pleasing, for them at least.On the flip side, There's hardy any story. One fight scene, One song, One fight scene, One song. A wafer-thin plot that gets dragging, especially post interval. Plus, the violence and chillam-chili is too much after a certain point. Songs are good to hear, but pop-up for no reason.Performances: Salman is as usual, though his continuity is inconsistent. In songs he sports long hair, while other-wise a military cut. Ayesha Takia's big, big goodies are a treat to watch. Mahesh Manjrekar is fantastic as the conniving cop. Prakash Raj is funny, especially in the scene when he tries to escape from the cops, the aftermath is truly hilarious. Vinod Khanna deserved more footage. Inder Kumar, Sajid &amp; Kader Khan's son are good in their parts. Mahek looks hot. Manoj Phawa tries hard to make you laugh, but succeeds at times nevertheless. Assem Merchant, Raju Mawani &amp; others are okay.on the whole, watch 'Wanted'... but don't forget to leave your brains at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanted too good- Rhadey is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Salman reprises his role as Rhadey and boost his dying career again in my opinion. Its time for Prem to take a break and Rhadey to break bones and set new trends in bollywood.This film wonderfully crafted and the actors and actress do an amazing job. I do applaud Vinod Khanna, the forever hard man of Bollywood. The scenario's are nicely collated the affects suit the genre of the film and the acting does justice to the characters.Like all of bollywood films and the big stars excluding Amir Khan the acting has become poor as they expect hits from their simple appearance in a film. This is true on the majority of films as most bollywood movie fans adopt a favourite actor and will no matter what what their films. In my household we have Akshay Kumar and Shahrukh fans - no matter how bad the film, reviewed it must be watched at cinema.I think this film will bring Salman closer to success as he will regain confidence in his acting and will make more an effort to deliver.This type of movie differs from conventional Indian movies and thus creates a new market which salman possibly akshay could exploit further and enhance their acting to what it once was.I would love to give this film 10/10 but there were moments were it could have been enhanced even further for the action fans of bollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wanted.... a movie many of us have been waiting for. It has already been declared the biggest blockbuster of 2009. I just got back from this movie and I just have to say one thing : THIS, is what Salman Khan is about!One movie in which you get it all! ; Marvelous acting, awesome comic timing, fantastic dance moves, good performed action!All done by the one and only Salman Khan!Let me start off telling about the story, though it's not the best ever story around, the story is good. Different than the usual boy-meets-girl stories. The story is about gangs and the underworld dons v/s each other v/s the police. Prabhudeva proves he not only has dance talent, but also amazing story telling abilities. The story was told very differently, other than the usual underworld movies bollywood has produced (Sanjay Dutt movies. The movie has a lot of comic moments, they were not over the top.. just perfect enough to make you laugh! Though I have a slight complaint against the songs that just popped op at places, the melodious music and great choreography made me forget the problem.Ayesha Takia hasn't forgotten how to act for sure, she not only looks great, but acts very well too! I sure hope this lady continues acting even though there are rumours about her quitting acting.Prakash Raj as Ghani Bhai has done the role very convincingly. The scene where he's not supposed to sleep is simply hilarious!Mahesh Manjrekar is effective as the very corrupt bastard cop. He ones again proves how versatile he is.And now... SALMAN KHAN... the man that made this movie what it is. Wanted is a pure Salman movie, the movie shines because of him. He's done the role exceptionally well. Though Salman hasn't seen many commercial successes the past few years.. I personally believe things will go very smooth for him post Wanted! I am very satisfied with Wanted and look forward to Salmans future releases! THUMBS UP WANTED!P.S. Wanted.. Salmans comeback vehicle? Hell no, are you telling me he was gone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of 2009</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read the reviews about the film (mostly favorable), I had high expectations about it, and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. Prabhudeva, the dancing guru, starting his career as a director with a bang.It's all about this hardcore gangster Radhe (Salman Khan), who can just about kill anyone who gets in his way. He is working for Don Gani (Prakash Raj). Later, he meets Jhanvi (Ayesha Takia), and eventually they fall in love with each other. Then, the film takes an unpredictable turn of events, to the climax, which is absolutely amazing.Salman Khan, in his second best performance to date (first being Andaaz Apna Apna), really carries the film on his shoulders with the gangster image. He should really stick to roles like this one. Ayesha Takia does a good job as Jhanvi. Prakash Raj essays the role of Gani Bhai, was OK in the first half as we didn't get to see a lot of him, but does a fantastic job in the second half. Mahesh Manjrekar is good as the corrupt cop. Vinod Khanna is OK, and the guy who play Sonu Gates in the film is brilliant as the comic character.The action is fantastic, being compared to that of Ghajini's, which was fantastic as well. Direction was good, and everything was good.But the biggest let-down was the music. Although some of them pretty catchy (Love me, Love me, Jalwa etc), I felt they weren't really required in the film. The story is OK, so if you are looking for any logic in the film, don't bother showing up. This is an all out action packed film.This should be the best movie of 2009, but will be tough, as there are other really good films like Kaminey and Love aaj kal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie itself is a good piece of work. The dialogues are good and so is the script. You have to remember that it is a remake of the Telegu film Pokiri, but i feel it does justice to the original. Nobody could have played the leading role played by mahesh babu in 'pokiri' better than Salman Khan, who the only action hero in bollywood at present. This is the career best for Ayesha Takia, who plays the female lead in this film. Others such as Vinod Khanna, Govind Namdeo and Prakash Raj are also good in the film. The music is also decent. The two tracks that stand out are 'Jalwa' and 'Love me love me'. The dialogues, delivered in typical fashion by Salman Khan, are also good. As an action fan, i really liked it.My verdict: unmissable for Salman and action fans. 9.5/10</fullReview>

And this movie proves it very well.Prabhudheva, who also directed the Tamil remake Pokkiri (2007),that featured my favorite Tamil actor Vijay, has managed to could the south Indian masala for the north Indian audiences very well. The film is simply the best one of Salman,who is the show stealer throughout the entire movie. The fights and music too are mind blowing and won't let you rise from the seat,until it's over. The film has showcased Salman in a definitely new avatar,which we had never seen before. Really,this is one of the best action entertainers of all time.On the whole, Wanted is the best film of Salman Khan and also is a perfect masala entertainer. A definite entertainer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Salman Khan after a disappointing 2008 starts 2009 on a good note. Wanted released after GTGH and Yuvraaj, this film became a super hit at the box office. However, after this success eluded him till Dabangg(2010). The movie was directed by Veteran dancer Prabhu Deva and scripted by Puri Jagganath who directed Bbudha Hoga Tera Baap.Wanted tells the story of Radhe a hit-man who works for anyone who pays him money. There are 2 opposing gangs, and Radhe works for one of them. There is inspector Ashraf Khan who swears to get rid of crime once and for all in Mumbai. There is Jhanvi who falls for Radhe but doesn't like his profession. There is also Talpade a very bad inspector who works for Gani Bhai the don and main villain. Gani Bhai get's his rivals killed after which his gang nabs the commissioners daughter. From her, they come to know that there is an undercover cop in their gang. There is a huge twist and watch the film to find out who the officer is and how Gani Bhai and his people end up dead in the climax.The story is not novel but the movie is not bad for a Masala entertainer. There are hardcore action scenes as well as many comic and light hearted scenes. The movie shifts well from the violent action scenes to the light hearted scenes which is a good thing. The entire Radhe-Pavle track and the Radhe-Gani Bhai track is well handled. The dialogs are good and solid one liners are what Masala Entertainers require for applause. Masses went crazy for this film and Salman's career got a good 2009 start with this film.Direction by Prabhu Deva is good, he handles many scenes well and he has also danced well in the Jalwa song. His direction works well because his direction also made sure the tempo of the film is well maintained. The story keeps you focused and the twist nearing the end is brilliantly handled.Sajid Wajid's music is good. While the Dil Leke, Love Me, and Jalwa are good songs, the rest are just fillers. Action is superb though the overdose of violence is a bit too much. The violence is the main reason the film got an A Certificate. However, the movie still rocks because the action scenes are superb. Dialogs are a major plus point, they entertain all the way and applause are guaranteed. EK BAAR JO MAINE COMMITEMENT KAR DI, MEIN APNI AAP KA BHI NAHI SUNTA dialog is superb.Salman Khan is the USP of this film, he does a fantastic job, his action, his dialogs, his expressions all are brilliantly portrayed. Ayesha Takia does good as the heroine, she has more to do than any other heroine in these kind of movies. Mahesh Manjrekar is a corrupt cop and he does a good job portrayed his role. Prakash Raj is hilarious as the villain, however he did better in Singham. The rest provide good support.On the whole, Wanted is another Salman Khan action film which broke many records and ruled at the box office. It is good to see Salman do these kind of films but what would've been better is the actions scenes were less violent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanted mainly works because of Salman Khan's charisma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanted directed by Prabhu Deva is an entertaining movie which presents Salman Khan,never-like before.Wanted is very high on entertainment but unfortunately low on providing a good story.Story: Mumbai-based middle-classed Jhanvi (Ayesha Takia), who lives with her widowed mother and younger brother, has three suitors. The first is much older and considerably overweight - Sonu Gates (Manoj Pahwa). The second is Police Inspector Talpade (Mahesh Manjrekar), who is already married to Nandini, but lusts after Jhanvi so much so that he creates circumstances that will force her to marry him. The third is a male named Radhey (Salman Khan) - who often comes to her rescue - but breaks her heart when she finds out who is really is - a cold-blooded killer who works for a gangster named Gani Don (Prakash Raj). The later is a ruthless gangster who challenges Police Commissioner Ashraf Taufeeq Khan (Govind Namdeo) with impunity, and even abducts his daughter to ensure his personal safety.The story is basic so even the twists and turns will not be a shocker to you.But still apart from story,WANTED works for its high-octane action,unlimited entertainment and Salman Khan.The direction is fine.Performances: Salman Khan is excellent.Ayesha Takia is cute.Mahesh Manjrekar is first-rate.Prakash Raj is superb.Manoj Pahwa fails to provide any laughs.All in all,WANTED must be watched only for Salman Khan and for nothing else.I am giving it a six on ten.Strictly recommended for fans of Salman Khan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Controversial Khan's answer to Ghajini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Owing to the fact that I have watched the original (masterpiece?), my review would be less of an opinion and oscillating towards comparison. &#x6e9; Salman Khan:: The Radhey (from Tere Naam) perhaps was the prerequisite for Salman to earn this role. And he justifies well given his constraints of his style and persona. &#x6e9; Ayesha Takia:: The miss-goody-two-shoes seems to try too hard to appear coy and the penny drops at many places. &#x6e9; Prateekha Lonkar:: Pity this "Iqbal" mother had barely any scenes in the movie.&#x6e9; Manoj Pahwa:: Apt choice in comparison to the original version ? but pity the track was edited out completely.&#x6e9; Vinod Khanna:: Its appalling to see the quality and the size of the roles he is reduced to. &#x6e9; Mahesh Manjrekar:: As usual he is reliable and effectively delivers the sleazy and gullible police officer with perfection. Wonder why the original Ashish Vidyarthi was not considered. &#x6e9; Govind Namdeo:: Was adequate but as mentioned above why the the original Sayaji Shinde was considered. In fact both above were spot on in their original roles and linguistic skills wasn't a constraint either.&#x6e9; Prakash Raj:: He is the only one who reprises the same role in both versions. "Wanted" gives him ample scope to display his histrionics to Bollywood audience and who knows he might be the next Big Baddie in the offing!The action are hard hitting and delivered with a punch. The good thing about Prabhudeva holding the directorial reigns is that he put special effort on Salman Khan's dancing skills. Sadly if the music could compliment equally ? the results would have been set aflame the countdowns on the music video channels. On that note, what difference would it had made if the original director Puri Jagannath was asked to deliver goods instead? Lastly, the original made a dent in the Telugu cinema and "Wanted" comes about 60% tops. Recommend to lay hands on the DVD of "Pokiri" with English subs at the first instance to discover sacrosanct can get lost in translation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good old Bollywood Action Hero is back in form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's good news for the real Bollywood fans, the common man, living out of the metros in small cities, towns and villages. Salman Khan brings back to them their good old action cinema with the same punches and enthusiasm which got lost in the new age glossy kind of movies in the recent years. The angry young man is back on the screen bashing all the bad men real hard. And it was indeed a lot of fun and relief to see a true Bollywood kind of movie after a long time stuffed with our own trademark action, fights, love, dance and songs.Remake of "Pokiri" already made in Telugu and Tamil, "Wanted" starts off normally with a mention of Mumbai underworld nexus and a newly appointed honest Police Commissioner in the town. Salman Khan makes a routine entry as the usual filmy action hero who works for the underworld dons and is known for his killer instincts and attitude. After a few slow initial moments, the movie starts growing on you gradually and holds a strong grip over the viewer till the intermission. Especially the confronting scene at the basket ball court between Salman and Mahesh Manjrekar sets the mood in and you start enjoying the movie from there on.The explosive second half is a real treat for the action lovers where Salman beats and kills uncountable men left and right with a great confidence. Here you witness the good old cinema of Bollywood Heroism back on screen where the Macho Man is hitting more than 20 men on the screen among the loud roar of claps and shouts from the audiences. Later we even have a suspense element added towards the climax which though is predictable but still adds more spirit to the highly violent fight sequence in the end.Salman shows great attitude in his highly brutal act and also looks very cool in his casual shirts &amp; denims. His emotional scenes with Ayesha Takia are equally convincing and enjoyable. Thinking about his amazing action scenes in the movie, you just cannot imagine anyone else doing more justice to the role other than Salman himself. Here, I would also like to mention, one highly appreciable scene in the movie where Salman Khan strongly criticizes his close friend for eating "Gutka". That was indeed a very commendable effort from the actor to save many lives from this highly famous killing habit in the youth today.Ayesha as the leading lady unexpectedly gives a spirited performance in the movie and is not just there for adding glamour. Mahesh Manjrekar, as the corrupt cop, deserves a special mention for his scenes providing the right momentum to the movie. Govind Namdeo suits the role of Police Chief perfectly but Vinod Khanna is completely wasted in an unimportant role. Mahek Chahal is there as the vamp and Manoj Pahwa tries to make you laugh with his not so entertaining getup.Sajid Wajid come up with a couple of good numbers enjoyable on the screen (with a special appearance of Govinda &amp; Anil Kapoor), otherwise the movie could easily do without so many songs. Action is the main asset of the movie, getting the much needed support from its Cinematographer. Story wise, "Wanted" has nothing new to offer, but after a long time, Indian Common Man gets a pure MASALA Movie to enjoy on the lines of highly successful action movies released a few decades back. I would even like to rate "Wanted" better than "Ghajini" since it does not take help of any additional (memory) gimmicks added deliberately in the script.Surprisingly, this hardcore action movie comes from the director "Prabhu Deva" who is more famous in Hindi Cinema for his amazing dance movements. And quite unpredictably, he delivers a highly entertaining flick especially for the single screen theater viewers, who simply love Bollywood movies as one of the most important passions of their lives. The critiques may find it over the top and the thinking viewer may take it as a routine flick with a weak script. But if you are not among any of these, then just go for this engaging action drama and enjoy the three hours in the dark with your friends. It's pure Bollywood for the masses, coming back to the silver screen after a long time. At least, it is not a usual inspired movie from the west for a change.In a nutshell, if you loved watching Amitabh in "Deewar" &amp; Sunny Deol in "Ghayal", then here is another equally entertaining act by the still young &amp; angry Salman Khan. "Wanted" is undoubtedly among his most hard hitting and enjoyable movies till date with a different Salman altogether as never seen before. So, just go for it now and have a great time with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanted, from director Prabhu Deva, has a bit of everything, and like a puzzle it takes a while to put everything together.The run time is quite long at around 2 hours and 20 minutes, but take away the music videos and it shortens to 2 hours. The fast pacing of the scenes and the various subplots come and go in entertaining fashion; however, with all that is going on, it is a bit difficult to get a firm grasp on the plot itself.The 5 musical pieces take advantage of luxurious settings and lots of dance choreography. The songs themselves can be catchy and most are upbeat dance numbers.The action is a lot of wire work stunts and camera effects. The violence, while not excessively bloody, is gruesome when it comes to the deaths and major hits. This is a bit of a surprise when comparing to the other elements of the film.The acting is good for what it is, as the characters are more on the unconventional side. Salman Khan is a believable thuggish hero and Ayesha Takia is enticing just with her gorgeous looks.When all is said and done, the romantic flirting, quirky side characters, and action somehow mesh together into one film known as Wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanted Entertainment !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wanted a good, plain entertaining film; no baggage attached". The ad is doing the rounds for quite some time but hardly find any takers. But if you keep all mindless and illogical things aside, film Wanted fitted the bill and that too quite perfectly. A remake of Tamil hit Pokhiri, which Producer Boney Kapoor mounted on a large canvass and débutant director (for Hindi films) ace-choreographer cum dancer Prabhu dheva handled deftly, crafted neatly with lot of panache.Salman Khan is in top form and his whole persona is used to the hilt by his trademark mannerisms. In Prakash raj, Hindi film audience has found a new menacing Villain who finally wins everybody's hatred and you want him to get bashed up in the end. Mahesh Manjrekar also played corrupt cop that you love to hate. After a long time, ace stunt coordinator Vijyan from south has done a Hindi film and he surprises you. It is Major a stunt film but the gore, the blood shed and raw violence is spared by executing the action sequences quite stylishly and using good acrobatics &amp; effects. . The best thing is this genre is being re-discovered and some film makers are exploring new dimensions in it. Hence, it is not your routine dhishoom dhishoom kind of yuck cinema. It is feel good cinema. It is fast paced and crisp. The film is again rooted in underworld but rather than going into the usual bhaigiri grim stuff, here whole treatment is light. Nevertheless it is more like stuff from the south but minus the usual melodrama, thankfully. Be it songs or dances (though unnecessary for narrative), humor or drama, there is something for those also who are not die hard action film buffs. The clever, witty one liners are smartly used in dialogs.All in all a well scripted, directed, photographed &amp; acted film.. Isn't it something that you have always WANTED ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salman's turning point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pre Wanted Salman Khan gave a series of flops when he either did comic roles or romantic roles, post PARTNER Salman's films like Yuvvraj, God Tussi Great Ho, Heroes flopped at the B.O. Post Ghajini which was an official South Remake again there was a craze for South remakes and hence Prabhu Devaa remade Telugu superhit Pokiri which had Mahesh Babu in the lead.It was also remade in Tamil What do I say of this film? Well Salman reprises his Radhe Mohan Tere Naam role, incidentaly his name also is Radhe, He hangs around with the same sidekick Sarfaraz Khan In 1 scene he also beats up the same goon from Tere Naam and has the same hairstyle, Tere Naam was also a remake of Tamil film Sethu. The film is almost entirely copied from Pokiri, just a few changes done to suit Hindi Cinema. Don't look for logic, but the preclimax does an about turn and leaves several loopholes like why Vinod Khanna always detested Salman before ? There's no proper flow in the story, In fact no continuity Salman's hairstyles too keep changing throughout The comedy involving Manoj Pahwa is terribleDirection by Prabhu Devaa is good in parts but the writing isn't strong enough Music by Sajid Wajid is typical, Love Me was a hit song those days, Most songs look like South reproductions however Dil Leke is the best song and also LeLe Le Mazaa LeSalman Khan looks fresher in many scenes unlike those days, his acting is okay though compared to Mahesh Babu he lacks behind but then Salman's fans like to see him in this avtar Ayesha Takia got her first bollywood hit, actingwise she is alright This film was a turning point for South talented Prakash Raj who got immense praise though he just did the same from Pokiri. He kept doing similar roles post this film, he is superb Amongst rest Mahek who was earlier seen in Nayee Padosan tries hard, Inder Kumar is okay, Sarfaraz Khan hardly gets scope, Vinod Khanna is nothing great Mahesh Manjerekar is okay, Manoj Pahwa annoys</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>watchable...but originals were much better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie directed by Prabhu Deva is a direct copy of a same director directed Tamil movie 'Pokkiri' starring Joseph Vijay which was a direct copy of another Telugu movie directed by Puri Jagannath starring Mahesh Babu called 'Pokiri'. All these movies are same but my personal favorite is the one with Joseph Vijay, the Tamil one. First one was was too stale for me though it was the biggest hit of telugu industry ever and wanted was too passive for me as i always feel that Salman really deserves a good night's sleep and need to work more on his screen presence. He looks tired and that's what ruins the whole fun of watching him. He has good body, good body and massive fanfare so i think he should respect that. Sanjay Manjeraker is good too and i guess he has done roles like this so much now that he is used to of doing it and looks effortless. Ayesha takia is what every heroine in action film is, a filler and OK. All and all a good an entertaining film that will make you feel that your money is went worth but you will be left desired for more. though there is a remedy, go watch south Indian remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay i guess because of the action and villain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now i had a lot of hype watching this movie because Salman khan finally doing an action movie but that changed i mean salman khan looks like he didn't even wanna do the movie and the chemistry between him and Ayesha Takia was like a brother and sister kind of relationship. The action was good though and the show stealer was the guy who played the villain played by Prakash Raj he had some catchy dialogues and lastly the songs were pretty good. The movie lastly had no plot just about two gangs and then salman khan has to save them Ayesha Takia from the gang.The other villain role was okay to whose with Prakash Raj hes kind of slick and smart criminal but I liked Prakash Raj better because he was just to awesome. Lastly songs were good but i think Salman khan is getting to old to be dancing like that. So I thought the movie was okay because of the Prakash Raj, the action, and I guess the songs but NOT because of Salman khan. I'll give it a 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>maybe for Indian audiences it is OK...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>but for me, even though I watch Hindi and other Indian films, this is mediocre. I don't approve of such nonsense, with no story, mindless scenes, and forced "masala" which most Indian audiences may fall head over heels for. This fim is a representation of Indian cinema at it's worst and the fact that it was a blockbuster makes me wonder whether the audiences have been dumbed down. Films like "Singh is Kinng", Kambakkt Ishq", "Partner", "Housefull", "Blue", "Do Knot Disturb", along with other old fashioned and badly made films like "We Are Family", Kurbaan, Lamhaa, make me lose faith in the industry. Some people that have seen bollywood their whole lives may find these films to be OK. Films like Udaan, Tere Bin Laden, and LSD are films that are well made and deserve a larger audience but the world of stars, foreign locations, etc is ruining everything.Salman Khan stars in wanted. It takes place in a nice foreign location(at least the dance sequences), there is no proper, scripted story. Unfortunately it seems as if this is what the audiences want. No story, just entertainment. No wonder there are still "boy meets girl" films coming out from all the major production companies that take place outside India. Don't people get sick of this since it has been happening since the 90's and even earlier. The next film is "Anjaana Anjaani". Recently there was also "I hate love stories"...This formulaic crap is killing the industry.</fullReview>

It's like a Bollywood spoof of 'Hollywood's Wanted' I cannot believe that anyone recommended this movie to me, it's a joke right. And let us not even get into the fact that Salman Khan can't dance. The funniest scene ever was when they brought out Anil Kapoor to come and dance with Salman at the beginning of the film (talk about the blind leading the blind). The only good thing about the film for me was the quality in which it was shot and Govinda's cameo (IN THE VERY BEGINNING).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it only if you are a die-hard Salman Khan fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Salman Khan-starrer Wanted is a film that makes no bones, no pretences about the fact that it'll do anything to get a reaction out of you. It's loud, vulgar, offensive, violent, cold-blooded, dumb, and silly. But that's all part of the design. Salman stars as a glum hit-man-for-hire named Radhe who, for the right price, will bump off rival gang-members like he's snapping twigs. Radhe can take as many as 10 to 12 scoundrels at a time; he dodges bullets, leaps across scaffoldings, and smashes through glass panes without so much as a scratch. In between such nefarious activities, Radhe's eyes fall on a middle-class girl named Janhavi (played by Ayesha Takia), who is drawn to his rakish charm. The city, meanwhile, is gripped by a surge of crime; rival gangs attack each other in broad daylight, cops are mixed with crooks, and the body count keeps rising. When criminal kingpin, and head of the gang that Radhe works for, Gani (played by Tamil actor Prakash Raj) arrives from his secret hideout in the far East, hoping to settle scores with a friend-turned-foe, the police swings into action. Even as Janhavi fobs off the advances of a lecherous, corrupt cop (played by Mahesh Manjrekar), a sudden unexpected twist takes everyone by surprise. A shrewd, old-fashioned entertainer that plays to the galleries, Wanted is exaggerated and formulaic, but relies squarely on the charm of its leading man to pull off its over-the-top tone. The good news is, Salman Khan appears to be having a rollicking good time. He throws himself completely into the film's visceral action portions, which include scenes of gruesome stabbings, bone-crunching freefalls and ear-drum splitting shootouts. He even puts his casual, laidback style of dialogue delivery to good use in the film's romantic and comic scenes. There's a running joke in the film that involves Ayesha Takia's character Janhavi and her pasta-containing lunchbox which she never seems to offer Radhe. Watch him in the scene at a railway platform where he finally confronts her for never sharing her pasta with him. Rare moments like these have you guffawing in your seat.Where Wanted slips is in its pacing. While early portions of the film move at a breakneck speed, allowing you little time to even ponder the ridiculousness of what's going on, the film's second half drags on and on, leaving you bored and exhausted by the time the end credits finally roll. Inevitably, comparisons will be drawn with Ghajini, but that film ? despite its similarly violent premise ? had a coherent plot at its core. Wanted like I told you earlier, doesn't even pretend to make sense. Directed by ace choreographer Prabhu Deva, Wanted is a remake of his Tamil film, Pokiri, which was itself adapted from a Telugu original. The Hindi version, much like the previous films, goes for broad humour and cheap thrills. At times downright stupid and unapologetically excessive, Wanted is a B-grade crowd-pleaser that knows exactly who its audience is. The film is a showcase not so much for Salman's acting, but for his scorching screen-presence and his infectious enthusiasm for dancing. Film after film the actor has been accused of sleepwalking through his roles; this time he's wide awake and having a blast. For die-hard fans of the star who don't have a problem with extreme violence and juvenile comedy, this might be a treat. For others though, it's strictly average entertainment.Carry cotton for your ears and a Crocin for the headache.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this film 2, because of the actress Ayesha Takia and Mahesh Manjrekar as a corrupt cop, they are the 2 constant in this appalling movie. She's really beautiful, and as a villain Manjrekar pulls it off again. I read somewhere that this is a "superhit" if it is, Bollywood is not heading in the right direction. The story line, is relegated in the background for Salman Khan (who looks really old by the way) to beat and kill everyone he can, and flex his muscles. This could have been such a good film compared to the likes of The Departed or Infernal Affairs, but sadly it's not. I read in one of the user comments someone comparing this to Ghajini, Ghajini although based on Memento actually had a proper story, and not just scenes put together for the sake of the main star.

		<shortDescription>Most ridiculously wanted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gajhini started it with its hundred and fifty crores of business. Span is widened. Suddenly Hollywoodland is not the only place filmmakers are limited to lay their hands on source material especially for action movies. Wanted by what I gather from around is the most wanted film for makers and takers as well. Originally made in Tamil as Pokiri, followed by Telugu remake and now here it is B-grade B-version. Each shares genes of a superstar of their native woodlands with the other. Ours stars Salman Khan and Wanted is destined to be a hit for sure. Producer Boney Kapoor imports director from South, elastic Prabhu Deva (debut) and casts one of Bollywood superstar. Name is Radhe, just Radhe, a killer for hire who can take on an entire army and can action sequences starts like a video game with Sallu taking controls just thrashing till game over. "I work for money", he says without flinching it as its most self- marketed line and a principle together. His employers are city mafia dons. Everyone is eager to buy his services and his loyalty. Salman stands in mid-fight of two gangs making room for plenty of brainless action whacking, thrashing, crushing bones, clenching fists and flying fury and whirling beaten up goons bodies crashing. Apart from lynching the killer has heart too and he loses it to bubbly Ayesha Takia. She works in a call-centre and has extra-fit body, thanks to her regular aerobics which hero and villain (Mahesh Manjarekar plays the filthy cop) equally appreciate. And by the way there is twist ending to win more applause from Khan Aficionados and justify this theatre of cruelty. Salman apparently looks awake after so many sleepwalks in previous endeavors. He is in his full superstar mode and I can hear whistles and applauses from front rows. This is a ridiculously over the top B-grade entertainment targeted for mass pumped with South Indian steroids. If you are Salman Khan you are anyway going to see it. Rest and whoever would want to keep safe distance from Wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanted....A Cheap Movie, or Rehash of Old Cheap Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a cheap and loud Dishum-Dishum thriller. This is what you get when you mix a second rate producer and a third rate meathead like Salman Khan. The only redeeming factor in this flick is, Ayesha Takia, She is sure sight for sore eyes-an eye-candy in the lines of Mumtaz in the 60's. In fact she is the beauty-among the beasts. Apart from the Twin-Talents that she has been bestowed with,she has twinkling of a potential albeit she is not in the same caliber as Kareena or Rani and safe to assume that she never will be.The only noteworthy is Mahesh Manjrekar-you hate his character and love his acting. The movie is a typical Southern-Sambhar(as opposed to Masala-in reverence should be reserved for similar genre of flicks coming out of Mumbai) with portly and pot bellied baddies(and one major villain-preferably tucked away in Dubai or Bankok-here it happens to be Hong Kong)with greasy hair and cheap sunglasses.Salman Khan has proved time and times again that you don't need to be an actor to be a Star. The movie is inordinately long. I guess this is to accommodate all the baddies that come flinging from all directions that seem to come between the hero and his girl and also prove his credentials to the girl specially when there is no father in the family--to give away the bride. The couple live happily every after in a Government subsidized Housing development(This is the Spoiler and Giveaway)</fullReview>

Salman Khan has shown good body language and personality but that's not enough to carry the film. The only advantage of the film is Salman and the villain in the film.They acted superbly. Comedy is also poor.it also can't help the film. The film contains unwanted bad example of fighting like south style films. Ayesha Takia does not make any remarks. Some dialogues are good and let us enjoy the film and it suits to Salman Khan. Salman Khan has shown his good body shape once again as always. The conclusion is Wanted is an ordinary film.

		<shortDescription>Great action.... ridiculous story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing first... Wanted is strictly for 2 king of audience: Hardcore action lovers and Hardcore Salman fan. If you are none of these, there is nothing else for you in this flick. No great acting, no good songs, no emotions, no romance. The movie relies heavily on Salman's star power and Vijayan's mindless action sequences. I have read most of the earlier reviews on IMDb, and most of them seem to be biased just because they are Salman fans. I agree that Salman is one of the greatest action heroes of Bollywood and Prabhu has exploited his muscle power to full extent. But thats it; the movie has nothing else to offer. Had the writers put a little more efforts on the story and screenplay, Wanted could have been the Ghajini of 2009. But alas, Wanted is just 50% as good as Ghajini.None of the other actors seem commendable. Mahesh Majarekar's character of a crooked cop seems more like a comedian while the Prakash Raj, in spite of his good acting, doesn't look like a furious don. Ayesha Takia's lover girl role too is unconvincing and plastic. Vinod Khanna is wasted as an actor. Everybody has left the job of pulling the movie on Salman. Even the few good dialogs belong to him.I watched the movie on pirated DVD, taking three breaks in between. Just got bored after every 45 mins. Watch it at you own risk, preferably on DVD only. No need to spend to watch it in theater. Once again, Wanted is only wanted for action and Salman lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i don't know what happened with Indian movies lovers?? they taught that every action movie is a masterpiece, i think in the BOLLYWOOD history there are some good action movies like GHAYAL DON AWARAPAN KHILADI 420 , but with wanted i can't say that's a good movie.SALMAN KHAN is not a bad actor, he has some good movies , but in this , i can't see any good things,just a waste of time of regular business movies: a hero with a beautiful girl, when he becomes angry everyone has to run away because he can kill all the world.for action scenes they are not well done, you can See how lies they are, a man can fight 30 gangsters himself just because he is the hero, even he can kill anyone in any place even a doctor in a hospital.that'as not a movie which you can enjoy, if you look for good action movie just forget this movie, because its so far to be a nice movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were waiting for a good film from Salman Khan, your wait is certain to continue as Wanted turns out to be a below average watch. Directed by dance guru Prabhudeva, Wanted will fail to impress you on every level. Adapted from the original telugu flick Pokiri, Wanted is an out and out action film. The script of Wanted seems more like its made for the audience down south and implementing it with Salman Khan makes it all more interesting. Having proved his abilities with action flicks, Salman Khan looks to have gone that extra mile to give Wanted the classy touch.Wanted's protagonist Radhe(Salman Khan) is a local thug who terminates people when offered the right price. He's seen shifting between two rival gangs to terminate one another who ever offered more money. Radhe takes no time eliminating people and is seen doing the same in every second scene and here's when he falls for the innocent-pretty girl Jhanvi(Ayesha Takia) who works in a call center. Not so impressed by his rough gangster looks, it takes a while before Jhanvi starts feeling for Radhe who helps her out from the hands of the corrupt crook inspector Talpade(Mahesh Manjrekar). On the other hand due to constant killings in both rival gangs, the top don Gani Bhai(Prakash Raj) is forced to visit mumbai to take over the underworld activities. Now is when the plot takes a unanticipated bizarre u-turn giving Wanted the much needed climax that you might end up liking. The abrupt unpredictable climax is for you to watch it yourself.Wanted has hardly anything that you might want to look back at except for Salman Khan. The script is ordinary and the execution part makes it even more lousy. The dialogues are ineffective and fails to derive the energy necessary except for a few. Salman Khan has delivered a decent performance with some great action sequences which you are sure to enjoy. Not so impressive are the costumes which look awful in nicely shot backdrops especially in the songs- "Tose Pyar karte Hai" and "Dil Leke Darde Dil". The performances of Ayesha Takia and the rest of the crew is forgettable.The music by Sajid-Wajid is again ordinary and is tolerable provided the violent theme of the movie. "Love me Love Me" being the most catchy of all. Having seen the huge commercial success with the Tamil and Telugu versions, Wanted will have to literally run full shows to even compete with its counter parts. Go watch it if you are a Salman Khan Fan, and not really advisable for the rest.Reviewed By, Raghav RamaiahOriginally posted @ TalkingPopcorns.com!</fullReview>
