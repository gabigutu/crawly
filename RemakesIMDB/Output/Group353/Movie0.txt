		<shortDescription>An excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, when I first watched this movie, I was blown-away! It's a very good thriller/comedy/romance/action etc Telugu film.Mahesh's performance is amazing and he is made for this role. His new haircut is hot and he is so, so Hot in Pokiri! Prakash Raj should win a award for Pokiri and Ileana is so,so beautiful and pretty. My new favorite actress! The comedy track was OK and I love the chemistry between Ileana and Mahesh especially the elevator and up-ma scenes.Puri did remarkably good for directing and the story! The songs are breath-taking. I actually like them all and I bought the soundtrack! This is a brilliant movie and it deserves to break the Telugu movie records! Pokiri is nowing running for 400 Days!I can't wait for the Hindi pokiri and also I didn't like the Tamil one! So, I say that every Telugu people have to watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect blend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pokiri has the perfect blend of everything an entertaining movie should have. Powerful dialogs, foot-tapping numbers, cheeky romance, great action sequences, fantastic characterization and a mix of a perfect dose of humor interlaced throughout. The director has also reserved some space of suspense with the plot! All these ingredients make Pokiri a must see for the entire family and not just fans of Mahesh. The cast matches the characters to the tee and every one contributes. You'll probably want to watch the movie more than once just to hear Mahesh's dialogs again. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Hats off to Mr. Puri Jagannath!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that is the best movie made so far in Tollywood.the actor and actress are very talented,the songs are excellent,the story is good and the fights are very realistic.It has won many awards.It has also rewrote 70 years of Telugu film history.It is basically about a cop Krishna Manohar (Mahesh Babu) undercover as a criminal(as Pandu),who pretends as he is a part of the mafia to catch the villains.The leader of the mafia is Ali Bhai (Prakash Raj).Meanwhile he falls in love with Shruti(Ileana D'Cruz) who is being tortured by a corrupt police officer (Ashish Vidyarthi) who happens to be a part of the mafia.If you haven't watched it yet,I would definitely recommend that you watch it as soon as possible.It is a really good movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie but not original :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One great movie with wonderful dialogues, great performances, superb songs and nice screenplay but still can't digest the fact that it has been copied from some French movie.I just happened to browse through some videos in youtube and realized that the hit song devudaa is copied from Ricky Martin's song and when I was browsing related videos I found that this is a straight lift from Banlieue 13.Still all credit to director and Mahesh for such a great display. It has raised Mahesh to next level and people see him as the only guy who can reach to the heights of Chiru</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mahesh Babu's best performance till date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fantastic movie. Mahesh Babu was simply brilliant. The director Puri Jagannath has obviously put in a lot of hard work into the script of the movie. And how he succeeded!!!!!The movie VCD/DVD is worth a buy. All the songs of the movie, especially the title track (Jagadame) and "Deva Devuda" are good. The action part was slightly exaggerated but thats accepatable. Another highlight of the movie was Prakash Raj performance. Sayaji Shinde as the DCP was also very lively and the scenes of the press conferences are very good. The movie is slightly boring in the middle but that is made up by a thrilling finish. The comedy track was average.Overall a must watch movie especially for PRINCE MAHESH FANS!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pokiri has blown up the whole spectrum of commercial cinema once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an outright commercial film with lot of action and one liners. Mahesh babu proved himself as future of telugu cinema with this film.The story is simple without many twists, which has helped sustain a good screenplay, followed by straight direction. Puri Jagan completely relied on the action genre, judiciously mixing it with commercial elements. His treatment of the dialogues too is neat and response-targeted.Suspense keeps the tempo of the film till the end.very grippy scripting by Puri Jagan.What was Shiva for Nagarjuna is going to be Pokiri for Mahesh. After a long gap I strongly feel telugu directors are coming on top compared to their kollywood counterparts who have dominated the younger minds for a decade almost. young directors like Nagesh Kokinoor,Shekar Kammula,Puri Jagan,VV Vinayak have brought fresh ideas to the screen irrespective of the so called mass or class elements.over all a very entertaining film.Illenia is simply sexy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being bad has never been better. And suddenly gangster and mafia movies are the flavor. In a sense, even Mahesh Babu's previous movie Athadu was one.In Pokiri, the hero is introduced to us a ruthless baddie, part of the huge underbelly of mafia. By the time we come to the denouement, there is much twist and turn. If you like some racy action, fun, glamor and love, then Pokiri would be your kind of film.Pandu (Mahesh) is a remorseless mafia man. He is part of a gang that is headed by Ali Bhai (Prakash Raj), the Dubai-based don. Pandu falls in love with the aerobics teacher Sruthi (Ileana). She also falls for him but he is put off by his bad ways. Pandu has a fall- out with Ali Bhai while Sruthi is harassed by a venal cop (Asish Vidyarthi). The finale is about how Pandu (there is a suspense to his role) outwits Ali and how he gets the hand of Sruthi.The tale is a mixture of Hollywood and Desi hits.Mahesh revels in an author-backed role. His insouciance and cultivated elegance add to the polish of the character. He is decidedly first rate in the role of a patented baddie. The director seems to have created his character with lot of care. Even his looks are very cool and comfy. Ileana, looking gorgeous, is also very cute and likable. She has moved up in acting to after Devadasu. Her exchanges with Mahesh and the natural chemistry that flow between them is a highlight of the movie.Prakash Raj as Ali is typical. But some of his mannerisms are predictable. So too is Asish Vidyarthi. But it is Shayaji Shinde, as a honest cop, who is the standout. Nasser is also convincing. The same cannot be said of the comedy track.Mani Sharma's music is also another plus. His re-recording gives the right backdrop. Shyam K Naidu's camera work is another asset to the movie.Puri Jagannadh has got it right as a scriptwriter. He has worked around the story with dexterity. He has also got the feel of the movie right. Though there are elements that may put you off (too much action and extra glamor), Puri Jagannadh surely knows the pulse of the audience. And in Mahesh he has got an able ally.Pokiri looks like it will work at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mahesh Babu's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pokiri is like a saving grace for Mahesh Babu. If you want to see one film which will define an actor, Pokiri is the film for Mahesh. It's got action, humor and emotions that all count. His stunts, style and enigma sprinkle magic on the viewers. But, Puri Jagannath also gives us a good lineup of stars that include Prakash Raj, Nasser, Ashish Vidyarthi and Ileana. In films like these, the female lead is supposed to be a stupid female who has nothing else to do other than romance the hero. But, Ileana's character has a story for herself and she plays her role suavely. The film also offers extensive story lines to several other characters. Prakash Raj explains how famous he is; Ashish Vidyarthi sees a connection between his wife and concubine; Nasser has a will of his own, and Mahesh incredibly fits in as the guy for the job. With Mani Sharma's crackling soundtrack, Pokiri is a fine action flick which you can watch over and over. Dole Dole anybody?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puri Jagganath punches the lights out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To quote Anupam Kher "When a movie becomes a hit, everything about it is appealing". Pokiri should be used as a reference point for utilising all the possible movie-making formula's, however in precise-doses. If you play devil's advocate you will realise that there is no earth-shattering storyline here. In true sense, Pokiri is an ode to the cinema of 70's &amp; 80's. Mahesh Babu:: Gets into the skin of the role. His fan-following would have increased in leaps-and-bounds after Pokiri.Ilena:: Her presence was restricted to songs and providing relief moments in the storyline.Mumait Khan:: Did full justice to the item number.Can't get enough of one Prakash Raj? Pokiri does a new BOGOF (buy-one-get-one-free). Yes, Sayaji Shinde seems to have found his face/off. Hold on ? I almost forgot... for a brief moment, our Prakash Raj dearest gets spawned yet again and this time its Nassar. But thankfully the possessed moments are confined to his last breath (and the audience is spared!).Comedy track:: Innovative, but at times really hampers the narrative. Songs are catchy and stay on with you. Background score is impressive and elevates the screenplay.Action sequences:: Deserves a special mention. Gruesome, gory ? the split-second editing is used effectively to create high-impact shock! Tarantino-meets-Spielberg influences are apparent.Puri Jagganath:: If Pokiri has satiated your appetite to make your mark and make your presence felt... please move on. Needless to say, the movie bears streaks of powerhouse of talent that lie within you. Your product has created a milestone by numbers but on a creative level I am sure you would like to add lot more feathers on your cap. Avoid the pitfall of turning into Y2K version of K. Raghavendra Rao-cum-Dasari Narayan Rao-cum-B Gopal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characterization of the lead actor is good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is the typical Telugu movie for mass. The highlight of the film is Mahesh's brilliant performance. Apart from this, Prakash raj also has put in a fine effort.The director Puri tried to mix lot of bollywood movies like Abtak 56, Company... The comedy track is horrible. His only forte is writing the screenplay keeping hero character in his mind.Some of the dialog like "Once i am committed, i don't even listen to myself", " I don't know how much an idiot i am" are very good.Ileana looks beautiful. This is Mahesh's another hit after Athadu. Nothing to talk about the music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't judge a movie by its records!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One might get the feeling that the movie is once in a lifetime event after seeing the hype and hoopla surrounding the release and the subsequent record-breaking run it had at the box office. But the movie sadly fails to deliver on many counts - tight story line, memorable music and, for me the essential ingredient of any entertaining movie, a good comedy track.Though it's all too well known that we are not sticklers for realism in our movies, we don't complain a spoonful of it! I mean, an undercover cop going berserk, in his imitation of a Mongol barbarian, with the poor rowdy folks was a bit over the top, to put it mildly. Probably Mahesh Babu was stretching the macho-ism thread little too thin. I still feel his 'Okkadu' is way better than 'Athadu' or 'Pokiri'. Ileana's is a fresh face on the horizon with a neatly chiseled body to boot! Acting is probably not her forte, but who cares, in an out and out hero-focused movie. It's probably due to the sheer number of films he does, but Prakash Raj is getting too predictable, either in a mean, calculating villain's character or in a caring, compassionate father's character.The movie has its positives too - slick photography and exaggerating fight sequences that appeal to the large masses. And it also tries to shock the prudes by showing glimpses of BDSM and snorting! An entertaining three hours but falls short of the status of a legend, its records notwithstanding.</fullReview>
