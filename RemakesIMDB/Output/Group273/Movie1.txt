		<shortDescription>Beautiful and charming film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this film at the Waterfront Film Festival in Saugatuck Michigan. Directed by Randall Miller and a star filled cast, this film was the best of the festival, and may be one of my favorites of the year. The film begins with baker Robert Carlyle driving down a deserted highway. He comes upon a stranger in a car wreck, played by John Goodman, and the two talk with each other, waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Goodman tells Carlyle of his planned reunion with his childhood love at the place mentioned in the title.This beautiful film is wonderfully acted, with such stars as Marisa Tomei, Mary Steenburgen, Sean Astin, Donnie Wahlberg, David Paymer, and Ernie Hudson. I loved the story, I didn't realize you could do so much with such a simple outline. I loved the structure of the film, the way it was edited and shot. There were some very funny moments, very touching moments, and overall it's just a great experience. Some of the filmmakers showed up for the festival and had some great stories to tell. The movie was originally made 15 years ago as a short film of the same title, and a lot of the scenes from the short film are used in the feature as flashback scenes (I knew I saw Donkeylips from Salute Your Shorts).I think with such an all-star cast and such a good story, this film will at least get release in major cities. So if you get the chance, check this movie out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simple yet surprisingly introspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though certainly not about a new and unique topic in entertainment, this film presents a multi-dimensional perspective about experiences that we all, as human beings, can relate.The films unique approach, and the actors sometimes subtle, sometimes dramatic execution causes a myriad of emotions to surface during the development of the plot. The audience laughs, cries, and I was personally touched by both the plot transitions and the elegant development of the characters and story line throughout the film.The film provoked reflection in the audience by asking questions and allowing this moviegoer to connect many life experiences to the film. So many movies today are developed for entertainment purposes only, usually either through special effects or dark, dismal shock factor. This film differentiated itself by not wrapping everything up in a pretty little package, leaving room for discussion and interpretation. And Mary Steenburgen's performance was easily one of the best I've seen at the entire film festival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional roller-coaster, Mary Steenburgen is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a while before i felt involved with the film and the characters. However, once more characters started joining the dance class i started to look forward to every scene in the ballroom. Robert Carlyle was obviously the lead role but Mary Steenburgen was fabulous. She was funny but serious and assertive, and her wardrobe throughout the movie evolved along with her character. A nice, subtle touch. As was the gentleman who starts and stops the music for her during the film, i think his name was Freeway? I started looking forward to every time he hit play on that tiny boom box and hearing the music boom through the theater sound. Overall i really enjoyed the film even though it started a little slow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. It truly was a wonderful package. All parts come together. After the film, the audience gave it a standing applause. It was a hit with the audience, including myself. I would see it again. Robert Carlyle was very good as the sympathetic baker, consumed by his wife's death, and inadvertently drawn into an emergency situation. The director/writer incorporates his older film of a boy's experience of being forced to go to dance and charm school, melding it perfectly with the now adult man's perception played by John Goodman. Others in the film were Marisa Tomei, Mary Steenburgen, Donnie Wahlber, and Sean Astin, all giving a wonderful performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A guy who's lost his wife winds up at a dance school and learns to fall in love again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie got it right where a bunch of other movies have gotten it totally wrong. Most movies about grieving and loss gloss over what it really feels like to lose someone, but Hotchkiss' really makes you feel how alone Frank is after losing his wife before you see him begin to learn how to let go and move on. The cast in this movie (John Goodman, Danny Devito, Marisa Tomei, Donnie Wahlberg, Sean Astin) is stronger than most big budget Hollywood movies (Robert Carlyle is really amazing here!) but this isn't an 'indie' film with boring camera shots and amateurish productions, it's very stylishly shot and incredibly well-done all around. Best of both worlds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something about Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing &amp; Charm School that audiences will find enchanting. The script is quite good, but not overwhelming. The acting very solid, but maybe not as good as I would have expected from Robert Carlyle, John Goodman, Mary Steenburgen, Marisa Tomei and plenty of other all-stars. And cinematography was used in some interesting ways to delineate three different periods, which provided perspective, but was hardly revolutionary.But the beauty of the movie is really none of these. Robert Carlyle plays Frank Keane, a baker (from a long line of bakers in the family business) recovering from the tragic loss of his wife. One day while driving he encounters a car wreck, and begins to talk to the mortally wounded driver, Steve (John Goodman). What unfolds is the interweaving of stories?Steve's experience as a 12-year-old in the Marilyn Hotchkiss School, and Frank's as he fulfills a promise to the dying Steve.What emerges, rather remarkably, is a story filled with tragedy that nevertheless manages to be warm, light-hearted, nostalgic, funny and inspiring. Carlyle seems an unlikely protagonist, but his character gradually blossoms into someone that is quietly heroic, as his encounter with Goodman takes him on a path of exploration, self-discovery and love. Director Randall Miller has done a remarkable job of telling a story filled with meaningful insight and compassionate charm. I flat out loved this movie, as did the rest of the audience at Sundance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Touching Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie and sobbed my heart out at the end. I'm a sappy kinda gal and it wrenched my heart strings good and proper. I love the fact that the story is based on a short clip the director, Randall Miller made some 15 years ago, which he embellished into a full story about finding your joy again after the loss of a loved one.All around the performances were superb. I was very taken by Robert Carlyle's grief stricken husband, who happens upon a tragic accident and fulfils the dying person's (John Goodman) last wish to visit the place where he was travelling to - Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School, where he was meant to meet his long lost sweetheart on the 5th day of the 5th month of the 5th year of the Millennium.The story seems crazy, but it worked for me as Frank Keane (Carlyle) becomes involved with the decorums, courtesies and fancies that the ballroom dancing class has to offer and also finds love in the shape of Meredith Morrison (played delicately by Marisa Tomei).There's a great supporting cast of zany characters that will have you laughing at their antics as girl tries to snare boy on the ballroom dance floor. The shenanigans are lead by the wondering Mary Steenburgen, who shows such great poise and gentility as Miss Marienne Hotchkiss, carrying on the tradition of her long departed mother Marylyn.Another outstanding performance was by Donnie Wahlberg, as the overly overprotective step-brother to Meredith, Randall Ipswitch, who has a passion for ballroom dancing and domestic violence. It is his life. Donnie has become a fantastic character actor and deserves much more credit than he gets.I would have liked a slightly better ending to the John Goodman storyline, but no matter. The movie was great IMHO and touched me to the core.Go see this movie when it comes out. You'll never be the same again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie I've Seen All Year!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The is by far the finest film that I have seen all year... Robert Carlyle was superb as the broken widower. I lost my wife to cancer four years ago and his portrayal was dead on. John Goodman was magnificent as were Mary Steenburgen as the beleaguered and out of touch Marianne Hotchkiss, the Grand Damne of the ballroom. And Donnie Wahlberg was brilliant in comic turn as Randall Ipswitch, the Lord-Of-The-Dance of the Pasadena ballroom. But finally the Marisa Tomei character, Meredith was perhaps the finest bit of acting in the bunch. Her work as the broken and beaten down sister of Donnie's character was dead on. I cannot recommend the film highly enough. GO SEE IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>masterful mingling of narratives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's use of two voices relaying three narrative threads, artfully woven without confusion while maintaining audience interest and focus, could be used as a textbook for compound story structure. If the story hadn't been expanded from a short film thereby requiring this approach, I'd be heaping superlative praise on its inventiveness as well.Entertaining, well-cast with excellent performances by its ensemble of seasoned character actors, and just quirky enough to offset its sometimes saccharin character, I think this will grow a deserved following when it airs on cable. A solid illustration of the possibility of 'charm' in contemporary cinema, it presented little violence beyond its illustration of an automobile accident site and the language of adolescent boys, and managed a passionate but never prurient love scene under cover of a liberal dusting of flour.Enchanting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie about human feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a ballroom dancer this was pretty much a "required viewing." It was a little different from what I expected, but it was still worth the time. I've read the feelings of a lot of dancers who have rated this movie lower than I did. I would guess that they come by their opinions based on the fact that dancing to them, is a competition sport and that's how they always look at it. My feeling towards dancing would probably be more in line with those of Mary Ann Hotchkiss and Mr. Keane. "Dance is a very powerful drug Mr. Keane. If embraced judiciously, it can exorcise demons, access deep seated emotions and color your life in joyous shades of brilliant magenta that you never knew existed. But, one must shoulder its challenges with intrepid countenance if one is ever to reap its rewards." Get this movie, curl up on the couch with your honey and enjoy a very nice, sweet movie about searching for, and finding reasons for going on, even when life seems so pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet and Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so incredibly sweet! I really loved how the Robert Carlyle's character learns to love (and live) again. John Goodman was amazing telling his story, and the flashback scenes with the kids were so sweet.I loved how John Goodman's character passes on his destiny to Robert Carlyle's character, and how everyone's life is impacted. This is a wonderful story of love and loss and moving forward. The dancing may not be brilliant, but it's not about the dancing. It's about real people learning to dance and learning so much more in the process. It's about people actually connecting with each other. The supporting cast was awesome! There were so many people I recognized. Mary Steenburgen was just brilliant was the eccentric dance teacher, and Donnie Wahlberg was so funny as the jealous step-brother. And so many more celebrities - Sean Astin, Camyrn Manheim, Danny DeVito, Adam Arkin -- the list goes on and on.I highly recommend this wonderful film. It made me laugh and cry. It made me want to dance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was savaged by every critic on earth, which pretty much confirmed my opinion that critics are all stupid. Yeah, it was kinda' sappy, but I thought it worked for the film. Contrary to many reviews, I thought John Goodman's performance was excellent. The ensemble cast carried the movie well. It wasn't "Becket", but it was totally watchable. You have to pay pretty close attention. They don't whack you over the head with exposition the way some films do. The one thing I will say is that there are a few plot and character elements that just seem to be thrown in there for no apparent reason. If you can get past that, the movie makes it's points well and clearly, if not completely originally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love quiet little independent films and this one was more than I expected. So many well-known actors who must have seen the film as a labor of love instead of a big paycheck. I think it showed in their performances. Robert Carlyle had such a heavy sadness about him and watching him come out of his self-imposed solitude was one of the nicest things about the movie. There were so many sweet little moments and I've always liked John Goodman, his inability to correct some of the regrets he had in life would resonate with many of us. The scenes with the men together in group therapy were familiar to anyone who ever experienced the deep loss of a life partner. This movie contains both grief and joy too, which is pretty much what life contains if we are lucky enough to love someone and be loved in return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a film maker or film student, just like movies and watch way more than I should. This is not the type of movie I would generally watch but because I like Robert Carlyle I gave it a chance. I am glad I did.I forgive the fact there are no great dancers in the film as it isn't about dance and most in the classes are students, children, older...in essence, they aren't dancers and most are probably not there to become expert dancers.It IS a movie that looks to tug at the heartstrings and manipulate the emotions but most movies are trying to illicit a response, an emotional reaction, of some kind. This movie did a good job.Personally I had a hard time investing emotionally in this movie but it gradually weakened my resolve and I started caring about the characters.Indeed it is an older short film encapsulated in an updated shell and secondary story but to be honest, the characters (and a few were real characters), anachronisms and all, were still just as interesting and was worked into the new overarching story quite well.Any weakness of this story, this project, was ably work around by a great cast that did seem to immerse themselves in their roles. Its not a perfect film, it overtly tugs at the heartstrings, sappy, some comedy. I recommend it but it certainly isn't going appeal to all.I wish they had credited 'freeway' the boombox button pusher...it was a funny touch, one of a few minor quirky characters both modern and flashback, little touches that added to the enjoyment of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank (Robert Carlyle) is a widowed baker, trying to recover from his wife's sudden death. As he is driving the highway, one day, he comes across a serious auto accident involving a single driver, Steve (John Goodman). Told to keep the man conscious through conversation, Frank learns that Steve was on his way to a dance class appointment he made, 40 years ago, with a young girl he had a crush on! He begs Frank, when he can, to go to the Marilyn Hotchkiss Dance and Charm School, find Lisa and tell her why he couldn't make it. Frank does so, reluctantly, much to the surprise of his widowers support group. Once at the school, however, now operated by Marilyn's daughter, Mary Ann (Mary Steenburgen), and featuring a beautiful lady, Meredith (Marisa Tomei), Frank is intrigued. Failing to find Lisa, the baker, nevertheless, goes back the following week, even though Meredith's troubled stepbrother (Donnie Wahlberg) warns him to keep away from his sister. Before long, Frank and all of the widowers are learning to "live again" with the healing power of ballroom dance. But, will Steve remain alive and will Lisa ever be found? This lovely film is easy to recommend to fans of romantic drama and, indeed, all those who admire quality film-making. The story is wonderful, after a slow opening, with some memorable lines and situations. Also, the setting is fantastic, an old but beautiful ballroom, with Mary Ann parting the stage curtains at each class' beginning and following a pattern of etiquette that recalls a different era. As for the cast, Carlyle, Steenburgen, the always lovely Tomei, Goodman, Sean Astin, Paymer, and especially Wahlberg, are made-to-order great. Naturally, the costumes, photography and inventive direction are also strong assets. Want to put a spring in your step and smile on your face? Dance out the door and secure a view soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delight not to be missed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that dance-themed movies are almost by definition, if you will pardon the pun, a little offbeat. I suppose one could make pseudo-intellectual references to dance as metaphor, but, in the end, I think dance is dance and that's just fine. And so is this movie ? just fine, wonderfully, delightfully fine.Writer/director Randall Miller deftly employs the frame story literary device to weave two disparate narratives into a third, unifying story line. While this literary conceit was necessary to incorporate a short film of the same name that Miller made fifteen years previous to this film, it is nonetheless cleverly handled and flawlessly executed. One actor even appears in both time-lines. As a child he plays one of the central characters in his boyhood story, and as an adult, he plays the colleague of another central character. This is done imperceptibly, and is almost in inside joke to those who are aware of the earlier film.Without giving too much away, the story lines all revolve around the eponymous Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School; how one character, recalling his youth there, struggles to return for a rendezvous he promised as a boy to make on this day, and how his struggle leads a grieving widower to make his own journey there, where he will find, well, you'll have to see for yourself what he finds, but, believe me, it's worth it.The cast is surprisingly heavy with A-list (and some solid B-list) talent. Frank Keane (Robert Carlyle: The Full Monty) is a widower going through the motions of his life as a baker, unable to get past the suicide of his wife. Carlyle excels at bringing unexpected layers to his roles, and this is no exception. His character encounters challenges and inspirations that become life changing, and Carlyle renders them perfectly.John Goodman is one of those actors who, despite being gifted, are almost, if you will pardon another pun, too large a personality in real life to be effective in most roles. Here, the circumstances surrounding his character make it work beautifully. Similarly, Danny DeVito, who has but a cameo appearance, is delicately downplayed with surprising effectiveness. One almost wonders how Miller managed to assemble this impressive cast, as if he won some Hollywood casting lottery, but the fact that he is Rhea Perlman's cousin might explain at least DeVito's willingness to do the film. Rhea's father even appears.I have always loved Mary Steenburgen, and her more or less title role as Miss Hotchkiss is no disappointment. Her characteristically cracking voice is just what the character needs to seem somewhat surreal. Oscar® winner Marisa Tomei delicately inhabits the female lead of the story, and brings closure and redemption to the bereaved widower. Camryn Manheim has a brief but powerful appearance, and even Sonia Braga was somehow convinced to join a cast inexplicably overloaded with talent. Add to that Sean Astin, Adam Arkin, Ernie Hudson, and even a deliciously counter-cast Donnie Wahlberg, and you begin to see what I mean about the surfeit of talent.All of that talent wasn't for naught. The ensemble melds beautifully, delicately supported by Mark Adler's gorgeous soundtrack and all orchestrated with preternatural grace and subtlety by auteur director/writer/producer/editor Randall Miller. Films like this go largely unnoticed, and most of its fan base comes from people who caught it as part of some tedious and pretentious film festival or other. I was fortunate to have placed the film in my Netflix queue so I could watch it sans pretense, where I could experience it personally, as it was meant to be seen.Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School is simply a delight not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man in 2005 is trying to get to the ballroom to see 1960s friends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a somewhat quirky story that I find works very well. It is not told in a linear fashion and that works very well, with the fine editing. In present time John Goodman is Steve Mills, driving to get back to Pasadena, California, to the "Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing &amp; Charm School". He had taken dancing and charm lessons there for almost 3 years in the 1960s as a young boy, and he and one of his friends agreed to meet there on the 5th day of the 5th month of the 5th year of the new millennium. This was the day and he had to get there. Robert Carlyle is Frank Keane, who bakes bread and delivers it. He is in his delivery truck when he comes upon the single vehicle accident. It is Steve, who is injured, but he makes Frank promise he would go in his place and look up the old friend. In a complementary story Frank has recently lost his wife and is still grieving, so he and several other men meet in a self-help group. Some of them are Sean Astin as Kip Kipling, Adam Arkin as Gabe DiFranco, David Paymer as Rafael Horowitz, and Ernie Hudson as Blake Rische. In the modern day dance studio are Mary Steenburgen as Marienne Hotchkiss, the daughter of Marilyn who is now deceased. Two of the key adult dancers are Marisa Tomei as Meredith Morrison and Donnie Wahlberg as Randall Ipswitch. The story, its pacing, the acting all have a charm to them. All in all a very unique and enjoyable movie. A very touching story. In trying to help a stranger Frank helps himself out of his depression.SPOILERS: Steve is gravely injured in the accident. Very late in the movie we see that he had been in prison, and released just the day before he was supposed to meet is boyhood crush Lisa. So he stole a car and had to drive through the night. Sleepiness caused him to crash, almost cutting himself in two. He did not survive the ambulance ride to the hospital. So Frank went in Steve's place, sure that Laia would be there, but she wasn't. However Frank found a new place he felt comfortable and meeting Meredith was a bonus. They eventually became a couple. Frank did track down Camryn Manheim as Lisa Gobar, a frumpy smoker living in a trailer, she said she had no recollection of the deal she and Steve made 40 years earlier. But as Frank left, we see her pull out a cigar box on mementos, including a photo of Steve. She never forgot. (Danny DeVito has a very brief appearance as Steve's cell mate as Steve is leaving.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dancing as a Way out of Loss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever the impetus for writer/director Randall Miller to recreate his 1990 film on the same subject, this little low budget film has the sense of commitment and love on the part of everyone associated with it. Be warned that this is a hankie film and that if you don't have a tolerance (or a fondness) for tearjerkers, then best avoid this one. But for those who enjoy a look at the changes that loss and discovery and love can impact a disparate group of characters' lives, this is a sweet little movie.The basic premise is how caring for others can positively affect one's own world view. Frank Keane (Robert Carlyle) is a baker in a family shop, a quiet man who is trying to recover from his wife's unexplained suicide and for consolation he is in group therapy with other grieving men (David Paymer is the leader of a group that includes Sean Astin, Adam Arkin, Ernie Hudson, Miguel Sandoval). On a routine delivery run, Frank witness a car crash in which Steve Mills (John Goodman) is critically injured. Feeling helpless, Frank calls the paramedics who respond and tell him to keep Steve talking. And talk Steve does, pleading with Frank to go to a ballroom dance session to which he promised a young girl he would attend 40 years ago when a child. Frank does attend Marilyn Hotchkiss (Patricia Fraser) Ballroom Dancing and Charm School, feels out of place at first, but gradually warms to the message of now-owner Marienne Hotchkiss (Mary Steenburgen), meets an abused Meredith (Marisa Tomei), her abuser Randall Ipswich (Donnie Wahlberg), and fellow dancers including Sonja Braga et al. Through the miracle of dance (and through a lot of flashbacks from car accident to Steve's childhood, etc) conflicts resolve. The ending is cluttered by events unnecessary to the story but seemingly inserted to make use of the talents of Danny DeVito and Camryn Manheim. But by the time this fluff is added we have already been enchanted with the bumpy road tale and can forgive about anything.This little unpretentious movie has an endearing style and is populated with some superb actors who seem committed to the project. Many of the 'little things' (Hotchkiss' gradual variation in costume, the DJ "Freeway" (uncredited), and the quality of outside vs interior photography) come to mind in retrospect and make the memory of this evening of borderline saccharine story even more of a treasure.

The story mixes well with the boys and girls attending the charm school and the way it shapes there life. The script is so wll written, the acting so good and the end of the movie will leave you asking for more. Why oh Why can they not make more movies like this one.

		<fullReview>Excellent movie that's well worth seeing. Find it. See it.This is a story that weaves several plots into one. The main ones are: guy loses wife and comes to grip with his changed world; another guy has a dream to meet his childhood sweetheart 40 years later. The two plots are connected in an artful way with excellent actors and clever, imaginative film editing. To every person over age 30 who wonders what life would have been like if you could re- direct your own life's plot, this film is for you. i.e. "What would life have been like if only...?" In one way or another, each of the the characters in this movie faces this dilemma and his or her own interesting way. Life happens and then we try to change things - either by trying to undo the things we have done or by fantasizing what things will be like when we finally get to do that one thing we've been wanting to do for so long.Robert Carlyle is a shy, timid baker on delivery who comes across a car wreck and a dying John Goodman. Both are trying to deal with life's inequities but its not until they meet in such a cataclysmic way that resolution occurs.See the movie. Too bad it doesn't have broader release...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Has A Special Resonance For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw this in the theatre but caught it recently on STARZ. Like Steve, I'm a Southern California boy(Ventura-born)and lived in Pasadena for eight years. But this film touched me as a There-But-For-The-Grace-Of-God story.I grew up in Northern California and saw my wife for the first time on her mother's 51st birthday, Feb. 17,1968, crossing the intersection of Telegraph and Durant Aves in Berkeley. I was not quite 14 and she was dressed in a black silk top hat, long black velvet cape and dress. That girl became the physical template for every girl I'd ever be attracted to.Over the next 21 years, I went through junior high and high school, joined the Navy and hunted the Great Steel Whales, got married and had two children with a woman I knew I didn't love. I was working in San Francisco for A.T.&amp;T. in the 1980's and started riding the Vallejo ferry into San Francisco in the summer of 1989, the same company my Dad had worked for as a deck hand at the time I saw her. Although I didn't know it at the time, the first person I met on the boat that day was her, 21 years later, sitting in my favorite seat outside.We started talking and found out we were both budding writers. Over the next few months, we read each other's work and started writing a spy novel together. We were also both trapped in bad marriages. Then three things happened to me in the last months on 1989. The first was cutting off a killer called the 580 shooter on the Oakland Freeway one midnight going to work. Then 6 weeks later the Loma Prieta Quake hit and while she was on the pier, I headed back into work and kept long-distance phone service working through the emergency. By this time she had confessed her feelings to me and I was hit out of left field. While I processed that, I had to realize that the only time I looked forward to in the day was the time I spent with her. The final straw occurred on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.They had repaired the cable cars by then and we got free cable cars with the ferry pass. We would walk to the California Street cable car from the ferry, hop aboard and ride up to Kearney St. where I would get off. She would continue up to Stockton St. where she would get off. That Wednesday, my daughter was sick so I stayed home to care for her. So, the cable car didn't stop at Kearney and made the light. Forty seconds later, a 50-ton construction crane collapsed into the intersection of California and Kearney, killing six people. When we talked next, we left together. It wasn't until a month later that she told me she used to hang out in Berkeley in the same place, time and wearing the same clothes I had seen her in that day. And if we hadn't had the courage to stand up for love, I would have never known it.That was 19 years ago and we have never been apart since. This film reminds me of what might have happened had I not had the courage that day. The fact that I've driven many of the streets on which the story is set and recognize most of the locations is a special bonus for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Moving Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this incredible film! It's touching and brilliant. I was so moved by the story.Take a look at this review from the Washington Post:'Hotchkiss': Dance-Floor Redemption By Sarah Kaufman Washington Post"Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School" has a clunky title but an elegant concept: that the fantasy of the fresh start is attainable for all of us. It's as easy as one, two, cha-cha-cha.Yes, this is another one of those movies about finding your own soul, and perhaps a soul mate, on the dance floor. But "Marilyn Hotchkiss" demonstrates that the same old construct can be made thrillingly fresh with the right components. In fact, this film does other power- of-dance movies one better by downplaying the dancing -- it's in there, but doled out carefully -- and underscoring what its brethren often lack: a compelling, wrenching and wonderfully inspiring story.It's the story of misfits, and how the most unforgettable girl on the dance floor is the one with the black eye. It's also the story of people locked in their pasts: their first kisses, dead wives, dead dreams. Robert Carlyle ("Angela's Ashes," "The Full Monty") plays Frank Keane, a baker on a delivery run who stumbles upon a horrific wreck on an otherwise deserted California highway. The accident victim has been nearly bifurcated by his car's crushed front end, but he's still lucid enough to implore the dumbstruck Frank to complete the mission he can't finish himself.Since the dying man, who cordially introduces himself as Steve, is played by John Goodman, he doesn't just blurt out his tale in an agonized gasp. Instead, he unspools it in that signature sleepy-raspy voice, unhurried by his fading vitals, as undaunted by death as if he's simply waiting his turn in the barber's chair. Steve was on his way, he tells Frank, to an appointment he made 40 years ago. It's with a girl he fell in love with when he was 12 and they were forced into dance classes together by their parents. No matter what happened in the meantime, they promised each other, they would meet again at Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School -- on that very same day that Steve happened to meet up with an 18-wheeler first.What follows is a deftly executed trick of weaving three different time spans together -- Frank's attempts to keep Steve talking as the paramedics work on him, Steve's flashbacks to an engagingly rendered 1960s childhood, and what happens to Frank when he goes to the dance school that night looking for Steve's lost love. As far-fetched as the plot seems (can someone really spill his guts while his guts are really spilling?), director Randall Miller, who also wrote the screenplay with his wife, Jody Savin, injects it with the emotional honesty and keen storytelling skills that make it work. (The feature is based on a short film by the same name that the couple created 15 years ago.)A good deal of the success is due to the film's narrow psychological scope. The characters are all broken, and broken in the same way. Take Frank, saddled with the past, by choice. He drives a vintage truck, listens to oldies, lives amid dark wainscoting and vintage furnishings. He speaks in a rolling Old World brogue. A widower, he carries around his grief like a prized antique. He's past due for a good, solid shake-up, which is what he gets from that withered dance ticket Steve gives him.Frank is part of a therapy circle of other messed-up widowers, among them the sweetly vulnerable Sean Astin ("The Lord of the Rings" hobbit Samwise Gamgee). And of course, the woman he meets on the dance floor (Marisa Tomei) is a train wreck. Nor is the present-day owner of the Hotchkiss school, the daughter (Mary Steenburgen) of the original Marilyn, all there herself. Steenburgen has a riveting star turn here: Her Marienne is weirdly remote and gracefully loopy, given to such whispery pronouncements as: "Dance is a powerful drug; it can exorcise your demons . . . and color your life in brilliant shades of magenta. . . . ARE YOU UP TO IT, Mr. Keane?"Well, Mr. Keane is not at all sure. His first night at the dance school ends with him alone and anguished on a dance floor, even when surrounded by women who crave his attentions. It's a powerful scene, crafted with restraint, as are so many others in the film. There are terrifically telling details throughout: Goodman's big, moist, doughy jowls, spreading out on either side of that mouth that keeps talking even as he lies on the gurney, blood from his near- evisceration pooling on his chest; cut to a view of a mournful Frank kneading a big flabby ball of dough in his bakery.Dancing soothes with its age-old balm. When men and women are isolated, when their hearts are sealed off, dancing -- especially ballroom dancing -- forces them to connect, to look each other in the eye, to hold hands and bring their bodies into sync. It opens the door to emotional freedom, passion, collaborative self-expression, as Frank finally discovers...For all its drama and poignancy, "Marilyn Hotchkiss" doesn't deal in pat sentimentality or hokiness. What Steve passed on to Frank was something more than just a ticket to the dance; it was hope and stubborn optimism, no matter the obstacles. That lesson infuses the rest of the picture, and leaves its mark after it's over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a screening of this recently, and I was pleasantly surprised at what turned out not to be formulaic (there have been a number of cathartic-style movies where dancing or some other activity has inspired someone -- Shall We Dance, Strictly Ballroom, etc.), but Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School is a sweet, quirky and mature look at getting past grief. Marilyn Hotchkiss is well-acted, especially Robert Carlyle -- whose shell-shocked expression throughout the earlier parts of the movie inspires tons of empathy -- and Mary Steenburgen, fragile but strong - and a strong supporting ensemble, and ultimately quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad... very bad excuse to theatrically release an old student film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Warning - no plot spoilers ahead, but movie spoilers nonetheless...* My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast. Wow - very, very wrong. This movie is an overdone, overwrought, and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot! The copyright date on the box said 2005, yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s, and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos. It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback, and therefore supposed to look old, but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s... then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up, and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences (yet it's a different, much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks). I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences, shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up (and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes). Thus, this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old, re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time. The shell story, shot in 2005, is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead (something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the "fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005?) These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful, overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie. Don't bother. There's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it's terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Didn't know what to expect but I laughed - I cried - I really enjoyed it! I saw it at its UK premiere at the Edinburgh Film Festival and really hope that it gets a UK distributor. And by the way Randall - the opening tune of your film was also in "Meet Joe Black" (closing credits of that film - really!) Either way - the music was good and there was an amazing cast for a small budget film including a cameo from Danny De Vito. The audience really enjoyed it and I don't think that I was the only one who was surprised to hear that one critic gave it a really low rating. I don't think that they can have been at the same film!I loved the way that the story was woven together with lots of flashbacks without it being confusing or messing up the flow of the film.A great performance by Robert Carlyle et al and a fantastic Friday night film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for viewers allergic to emotional manipulation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of movie millions of people love because it pushes all the right buttons at all the right times, and it pushes them hard. It seems real enough that they feel like it is talking directly to them personally, and yet it is unreal enough to create in them a wide range of intense emotional reactions within a relatively short time. The vast majority of reviews here prove that the formula works like a charm for a lot of people. If you are one of them, you will love this movie as much as those reviewers did. But this kind of movie has the opposite effect on me, and since there may be a few others like me out there, it is worth giving my reaction to it too.I am allergic to the heavyhanded emotional manipulation movies like this use to get the response I just described. To me it rings as false as a three dollar bill. The culprit is the screenplay, which goes for the emotional jugular in every scene, making every word, every action by every actor so fraught with emotion that I begin to feel suffocated. The result for me is an experience that is neither believable - at all - nor moving in any positive or pleasurable way. It leaves me feeling manipulated and cheated. A lot of great acting talent was squandered on this tripe.I do not mean to offend those who love this movie but to caution those who - like me - do not react well to emotional manipulation. I love being genuinely, spontaneously moved emotionally by a movie, but the heavyhanded technique used here backfires on me.</fullReview>

Don't let the tittle throw you, not sure it does the film justice. No disrespect to Mary Steenburgen who was wonderful as Marienne Hotchkiss. Not sure what more to say without giving away anything. Just don't look at the tittle and think you know what the film is about. Also interestingly part of the film was shot as an AFI short thesis film and completed years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promises to keep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some promises, like the one Stephen Mills made to Sue Gober when they were young, are often forgotten as life gets complicated. It's hard to imagine someone will still remember a pledge to meet with a childhood sweetheart forty years after it was made. Such is the premise of this delightful movie in which fate plays a big part of the story.When Frank Keane, a baker, meets Stephen, little does he know how his own life will be transformed after he is asked by Mills to go in search of the woman he promised to meet. What Frank finds is a group of lonely people that meets for a weekly ballroom dancing lesson led by the daughter of the founder of the school.Frank who is going through a rough time after his wife committed suicide, is caught by the gentle folks at the academy. Most of all, by Meredith, a young woman whose life is not exactly perfect and who suffers from beatings at the hand of a rough step-brother. Frank Keane, in turn, is part of a group of grieving widowers that meet to find a cure to their depression.Through flashbacks one gets to know Stephen Mills' story and what happened to him as a grown man. Paul's recovery from the sad state his wife's suicide has meant for him has a lot to do with his passion for the newly discovery therapy: ballroom dancing, as taught by the famous Marilyn Hotchkiss' daughter.Randall Miller expands on his 1990 short film of the same title giving it another perspective on the basic idea behind his first movie. There is a definite improvement as the film has opened up to better results. Some of the original cast return to repeat some of the original roles.The best thing in the film is Robert Carlyle. He is not a matinée idol in any shape, or form, but playing against type gives him an opportunity to show his versatility. Marisa Tomei, seen as Meredith, does a fine work as the shy Meredith. Donny Wahlberg plays the brutish Randall Ipswich. Mary Steenburgen makes a fine Marianne Hotchkiss. John Goodman plays Stephen Mills. The large supporting cast makes an excellent contribution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The possibilities of a Classic, but.............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a while for me to get a copy of the DVD but viewed Marilyn Hotchkiss today and I feel it has the possibilities of a Classic but felt it was over saturated with unrelated scenes, name actors, i.e. John Goodman, and Marisa Tomei and an unbelievably cheesy accident scene which distracted me from concentrating on the marvelous portrayals by Robert Carlyle, Sonja Braga, Elden Henson and Donnie Wahlberg. I felt there were much too many flashbacks of the nostalgia of childhood , which I found boring and superfluous and the bereavement/ therapy scenes were just included to add weight to the project, could have worked but none of the testimonials convinced me one iota of these men actually grieving. It make me wonder if it's the American Male or all Males who have trouble expressing grief and heartbreak without trepidation.Pity, I waited 06 months to view this film because the synopsis, which sounded appealing and has universal appeal, however, It's like the old proverb, "When too much cargo is placed in craft, all sinks to the bottom."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Carlyle shines in this heartfelt story of love and loss. Frank (Carlyle) is driving to work in his bakery truck and he sees a man who has been fatally injured in a car accident. He stops to help the man, Steve, played by John Goodman. It turns out, Steve was on his way to meet the girl he loved as a young boy. They made a pact to meet on the 5th day of the 5th month of the 5th year of the new millennium. He was supposed to meet his love at the school of ballroom dancing where their love first bloomed. Since he can't make it, Steve asks Frank to go in his place to let the girl know what happened and that he tried to make it. Frank goes to the dance school, but doesn't find the girl there. He ends up participating in the class and keeps coming back. He meets Meredith, played by Marisa Tomei, and their instant attraction is clear. Donnie Wahlberg is excellent as Meredith's protective and controlling stepbrother, not to mention a wonderful dancer. Mary Steenburgen is great as the teacher of the dance class. She is very serious about the class, which makes her funny, although she is not meaning to be. There were many great small performances by Danny Devito, Ernie Hudson, Miguel Sandoval, David Paymer, Adam Arkin, Sean Astin...the list goes on. The movie goes back and forth between the conversation Frank has with Steve about how he met his young love as he is dying, the dance class, and Frank's therapy group. It does seem like it could be an extremely depressing movie, but it left me with a good feeling. It was about finding love and rising above the bad things life throws our way. That's what I took away from it, anyway. Not a blockbuster, but a nice little indie gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real charmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CHARM SCHOOl stars Robert "Ravenous" Carlyle as a grieving widower who comes back to life after a run-in with errant motorist John Goodman sends him to an old-fashioned dance school, where he encounters new love, new life and new meaning. Marissa Tomei (where has she been?) plays his newfound love, an emotionally fragile woman who is in the thrall of her mean-spirited stepbrother (Donnie "Sixth Sense" Wahlberg), who also attends the dance studio. Nobody and nothing is quite what it seems in this simple little tale of love lost and found, as you will discover by the end. The biggest shocker involves Carlyle tracking down Goodman's long-lost love, which I guarantee will have you talking about the movie long after it is over. A wonderful film, populated by some of Hollywood's most recognizable faces (David Paymer, Ernie Hudson, Camerin Manheim, Adam Arkin and Danny DeVito) in small roles -- although this is the kind of movie where no role is really small. Along with the wonderful Carlyle and Tomei (I kept saying to myself, imagine running into Marissa Tomei in a rundown dance studio) Mary Steenburgen absolutely shines as the oddly repressed daughter of the woman who founded the dance school. Steenburgen's character hysterically launches every session by remarking that her mother, who has been dead since 1972, "cannot be with us this evening." Based on a short film from 1990 by the same director. Make sure you watch that short, which is included on the DVD and narrated by William Hurt. And keep a box of tissues near at hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should not be called Ballroom Dancing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the attention recently focused on Ballroom Dancing, this film was disappointing. Actors commonly spend a great deal of time developing their character. Stunt double withstanding, if one is to be on camera riding a horse, or fencing in a duel, or playing a song and dance man as Richard Gere in "Chicago", there is some serious preparation necessary to bring the character to life...thank-you Richard. How would we have reacted had Mr Pitt repeatedly tripped over his shield in "Troy"? I was so distracted by the dance shots in this film, I found myself rubbing my eyes and forehead in disbelief. I will not say that the script was void of merit, for I wasn't able to pay that much attention. I simply kept being pulled off track. On the upside, there was a nice pool of talent. John Goodman choked my heart, as usual. Still, I imagine the screening was very sobering for all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Way to Lisa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed as it is, without the cynicism that comes with having seen too many movies both good and bad, MARILYN HOTCHKISS BALLROOM DANCE AND CHARM SCHOOL is an affecting picture about disaffected, bruised people whose destinies converge in this little motif of a tableau. An expanded concept from a short film of the same name that was released in 1990, this is a very romantic (i.e. "escapist") take on lost love, and the intent to rekindle it in a time and place where dreams have been lost, people have outgrown their innocence, and the only thing lingering over their heads is a small sliver of hope to return to that safe haven.The movie cuts between time zones in a style closer to the fragmented storytelling of Guillermo Arriaga's 21 GRAMS and THE THREE BURIALS OF MELQUIADES ESTRADA, and changes palettes according to each: blue for the fateful encounter between Robert Carlyle's and John Goodman's character, pastel for the flashback sequence where we see the title character, and a more balanced tone for the story as it eventually unfolds from Carlyle's point of view. It's a technique that works in unraveling the parallels of the characters as children, and seeing them now, as broken adults.It almost becomes a thriller in a way that is less dependent on an intentional story within a story. Carlyle's quiet baker, trying to locate Goodman's childhood sweetheart Lisa, stumbles on another situation where another shy girl, played by Marisa Tomei, is being brutalized by her half-brother, played by Donnie Wahlberg, and discovers a second chance at love. All the while, the specter of this ideal Lisa hanging over the ballroom and Marienne Hotchkiss' sensual-robotic commands, which makes her actual introduction late into the story as a bitter woman all the more heartbreaking. Camryn Manheim plays out all the anger and sadness into her brief scene where she at first pretends not to know what the hell this stranger is doing at her door, and later, alone, reveals to us her pain.An imperfect movie in the way it decides to resolve supporting conflicts and uses the voice-over narration of John Goodman to near unbelievable levels, but again, this is an escapist feature length film made with what seems to be genuine love for the material and devoid of all manipulation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Saturday Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great movie! I went with my mother this weekend. We were just talking about maybe taking a dance class, but it began to rain, so we went to the movies instead. Coincidence, I think not! It was just what we needed. My mom is divorced and I recently went through a break up. This was a great "chick flick".First of all, I love Robert Carlyle. He was brilliant as usual. He just makes me smile and he really came through and brought me into the story. It was kinda slow in the beginning but I enjoyed the ride.Marisa Tomei is beautiful. Everyone may not think so but I feel like I can relate to her.The movie had its enjoyable and lighter moments and the sad and touching moments. I really like Robert Carlyle/(Frank's) character transition. John Goodman was okay, I was expecting better.Great Saturday movie! Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had a ball!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This happens when you let your stomach decide, and not your hands. My hands wanted to take Flight Plan of the shelf at my local videoshop, but then I came across this film and my stomach told me, that's the one to make your day! And it most certainly was and did! For a long time I haven't seen such a broken yet lovable character as this Frank Keane, played so soulfully by Robert Carlyle. Marisa Tomei was amazing, as was Mary Steenburgen. Equally I enjoyed watching all those widowers thawing up in the ballroom in the end. Wahlberg, Paymer, Arkin, all of them in small roles, but brilliant nevertheless.The music did the rest. What a gem of a score, I hope I can find it on CD somewhere. Not just the songs, for dancing and background, but also the original music by Mark Adler was mesmerizing. A treat for everybody who loves violins.The film is out now on DVD in Germany, so nobody has an excuse any more, get out and get this film. Don't say I didn't recommend it! Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all of the improbable plot twists, and gaping unexplained errors (why would a 3rd generation California baker have a Northern England accent?) and distractingly horrible haircuts, I found this film very appealing. Many of these quaint, quirky and sweet people could only exist in a fictitious movie world, but when you see them try to learn to dance, all is forgiven. After seeing a slew of dance movies lately, it's refreshing to see someone genuinely clumsy on a dance floor, and actually NOT learn all the steps the first class! The diverse cast creates a story and world worth spending time in, and life lessons worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweetly Charming for Nostalgia and Dancing Cares Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School" is a slow paced, but sweetly charming and amusing film. It is like a "Mad Hot Ballroom" for grown-ups, crossed with the period feel of "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio" and some of the nostalgia wallowing of "Mrs. Henderson Presents". Extended from a 1990 short film by co-writer/director Randall Miller, much is made that it takes place in 2005 but each of the three periods that are stories within stories has a different cinematographic tint, blue for the opening situation, yellow for 1962 (that are actually from the original film) and color for moving forward.But the small matinée audience responded with warm chuckles to the humor and poignancy, especially for the flashbacks to twelve year olds that wonderfully captures boys and girls. (Recreating boys' junior war games was particularly effective).While these are all non-dancing actors, with, unusually, no ringers in sight, the choreography is pretty lame and there's very little real dance step learning that goes on, and I don't even watch "Dancing with the Stars" though this should appeal to those fans. But this is not about the serious amateurs like in "Roseland". This much more about human behavior than dance steps as the Misses Hotchkiss seem to accidentally work a lot like "Nanny McPhee". The large ensemble of recognizable actors is enjoying mostly playing against type, such as Robert Carlyle as an almost monosyllabic baker (like Nicholas Cage in "Moonstruck") compared to his usual motor mouth, even as the script manages to finesse his accent; Marisa Tomei as a shy wallflower (there's a leg here at issue rather than the arm in "Moonstruck"); Mary Steenburgen as a robotic emcee; Camryn Manheim in a vivid cameo; Donnie Wahlberg as an ineffectual Lord of the Dance (with a joke that "he's not even Irish" as several others also play against their usual ethnics). Some of the characters, though, are a bit one-note, such as an exaggeratedly lascivious Sonia Braga and a weepy widower. John Goodman does have the longest wounded monologue scene outside most opera and Shakespeare, but that happens frequently on "E.R." as well. The now grown-up kid from the original film has a small role as Carlyle's co-worker, and it's not far-fetched that we could be seeing that in his imagination.The opening rendition of "Over the Rainbow" (I couldn't catch if it was by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole or covered in his style) has been way over-used in too many films, but the arrangements of dance music and the musical period selections are fresh.While the outline of the film is predictable, as each person faces their grief, guilt or other family issues and brightens through dancing and human contact, it is overall a lovely and heart warming film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Charming, Mostly Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had to write a comment. I can't believe how many people found this movie poignant and charming and touching. I hoped I would. I did not.I was surprised to find this movie at my local cineplex. The reviews in the paper weren't very good, but the ad was intriguing. The title is awkwardly long, I hoped the movie was not. There was only room enough on the box office sign to put the words "Marilyn Hotchkiss", and there were at least 2 couples in line were confused about what "ballroom" movie it was they were there to see. I suspect there will be some audiences who really wanted to see the Antonio Banderas movie (Take The Lead) instead. I haven't seen that one yet, but it looks like a better bet.The movie is obviously low budget, and the fact that they nabbed so many name actors to appear in it is both appealing and distracting. It's almost like the result of some contest for "who can get the most name actors in their low-budget movie?". Perhaps they were following the trend set by last year's winner of that contest, "Crash". Most of these name actors in "Marilyn Hotchkiss..." have very little to do, and some of them are surprisingly awful. There are exceptions. Robert Carlyle, in the lead, is quite good, though at times it seems he can't quite decide whether or not to use his native Scottish accent. His character is a baker whose family has owned a bakery in Pasadena, California "since 1903", so it would be logical that at least he and his father before him were born and grew up in the United States. Still, Carlyle is otherwise very genuine and is the backbone of this movie. Donnie Wahlberg is also a welcome stand-out in his role as one of the patrons of the Ballroom Dancing and Charm School. Marisa Tomei gives a nice performance, as do several of the other "name actors" who have minor roles, including David Paymer, Adam Arkin, and Ernie Hudson (as members of Carlyle's widower's support group) and Sonia Braga (who is one of the ladies at the dance class). Mary Steenburgen, as the leader of the dance class, gives an interesting performance. I'm not usually a fan of her work. I don't always believe what she says -- she always seems to be "acting". But in this case her theatrical style is very appropriate and suits her and the role. Sean Astin, of whom I am a fan, doesn't fare as well. Had this been the first film I'd ever seen him in, I'd have thought, "That is just not a very good actor".Others on the minus side are Camryn Manheim, who stops in to give a one-scene one-note performance -- and it's not a note you'd want to hear over and over again. At least her scene is short. Which leads me to another one-note performance that seems endless -- The winner of the Lousiest Acting in an Independent Feature Award goes to John Goodman. I have even greater respect for Robert Carlyle's talent in coming up with such an honest performance while having to act with Goodman, who is so unbelievable and phony. Danny DeVito appears briefly in one scene, as if to fulfill the star quota. Among the several non-name actors that are spattered throughout the film, there is one that was conspicuous, the only actor I didn't recognize in Carlyle's widower's support group, a sad-sack faced actor named David St. James, whose every appearance involves him crying. Though I imagine it's intended to be comedic, it is so over-the-top, reminiscent of Stan Laurel or the Cowardly Lion, he seems to have been stuck in the wrong movie.The writing is all over the place, some good, some bad, some preposterous. I won't include a spoiler, but there's a scene in the bakery that would not only violate health code standards, but have you seriously consider that low-carb diet. I can't say the directing is all bad. Though he wasn't able to get good performances out of all of the actors, director Randall Miller has managed to come up with some nice imagery. His skill at photographing dance isn't always great, but I did like one particularly memorable shot panning across the feet of the ladies waiting in line to dance. He's chosen two different cinematography styles to denote flashback. The scenes from the original short (made 15 years ago), of the young kids in dancing class, are given an overly grainy look. (Or maybe that was what the entire short originally looked like). The John Goodman scenes, flashing back to the car accident, are all in that over-exposed, washed-out look that has become popular in many films. The first time I saw that look in a movie, I thought it looked like bad photography, like the filmmakers didn't have the money to do it properly so the footage would look "good". I thought it looked cheap. But now that I've seen it in major studio films, like "Munich", I recognize that it isn't cheap, it's a choice. It's simply a choice that doesn't appeal to me. It makes those scenes look even more strident than John Goodman's acting. In "Marilyn Hotchkiss...", the many different styles make it look like an exercise in Photoshop Filters.I really wanted to like this movie. Instead, I found myself shaking my head in disbelief through much of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ballroom Bliss!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of those who haven't read the Rex Reed review in the NY Observer let me say this is one of the best films of the year...Here's the full review:Ballroom Blissby Rex ReedAt the movies, there isn't much to write home about, but compared with the violence and filth of today's Hollywood action epics and the creeping deadliness of all the independent productions that look like they were made for $100, a sweet, unpretentious and heartfelt little movie like Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing and Charm School begins to look like a wayward valentine from the dead-letter office, lost in transit and delivered late.A despondent and recently widowed bread baker named Frank Keane (played by the sometimes unintelligible Scottish actor Robert Carlyle, thankfully exchanging his thick brogue for a more decipherable Irish accent) is driving down a California highway when he finds a man seriously injured in a car accident. Although the injured driver (John Goodman) is near death, 911 tells Frank to keep him conscious and talking until the paramedics arrive. An extraordinary story unfolds when the stranger reveals that he's on his way to fulfill a promise made 40 years earlier to meet his childhood sweetheart at the Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School, where they first met as kids?and that he's broken out of prison to do it.Frank keeps his appointment but never dreams that when he enters the old social club in Pasadena, his own fate will take a remarkable right turn. The original Marilyn passed on in 1972. But her dance classes are still conducted by her grown daughter (Mary Steenburgen), and they have such an unexpectedly liberating effect on the shy, inarticulate Frank that even the miserable members of his group-therapy sessions for grieving widowed husbands move to the ballroom, and the Thursday-night lindy hops and tangos become metaphors for exorcising demons and opening up new doors to hope and affirmation.Directed by Randall Miller and co-written by Mr. Miller and Jody Savin, the movie is similar in theme to Shall We Dance? But unlike that film, it doesn't narrow its focus to what happens inside the classroom. The story is complex, involving a variety of characters at different ages in their lives, so the structure understandably has a hopscotch effect, with three different looks: The past has a historic sepia-tone quality, the California-freeway scenes between Mr. Carlyle and the dying Mr. Goodman have the bleached and antiseptic hue of an ambulance interior, and the ballroom scenes that grow from awkwardness to passion are rich and colorful.The performances are whimsical and touching, with solid and human portraits etched by Marisa Tomei, Donnie Wahlberg, Sean Astin, Sonia Braga, David Paymer, Adam Arkin, Camryn Manheim and Danny DeVito, among others. Today's movies are so bad that when respected performers with established reputations find a script they believe in, they work for next to nothing. By the end of this film, every life has been changed or impacted in positive ways through the group experience of ballroom dancing. The point of the film is that anything is possible when you open your heart to new experiences? the feel-good pleasures in a movie with this much positive thinking are undeniable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>makes me wanna dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the best of the 'get on the dance floor' movies. i bet it will make each and everyone of you wanna take dance classes, or simply dance wherever you are.that is only the side effect, though.the movie itself is so emotional, so crazy, so lovely, and it draws you in so deep that it makes you sad / happy for all the characters.the movie depicts a man drawn in into another mans to-be life where he feels awkward at first, but he learns to love it and stays with it, thus changing the lives of everyone around him.this movie is about love, forgiveness, humanity and dancing ;) 10/10 of course. nothing short of great casting here as well as amazing storytelling. a must see if i ever saw one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We need more movies like this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My daughter and I saw the premiere of Marilyn Hotchkiss at Sundance, 2005. It was by far our favorite of all we saw. It is refreshing to watch something with your family that is intelligent and not animated (meaning not a cartoon!) and not offensive in any way. It is a great character study - love the way it intertwines with the original short. Marisa Tomei and Mary Steenburgeon are wonderfully heartbreaking and Robert Carlyle plays his character with great sensitivity. I loved him in The Full Monty but this is better. John Goodman is great as well. I've been waiting a year to see this film again and have searched for it in vain. I am thrilled that it has FINALLY been picked up and will be in theaters on March 24th. I'll be going opening day and I'll take ALL of my family and friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was awesome ! Donnie Wahlberg was so perfect. The metaphor that was created through Ballroom dancing was really one of the best I have seen. I really loved this movie, great ballroom dancing scenes, great story, great acting and beautifully shot. A great little movie all around. I saw the Premier in NY this past weekend with a bunch of people and we all loved it. Maria Tomei was great and Robert Carlyle was awesome. I really liked the way that he weaved in the old film into the new one -- it was really genius. It made me think back to the days before I liked girls and having my first little flings. Even the brief appearance by Danny Devito was great. I am not sure what else this Director, Randall Miller has done but I sure hope to see more films from him. If you have not already seen this film please go see it immediately - it will definitely inspire you to change your life and taking the lead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you like long, slow, artsy-fartsy movies with lots of black &amp; white flashbacks that go on forever ? Then you'll love this one.There are some good actors here, but this film represents their worst work. John Goodman's performance, as an accident victim, is lost. He looks about twice as obese as I remember him, and his face crowds the screen. Frankly, I couldn't get through it, and Donna Grayson's previous comments are completely inexplicable. She must have been involved in the production and is trying to beat the dead horse of promoting the film.Avoid this film like the plague, and you'll be a much happier person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unfortunate Title for an Unfortunate Film Ostensibly About Spiritual Reawakening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-director Randall Miller tries far too hard to make a multi-layered film about spiritual reawakening that he defaults into either formula or incoherence to move his low-budget movie along. With its unwieldy title signaling its contrivance, the 2006 dramedy, co-written by Miller and his wife Jody Savin, is an oddly unsatisfying film that attempts to track three different timelines through jumpy edits and differing film stock. Filmed in irritating bleached tones, the first storyline focuses on Frank Keane, an Irishman who moved his family's baking business to California. Shell-shocked from his wife's recent suicide, he comes upon a road accident which has left the driver badly hurt and pinned inside his car. The victim is Steve Mills, an overweight, seemingly gregarious man who was rushing to meet Linda, his childhood crush from forty years earlier, in the ballroom where they last saw each other.This kick-starts the second storyline, which flashes back to Steve's pre-adolescence when he accidentally gave Linda a black eye during a rough game of British Bulldog. With heavy echoes of "The Wonder Years", this portion of the movie is actually footage from Miller's 1990 short with the same title. It shows Steve and Linda first dancing at the Marilyn Hotchkiss ballroom. With Steve sharing his memories with Frank and Frank attempting to keep Steve conscious on the way to the hospital, we are given the third storyline which takes place again in the Marilyn Hotchkiss ballroom, this time in the present day. This time, in Steve's place, Frank shows up for dance class trying to find the now adult Linda amid a gallery of eccentric characters learning to dance under the tutelage of the late Marilyn's daughter, Marienne. Even more characters are introduced by way of Frank's therapy support group of recently widowed men.The cumulative result is a hodgepodge of artificial moments that feed into Miller's overriding theme of getting on with one's life in spite of the barriers one faces. For such a potentially strong ensemble, the performances are variable though mainly because most of the actors are not given enough screen time to flesh out their stereotypical characters. With his mangy-looking hair and sad eyes, Robert Carlyle does well enough as Frank, though his zombie-like behavior at the outset is enough to unsettle anyone. John Goodman plays Steve as the accident victim, though the combination of his bulky, uncomfortable-looking frame and his wheezing delivery is hard to watch for an extended period. Marisa Tomei affectingly portrays Frank's new love interest, Meredith, who holds a secret and has an intractable link to her constant dance partner, Randall, played convincingly by Donnie Wahlberg as an egocentric bully who feels he owns the dance floor.Others are simply wasted in smaller roles ? an affected Mary Steenburgen as the prim Marienne who demands order and courtesy in her late mother's ballroom; Sonia Braga as a flirtatious dancer; and as members of Frank's support group, Sean Astin, Adam Arkin, David Paymer and Ernie Hudson. The ending contains something of a twist, and Camryn Manheim and Danny DeVito show up late in the film in intriguing cameos. But by that point, it all comes too late due to the overlapping story lines and sluggish pacing. The DVD has rather perfunctory commentary from Miller, Savin and actor Elden Hensen, who plays both Frank's bakery co-worker in the modern sequences and Sam in the vintage flashbacks filmed in 1990 when he was thirteen. The other significant extra is the original 1990 short with William Hurt providing the memory flashback voice-over as the adult Sam. The package strangely does not make clear that this is the inspiration for the later film, so it seems like a patched-together version of the flashback scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Annoyance for True Dancers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie held my interest, but it did three things that just bug the hell out of me, and I couldn't forgive it. First, it was teeming with anachronisms, from the dresses and hairstyles of the little girls in the "1960s" dance class (these scenes, it turns out, were filmed in 1990, which partly explains why everything looks so late-'80s), to a 1960s tyke declaring, "This sucks!" Second, it portrayed the past as an impossibly innocent, cornball, cheesy time when everyone's life was supposedly lived in terms of "Leave it to Beaver" meets prep school.But the thing that most got on my nerves was that this was a movie supposedly dealing with dance, and it had not a single decent dancer in it. Not a soul in the film danced in time with any of the music played, and Carlyle's big scene in which he supposedly makes a big show of having loosened up enough to dance is played almost as if he is doing something impressive. Why do this when there are so many terrific dancers out there who could have been cast? I couldn't believe Steenburgen as a dance instructor, because she was a terrible dancer who could not keep time. I understand that the people in the class are not professionals, but none of them seemed to be learning any sense of rhythm or dance ability at all. The movie was not purporting to be a "Strictly Ballroom"-type parody, but it almost had that feel. If you really want to see a film about people learning to ballroom dance, and having their lives improved by it, watch the Japanese version of "Shall We Dance?" Oh, and West Coast Swing was not "an element that, with Charleston, went into the development of Lindy hop." West Coast swing derived from Lindy about 40 years after Lindy was born.Yeesh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God help us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me see if I've got this straight: John Goodman, recalling his childhood after a car accident, is represented in flashbacks by 13 year-old child actor Eldon Henson -- the pug-nosed kid who carried Kieran Culkin on his shoulders in "The Mighty." Henson doesn't look anything like Goodman, but I'm willing to play along with it. So far.But later in the film, a character who has nothing at all to do with Goodman -- young or old -- shows up, playing a friend of the main character (Robert Carlyle). Oddly enough, this friend looks uncannily like a grown-up version of Eldon Henson. Turns out it IS Henson, now 15 years older than in the childgood flashbacks. Apparently, the flashbacks were scenes taken from an earlier short film by the same director, who decided to incorporate16mm footage into a 35mm widescreen feature (not the best idea for technical reasons, if nothing else). The short was made in 1990, when Henson was still a child. Now he's 28. God only knows why the director decided to stick the adult Henson into the film as a character completely unrelated to the one he played in Goodman's childhood flashback. And the character's name? Sampson -- perhaps some sort of in-joke referencing his part in "The Mighty." You with me so far, or you want to drink?So now we've got a cute blonde child actor playing the childhood version of the decidedly un-cute (and obese) John Goodman, and the same blonde kid as an ADULT playing the main character's best friend in the present. On top of all that, in the flashbacks, the cute blonde kid's dark-haired friend looks very much like a young Robert Carlyle, making the audience wonder for a moment if some kind of personal interpretation thing isn't going on. Was the director trying to suggest that Carlyle is imagining Goodman's story, using his own personal recollections to depict the memories? It's quite a stretch, to say the least.Things get worse: an unnecessary bleach-bypass look for the accident scenes, a confusing, non-linear story structure, a1940s-style dance class -- apparently stuck in a time warp -- and Donnie Wahlberg as a tough guy (for some reason obsessed with ballroom dancing) all add to the confusion."Marilyn Hotchkiss..." was a good idea for a movie. What it needed was a director who knew how to tell a simple story without resorting to clichés and complications: trendy non-linear scene-shuffling, unnecessarily confusing cinematography, muddled casting and a manipulative, wall-to-wall Thomas Newman-influenced score to make it all seem meaningful (Newman is one of my favorite composers, but music should enhance emotion, not create it).Had the director been skillful enough to simplify matters, this film might have had a chance of someday being mentioned in the same breath as a Frank Capra classic. But now, in the second century of film -- and thanks to people like Quentin Tarantino, Oliver Stone and Steve Soderbergh -- we have drama being seriously diluted by technique -- exactly what this heartfelt little story didn't need.Not everything is a misstep, fortunately. Robert Carlyle? Not a bad choice for the lead: a disillusioned widower who each day wishes good morning to his wife's ashes. Carlyle may be a bit blank-eyed, but considering he's the nutcase from "Trainspotting," he's pretty effective here, reminding me a bit of Viggo Mortenson in "History of Violence" -- another minimalist acting job which works, but is certainly nothing to write home about. Mary Steenburgen? Always a delight to see her in anything, and she looked and acted great here. Same with Marisa Tomei, who plays Wahlberg's beautiful step-sister and Carlyle's romantic interest. My guess is the majority of the cast probably worked for scale or less just to be part of an offbeat little picture with a positive ending.But thanks to the deficiencies in the writing and directing, the overall effect is much less than the sum of its parts. These fine actors all contributed to a minor footnote in film history, rather than a contemporary classic.Audiences will probably respond favorably because the film is essentially good-hearted, ultimately delivering uplifting messages we all want to believe in: redemption, hope, forgiveness, surviving tragedy.But real filmmakers will notice the movie fails in as many ways as it succeeds. The lesson here is simple: just because "21 Grams" got away with an experimental structure doesn't mean it's right for every film. And if "Traffic" or "Minority Report" were somehow justified in using desaturated images to create a slightly surreal world, this story has no reason for attempting the same, as far as I can see. Surreal traffic accident? All the washed-out look does is make viewers wonder for the first 10 minutes if something's wrong with the print.For all of you who love this film -- and I imagine there will be more than a few staunch supporters -- I do agree it's good to see a movie that at least attempts to deal sensitively -- and sometimes humorously -- with serious issues of life, death and the sometimes tragic nature of existence.But the real tragedy, in my view, is that the art and craft of film-making has peaked and is now in serious decline, dying just a little bit more each day. The great directors are mostly gone now, and with them, their genius for effective and straightforward storytelling. Richard Fleischer is dead, and someone named Randall Miller is in the director's chair? God help us all.</fullReview>
