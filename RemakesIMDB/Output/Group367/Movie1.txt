		<shortDescription>Felt like being on Broadway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an Excellent film! I went to an advance screening and left with my jaw aching from all the laughing and grinning.At first, it felt the film was just the play in front of the camera, but the style eventually worked, turning the movie audience into a Broadway audience. At times, the director took the actors outside almost as a fun way of saying "see? with a camera, we can now move around!" Nonetheless, by the time we get to the most famous musical number, the audience was applauding and cheering after each song. During the credits, it felt like a curtain call with applauds for each actor.So much fun and very deserving of the name Mel Brooks this film is great for the holidays (with the more adult jokes being concealed in song, and only minor swearing) older children and teenagers should get a kick out of this fast paced, fun, and very memorable film.Also, just a bit of advice: stay until the end of the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Producers (2005) **** Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Uma Thurman, Will Farrell, Gary Beach, Roger Bart Dir. Susan StromanI don't think the critics know what they are talking about. This movie rocked! It took me back to the old days of movie musicals. You know, the Bugsby Berkley years, big and flashy with hum able songs. Based on the 1968 film starring Zero Maestel and Gene Wilder, and the smash hit on Broadway, the story of a failing Producer named Max Bialystock who has just had the worst show in town close called Funny Boy, a musical version of Hamlet. Distraught he runs into accountant Leo Bloom who comes up with the notion that you can make more money with a flop than with a hit. Max overjoyed to hear such wonderful news lays it all out. Step 1. They find the worst play ever written, the "mother lode" as Max calls it when he comes across Springtime for Hitler, written by neo-nazi Franz Liebkind. Step 2. Hire the worst director, a prime and proper gay man named Roger Debris who wants to keep everything gay! Step 3. Raise 2 million dollars from Max's backers: harmless little old ladies looking for a last roll in the hay. Step 4 Open on Broadway and before you can say step 5 they close and run off to Rio. All goes well until Springtime for Hitler becomes a success leaving Leo and Max in the dust.People have been comparing it to the original, which sure it has some of the same lines, and the story is the same, but both shows have something different to offer. You get songs in this version that you don't get in the original. Nathan Lane tears up the screen and will have you in stitches as Max; his show stopping number "Betrayed" will have you applauding. Matthew Broderick is also very good as Leo who can't grab life by the balls and go. He sings "I Wanna Be A Producer" with such gusto and dances with Ms. Uma Thurman, who is amazing as Ulla, and their dance number has sheds of the old Astaire and Rogers's musicals of the 30s.Also excellent, are Will Farrell as the Nazi who speaks to his birds and Gary Beach and Roger Bart as Roger De Bris and Carmen Ghia they gay "couple" who want to put Springtime for Hitler on the stage, both stand out in the cast, and both played the roles on Broadway. Other familiar faces you will see are Jon Lovitz as Leo's accounting firms boss, Michael McKean as one of the prisoners and Richard Kind as the Jury Foreman who took over in the Nathan Lane role on the stage.Susan Stroman doesn't make the camera cuts flashy, they are simple, which makes it more enjoyable to watch the dance numbers, from the opening number to the hilarious "Along Came Bialy" when the old ladies do a dance break with walkers, to "Keep it Gay" to the uproarious Springtime for Hitler number. The best-staged number was probably "I Wanna Be A Producer" as it has shades from the 30s mixed with modern day. It was wonderful! If you listen to some critics who choose to say "this film show inexperience" or "not as good as the original" you are missing a terrific movie musical that is just as good as Chicago! Plus Mel Brooks was also standing there at the helm with Ms. Stroman. Be advised to stay until the very end of the credits to view something special! Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much better than anyone had the right to expect. Lane and Broderick are superb. Even moving. Look what I'm saying, moving. I mean it. Their commitment is contagious. The comedy in itself is shamelessly anachronistic. The gay jokes belong to the period in which the original Producers were conceived. The tone is consistent with that period, the film happens at an incredible pace and you smile from beginning to end. How marvelous to see Matthew Broderick dance. This is an actor who never had an Academy Award nomination and his performances have always been top notch and his range runs the famous gamut from A to Z. What a courageous actor. I couldn't believe he could get away with the "I'm in pain! I'm wet and I'm still hysterical" scene without making me miss Gene Wilder but he did. Nathan Lane is a force of nature. His Max is very much a tribute to Zero Mostel, especially to his hair but this Max is Nathan Lane through and through. Uma Thurman is a delight and I had a great time at the movies. What else do you want out of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading critics' reviews I thought twice about seeing this film. But I needn't have worried as this was fantastic entertainment. I don't seem to care that the director has kept the stagy sets and took a literal approach to adapting a stage musical for the big screen. It was a fun time from beginning to end.While his portrayal of Leo Bloom was too much like Gene Wilder's, Matthew Broderick was simply divine when dancing. Indeed it was an interesting to see the top half of his body so still and rigid while his legs and feet were moving with such poise and grace. Nathan Lane never seems to disappoint, he is simply brilliant. His physical resemblance to Zero Mostel is obvious but the mannerisms are all his own. Uma Thurman is good as Ula and Will Ferrell rediscovers his funny.I didn't even mind the over-the-stop stereotypes. Gary Beach and Roger Bart are screamingly funny. Springtime for Hitler is the best part of the show and nice to see John Barrowman giving it his all as the blond Nazi.If you want to be entertained for a few hours then this is the movie to go see, don't let the critics put you off!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic surprise. I've seen Luke-warm reviews about this film, largely saying that the theatrical basis (the Broadway show) is oh-so-evident. Well, in my opinion, this is one of the film's strengths. It's a well-intentioned performance and is close enough to the original Producers, and so unlike it, that the musical remake is justified.I love musicals, especially musical comedy. This film is a sop to the musical comedy, with good performances from the leads, and Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell, who all appear to be enjoying themselves.The central (staged) number "Springtime for Hitler" is brilliantly choreographed, with suitably outrageous costumes. Gary Beach as a brilliantly camp Hitler completes this excellent scene. And the bratwurst!! The editing in this sequence - camera panning to the gob-smacked audience is brilliant. This is a film that salutes and spoofs musicals. It's an absolute delight</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, there was Mel Brooks' clever movie "The Producers." That got adapted into a Tony-winning stage musical. Then the musical became adapted into a movie. This hilarious spectacle is sure to please! Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick return as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, the same roles they made famous on Broadway. Lane is a riot, channeling Zero Mostel's bombastic character. Meanwhile, Broderick surprises as he does a decent take on Gene Wilder's original hysterical act. Will Ferrell scores laughs as Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind, and Uma Thurman puts in a good song and dance as Swedish sexpot Ulla. The movie perfectly catches the style of the old-fashioned musical, with a large serving of slapstick. This snappy production is sure to be a hit with everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the original movie and had the pleasure of seeing the wonderful Broadway show in 2003, so I was more than expecting to love this remake. Unfortunately it didn't live-up to my expectations on a number of fronts.Most fundamentally, it seemed more of a cinematic rendering of the stage show than a remake of the movie - the problem is that it utterly lacks the charm of the 1968 film, and fails to capture the excitement and energy of the show. This is not to do with the actors, who all put in great performances and do the best job possible with their roles. Though, I wonder if it was a good idea to keep the leads from Broadway - playing a part on stage is very different from doing the same thing in a movie. This is at the heart of what is wrong with this movie - it is trying to be cinematic and theatrical at the same time.Also, they have cut some of the funniest scenes and changed some of the best lines from the original. Why, I wonder? For example, the first encounter between Max and Leo in the original movie is hilarious and dramatic - a magnificent opening set-piece, with drama, humour and conflict. In this version, Leo just knocks on the door and introduces himself. Bit of a damp squib, really.Overall, I am not sure what to make of this movie. I would probably have enjoyed it more if I had not seen the original. But not much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total disaster on toast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing is more arrogant than a film that assumes it's going to be a hit before it even goes into production. Such a disaster is this musical remake of "The Producers." Stagebound, presentational instead of reactive, and more leaden than an Iron Cross, it betrays everything about the 1968 classic -- not to mention raising questions how anything this klunky could ever work, must less be a hit, on the Broadway stage. Reportedly, Mel Brooks was distracted during filming by his wife's illness and death, and that director Susan Stroman didn't have the clout to override his in absentia presence. Never mind that the new third act ending betrays the first two. Never mind that Lane and Broderick never develop the father-son relationship that Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder did, and which drove the story. Never mind that the musical numbers are not only forgettable, but extraneous. Never mind that the 11 o'clock number is over by 10:59. Never mind that Nathan Lane is made up to look like a Hirschfeld drawing. Never mind that Matthew Broderick is a human marshmallow. Mever mind that Uma Thurman sucks the energy out of movies that she's not even in. Never mind that -- oh, never mind. Like a dumb horror movie where the girl heads up to the attic and you know the monster's there waiting for her but she goes up anyway, "The Producers" is its own train wreck, devoid of any sense of self-awareness, let alone the major one: that it needs an audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i could give it an 11 out of a possible 10 I would give it that... the entire production was wonderful.. i would watch it again...and that is something i do only with very few movies. Nathan Lane steals the show with his wonderful performance. The performance by the actor portraying the gay director is a model of what a supporting actor should be.The scene showing the actual production of the play was a masterpiece and only Mel Brooks could do it justice. Uma Thurman gives a stellar performance and almost steals the show.I can not say enough good things about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few films I have tossed in the trash after I finished watching it.If you like over-acting, flamboyance, Broadway on the silver screen, and people trying hard to be funny, but coming off as obnoxious, desperate, and overall plain stupid, then you will like this.I honestly do not see what humor people are finding in this, and it's not that I don't get it. I loved Broderick in Ferris Bueller's Day off, that's a classic, but he is excruciating to watch in this. Between the cross-dressing, ridiculous costumes, terrible over-the-top acting, horrible singing, and terrible songs, I found this film incredibly offensive and a complete waste of time.I honestly would put this in the bottom 10 films I've ever seen in my life, and that's not an easy task to pull off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the remake of THE PRODUCERS. I am left speechless. Who, in their right mind would even attempt such a silly idea? I watch the original periodically and still laugh a lot, but this thing is ridiculous. I saw the play in London this year and found it wonderful. The acting superb, staging brilliant etc. I am a fan of both Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick and can't understand how they allowed themselves to be so miscast. As far as Will Ferrell trying to do Kenneth Mars' part, it's laughable(and not in a good way). Anyway, if you want to see how funny something can be go get the original because it's arguably the funniest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This definitely was one of the worse movies to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always heard great things about this movie &amp; tried to watch it for myself. Unfortunately I couldn't get through the first hour. My husband and I sat for the night to watch a great comedy &amp; instead looked at each other after the first 1/2 hour &amp; said "This was critically acclaimed on Broadway?" But let me digress for a minute. Nathan Lane is a brilliant comedian, I've always liked his performances. He does do a good job here but some of the scenes just fall short. Maybe it works on the stage but not on the big screen. Matthew Broderick totally overacts - his performance is only irritating. I believe he forgot he wasn't on stage. His huge musical number in the Accounting office was way too long - we turned the channel &amp; watched another show when it went on &amp; on. I wanted to be able to reach into the television &amp; slap him. Then we get to Will Ferrell - who generally overacts so I was used to it. This was the reason we kept watching because we are Will Ferrell fans. However, there was no chemistry between the characters. Stick to Broadway &amp; the stage - please don't do this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My father adored the original Zero Mostel/Gene Wilder version of The Producers, he used to watch it regularly when I was growing up and that rubbed off on me. When I first saw Mel Brooks 'The Producers' I thought it was a stage play adapted into a movie not the other way round that it became. While I never saw the Broadway revival of 'The Producers' I did 'try' to watch the 2005 version of the 'Producers' on DVD. If you have never seen the original 1968 version and have only seen the 2005 version then of course the 2005 version is going to be funny. If you have seen the original, then you notice just how little effort the actors made other than giving pale imitation of the Zero Mostel/Gene Wilder blue print that makes the 2005 version look like an overacted summer pantomime. I could only go 15 minutes before turning it off in disgust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1968 version of "The Producers" with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder was hilarious. It was one of the all-time funniest comedies to hit the big screen. The 2005 version, however, is gratingly awful. The idea to set this comedy to a musical format was obviously very successful on Broadway. It certainly failed to transition to film. All of the songs seemed annoyingly unoriginal; as if someone put dumb rhymes and monotonous tunes together. Each song was painful to watch and hear and they were all completely forgettable. Matthew Broaderick, in the opening sequences, did a pretty good impersonation of Gene Wilder - line for line, that is. Remakes should show a little more originality and, anyway, Gene Wilder he's not. The same can be said for Nathan Lane - a pretty good impression of Zero Mostel - as if these actors viewed the tape of this movie a hundred times until they got it down. Big deal. Will Ferrell was atrocious as the crazed Nazi. It was as if he did a workshop on overacting. He was more over the top than Dolly Parton in a turtleneck. Uma Thurmon's character was unnecessary and should have been left out. The happy ending lacked the humor of the original. The whole movie seemed like a loud, amateurish wreck. Even the joke Lane made towards the end about someone else's life flashing before his eyes was stolen from an old Woody Allen joke. El Stinkeroo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks, the comic genius of the late twentieth century, comes off great with this new production of his classic musical. Nathan Lane is a wonderful and wacky producer who rescues Matthew Broderick from a life of accounting boredom and makes him his understudy. They scheme to put on the biggest flop ever so they can close after one day and flee to Rio with the sponsors' $2 million. Of course, things don't turn out as they plan. Along the way, Uma Thurman displays her considerable charms along with a host of fine dancers and singers, from Neo-Nazis to Sing Sing prisoners to drag queens in full costume. Mel Brooks really knew how to brighten the day among the gloomy tedium of more sober folks who were trying to save the world or just merely trying to make a living. So here is another tipsy triumph of the master, beautifully realized and sung and danced by this splendid cast of multi-talented actors and actresses.</fullReview>

The movie is way to long, after 15 minutes my brother and looked at each other and thought about leaving to watch another movie instead.

		<shortDescription>Not good, not bad, just... boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie written by Mel Brooks, starring Nathan Lane. How could this be a miserable, boring, snooze-fest? You got me, but it was.I rarely go to see movies. I just got back from this one, literally walked in the house ten minutes ago. It wasn't a good movie. It wasn't an especially bad movie. If I had hated it, I would have given it a higher score. If a movie can evoke an emotion like hatred in you, they've done something special. This just left me bored.There have been perhaps half a dozen movies in the last twelve months that I have wanted to see. This was one of them. Mel Brooks and Nathan Lane would have been more than enough to get me there. What I got was disappointment. My entire family went to see it, and we got about three chuckles each. It wasn't the Hitler thing, indeed, that was one of my three chuckles. It was just... flat.Matthew Broderick was the wrong choice. His singing voice is quite good, which was a pleasant surprise, but still... just not the right choice. His facial expressions were a constant source of aggravation, wide-eyed and simply not fitting the scene, and his acting was overdone. Yes, that was likely the point, but he couldn't do it well. Someone like Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler makes overdoing it an art form, but Broderick couldn't do that (Please note that I'm not saying Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler could have done better in this role, merely that they do that style of acting well, whereas Matthew Broderick didn't). And the scene where he is going hysterical? Painful. With a capital P, and a large number of exclamation marks.Nathan Lane was amusing, but somehow even he didn't manage to save this from the clutches of boredom. Such a pity, as everything else I have seen him in has been brilliant, but this... Just unfortunate.Uma Thurman was as good as her role would allow. There's only so much you can do with a Swedish accent and revealing clothing.Will Ferrel as Franz Liebkind the neo-Nazi playwright was probably the most amusing, possibly rivalled only by Gary Beach as Roger DeBris and Roger Bart as his "Common law assistant". These three where probably the only consistent source of laughter, and the cause of the other two times I cracked a smile.The musical numbers went on for just that touch too long. If each had been a verse or two shorter, they would have been perfect.The Hitler thing didn't offend me in the least. Actually, I lied when I said I chuckled three times. I did chuckle a few times during their opening night, but I didn't laugh once.The theatre was silent, save for the movie itself. No, actually, a phone rang, once, and I think someone was playing brick on their phone. Oh, and the door squeaked as someone came in with popcorn.We came out distinctly disappointed. The phrase that came to mind was "Waste of money". It may well have been better on the stage, but... this was just a flat, boring, unfunny mess.If you're considering seeing it, don't. Wait a few years until you can rent it for a week for $3. That way, you'll lessen the money you waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember when musicals didn't need to be based on movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever a movie that did not need to be re-made, it was "The Producers." Still, the creatively bankrupt Broadway (i.e. Hollywood's eastern franchise) decided to take pandering to a new level, releasing "The Producers: The Musical," along with "Big: The Musical," "Titanic: The Musical" and "The Lion King: The Musical" (can't wait for "Rambo: The Musical" myself). It was such a hit, that a movie, based on the play was inevitable. Hey, it worked for "Little Shop of Horros" right? Nathan Lane stars as a Broadway producer, with Mathew Broderick as his accountant/henchman. Together they cook up a scheme to raise a fortune from backers, put on the worst play in history, allow it to close after one night and pocket the money they didn't spend. The scheme runs awry though when the play turns out to be "so bad it's good" (no such luck for this movie though). The plot has the potential to be wonderfully humorous, but sadly, this movie is not.First, you have Broderick, doing his shy nerd thing from "Biloxi Blues," and you have Lane doing, well, Lane, a loud whiny fat man (Hey Lane, Joe Besser called, he wants his shtick back). Neither is appealing enough that you want to see them succeed, or repulsive enough that you want to see them get their comeuppance. In short, we don't care what happens to them. Uma Thurman plays a would-be actress who is included as a subject for a romantic rivalry. Unfortunately, that subplot is under-developed, making her presence superfluous.Second, there is the music. Each song is wrapped around a big, show stopping dance number. Unfortunately, the music is generally dull, and the frequent show-stopping makes an already tedious movie drag on painfully.Third, there is the humor, or rather, there isn't. Most of Lane's jokes revolve around his seducing old women for money. It's vulgar and inane, but not funny. Broderick does slightly better as a neurotic nerd, but hardly great. The play's director and crew are stereotypically camp gay men for the audience to laugh at, if that sort of thing weren't old hat. Overall, I think I smiled twice, hence the two stars.In short, "The Producers: The Movie Based on the Play" gets no points for comic or musical accomplishment. And please, don't tell me that the play was brilliant because a lot of people saw it. A lot of people watched "The A-Team" too. Wait a minute, "The A-Team: The Muscial!" Get Broadway on the phone, I've just had a great idea!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like musicals; I love Nathan Lane and like pretty much every other actor in this; I thought the original movie was funny but didn't remember it that well. I really thought that I was going to enjoy this version of "The Producers" but man, oh man, I didn't even crack a smile during the agonizing 2 hours of this movie. The acting is overdone, and it looks like they just filmed it on a theater stage (and not in a good way, like Chicago) which was really distracting. The songs were OK, but every new musical number just made me impatient for the movie to end already. I don't know why Matthew Broderick did such a terrible job; he's usually a good actor, but he was SO FAKE! I couldn't stand it when he pretended to be anxious. And Will Ferrell--ugh! Nothing was funny. The only reason I would give it 2 stars instead of one is that I think if I didn't already know how the story went, I might have thought the premise was interesting. But yeah... nobody needs to be watching this instead of the original.</fullReview>

The exaggerations are, yes, supposed to be funny, but everything is overdone. It gets very tiresome fast. The Hitler scenes are, as the initial "audience" said, tasteless. How someone can even think of making a comedy/play/satire about such a time in history is beyond me. Goose-stepping little Nazis are not funny. I can't imagine anyone with a relative who died in the extermination camps sitting through this. This is neither satire nor humor--it is tasteless and sophomoric.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I miss something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot understand the large number of raving-reviews regarding the Producers (2005). I sat through 3/4 of this wondering when I was going to start laughing at this "halarious" film. I couldn't get to the end of this movie.The musical aspect of this play was perhaps the biggest spoiler, while the songs were clearly supposed to be entertaining they were instead irritating and the lyrics seemed to resemble something along the lines of particularly unoriginal.And as someone else stated: "the Hitler scenes are, as the initial "audience" said, tasteless."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I missing something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be missing something because I know many people like this film but I simply didn't get it. Maybe the over acting would work on stage, but in this format I just found it irritating. The laughs aren't really jokes they are just&nbsp;playground silliness, but not in a good way, in a forced, "we need to make this funny" way. The actors separately put on a good performance, but I say separately because there was a huge lack of chemistry and connection between the characters something even the most mediocre of films get right. I believe this to be more the fault of the writer and director not the acting. I did chuckle a few times but it certainly wasn't worth the rental. Maybe if you are a big musical fan you will enjoy this, however I would imagine you would still need to see it on stage.&nbsp; Sorry, not for me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film which is a remake of a play which is a remake of a film... Only Mel Brooks would dare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's the deal with directors who remake movies and get angry when anyone calls it a remake? ("It's not a remake, it's a re-IMAGINING!") Whatever. Not here. "The Producers" (2005) is a hands-down, unapologetic, knock-down, dragout REMAKE. And a fine one at that. Not just scenes, but sets, costumes, actors' intonations, and the overall feeling is just like watching the 1968 classic. I can picture both Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane intently studying the reels of Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel to get pinpoint accuracy.If it's so true to the original then why, you ask, would anyone bother watching the remake?For the same reason we rush out to buy the digitally remastered versions of our favorites. We want to see them shiny and new, the way we've never seen them before but without destroying the original charm. Here we have writer/director Mel Brooks after 40 more years of experience and maturity, doing it again for a new generation, yet having the humility to keep it the same as it was for the old generation. Imagine going to your favorite band's reunion tour and having the thrill of seeing/hearing them sound exactly the way they did decades ago but now with a stage 5x the size and all the fun stuff that they never had the chance to do before.What's that? Never saw the original "Producers"? Even better. Here you have the opportunity to see a classic, but with crisp, modern production standards. And with some crazy showtunes that were never there the first time around. My guess is that Mel always wanted this to have more music, like his later classics, "Blazing Saddles""History of the World", "High Anxiety", etc. But with "The Producers" being his directoral debut in '68 he toned it down a bit. Here we get the absurdly flamboyant musical he always wanted.Actually there are 2 big changes to the original, both of which are so perfect I can't believe I went all these years not missing them. The first is the expanded role of "Ulla" (played by Uma Thurman) who is perfect as the ditzy Swedish bombshell. The second is Will Ferrell as the Franz the closet Nazi. In both of these cases, the characters pop right out of the screen. Will's song "Der Guten Tag Hop Clop," complete with choreographed pigeons, had me howling.And that brings me to the biggest reason why you'd want to see this remake, aside from the songs, the dancing and choreography is EXCELLENT. Folks, this isn't just a movie with some crazy songs and actors flailing for laughs. It has some great dance numbers with nice moves had by all.All of this has the effect of making "The Producers" (2005) more like the extravagant musical comedies that made Mel famous in the 70s. This remake got everything right. I have to say, compared to other successful directors who now sit in their ivory towers disparaging their early work and swearing they'll never do that again, Mel's still the same as he ever was, but even more so. Keep em coming, sir!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>now I wish to see the full stage of the unsuccessful disaster play!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time, not having ever seen the 1968 movie, nor ever been able to frequent theatrical shows. It was therefore an exciting experience to see the highly reputed theater piece performed by stage actors alongside screen actors; then I allow myself falling in love with motion pictures (and screen actors) again rather than lamenting a life without chance to be a theatergoer. Dialogues are funny and "deeply" cynical, spoken just they should be; but I felt they were often upstaged as every small role is played by enough eye-catching entertainer to weaken the charm of words. The Central Park fountain eruption following the scene of the successful-fiasco-seeking "producer" calling God, "old friend", seemed quite modest, playing rather good "supporting" role.It is hard to dislike this musical, after all. The song, "I Want to be a Producer" is sweetly sung like a touching love song; I wonder this soft singing voice existed in the original 1968 film? Also, Ulla's flaring blue dress is a delight to capture in view while she elegantly moves. Most of all, now I really wish to see the full stage of the Franz Liebkind's "Spring Time for Führer" or a furor play!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One has to compare this with the original and it just does not cut it. Lane is pretty good in this but have seen him much, much better. I like Broderick usually but this performance is embarrassing. Will Ferrell is his usual overrated self-there is not a funny bone in his body!! Uma Thurman is wasted in this .I have been told that the stage play is great, so perhaps a straight filming of the Broadway production might have been a better idea (after all Into the Woods worked brilliantly as a simple filming of the stage). Incidentally I love musicals so that was not my problem. The original film was just so great and the performances by Mostel,Wilder and Mars were incredible and incredibly funny that any remake just had to suffer by comparison. The only way in which the new version might have shaded it were the stage numbers which looked great. A nice try but they shot and they missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid no matter what.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only two possible explanations for the large number of rave reviews on this movie:1. There are far more shallow, easily-amused people than I realized. Or, 2. The makers of this drivel persuaded and/or paid large numbers of supporters to post positive comments.This movie simply stinks. I didn't smile once. I liked the original very much, but I found most of Mel's later stuff to be embarrassing more than amusing. But this isn't even funny. I tried to be really fair and not compare this to the original, but failed miserably. The reason the original worked was because Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder had personality traits that meshed with and enhanced the script. No such thing here; Matthew Broderick has no discernible personality and is just as bad here as he was in "The Stepford Wives", another remake that never should have happened. He should have quit after "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". Wil Ferrell is just as not-funny as I would expect. I just adore Uma Thurman, but she can't sing and is going to waste here.The musical numbers go on and on ad nauseum and are dead-boring other than "Springtime for Hitler in Germany".If you've not seen the original, then go find it and watch it instead of this uninspired drivel. If you have seen the original, then get it and watch it again. It's a bit dated, but it still works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Producers gives musicals a bad name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where did they go wrong? So wrong!? Nathan Lane is a wonderful actor, so is Matthew Broderick. I had heard rave reviews of the original from 1968 by Mel Brooks.This movie gives musical films a bad name. It is 2 hours and 15 minutes of your life that you will never get back. At the beginning there were some subtle hints at brilliance, like the poster of "King Leer," and some songs and dialogue, like "he did to Shakespeare what Booth did to Lincoln." You see and hear these things and think that the wit will continue to build, it does not.You also hold out hope that the "Springtime for Hitler" sequences will make the horrendous experience seem worthwhile, it does not, it lasts only 3 minutes.The worst part of this, for me, was that I talked a couple of friends into watching it with me. They were already apprehensive about musicals, and since I am generally a fan of musicals (Grease, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Chicago, Moulin Rouge, Little Shop of Horrors, etc. etc.) I guaranteed them it would be good. I owe them a good many beers and apologies. Terrible!</fullReview>

Well actually I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. I mean it was just horrible. I didn't like any of the men's voices so it was painful to listen to. I was just waiting for it to end and we skipped most of the movie. Made me angry to spend my time and money on this piece of crap. If I have to explain or give a good reason why it sucked well here it is "Because it just sucked" that's why, it was not funny, not entertaining, i almost fell asleep watching it.

I wish I had those 2+ hours of my life back. I kept waiting for it to get funny, but that never happened. The level of ridiculousness that the film aims for falls short and succeeds only in being painfully bad overacting. If the producers' intent in making this film was to make a horrible, unwatchable flop, that would be the only bit of good irony one could glean from this wretched piece of work. I now have a headache and an awful song stuck in my head that will probably give me nightmares of being in a gay Sing Sing prison cell.</fullReview>

The songs lasted forever, then another song would be sung, and then the same song from twenty minutes ago would be sung again. I didn't smile once at this poor excuse for a movie. I don't think this could have been worse if they had tried. I absolutely hated this film so much that after two incredibly long hours in the theater, I left a movie for the first time in my life. I love all movies, yet I hate this one with a passion. I would have rather flushed five bucks down the toilet then watch this film for three reasons, 1: It would have cost less 2: It would have been more entertaining 3: It would only take about thirty seconds. Nobody should ever have to sit through this terrible excuse for a movie, if you buy a copy of this, feed it to the dog, eat it yourself, or burn it, no matter what, DON"T WATCH THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this on DVD, and gave it two attempts. The first time, I only made it to about the 5-7 minute mark, and the second attempt, I watched till about the 16 minute mark. I was shocked at how bad those first 15 minutes were. It was amazingly bad. I was embarrassed for Lane and Broderick. The best way to sum it up is that they were overacting in a manner to be comedic, but it didn't seem a bit funny to me or my wife, like watching little kids be silly only it's adults. The acting was corny and stupid. I figured that if the director thought that the first 15 minutes was funny or even had one laugh, that there was nothing coming in the movie to improve it, not even Uma Thurman doing the splits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without question one of the worst movie musicals ever made- right up there with CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC and the Glenn Close SOUTH PACIFIC. Even SONG OF NORWAY has better music and nicer scenery. Pasting Nathan Lane's hair down to make him look more like Zero Mostel didn't help matters. It's seems everyone believed that since the stage production was such a hit (still a mystery to me), they could take the easy road and simply slide on it's reputation. The makers of films like MY FAIR LADY and THE SOUND OF MUSIC didn't make that mistake. One of the biggest frustrations of this film is the roster of New York talent who ended up mostly on the cutting room floor- people like Andrea Martin, Marilyn Sokol, Debra Monk, Karen Ziemba(!), and many more listed on the credit crawl and hardly, if ever, seen. Major frustration! To boot, the film has a cheap, badly lighted look to it that doesn't help. All in all, a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of talent - did anyone actually see this in production? It's a bit like watching an early silent film when stage actors had not learned movie technique - that what might work across a cavernous hall is grotesque and simply dumb to do on film. And in modern extreme closeups, this kind of extravagant mugging looks amateurish and clownish - or like having some kind of seizure.Perhaps the success of the Broadway show so great that no-one had the guts to say that this pathetic filmization just is not funny.But it is wheezy, clumsy, tedious and v-e-r-y v-e-r-y l-o-n-g with even more of the sub-adolescent crudities that have stained much of Mel Brooks's later work.Maybe it's my problem but repeated erection gags ceased to be hilarious when I was about 12.I really wanted (and expected) to love this film (as I do the Mostel/Wilder original); I hated it and still find it hard to believe that I considered walking out after about 10 hair-raisingly awful minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I go to the cinema regularly; so much so that I have considered that I may be addicted to popcorn, or at the very least have an unhealthy obsession with escapism, but after countless films I have only ever genuinely wanted to walk out of the cinema on perhaps two or three occasions. One such occasion was Charlie's Angels 2. Another was this film.I haven't seen the original and though I suspect Mel Brooks probably did a sounder job, I don't think I would be brave enough to take the risk. Nor have I seen the stage show but I don't think either of these thing should matter; I 'm not passing comment on either of those works but on this piece of cinema itself as it stands alone. And it stands poorly, leaning on a crutch with a slightly seedy demeanour.So great was the impact that this film had on me that now, 9 years after having seen it, I experienced an uncomfortable flashback, resulting in cold sweats and nausea. Once they had passed I thought that it may be time to work through the past trauma and that this review may be a first step forward in doing so.I won't go into the technical details about why I did not enjoy this film because I think it is still too soon for me but I will say this: a previous review was quite accurate in their description of it being produced like a stage show not a movie; I'm not sure if this was an experiment on the part of the film makers but it felt like I was part of one and I certainly had not given my consent.I did not enjoy this film. I thought it was bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Producers" (1968) stands as a classic movie comedy. Though some of its jokes were topical (such as, the hippies), it has a great script, a sure-fire plot and nail-on-the-head turns by a cast of rising stars (Gene Wilder, Kenneth Mars, Christopher Hewitt, William Hickey). "The Producers" (1968) features the legendary Zero Mostel. Mostel made few movies because he was extraordinarily difficult and because, to be brutally honest, his personality was too large for the screen. The Broadway stage was his métier. But Mostel's humongous presence filled the shoes of Max Bialystock, Mel Brooks' producer. With all this going for it, "The Producers" remains a fun-fest long after more recent comedies have gone stale. And the most amazing thing about "The Producers" in retrospect is that such a quality product ever got made in the first place."The Producers" concerns a Broadway producer (of flops) and an accountant who concoct a scheme to bilk investors via the greatest stinkeroo Broadway has ever seen ("This play's guaranteed to close on page four!" -- and he was almost right.) And it has two great songs, both mostly written by Brooks, "Springtime for Hitler" and "Prisoners of Love." In a trend of turning old TV shows into movies and movies into Broadway productions ("Sunset Boulevard"), around the turn of the century someone got the bright idea of metamorphize "The Producers" into a live, Broadway musical. Given the plot, it was an ironic twist. It might have been more ironic if the play had closed on page four. But because Broadway was thirsting for good material, "The Producers" was a hit.Naturally, because it was a hit on stage, film producers sniffed the possibility of a hit movie. So we have a movie turned into a musical turned into a movie. And it was possible that the new "Producers" would be a shadow of the old movie.The new "Producers" is hardly a classic. One approaches it with a couple of questions.Is it more than a pale duplication of the original? Yes. The script has been changed, sometimes for the better. For the good: L.S.D., an annoying character in the original made palatable only by the performance of the amazing Dick Shawn, is removed; other characters are expanded to fill that void. Too bad Dick Shawn was not alive an able to play an aging L.S.D. (hey, they put a hippie in "Kelly's Heroes" so why not in a movie set in the 1950s?) For the bad: A wholly unnecessary (but, at least, different from the original) love story is attached to the new "Producers." And since songs had to be shoehorned in, a lot of the movie had to be compressed. In the original "Producers" Mostel's producer seduces an unambitious accountant played by Wilder to want "everything I've ever seen in the movies!" In the new version, the accountant nurtures his own secret ambitions that Bialystock brings out.The movie also has a radically new look. "The Producers" (2005) plays up, rather than down, its stage roots.Another question, is the movie offensive? Yes, joyously so. Not offensive as the real musical "The Book of Mormon" is offensive, targeting one group for ridicule in a way one might have seen Jews done in the Third Reich. "The Producers" is offensive in the way of the original movie, scattershot, with a pellet for everybody. If you're snootily, easily-offended p.c. neo-puritan, stay away.Also bad: in the original "The Producers" (1968), everyone seemed tailor-made for his or her role. They all worked together like the components of a finely-tuned machine. In the new movie, the performances are variable. At best.Matthew Broderick is a very good actor, but, presumably duplicating his stage performance, he comes across as too mannered. His co-star, Nathan Lane, is, like anchovies, a matter of taste; and he has never been to mine. Perhaps, like Zero Mostel, his natural place is on the stage, but I've never enjoyed him in the movies. In this movie, lacking Zero Mostel's outsized personality, he is unable even to bluster his way through. Una Thurmond is too old for Ulla. The original Ulla, Lee Meredith, was barely in her 20s; Thurmond was thirty-five. True, their characters had different roles and motivations, but the producers of "The Producers" (2005) might have given a rising starlet a chance rather than merely going for a marquee name. Uma had her "Dangerous Liaisons" and we are all grateful for that; it's just too bad another aspiring actress wasn't able to get an opportunity here to show what she's made of."The Producers" (1968) was about beginnings. No one could guess it at the time, but it started a director's career for Mel Brooks, a star career (for better and worse) for Gene Wilder and, by its success, opened the door for other hot new writer-directors like Woody Allen. "The Producers" (2005) feels more like an ending, like the closing of a door on a phenomenal project that started in the 1960s on a shoestring and that the smooth, brand-name stars and operators have taken over.</fullReview>

The Gene Wilder version is the one to watch ,not this mess of a redo. Nathan Lane has to be the biggest annoying queen on stage right now next to Harvey Fierstein , in the Birdcage I thought he couldn't get more annoying but he surpasses himself in this movie with his whiny portrayal of Max. Matthew Broderick who I haven't really cared about in years does no better and he can't sing to save his life. Uma Thurman is simply eye candy and nothing more and don't get me started on Will Farrell - if this was the 1880's he'd be on the other end of a rope. The movie is just awful , it tries so hard to camp it up by having people overact and people who can't sing thinking they are actually good singers. Sorry Broderick but don't ever sing on screen again. 1 out of 10 - terrible.</fullReview>

Bad. Bad. Very very bad , in a movie format. At least the songs, while novel, had music that was entirely forgettable. While this may have been a fine musical play (though I doubt it, and I enjoy musicals) it was irritating as a movie. The characters dialogue was not comical- simply over the top (like the acting) and bizarre - intended to be funny simply for the crude, crass degree of bizarreness.Unless you get into watching mediocre musicals on film, I'd pass this one by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I may not have seen the Producers before, I had been told that this would still be worth watching even without prior knowledge (though I have seen Mel Brooks movies before and I could see his style was certainly in the director's mind).The Producers is a bit flat. It has all the glitz and the glamour but I really felt the humour to be...antique. I imagine that the type of humour on display would suit an older, grainy looking film. But something didn't feel right through-out the movie and the jokes were just dull - I only smiled a handful of times.That being said, the actors do a solid job. Nathan Lane is wonderful and suits the role completely. Broderick is good, but I also felt that he didn't quite get as immersed as Lane and considering they spend the overwhelming majority of the film together, it's a bit of a dent. Uma Thurman was okay (and looked delightful, especially in her summer dress towards the end) and Will Ferrell was surprisingly solid. Gary Beach is also worth mentioning though for his great performance as Roger - just bizarre!The props and set design were very good and I quite liked the way in which it was presented as if it were taking place on a stage. But the pacing was off and, by the end, it felt extremely rushed; becoming disjointed. That being said, it's still a solid watch even if it's a bit "meh" at times. 5/10 P.S. Brits and Torchwood fans - watch out for John Barrowman as the 'Lead Tenor'! It caught me by surprise!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, my first question must be "When did Matthew Broderick become a comedian?" Sure he's done Ferris Bueller, Cable Guy and such - but there he plays fairly straight characters in a comedic story. The closest he's gotten to play a comical character as far as I know, was Inspector Gadjet.In this movie he and Uma Thurman (and believe me, I have nothing against either him or Uma) seem to suffer from lack of confidence in their singing/dancing and partly comedic talent. Watching extra material on DVD you can find some remarks by Matthew indicating a slight distrust in his abilities. When it comes to Uma I think you best see it when she steps in in front of the German army during the big springtime-for-Hitler-act. If you look at her face it lacks the comfort so readily found in Nathan Lane.It feels like Uma and Matthew got thrown in there to get some household names on the posters. Apart from them the casting is brilliant. Nathan Lane never disappoints, Gary Beach and Roger Bart are tremendous, and Will Ferrell surprises at least me with his singing performances.All in all it's OK movie with some charm, but more appropriate casting for the parts of Leo Bloom and Ulla would have brought it up a couple of extra notches!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really expected to enjoy this film, having seen the original movie, and also the UK production of the stage musical with Nathan Lane, and Lee Evans in the Broderick role. Unfortunately, it didn't measure up to either.An unfair comparison, perhaps, but I wanted to see the film version of the musical particularly to see Lane and Broderick together, which I had heard was brilliant on Broadway. To my surprise, Broderick never came close to Lee Evans in the role - Evans brought a manic energy to the role, and when he was hysterical (and wet, and in pain), it was completely believable. Broderick was capable, but never sold it to me.The other thing that I was astonished about was the dropping of the "King of Broadway" number. This kicked off the stage show brilliantly, and was one of the more memorable numbers - I couldn't believe it had been cut and relegated to "Deleted Scenes".As a result, I did enjoy it, but not half as much as I thought I would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched the original some time ago and having enjoyed it, I was looking forward to the re-make hoping to see something different or at least a better version. In both respects I was to be disappointed. The Gene Wilder - Zero Mostel version was a better movie on all accounts except for the fact that Nathan Lane was a better Max Bialistock (you'll have to forgive the spelling as I am just in from work!). I like Matthew Broderick but when you compare both Leo Bloom's it is Wilder's that comes out on top by a mile. Broderick just doesn't cut it as Leo Bloom but I suppose had Wilder not done such a good job first then it would have been alright. It is the same for most of the other characters in the movie and the less said about Will Farrell the better. However, if you have not seen the original then you will enjoy this movie but I would urge you to rent out the original just to get a different perspective on what clearly was a brilliant idea for a film. There are two things thats this version has going for it and one is the performance of Nathan Lane. He was born to play that part. The other is the outtakes on the DVD which are hilarious. And, not to disappoint any fans of the original, but there is no LSD! And in case you don't know what the hell I am talking about you just have to watch the original to find out!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the joys of going into a film with low expectations is that you can only be pleasantly surprised. And whilst this was better than I though it would be, it was still far from perfect. As a standalone film, it may have worked better, but the 1968 version is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. This is partly due to the manic energy that Gene Wilder puts into Leo Bloom, which haunts Matthew Broderick. Even in the new scenes Wilder's absence is noticeable, but the scenes from the original feel like they're missing something. However, the rest of the cast manage to avoid unfavourable comparisons. Nathan Lane carries off Zero Mostels role superbly, and Will Ferrell is everything you could want from a crazed Nazi on the run. Uma Thurman goes against type to do superbly well as Ulla, and Gary Beach carries off an extended role for Roger DeBris.The main problem though, is that the original was a tightly plotted fast moving caper. This version on the other hand is slower paced and overlong in places. And why mess with the lyrics for Springtime for Hitler? Insanity.However, some of the added songs work well and add humour to some of the dryer moments of the original. So worth watching, but keep a copy of the original handy to remind yourself how great it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to say it, but Susan Stroman's film version of "The Producers" is one of the most dead musical films I've ever seen. The original stage show, also directed by Stroman, is brilliant, but it was a mistake to hand a film project over to someone so inexperienced in film. Her take on the film version is to basically set up a camera in one place and shoot the show in long, static takes, usually in mid or longshots, as the performers do exactly what they did on stage. It is colorful and tuneful, but deadly dull to watch (and I like musicals as a rule). I understand what she was probably going for?she probably wanted to recreate the stage experience as much as possible. But living people on a stage and people on film are very, very, very different. For example, seeing someone on a stage all by himself singing a snappy tune and dancing around is interesting because it's a real person right in front of you. It is amazing in person to experience someone dominating your attention that way. And of course there's always the chance they might not pull it off; it's similar to watching a car race--part of the thrill is that there might be a crash. On film, however, that same person singing that same song all by himself is dull because there is no immediacy, and unless the performer is extraordinarily charismatic, no involvement. Film is, as Orson Welles once observed, a dead medium. Dead in the sense that what you are watching has already happened and cannot be changed. It is the past, while stage performance is the present. To take up our car race analogy again, is watching a race as interesting if it's on tape and you already know there were no crashes?Also, when you're watching a live performance your eye can move all over the set and you know those actors can see you as well--you are to some degree a participant. In film you only see what the director wants you to see, and what they show you has to be involving, not just there. Take, for example, Will Ferrel's big number, the German Band song--what should have been a showstopper was just Will standing in the middle of a huge static picture space, singing and dancing as though even he's not too interested in what he's doing. And Max's big number, Betrayed, would have benefited immensely if there had been other inmates on hand for him to be singing to. There has to be some interaction, an audience, for this kind of thing to work, and a musical film director has to either provide that interacton between characters on screen or use the language of cinema to bring us in and make us feel as though we're interacting with what we see on the screen. Just sticking a camera in front of someone doesn't cut it.I love film, but I just know that film and theatre are not the same at all. Somebody should have told Stroman this. Ironically, actually setting up cameras and filming a real live Broadway performance of the show would have been infinitely more cinematic than what we have here (Altman could have done wonders with it)It is also ironic that the only section of the film with any cinematic life is Springtime for Hitler sequence?which takes place on a STAGE! This one section of the film seems alive. Part of the reason is that for some reason the part of the film that takes place on a stage is the only part in which director Stroman decides to move the camera! (Of course, it also doesn't hurt that the players in "Hitler" can all move and dance much better than any of the leads do in the movie's "real" world.)I wanted to like this movie?I really did. I was happy when I heard it was old fashioned and not full of quick cuts and special effects. But as more and more of the film went on (and on and on) I found myself bored. Old School musical classics like "Easter Parade" or "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" were never this visually dull. The Producers had no urgency on screen. No life. Not only were the visuals dull, but the performances seemed canned, almost as though being performed by rote. It was obvious that the two leads had done this same thing?this exact same thing?hundreds and hundreds of times. Every tic, every movement, seemed set in stone. And speaking of tics, Broderick's performance as Bloom may have wowed the back rows on Broadway, but his wild, retarded mugging in the film version makes Jerry Lewis look like Chuck Norris by comparison. A huge disappointment for me.In short, the filmmakers were afraid to change anything at all about the Broadway show when they made the movie, and the result was DOA.</fullReview>

It was both funny, sexy and downright appalling all at the time time.Then Mel Brooks made it into a musical and this was excellent. Great songs (some from the original film) lots of energy and so forth.Then Susan Stroman, someone more famous for choreography, remade the musical of the film and it's flat. I mean its just got zero energy in it. Despite all the glitz, glamor and shiny teeth.I love all the people in it, accepting that Broderick is no Wilder.It should have been awesome.But loosing the audience lost everything.What a shame... but you should never try to reboil cabbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow start but worth the wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS) The first time I watched this I found the hysterical rantings of Broderick &amp; Lane a bit tedious. The pair of them, acting like they had both just escaped from a nut house, were just not funny, and Mostel and Wilder did a much better job in the 1968 film. After half an hour of this I was just about ready to bail out, but I decided to wait a bit longer, and then after another 10 minutes Will Ferrell came on wearing lederhosen, singing Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop song and I found myself laughing out loud. I don't know what it is but there's something priceless about Ferrell as an ex Nazi in lederhosen, up on a rooftop singing and dancing to this ridiculous song. After this comes a spectacular song and dance scene from Uma Thurman, a very funny gay song and dance scene with Beach and Bart and, maybe the funniest scene of the whole movie, the Hitler auditions, ending with Ferrell singing the Deutsche Band song. The climax of the film is the 'play within the play', Springtime for Hitler. Franz Liebkind (Ferrell), was going to play the part of Hitler but breaks his leg on the opening night so Beach is called in at the last minute to replace him. Whilst Franz Liebkind's Hitler would have guaranteed the whole audience walking out and the show's demise by page four of the script (as the producers had planned), Beach's gay Hitler is a surprise hit with the audience and they return to their seats laughing. Beach effectively ruins Broderick &amp; Lane's carefully planned attempt to create the ultimate Broadway flop so that, instead of running off with the money Lane has conned from his little old lady admirers, he ends up in jail with Broderick. The original film included a very funny scene with Ferrell's counterpart, Kenneth Mars screaming orders at the audience to stop laughing at Hitler, which made them laugh even more. Another lost scene was Mostel and Wilder trying to blow up the theatre, when all else had failed. The whole play / film was designed by Brooks to be on the outer fringes of bad taste. Conning little old ladies to back the play by having sex with them, multi-million dollar business fraud, perverting an innocent accountant, gay clichés, Nazi stormtroopers, the 'Springtime for Hitler' song, and finally Adolph Hitler (just in case nothing else had worked up to that point). 'Springtime for Hitler' was much more shocking in the first film, complete with swastika flags and a large mug shot of Hitler. Apparently a women got into a lift with Mel Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft, sometime after the first film was released, and told him that she thought the film was vulgar. Brooks smiled and said 'Lady, it rose below vulgarity'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Producers is like a time capsule from the former golden age of musicals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When numerous incarnations of a famous story are created, it's easy for one version to get lost in the shuffle. For Mel Brooks's mega-phenomenon, The Producers, it appeared that the musical film version is that unfortunate casualty. Originally a film made in 1968 and starring Zero Mostel, The Producers was later adapted into an incredibly successful Broadway musical. For the film version based on his play, Brooks elected to assign Susan Stroman the directing job, just as he had done on stage. What was most often criticised about the film was that all Stroman had done was film the stage show. Yet, that is more a compliment than a complaint. The Broadway version of The Producers is one of the funniest and most refreshing stage musicals to date, bringing together some excellent and memorable songs, entertaining dance numbers and some witty lines that only Mel Brooks could write. The film version keeps all of the wonderfulness intact and thus the film succeeds incredibly well in producing not only the best film musical of this still young decade, but also one of the best musicals ever put to celluloid.The style which Stroman and Brooks chose to make The Producers suits it perfectly, as it pays homage to the classical musicals like Singin' in the Rain and My Fair Lady, instead of opting for the quick-cutting MTV approach that musicals have adopted in recent years. Thus, the result is a bright and breezily shot musical utilising the old school lighting techniques and most of all Stroman's choreography to great effect. From old lady walkers in "Along Came Bialy" to the absolutely bombastic campy style of "Springtime for Hitler", the dance steps are superb and the viewer is able to watch every step without interruption. Each number is set up perfectly, not running too long and providing the film's most entertaining moments. Of course, the written dialogue provided by Mel Brooks and collaborator Thomas Meehan is as sharp and witty as what was seen in the original film. The actors say their lines with the most perfect comedic timing imaginable, naturally causing fits of laughter in the viewer.The humour ranges from slapstick routines to both obscure and well-known Broadway reference. Littered throughout, as well, are background gags like the posters seen in Max's office and an extra doing something silly behind the main actors. Naturally, the satire is also kept firmly in place, with Brooks and Stroman going after their usual targets: critical theatre patrons, boring accountants and of course, Adolf Hitler and his "hotsy, totsy Nazis."The material and music is already perfect, so of course, they don't change it. However, critics have complained that the actors are over-the-top on the screen, thus producing a lot of mugging. Yet, that is the only possible way to perform Mel Brooks material as its scripts were practically made for mugging for the camera's attention. Naturally, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are the stars of the film and hence they deserve the bulk of the credit for bringing their jokes completely to life. Nathan Lane is tremendous, invoking exactly what got him the Tony Award for the performance. Even though, Max is a slightly vindictive fellow, the audience can't help but feel sorry for him. Matthew Broderick also brings a certain heart to the film as Leo Bloom, going for a different approach than Gene Wilder. His Leo is a poor schmuck, who despite his panic attacks, views the world slightly more optimistically, with eyes and expressions full of wonderment and desire. Putting Lane and Broderick together was a stroke of genius on the part of Mel Brooks, as they both shine and as shown in one of the final songs, "Til Him", their chemistry is one of a kind. Somewhere out there, Zero Mostel is smiling down and blessing these two actors.Broderick also has plenty of romantic chemistry with Uma Thurman, who sports a very funny mock Swedish accent in a part where she is able to stretch her pipes incredibly well. She also hits the dance floor in ways not even seen in her famous scene in Pulp Fiction with "When You Got Got It, Flaunt It", one of the film's best musical numbers. Showing that when given the right material, he can give out a gem of a performance, Will Ferrell's portrayal of Franz Liebkind is far and away his work to date. Ever the improviser, Ferrell intelligently respects the Brooks material, while still giving the crazy kraut his own feel. Ferrell appears to be more comfortable in this role than he ever was playing an anchorman and a race-car driver. He may have failed there, but in The Producers, he succeeds. Finally, returning from the Broadway production are Gary Beach and Roger Bart, who while they make their character completely flamboyant to the max, they still prove to be respectable and embody their characters perfectly. When Beach takes the stage in his Hitler get-up for the film's incredible ten-minute triumph known as "Springtime for Hitler", he especially shines giving the right ounce of offensiveness and, as De Bris promises earlier in the film, keeps it gay.The most under-appreciated film of the new millennium, Susan Stroman and Mel Brooks add the right amount of hilarity, heart, silliness and bad taste to make a film as classy as the works of Gene Kelly or Busby Berkeley. Although, I'm sure Berkeley never had his dancers take the form of a Swazitka.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Producers is brilliantly useless. This clever little paradox is only one out of an assortment of constructive critical comments to be made about this film.Matthew Broderick gives a dismal performance as what can only be described as a mentalist. His performance is backed up by the dreary Nathan Lane, whose repugnant face is enough to make me gip.For a while I thought that this was a satirical take on abysmal films; however it shortly becomes apparent that this is an abysmal film. This reviewer would have probably given the film an extra star if the cast were replaced by disease infested dogs that spat out needles containing polio.John Milton once quipped: "Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav'n". The Producers proves to be the anomaly to this philosophy.With an aspect ratio of a mere 2.35 : 1, the film was bound to fail in the cinemas. The film went on to achieve a pathetic certification of 6 in Germany, which further highlights its incompetence. To summarise, this film is a chore.After a gruelling 134 minutes, the film does end and you stroll out of the cinema, contemplating whether are not "Clifford the Big Red Dog" was better use of your six pounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spring comes again for Hitler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little more music and embellishing of several plot points that were passed over in the original film are what distinguishes this musical version of The Producers. It's a musical version about a film that had a plot about two men who try to create the biggest flop in the history of Broadway and a musical.Taking the places of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder as the producing partners Bialystock&amp;Bloom are Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. Both these guys are given an impossible task of repeating two classically congruent performances that Mostel and Wilder created. Even the additional bits of business just can't make me forget the original. Will Ferrall did not come over from Broadway to do the role of the hermit like Nazi living in Greenwich Village and caring for his carrier pigeons. He had to do double duty because he also took the place of beatnik method actor Dick Shawn from the original. I'm not sure that combining the roles was the best thing, I'm also not sure Ferrall did real justice to either try as he might on both. Kenneth Mars was the reclusive Nazi author of Springtime For Hitler. in the original. Both he and Shawn were almost as memorable as Mostel and Wilder.I do love the Mel Brooks humor, but I think he laid it on a bit thick with the gay stereotyping of Gary Beach and Roger Bart. It came this close to the good side of being offensive, but not quite.There's a lot to like in this version of The Producers, but I think Mel should not have touched his masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wintertime for Mel Brooks? and Hilarity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1968, Mel Brooks' "The Producers" was a masterpiece of vulgarity that pushed the limits of political correctness for the sake of heartfelt belly laughs. That it deals with Broadway and musicals is besides the point, the film is a comedic milestone: it didn't get to be such a classic because of the songs, but because of the story, a fresh irreverent script that earned Mel Brooks an Oscar. Well, to be fair, it became a classic thanks to a song, one song that defined the whole fraudulent concept of a sure-to-flop-musical but that succeeds in a brilliantly self-referential way because the public could see such bad taste can only be deliberate.The song was "Springtime for Hitler" (and Germany) and if there ever was one needed in the entire film, it was this one. The rest was just hearing ornament. Yet the remake, as pointless as it is, gratifies us with countless songs supposed to drive the narrative, but instead slowing it down and down till the 120th minute. I don't know much about the Broadway version of the original movie, but if they wanted to 'remake' something for the big screen, they could've remade the original, not the musical. A Broadway hit doesn't necessarily make a great film but the director Susan Stroman, took the film's reputation for granted. And no offense, but I want to ask 'who is she anyway?'Seriously, if anyone could remake the film, it should've been Mel Brooks himself, although he lost his touch in the 90's, he might have kept a few tricks under his sleeve. Unfortunately, 2005 coincided with a sad time for the legendary comedian, with the illness and death of his wife, actress Anne Bancroft. The film was certainly not a priority and I don't think the flop broke his heart and in a way, I'm glad the flop didn't hurt his legacy, and Stroman courageously carries the guilt of this remake. But she's not the only one to blame. The whole idea of remaking the play was ludicrous but it had chances to work, it went all wrong with the casting.The actors are good, in the sense that they're not bad. But Nathan Lane ain't no Zero Mostel and Matthew Broderick ain't certainly no Gene Wilder. In their defense, Mostel and Wilder created such a dynamic duo in the original that it was impossible to match their energy. I'm partial to Lane though, if he had Wilder's physique, he could have repeated his antics from "The Birdcage" and be as hysterical as him, I'm certain about that. But come on, how can you put Broderick and 'hysterical' in the same sentence? No offense again, but his emotional range can't get rid of that wide-eyed expression that made him look cute in his 20's, but awkward in his 40's. Even if his career depended on it, Broderick can't look wild, let alone 'Wilder'.But seeing is believing and the test-scene was the 'hysterical' one, and unfortunately, while Lane could pass as a Max Byalistock, I cringed at Broderick's impersonation of Wilder, maybe because his reputation precedes him, and creates a bias, but when the supposed-to-be highlight of the film makes you cringe, you know it's a bad signal. That's the tragedy of remakes, they can't escape from the original's shadow, and watching "The Producers" is like being submitted to an exercise of redundant comparisons. To make it short, when it's like the original, the original is funnier, when the film adds extra-songs, the original is shorter. So why the remake anyway?Of course, it's a very legitimate comedy/musical, nominated for four Golden Globes with songs that are well-choreographed as much as well-forgotten. The new actors are good, Will Ferrell does an interesting Franz Liebenkind and Gary Beach a remarkable eccentric director? still, you can't help but keep Kenneth Mars and Christopher Hewett in your mind. Only Uma Thurman (and that was a surprise) does an interesting and refreshing performance as Swedish Ulla and plays her more than a foil for the two leads' nastiness, she literally illuminates the screen. But even these good performances can't save the film after the musical (the one in the film) ends and the public applauds. The film loses its rhythm and there's still more to come.Even the original had its share of slow moments, but you can't have a high spot without a few low ones. The problem with the 2005 version is that by the time you get to the high spot, the film has given us two long patience-challenging songs that incredibly lowered your enjoyment. So mathematically speaking, when you consider the film's length, you don't have many gags to enjoy. It's like a dosage where the level of music has increased so much it made it lose the taste of fun, like a lemonade with too much water. The first one had bad taste, the second is tasteless.Speaking of the original, it was one of Ebert's favorite comedies and as far as he was concerned, he couldn't say he didn't enjoy the 2005 version, but couldn't say he loved it either. He knew there was some quality and professionalism in the making but that was it, the film couldn't make him forget the extraordinary experience the 1968 version was, at its time, and it still held up. And that's the magic of cinema, movies owe their classic reputation to the timing of their release.Brooks' film was a comedic milestone because it broke many grounds of political correctness but it's modern within its own context. The theme is relevant but the execution is a reflection of its time, now the 2005 version can't get away with that excuse, so at the end, it's not only outdated, but irrelevant. And to make it worse, it's longer, more boring and less funny as if the film's 'producers' wanted to pull a 'Byalistock' in this project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen every version of The Producers--the 1967 film with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, the Broadway show with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, and the movie musical with Lane and Broderick.Mel adapted his original film for Broadway tastes. It had to be a musical because that's what sells tickets in theater. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick were Broadway stars. However, the show was disappointing. A few of the musical numbers, particularly the old ladies and walkers was inventive. That Brooks had to include a song about being gay was cringe- worthy but necessary as Broadway musical theater audiences have to be hit over the head with the obvious. The show did not make a great film musical because it was not a great Broadway musical. Everything wrong about the musical starting with Lane and Broderick made its way to the screen. Lane and Broderick could never fill Mostel's and Wilder's shoes. Lane was too stridently fey, and Broderick too limply colorless. I disliked that some characters were combined, and that Ulla's character became Bloom's romantic interest. In the 1967 film, Bialystock was the great romancer. Everything and everyone was a conquest. Part of the fun was Bialystock's unstoppable wooing of the little old ladies for their money, of Bloom for his accounting wizardry, and everyone else who could serve his end game. Mel made a pot of money on his musical versions and I say bully for him. His genius was rewarded financially and theatrically with 12 Tony awards (not much competition that year). Saying that, if this is the only version of The Producers seen, there's enough humor and talent to entertain. It is nowhere and I mean nowhere nearly as funny and zany as the 1967 film. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are comedic giants. The original script and movie is simply one of the funniest ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great movie's terrible sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had great expectations of this movie; after all, I had watched the original 1968 version and enjoyed it very much. However I was never more bored watching endless Broadway songs one after another during the whole movie. The dialogs were dull, and the few laughs it offered were not enough to make up for the remainder of the movie. I feel like I wasted an hour and a half of my life. The original movie contained an actual story; whereas here we are greeted with songs interspersed with a few lines of actual dialog. I expected a lot better from this cast, but unfortunately, while trying to create a flop, they flopped themselves in a major way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Producers is a decent movie with an enjoyable storyline with a great cast that mostly play characters that they aren't suited for.Many,many lines are the exact same as the original Producers and I've seen the musical on stage before,which I found a lot more enjoyable than this because the songs are just simply more fun on stage.My favourite in this movie was certainly Will Ferrell,he is without a doubt one of my favourite comedy actors and he could have saved this movie if he was in it longer.I really did not enjoy Matthew Broderick as Leo Bloom,it was hard when you had to compare him to the fantastic performance from Gene Wilder in the original,but he also didn't seem interested in his lines,Nathan Lane and Uma Thurman did however deliver great performances as Max Bialystock and Ulla.The Producers is nothing close to outstanding,but you still may enjoy it if you're looking for a good musical,the songs are very catchy and memorable. A crooked Broadway producer co-opts a timid accountant to help him stage a play that is certain to flop.Best Performance: Will Ferrell Worst Performance: Matthew Broderick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably better on Broadway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) is a bad producer who scams old ladies out of their savings. Meek accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) is sent to work on his books. Leo imagines a scheme to steal a much bigger take with a horrendous flop. Max jumps on it right away and Leo comes to realize that "I wanna be a Producer". They find the completely inappropriate "Springtime for Hitler" written by Nazi sympathizer Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell).The Mel Brooks movie was made into a Broadway musical and this is the film version of that musical. I like a couple of the songs but it's probably better to see it on Broadway. It doesn't translate well onto the big screen. It doesn't have the energy. As for a comparison to the 1967 movie, the two leads fall short on a few areas. Nathan Lane is wonderful is his own right but he doesn't have Zero's big body and therefore is reduced in presence. Zero can command the screen just by being there. Matthew Broderick is nowhere close to Gene Wilder's high strung character. He's not a comedian like Gene. This one has its moments. But all the weird characters don't get a big laugh from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darn that director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we all are well aware, there is a decided difference between stage and film. This is the line that this film could not straddle, but I'll get to that in a moment.The pros are, of course, the songs and performances. Broderick and Lane SLAUGHTER it and are wonderful together. Beach and Bart are funnier than ever, perhaps even more-so than they were live. They jokes are classic and the timing is wonderful. A few of the newcomers, especially Ms. Thurman, didn't quite fit in as well as might have been hoped; not terrible, just not great.The biggest issue with this film is the directing. It might just be me, but when turning a play or musical into a film you have to treat it as though it had never been on stage; all rooms and locations should have FOUR walls, and if the blocking of the original show has to be ditched completely so be it. The musical that accomplished the transition from stage to screen best, where blocking is concerned, is probably RENT. In this movie, it's hard to look at it as though they're not on stage. The director stuck to the limitation of having three walls and treats the fourth wall as it would be treated on stage. It feels rough and false, not natural at all. Everyone is cheating out, even though there's no audience to cheat out for.I'm all for being true to the show, and this musical in particular works amazingly and deserves all the praise it's received and more. Perhaps if they'd actually filmed the live show it would have work, but as is it just doesn't work.Wonderful musical, poor movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something of a let-down after the cast recording</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this film via a rather strange route. The original "The Producers" was one of the few Mel Brooks films I actually liked (I remember finding the "Springtime for Hitler" number, seen for the first time in complete ignorance of what was to come, hysterically, unbelievably funny in a "I couldn't *believe* they just did that!" kind of way -- literally bent over clutching the back of a chair in uncontrollable laughter), and I was deeply sceptical about plans to put on a stage version. However, years later when I came across a CD recording of the Broadway musical version, much to my surprise I loved it even more than my condensed soundtrack LP of the original film: great new songs like "I Want to be a Producer", "King of Old Broadway" and "Keep it Gay", with memorable tunes and clever lyrics. I instantly coveted my own copy of the CD and bore it off home with great triumph.So when I had a chance to watch a DVD of the film-of-the-musical-of-the-film I was curious and excited. But... I don't know how well the actual stage production went over (and by all accounts it was a great success), but I found the film fell rather flat: in most cases the visuals of the musical numbers didn't improve on the recorded versions, and the 'business' often seemed to detract (and perhaps unsurprisingly, the lyrics didn't come across so clearly as in the recording studio). What was wittily suggestive on the soundtrack tended to come over as rather crass on screen; this is, after all, Mel Brooks...Particular gripes would be the poor puppetry on the pigeons, and the decision to keep cutting away to views of the audience looking shocked during the "Springtime for Hitler" number: *we the viewers* are the audience for this number, and it is we who ought to be shocked and flabbergasted at the sheer bad taste on display (a nodding German sausage on a headdress? a chorus girl dressed as an imperial eagle?!) Showing the reaction in the theatre was a distraction, with a danger of feeling 'oh how stupid these people are, can't they see that it's so bad as to be funny?' and/or of appearing to lecture the viewer as to what they ought to be feeling... In fact I felt that the decision to have Roger de Bris camp up the Hitler role horribly and to show the audience finding only that funny was a mistake: it switches the emphasis to yet another rerun of the tediously broad homosexual humour, which had already been mugged to death by this point, rather than to the original shock value of sheer bad taste. Perhaps it was felt that the number was now too well-known to have the same impact.But again and again I found the visuals went too far over the top to be amusing, whether it was de Bris' live-in entourage or Bloom's nervous hysteria: the idea was funny, but the actual presentation was then often too crude for me to laugh. In fact I was particularly disappointed when I saw the cast list and realised that it was in fact Lane and Broderick from the original cast recording: the line readings had varied so much from the stage recording that I'd assumed the roles had been recast for the screen production! (I'm interested to see that one reviewer specifically notes that he didn't remember Broderick's character acting as loud or borderline annoying in the Broadway performance...) Ulla's dance was also a great disappointment after my imaginings (or even after the 1968 version) and Uma Thurman totally fails to 'belt' the number where stipulated -- I did otherwise enjoy the expanded character though.I've still rated the film at 7/10, because after all, they were good songs (though they cut "The King of Old Broadway" -- I couldn't believe it!) and by and large it was a pretty good experience. But most telling, I think, is the fact that I found myself afterwards with absolutely no desire to get hold of a copy of this DVD for myself. An earlier reviewer hits it on the head when she writes "I didn't think it was bad, but I was disappointed."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of The Producers runs a bit too long and some musical numbers simply don't work. The film never escapes its theatrical origins. Nathan Lane is an inspired choice as Max Bialystock. Matthew Broderick and Uma Thurman are alright but Will Ferrell steals the show as the psychotic Franz Liebkind. There are plenty of jokes and a lot of gay innuendo. The play Springtime For Hitler(!) is quite well depicted, perhaps better than the original film. With better editing, a shorter run time and fewer musical numbers, this would have been quite good. Watchable at home on television/DVD.Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>and I thought I wouldn't like this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, I love the original Producers. I consider it to be one of the top ten comedies ever made. It has everything you can ask for in a comedy: funny people, funny lines and (most importantly) a funny and coherent plot. So when I heard they were going to bring this back as a Broadway play I was faced with a dilemma: see it because I love the original so much, don't see it- they're going to change things in it that I believe are sacred. I decided not to see it because " I know that if they leave out the line 'White, white, white is the color of our carpet' I'll have to get up and walk out of the theater.'" I caught the film made from the musical on HBO the other night and I really made the right decision...nothing upsets me more than to be among an appreciative audience while I am picking something to pieces. So watching the film I wasn't as aggravated as I might have been had I seen it on Broadway. That said, there's not much reason to see this film if you've seen the original. Every single main character is inferior to their counterpart in the '67 version with the possible exception of Uma Thurman(although in all fairness her part has been lengthened immensely and, truth be told, I'd take Lee Meredith over her any day of the week). All the changes that have been made weaken the script, or at least make it less economical. What is illustrated with a phrase in '67 is brought home with a sledgehammer here. The songs are, by my standards, awful. Though by Broadway standards that makes them brilliant! (See my review of Chicago). I don't know, after you see a musical shouldn't you be able to recall some of the tunes? The only thing you walk away humming are the songs from the original. Is it the worst thing in the world? No. But like Harry Connick Jr., why would you listen to him when you can still hear all the really great singers doing a lot of the same songs, only better. Doesn't make Connick bad, but why choose an inferior version when a superior one exists? Overall, the message of The Producers the musical is a very old one: the trick of a masterpiece is knowing when to put the brush down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shock, Schlock Mar Bialystock &amp;Company **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An early song in this Mel Brooks romp describing shock, schlock of Max Bialystock really describes the problems in this offensive movie. Yes, offensive it is to all groups. Singing about Hitler and Germany is most obnoxious. Could you imagine Holocaust survivors sitting through this? Unlike the original film, the song of "Springtime for Hitler" is lengthy and downright insensitive.Nathan Lane reprises the role originally done by the late Zero Mostel. He is engaging but lacks the emotional nerve needed for the role of this conniving human being.Matthew Broderick is Leo Blum, the bookkeeper originally played by Gene Wilder in the film. Broderick's performance is lacking. Though he sings well, his emotional outbursts lack the zany insanity of the Oscar nominated Wilder.There are some added songs and Will Ferrell as the author of "Springtime" is engaging but does not tackle the role as Kenneth Mars did in the original.Perhaps another flop could have made such as a nonsensical musical of Julius Caesar. Dancing to the Ides of March might have yet been hilarious!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite a Bialystock &amp; Bloom production, but no triumph either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of The Producers isn't quite the catastrophe it's been painted, though it's still a long way from a success. Some of its problems can be traced to the stage show - Mel Brooks' musical score is still thin despite much improved orchestration and, though toned down from his deeply irritating stage performance, Matthew Broderick misjudges things quite badly more often than not, while there's no excuse for flattening 'Springtime For Hitler' by padding it out to three times its length (indeed, this remake clocks in at three-quarters of an hour longer than the original). Some problems are unique to the film version: certainly if you're one of the many wondering why some people find Will Ferrell funny, you'll find no answer here in his terrible performance, while cutting the 'King of Broadway' number (to be found among the deleted scenes on the DVD) seems a misjudgement as it's one of the funnier and better staged numbers.Nathan Lane does well enough as Bialystock, although he's given a little too much rope to be at his best, Uma Thurman is better than expected and even Susan Strohman's direction isn't as bad as it's been made out, far more cinematic than her critics claim although it doesn't entirely escape the feeling that the only reason there isn't a fourth wall on screen is because there wasn't one in the theatre. Still, the 'I Want to Be a Producer' production number is an impressive throwback to some of the lesser MGM musicals, and the theatricality of 'That Face' works surprisingly well. It's certainly better than the screen versions of many Broadway musicals churned out in the 60s or 70s, but the tighter-paced and much better scripted original needn't worry about it stealing its thunder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but fails to reach the high expectations i had for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie, based on a play, based on a movie, about a play. Seems complicated. Quite easy. Mel Brooks' 1963 classic comedy was an instant hit, and was listed on AFI's Top 100 comedies of all time. The Broadway show went up in 2001 and has never had an empty seat. It's won so many Tonys, it was able to start its own organized crime syndicate.So the new movie should be a shoe-in for greatness. Just couldn't quite reach it though. The Producers is about Max Bialystock and Leopold Bloom, a Broadway producer and an accountant who figure out a scheme to make more money of a flop Broadway show than a hit show. So they find the worst show ever written, a little gem called "Springtime For Hitler" and agree to produce it. Unfortunately for them, people love it, and it becomes a hit.Now, with a Mel Brooks script, you can't really go wrong (Dracula Dead and Loving It aside), especially one as tried and true as The Producers. He was able to get most of the original Broadway cast back for the film, the only exceptions being Will Ferrell as "Springtime For Hitler" scribe Franz Leibkind and the lovely Uma Thurman as the lovelier Swedish secretary Ulla. They were able to fit into the cast as if they had been there since the start. They were funny and right in cue with the rest of them, which can be hard to do with a musical and a cast that had been together for years.As for the cast members that were in the original cast. The two worst performances were given by the two leads who had more film experience than the rest of the cast. I think they were just too comfortable with the stage show and brought those performances to the film. But acting on film is way different than acting on stage. So it just looked and sounded awkward, particularly Matthew Broderick.If you want to see a good version of The Producers on film, rent the original. If you want to see the musical version, go to New York and good luck getting tickets. This seemed more like a PBS filmed stage show rather than a film version of a stage show.But because of the pedigree and the supporting cast, it gets high marks.</fullReview>

Matthew and Nathan are perfectly cast as the new producers, but it looked like they had just bought the original Producers and just mimicked Zero and Gene's chemistry as well as lines. Not to mention Uma, how unnecessary was she? I felt that she was miscast, I just can't see her doing Broadway type of movies.While there are some cool dances and this is somewhat of an interesting take on Mel's zangy comedy, it wasn't necessary. The soundtrack was also pretty forgettable. If you are a fan of the first Producers, I wouldn't recommend, but if you haven't seen it or are a huge fan of Broadway, you might get your kicks. But you'll only end up laughing at the same jokes as used in the original Producers.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dick Shawn is rolling in his grave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being a teenager and loving the original Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Kenneth Mars, Mel Brooks classic and raving about it to everyone I knew. As a matter of fact, the original made me want to write my very own comedy musical at 17.The biggest problem with this film is the deletion or not even a tribute in the end credits. Also, the fact that it was a filmed Broadway production in essence, it is hurt dramaticaly (if you'll pardon the pun... and even if you don't.)The story of a pathetic excuse for a Broadway producer teaming up with a milk toast accountant to make a flop and run off with the profits was pure comic genius, and the take-no-prisoners comic gem of a performance by Zero Mostel with the relative newcomer Gene Wilder made one of the greatest comic pairings since Laurel met Hardy. So when I saw Mel Brooks on the Tonight Show one night and conversing with Nathan Lane about turning it into a Broadway show starring Mr. Lane, I knew THIS would be inspired casting. But who could ever fill Gene Wilder's shoes? Answer? - NOT Matthew Broderick. I wanted to love his work in this picture, but I can't stand his singing voice - pale and uninspired, almost amateurish I thought - his dancing stiff- and his comedy work was sub par considering the amazing work by Nathan Lane (from whom I expected nothing less.) Producer George Abbott once said that NO film version of a Broadway musical did it right, and I suspect he meant that it wasn't a carbon copy of the stage production. But then, Mr, Abbott never in his 100 years of living did make a movie. This is the main reason Broadway plays don't generally work on film. ^Those who saw the play expect it and will almost always be disappointed. Besides the fact that when you see a play live, there is a certain energy that does not translate to film.This film is not much more than a play on film which looks cardboard in so many ways. Broadway directors should not make films unless they learn the differences in the mediums. Even old theatrical hand Bob Fosse learned that in his work. Those damned puppet pigeons were just plain damned awful, and even though I love Jon Lovitz, the whole accountant scene could have been lost and I personally wouldn't have missed it.The loss of so many scenes, gags, characters and even show numbers (like the opening number "The King Of Broadway" which most definitely should have been used) was a true waste of celluloid. Even the Astor Bar scene with Lane's old buddy Ernie Sabella (in the role originated by Bill Hickey, best known as the Godfather in the dark classic Prizzi's Honor) was cut.But the biggest offense of all was not even a tribute to the fabulous Dick Shawn's LSD character. Yeah, sure. It was set in 1959 to take advantage of a bunch of theater trivia, so he might have been more than an anachronism, but too many writing changes were made and it hurt the screenplay considerably. Just a simple on screen credit "...in memory of" would have been in order here.Gary Beach was a standout in the flaming caricature of director Roger De Bris, as was his "common-law assistant" whose name escapes me at the moment, but I really did not need an expanded love role for Ulla (though I must admit, I was impressed by Uma Thurman's work even if her accent did slip more than her bra strap) or an absence of great characters like the "concierge" and New York City could have been used so much better advantage.And though I love Will Ferrell's work overall, he could never top Kenneth Mars amazing work in the 1968 original. Basically he stunk, I'm sorry to say. As funny as Will Ferrell is, he is not one for mugging. His comedic work is more understater.And some of my favorite lines were cut as well. Comparatively speaking, Will did not hit the mark.Breaking it down, Nathan Lane channeled Zero Mostel, but Matthew Broderick made a much better Ferris Bueller than a Leo Bloom (and here I'm being kind. He stunk worst of all.) Unlike another reviewer, he never made ME forget Gene Wilder's performance. Not a total Zero, but no hit either. I just hope there is NEVER a musical "Young Frankenstein." We already have "Frankenstein Sings" and "Rocky Horror Picture Show" anyway....and just because this is one of the few films of Zero Mostel, I have to add that I still am angry at Norman Jewison for NOT casting the might Zero in the role he originated on Broadway, Tevye in "A Fiddler On The Roof." To this day, I refuse to watch that film.</fullReview>

Uma Thurman was just OK--beautiful of course, but inconsistent. Her accent seemed to come and go. The ending is completely different than the original; I didn't see what they'd been doing with it in the recent Broadway version. It seems that several songs were written just for this movie and the songs were very unimpressive. It's an ending that is about 30 minutes too long, and frankly, what would have been a 6 in my rating scale is a weak 5 because of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly story, but enjoyable for the musical production numbers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stage musicals always have a story, but often the story is very silly, very unlikely, or very 'camp.' In 'The Producers', it is all of these. But that doesn't matter, because if you see a show like this, you do so for the acting and production numbers, not for the story. This is the movie version of the hit Broadway play, and has the look and feel of a stage musical. The performances are very good, the musical numbers excellent, I found it to be a very enjoyable movie.Nathan Lane is Producer Max Bialystock, hardly ever with a successful show. While being audited, the CPA Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) casually mentions that Max might actually make more money with a flop that opens and closes the same night, and just keeping the up front money that he convinces all his little old lady followers to cough up. Very reluctantly Leo agrees to partner with Max, the lure of being a 'Producer'!My favorite role was played by Uma Thurman who is Ulla, a tall and gorgeous Swede who shows up. She gets a job with Max and Leo, then later stars in their musical. Thurman again demonstrates why she is so good. I rarely like Will Ferrell but he is pretty good here as script writer Franz Liebkind, Nazi sympathizer. SPOILERS FOLLOW. Max and Leo set out to find the absolute worst script, the worst actors, and the worst director, while raising $2Million. The play will close on opening night, and they will skip out to Brazil with the money. But 'Springtime for Hitler' turns out to be a hit, a very funny take on Hitler. Franz is upset, comes over shooting, the cops are alerted, they find the fake 'books', eventually Max and Leo end up at Sing Sing, there they put on musicals for the prisoners, their sentences are commuted for having brought so much joy to the hardened criminals.</fullReview>

How about lots of lip-synced singing and much forced pandering to the audience. I'm especially disappointed by Susan Stroman's use of cutesy close-ups and her emphasis on slapping us upside the head with foreshadowed "special moments" (like, if we didn't get a cue, we wouldn't have a clue). The whole movie lacks tension as though it were one big boring exercise. The lack of emotional range gets set at the very beginning when the crowd pans "Funny Boy" and smiles unemotionally the whole time, like a bunch of extras from The Stepford Wives. On another note, I found Stroman's similarly treacly treatment of gay themes offensive -- and again not funny. Can't anything be presented with some serious undertones in order to generate some range?</fullReview>

The movie attempt is commendable for its staging of the a number of the old-time musical dance numbers, many done with grand flair, yet the movie seems both dated, forced in places, and uneven. Some of the stage acting just doesn't easily transfer to the big screen and some of the exaggeration both sometimes work brilliantly as much as crashing into idiocy. There are moments of nice on location sets that bring a heightened atmospheric musical Sound of Music big screen experience while at other times it seems to fade from view.

Along with a musical score, first performed on Broadway in 2001, the movie has a terrific mix of stars. Matthew Broderick (Leopold Bloom) and Nathan Lane (Max Bialystock) are the main characters who cook up a plot to make two million dollars. "You can make more money with a flop than with a hit,"says Bloom and the movie jumps into the real action, metaphorically speaking.The songs such as "Along Came Bialy" help move the story along. Excellent dance moves accompany "When you Got it Flaunt it" and "Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop (in which Bloom and Bilaystock try to get the worst play ever written from its author, a Hitler-loving maniac who demands they dance with him to prove they are worthy to produce his play; a more than side-splitting scene)". All the music and singing fits and the dances and lyrics sometimes make you cry with their hilarity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely hilarious! It's definitely better than the original.Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are wonderful in the starring roles, while Wil Farrel, Gary Beach and Roger Bart are perfect scene-stealers. Uma Thurman was surprisingly witty and sexy in the role of Swedish bombshell Ulla.A couple minor jokes fell a bit flat, but overall the movie had me laughing until my sides were sore and the musical numbers are first rate: words and music were equally lovely and, of course, given it's a Brooks film, delightfully witty. If for no other reason than the songs themselves, it's worth taking a look.'I Wanna Be a Producer' has to be one of the (if not THE) best musical production numbers ever filmed. The whole movie has the bright, light feel of the classic musicals like 'Singing In the Rain'.Anyone who likes musicals, comedy and/or Mel Brooks will enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Producers tells the story of Max Bialystock, a Broadway producer who has had some really bad flops lately. A public accountant named Leo Bloom arrives to do Max's books one day, and he discovers that a producer can make more money with a flop then he can with a hit. Upon hearing this, Bialystock teams up with Bloom to find the worst play ever written, the worst director in town, and the worst cast around. When their surefire flop becomes a huge success, they suddenly find themselves in more trouble than they can handle. Even though the story is the same and a lot of the lines are the same, this movie is extremely lacking in comparison to the original.Mel Brooks is a comedic genius, and I will say that it's cool that he was able to write songs and turn his original classic into a Broadway musical, but it just doesn't work as a movie. This isn't made like a movie from a Broadway show, but like a Broadway show in the form of a movie. Mel Brooks' hilarious situations and funny lines don't even have an effect here, because the Broadway style of the film dwindles the effect. Another problem in itself is how nothing is different from the original except for a few added sexual innuendos and of course the songs from the show. None of the songs really caught my interest. To me it seemed to make the movie longer and more boring. Every time a song came on or a dance number started, I knew it was adding to the running time, and it started to annoy me.The acting in this movie was, for the most part, pretty good. Nathan Lane put an amusing twist on the character last played on film by Zero Mostel. Will Ferrell is pretty funny as Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind, but he doesn't live up to the original portrayal. Uma Thurman is good as Swdish secretary Ulla. She sings better than I would have expected. The performance that irritated me the most was Matthew Broderick as Leo Bloom. It really annoyed me in the beginning how he was trying to be just like Gene Wilder, but he was failing miserably. He also played it like he would on stage with the big facial expressions and annoyingly loud voice.Overall, this movie was extremely lacking in comparison to the original film, and it's not really worth it.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful actors and a wonderful producer. Like many movies with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, this is a smash! Matthew and Nathan have perfect chemistry on set. While Nathan is in-your-face-comedy, Matthew has an approach of timid mousy characteristics with the occasional burst of emotions. When watching this movie, Nathan demonstrates his wonderful acting. Even when the camera's not on him, he shows facial expressions that go along perfect with each character's dialog. This is one of the best movies starring Nathan Lane.Matthew (who already had experience with musicals) is perfect for the role of Leo Bloom. His emotions are like real! When the Camera's on Matthew he makes sure he gets the emotions across to everyone. Another great movie.Overall, together the actors are perfect. This movie should get more credit than it's given. One of the best musicals brought to movie theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie and I had never really seen the original much less the Broadway play. I was expecting more of a typical Mel Brooks type of humor and not the typical type of conventions from a 1950s musical. I got the latter.As the movie wore on, it got more and more cheesy. While Nathan Lane was generally on line, Matthew Broderick was way over the top. The acting was stage acting, comedy, slapstick stage acting with broad stage movements meant to be seen by the last row but inappropriate for film. The whole thing, in fact, looked like a filmed stage play. That, in and of itself, is no great critique as all but the very best movie musicals (i.e. Sound of Music) are. This just seemed a typically obvious adaptation.Nothing against that as most musicals are, but this one did not have the wit or the songs to carry the day. The songs weren't particularly good and like said, rather cheesy, especially toward the end and Broderick has no great musical talent.Thankfully Will Ferrell was excellent and saved the movie to a large extent as did some of other supporting characters (Carmen Ghia and Roger BeBris). I also appreciate Brooks making a true live-action musical which only seems to come along once every several years in modern times, but this is not enough to carry the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Producers is a movie adaptation of the popular Broadway musical The Producers, which in turn is an adaptation of the Mel Brooks movie classic, Blazing Saddles. Now I don't know much about New York, but I can say with absolute certainty that there can't be many Jewish people living there! Why? Because they would surely have been outraged by the plot of this particular stage show! The Producers is the most blatantly pro-Nazi film I have ever seen! I've seen Blazing Saddles, it was a delightful comedy about some men doing a farts. Ha ha hah! Farts! But apparently when they were turning it into a Broadway show they decided that farts (ha!) weren't controversial enough these days and opted to make a musical about the glory days of Nazi Germany! I'm sorry, but are we just supposed to forget that Adolf Hitler's actions led to the deaths of DOZENS of people during The First Second World War? Is it meant to be okay to kill people as long as you explain it away with a catchy song and dance routine? Maybe a REALLY good dance routine could excuse two or three deaths, but any more than that are just inexcusable. MAYBE four, but definitely no more than that? To be honest, I can't blame people for wanting to make a musical about Hitler's attempts to rule the world. After all, they were called the Nazi PARTY, and every party needs music! Except a party for deaf people, but let's face it - what do they have to celebrate? Even though I can understand the reasoning behind the idea of a light-hearted musical about Nazis, something about it still seems a little wrong to me.The film stars some big-name actors who you might be surprised to hear are Nazi sympathisers. Nathan Lane starred in Mousehunt, but perhaps he would have preferred to star in Jewhunt. Matthew Broderick got his big break in the movie War Games, but all the while he must have been wishing that he could be committing War Crimes. He was the lead in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but would he rather Ferris had spent a day working in a concentration camp? The lead actress in The Producers is the lovely Uma Thurman, but should her parents have christened her U-boat Thurman? Yes, they should. And completing the cast is the hilarious Will Feral, who recently made the family comedy Kicking and Screaming, but seemingly would have preferred to spend his time dragging people kicking and screaming to their deaths at the hands of his Fuehrer.Hitler is often called 'the greatest monster of the twentieth century' by his critics. I'm not a fan of the guy, but I think that this is going a bit too far. Granted he had a knack for delivering a bitter, hate-filled, violent rhetoric, intended to inspire his followers to carry out some reprehensible atrocities, but ultimately I feel he would have struggled to take down, say, Godzilla. Toe to toe against any of his monster peers, I have to say I think he would struggle. I doubt he could even handle a Mogwai.Despite my reservations about the Nazi's more evil qualities, I do think they gave us a lot of good things too. Roads, canals, monocles. For this reason, I have no problem saying that this is the best pro-Nazi musical I have seen since Mary Poppins first goose-stepped onto the big screen.

		<fullReview>This is a remake of the original 1968 Mel Brooks classic, Brooks' first movie. It begins almost identically to the original and Nathan Lane does an admirable job in Zero Mostel's shoes, giving credit where credit is due. Beyond that, however, this movie goes downhill. I am comparing to the original, remember, which is one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. Matthew Broderick makes a HORRIBLE Leo Bloom. He just does not have the believability as a nervous character that the great Gene Wilder brought to the role. Uma Thurman as Ulla just did not do anything for me. And Will Ferrell as Franz, come on... that was one of the funniest characters in the original. I know that the Lorenzo St. DuBois (L.S.D) character was taken out to "update" the movie, but the whole of the production was hinged on his "Hitler".If you have seen this new movie, please please please see the original. If you have seen the original, you will be sorely disappointed with the new one. If you have seen neither, I think you will know which to choose!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Producers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start the review proper, since there might be some who just like a peek at what the movie offered and missed out on my all important tip, so I shall mention it first. Stay until the end of the credits roll. Not only will you be entertained by the song sung by Will Ferrell during the roll, and some ad-lib at the end about buying 'Mein Kampf' from Borders, Barnes and Noble, and Amazon, you'll be treated to one last short song-dance sequence sung by almost all the cast in turn, telling you to get lost, get out because the movie's over. Anyway I enjoyed The Producers more than I enjoyed Rent. Perhaps I'm not as deep and prefer my musicals to be fluffy entertainment, at least for those which made the transition from stage to screen. This Tony AWard winning musical by Mel Brooks tells the story of down-on-his-luck Broadway musical producer Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane), and his accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick). Max is an unscrupulous, unethical producer who obtains financing by making the wishes of horny rich old ladies come true, by being their elderly boy toy, while Leo is an aspiring producer wannabe suffering from a case of severe insecurity, who hatches a plan for both of them to strike it rich to the tune of a million dollars each by making a dud musical.They go all out to find the worst script - Springtime for Hitler, written by Neo-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell, in a better outing than the boring Bewitched), hire the worst director Roger DeBris (Gary Beach)- a gay man with a gay crew (lead by Roger Bart) decked in Village People outfits who all unanimously agree to make a gay musical, get the worst actors, and stumble upon one hot Swedish chick - Ulla (Uma Thurman).There are plenty of madcap humor and sexual innuendo incorporated throughout the musical, which doesn't bore and kept things fresh somewhat. The cast obviously seem to be having a riot of the time, with their one-dimensional characters hamming it up. A few scenes stand out given its extended length in song and dance, especially those that involve Max and Leo getting their cast and crew to sign on the dotted line.In particular, I enjoyed the sequence where they had to convince Franz to give them the rights to his Hitler musical, and it's a hoot to see the "well-trained" animatronic pigeons trained in Nazism. And who can forget the scene with Roger DeBris as they had to suffer the eccentricities of a director who swings the same way. Uma's scenes were all crazy and funny, as she had to speak in this accent that provided plenty opportunity for puns. And ooh-lala, can she shake that bootie :P We do get to see a bit of Springtime for Hitler though, but that signaled a decline in pace for the entire musical. It was as if the job has been done, and the plot was forcefully extended for that bit of soul searching and closure by the characters Max and Leo.It's pretty enjoyable, with some nice songs, and some very nicely choreographed scenes (I dig the one where Leo had gone back to the drudgery of his accounting firm, with robotic co-workers singing about being unhappy). If you're barred from Rent because you're under-aged, then probably The Producers could make it up to you with its brand of song and dance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good night at the theatre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is clunkier than the original and less polished. Its stage origins and director Susan Stroman's lack of any kind of cinematic sensibility is obvious. It's filmed theatre and no mistake. And while we're on the subject on where it doesn't measure up, Matthew Broderick is no match for Gene Wilder, (he is like an overgrown baby, but then maybe that's the point). Still, for someone who supposedly set Broadway on fire in a revival of "How to succeed in business without really trying", he doesn't appear to have sense of musical-comedy timing. And as Franz Liebkind, Will Ferrell lacks Kenneth Mars' sense of maniacal danger, (he's a cuddly Nazi).Now with that out of the way, let's just say that it's almost as funny as the original non-musical version, (and that is saying a heck of a lot). Most of the original jokes are retained and are tarted up and made the ruder for the Millennium. And this time round the gay element is ratcheted up to delirious effect with the roles of Roger DeBris and Carmen Ghia greatly increased, (and they are blissfully well played by Gary Beach and Roger Bart), and the musical numbers have a good old-fashioned Broadway oomph about them.Best of all it preserves on film Nathan Lane's wonderful turn as Max Bialystock. That Lane (almost) banishes memories of Zero Mostell is no mean feat. At times he sticks too closely to Mostell's interpretation like an actor trying to fit into a sacrosanct role but when he lets loose there is an almost diabolical glee about his acting that is all his own. Perhaps it might have been better to have let well enough alone; on the other hand this version is giving a new generation an opportunity to experience the whole thing first hand for the first time. Maybe we should be grateful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this show on Broadway just after Nathan Lane left the cast. I saw this show at Drury Lane, London, the night Nathan Lane hurt his back and did not appear. Now, at last, Nathan Lane, and he is good, very very good. And so are the rest of the cast in this transfer to the large, widescreen.This is Susan Stromen's first appearance on screen rather than stage and she does a fine job of direction and choreography. The screen lights up for the big song and dance routines. And Matthew Broderick is a revelation as a dancer as well as a pleasant voice.Mel Brook's humor is good, most of the songs are tuneful, particularly the title song, but one or two seem vaguely familiar from other sources (La Cage aux Folles for one). Some of the Jewish humor, so evident on Broadway has either gone or been watered down, for example the deletion of "King of Broadway". This is, I think, a mistake as it makes the first 20 minutes very wordy and, lets not mince words, boring. But with "We can do it", followed by "I wanna be a producer" all is forgiven. This is like the old brash Hollywood musicals of yesteryear.The deletion of "Old Bavaria" cuts a very funny sequence from the stage show with the pigeons, partially redeemed later, and the "Keep it gay" is splendidly over-the-top and politically incorrect. But, then, that's Mel Brooks for you.I have the DVD of the original Zero Mostel movie, I have seen the musical twice on stage, once in the cinema. I have the original cast CD bought in Times Square straight after the show. And, soon, I will have the widescreen DVD of the musical. Am I a fan? You betcha. My favorite bits? The brilliant and spectacular "Springtime for Hitler" that must rank in the top ten of everybody's best moments in cinema history, and the show titles at the end. She shtups to conquer. Pure Brooks.Go see it but if you get the chance, go see the show, its even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original Producer's film, this movie was a bit disappointing. Throughout the beginning of this production, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick attempt to mimic the jokes and characters as portrayed by Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in the original, which would have been great had they done it as well or better. To me, Matthew Broderick has no personality in this movie, rarely making facial expressions as well as bad mimicry. My only other complaint about this film is the role of Ulla. If I hadn't seen the original, I probably wouldn't care. Ulla's elaborated role in this movie does have a point, but seems slightly superfluous. Towards the middle of the movie, things picked up a bit and finally it seemed the actors were adding their own spin on their characters. Will Ferrell really adds flavor to the role of Franz Liebkind, someone you want to see more of in the original. Gary Beach as Roger DeBris is fantastic! He keeps the general personality of the original Roger DeBris and adds his own charm. Not to mention his companion - Roger Bart as Carmen Ghia, a splendidly creepy role. My only other complaint about this film is the role of Ulla. If I hadn't seen the original, I probably wouldn't care.

Nathan Lane was terrific, no doubt about it, but Matthew Broderick paled in comparison to Wilder. Will Ferrell, on the other hand, proved a worthy complement to Kenneth Mars. Both were outstanding in their own way as Franz Liebkind. The new material and many of the musical numbers were great additions. The whole "Heil Myself" number is a stitch. And Uma Thurman works for me. Boy, does she. The only negatives I can say about the original is that Dick Shawn's hippie-like character and Lee Meredith's scenes are definitely dated. But those are pretty small nits to pick. The main weak spot in the new film is that Broderick can't hold a candle to Gene Wilder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 2/25/2006 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Susan Stroman): Funny Broadway musical spoof that also turns out to be a fairly good movie musical in itself. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are great as the partners wanting to produce the biggest flop in history in hopes in making more money than would be usual for a typical Broadway show. This movie, based on the tony award winning play which is based on the 1968 comedy of the same name, holds up despite a lot of dated gay comedy references. Will Farrell is also very good as the Nazi sympathizer who writes the play "Springtime for Hitler" in hopes of bringing about better publicity for his beloved fuhrer. Mel Brooks's corny humor is sprinkled throughout the film as we'd expect since he has a lot to do with all versions of this piece but what I thought was interesting is that he wrote all the music as well. The music is very well done with wonderfully inventive sets that stand out with each song and are well performed by the vocalists. This music with the performances of the main stars are what stand out in this uniquely made, sometimes over-the-top but very funny, and well put together movie.</fullReview>

The Broadway musical was, like the movie remake,a hit with people of degraded tastes. Truly wretched songs were added, for one thing,and they have been apparently transferred to this movie version of the Broadway show. Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane are garish caricatures. They do not perform and do not act; they merely mug and pose and throw themselves about clumsily and unconvincingly.(It's arguable which of the two is worse.)The role of Franz Liebkind has been greatly expanded from a nice little counterpoint for Mostel and Wilder to a feature role for Will Ferrell, who is not good in it: it's just more mugging.

		<shortDescription>A fun and fantastic musical extravagance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big believer in judging movies on what they want to be. A lot of the criticisms of The Producers seem to be forgetting that this is an intentionally OTT, gaudy, camp and ridiculous musical, which puts it's strength in the audience's ability to play along and enjoy the bizarre ride accompanied by some fantastically elaborate musical numbers. So yes, Broderick, Lane and everyone else in the cast completely overacts to a cringeworthy degree, and there isn't much of an adaptation from the stage to the screen. In addition to this, the film is also pretty stupid and zany. But for all these reasons and many more I absolutely love the musical adaptation of The Producers.I think Nathan Lane plays his role perfectly, and I couldn't see anyone else in his role (in terms of musicality. I'm well aware of how good a job the original Max played his role). Matthew Broderick is slightly more replaceable, but he has a good voice and he does the sweet bits in his songs really well. Uma Thurman is the only person who I would say is actively miscast, but she was a big star at the time. Not to mention, as I said in my reviews of Chicago and Les Miserables (both of which I also love), that my appreciation of these films hinges entirely on the songs, and everything else is just extras. There's a number of standout songs in The Producers, especially in the first half. Then obviously there's Springtime For Hitler, and Betrayed, and yeah, there's only really two stinkers and they're the two slow ones (That Face and 'Til Him).So add to that the fact that I laughed out loud at a lot of the jokes in The Producers, more so than usual for either a comedy or a musical, and the fact that there was barely a minute I wasn't enjoying myself watching a movie that's over two hours long. Yeah, I love The Producers. It's a proper old school musical with a sense of fun, great jokes, a great cast and great songs. I really don't see what everyone's problem is.</fullReview>

Come on folks, except few scenes, this version is far superior to Mel Brook's take on so many grounds. And I am a Mel Brook's fan. Acting, script, editing, directing is all better. Some characters in the original movie really irk you both by their portrayal and their poor acting, whereas they are quite jolly in the remake.It must be longing for nostalgia or a snobbish dislike to remakes. If you have to choose in between, go for the younger one if you yourself are younger than 50.

		<fullReview>If Mel Brooks dies tomorrow (I hope he doesn't, but hypothetically speaking), this film would be considered a good ending note for him, even though he didn't direct it. His last film before this one was the disappointingly unfunny "Dracula: Dead &amp; Loving It" (1995). Traditionally, comedians die after making their worst movies, but Brooks deserves better. His comeback came early in the millennium not on screen, but on stage with the Broadway musical "The Producers", which was famously sold out years in advance. Being a big Mel Brooks fan from every movie he's made from the original "The Producers" (1968) to his last great film, "Robin Hood: Men In Tights" (1993), I was thrilled the Broadway version became permanently preserved on the big screen so I could finally see it.To best enjoy this film, you probably have to disregard the original 1968 movie starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. However, to Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick's credit, their major strength in this movie was the fact that they didn't try to imitate their celluloid predecessors. When Lane's Max Bialystock breaks down and literally cries for help from Broderick's Leo Bloom, he thankfully doesn't imitate Mostel's famous on screen moment that could easily have made Wilder deaf in his left ear. It would be hard even for me not to take from that scene.Similarly, Broderick brings his own energy to the Bloom character that's different than the way Wilder did it. Wilder's performance was by no means better than Broderick's, and visa versa. They were different, and thankfully both funny. Of course, there was the famous fountain scene in the original 1968 film that was hinted at in this version. Roger Ebert said in his review that he just kept waiting for the fountain to burst, and I found myself feeling the same way. On the other hand, I thought Broderick's previous scene in the accounting office was a great touch, and Jon Lovitz was very funny as the fascist-like supervisor Mr. Marks.Pretty much everything that was in the original Broadway musical, including the songs, worked here. There were a few songs whose placement seemed contrived (i.e. "If You Got It, Flaunt It"), but most fit well as they should have since Mel Brooks wrote all the songs himself. Gary Beach and Roger Bart reprized their roles as the ambiguously (or not) gay directors Roger DeBris and Carmen Ghia, and could have easily gotten Supporting Actor nominees at the Oscars that year (although Beach did win a Tony for the same role).Will Ferrell tackled the role of Franz Liebkind both without imitating Kenneth Mars from the original, and without making any winks and nods to the camera as he has done with some of his starring roles. Although he looks too young to be a former Nazi soldier, he dives right into his part, keeps his energy up, and remains funny throughout. Just imagining him dancing the "Der Guten Tag Hop Clop" still cracks me up.Of the main cast, I can't help thinking that Uma Thurman was the most miscast as the ditsy Swedish secretary Ulla. After seeing her in "Pulp Fiction" and both "Kill Bill" movies playing tough, no-nonsense, determined, strong women, seeing her play someone who's quite the opposite of those characters doesn't feel right. Even if she wasn't in those roles designated to her by Quentin Tarantino, she looks more intimidating than sexy as she, at six feet in height, towers over both Lane and Broderick. It doesn't matter what she's wearing. She just doesn't come off as lust-inducing as she should. Nicole Kidman may have been good at this part, but ideally a younger actress would have been best to pull off the "cute naive girl in the big city" role. Jessica Simpson would not have been a bad choice. Amanda Seyfried or Kirsten Dunst also would have been good choices.The only other weakness was the set design, only because every set (Bialystock's office, Debris' house, the courtroom) looks like it was put together on a theater stage. You saw most of just one wall in these scenes, as if you were watching this play on one stage. It didn't feel like a third dimension was there, and that dimension is crucial for a movie of this magnitude. Overall, though, most of the performances compensated for the theater-look of this film. Fans of the original can say what they will about this adaptation, but it deserved to be brought to the big screen. Most importantly, there's a great scene at the end (after the credits) that gives Mel Brooks the attention he deserves besides a few screen credits. It's an end note that deserves a standing ovation, although you may not have to give one if watching the DVD at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining musical fun, with great songs by Mel Brooks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Producers" is a musical comedy about Broadway. The movie is a film version of the smash-hit 2001 Broadway musical starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. THAT play was a musical version of Mel Brooks's 1968 film "The Producers", starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. Brooks wrote the songs for the Broadway version and co-wrote the screenplay for this 2005 screen version of the musical. (Confused yet?)I really enjoyed this musical comedy. I'm not really a musical theater guy, but "The Producers" is so funny and full of great songs with hilarious lyrics. It's the kind of musical that I can sit through and enjoy.The story is full of outrageous inappropriateness. A lighthearted musical about Adolf Hitler. Flamboyant homosexual stereotypes. The pimping of oneself to rich elderly women. Sexual innuendos and PG-13 language, although I think the film omits some of the racier lines from the play.Lane and Broderick reprise their acclaimed roles from Broadway and other veterans of the Broadway version pop up among the cast (including Gary Beach reprising his Tony Award-winning role). Added to the film's cast are Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell, giving the movie a little star power to appeal to audiences. I don't think Uma Thurman would ever make it as a Broadway singer, but she wasn't cast in the movie for her voice.I was fortunate enough to see "The Producers" on Broadway, but with the replacement cast. And I bought the CD of the music, so I was familiar with how the original cast sounded before seeing this film. I knew what was going to happen and I knew all the songs, so I could just enjoy them being brought to life on the screen. The music is just like on the Broadway CD and the numbers look a lot like I remember from seeing them on stage, with the choreography and visual gags. This film was a winner in my book.Some of the musical numbers from the show are opened up and placed in the real world for the movie, but the film version doesn't really change all that much from the play. It's more or less a screen translation of the Broadway show, even stagey at times. A few songs were cut out, unfortunately, but that happens with all musicals. (Among the casualties are the great "King of Broadway" and "Where Did We Go Right?") The movie runs over 2 hours long, even with the cuts, but it's fun enough to be manageable.Nathan Lane is great in his role and Gary Beach is great in his. Will Ferrell does a serviceable job as a Nazi sympathizer. Uma Thurman was...meh. I was torn on Matthew Broderick's performance. I never saw him on Broadway, but I don't quite remember the person I saw acting as loud and borderline annoying as Broderick is in this film. Over-the-top outbursts that called to mind Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman). After coming to IMDb, I realized that Broderick was probably doing a Gene Wilder impression, as Wilder originated the role in the 1968 film.I've never seen the original 1968 film, but most people seem to favor it over this 2005 musical version. While the stories are the same, this is not a remake of that film. It is a movie version of the 2001 Broadway musical, and in that regard I think it is a success. The original musical was adapted from the older movie and transformed into a hilarious musical play. I'm not sure what was changed, but this movie is as fun as the Broadway show.I think it's important to know what this movie is before seeing it. People who've only seen the non-musical 1968 comedy tend not to appreciate this re-imagining. And people who don't enjoy musicals should be warned: although it IS a comedy, it is very much a musical, and a good one. If you're familiar with the Broadway play, this movie should not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the $3.00</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always heard about how stunningly funny "The Producers" was. To my delight, I came across a copy of this version at a $3.00 DVD sale last week.I should have saved my $3.00, and hope I might be able to find a used copy of the original that I can trade up on. I did genuinely laugh during "Spingtime for Hitler and Germany," but that was it.This version of "The Producers" is highly polished, splendidly arrayed, has a huge number of dancers and actors. It is also terminally unfunny.I seriously wanted to enjoy this, but for the most part, it was just impossible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film version of the stage musical of the original film of the story of a stage musical produced to be a flop which unexpectedly makes money, then this film could be considered a failure. In a parody of the original story this film is so bad that it really should have flopped but appears to have been a hit. Except that this version was clearly made in Hollywood to be a hit. But it is just a complete disaster loved by many for some reason and so is a paradox rather than parody. It certainly isn't funny or entertaining at any level with tedious and repetitive songs.If Mel Brooks was dead he would be turning in his grave...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will state right off that I am not generally a fan of musicals. That being said, I found this one particularly difficult to watch through to the end. I have not seen the original Mel Brooks production, so am not comparing it.While I normally appreciate Matthew Broderick's acting, this is his worst performance that I have seen. Nathan Lane is mediocre. I am not a big Uma Thurman fan, but found her character the most interesting and well played of the lot.Most of the "songs" in this movie are unbelievably trite and mostly tripe. The dance routines do seem well done, for those that appreciate that.If you are not a HUGE fan of musicals, I would say avoid this one at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself to be an avid patron of the theater. I have seen plays and I have worked in them both behind the scenes and on stage. The one thing I really have some dislike about the theater is the musical. I feel if it isn't done right it usually becomes an awful waste of time and effort. The musical seems too flamboyant and loud that it never makes a connection with the audience like the play is able to do. I usually find that the musical lacks any real emotion, the characters have caricatures of emotion but nothing that I feel I can see as real or identify with. This brings me to my review of the Producers which will make me seem like the biggest hypocrite in the world because the reasons I hate other musicals is the reason I loved The Producers.The difference between the Producers and a lot of other musicals is the world it creates. Some film musicals simply don't have the guts to set up their numbers right( cough Tim Burton's Sweeny Todd cough). The Producers feels like a real Broadway musical complete with chorus lines, surreal sets, and over the top performances. Nathan Lane is absolutely hilarious as Max Bialystock. We can most certainly tell that he has had a great deal of experience in comedy and musicals because he knows how to set up each joke and song perfectly.The film follows the original story very well. Fans of Mel Brook's original film will not be disappointed. Nathan Lane and Matt Broderick create their own interpretations of the characters but they remain faithful to the originators of the roles and so does Bialystock's office set and the costumes.The Producers is as much of a parody of musicals as it is a musical it's self. The staging of some of the songs seems right out of the loudest musicals. The numbers "Keep it Gay" and "Along Came Bialy" are tongue and cheek parodies of how musicals are choreographed. I found myself laughing because I have seen some musicals where dances like those were meant to be fun and a part of the plot.The book(or script in this case) for the Producers sets up the numbers very well. It also seems to have a parody or musical feel to it. Ulla's "When you got it Flaunt it" song is introduced beautifully, like the best of musicals but with that parody slant.My complaints about the film is that it drags on a bit. They needed to trim some of the numbers down and maybe omit an extra song. Unlike theater the movie musical needs to be shorter and more to the point.Will Ferrel as Franz Liebkind is hit and miss. He's funny but his German accent and characterization seems forced and inorganic.All in all I have to say this really was one of the funniest films of recent years. Yes it's flawed at times but every musical is...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that Mel Brooks is my absolute hero, but the only movie of his that I didn't like was The Producers('68). So, when i heard a remake was coming out i wasn't that exited. I thought it would be the same, old lady jokes and all of that. Boy was I wrong. It was laugh out loud funny around every corner. The songs that Mel wrote were hysterical and i liked the new ending too. No offense to Zero Mostel or Gene Wilder but Mathew Broderick and Nathan Lane were 10 times better. Will Ferrel does a great job has a German and i know they those German songs were hard to sing, but he did great. To be I didn't want this movie to end. That was my only complaint. This is one of the best ever made. If you say it is less than 8/10 then you are not in your right mind. It took me a long time to think of a movie that surpassed its greatness. Trust me you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't say this is not worth watching, just that I never will again.I saw the original many years ago, and it was hilarious. I heard great things about Nathan Lane and Broderick Crawford on Broadway in the play, and anxious awaited the movie. The addition of Uma Thurman was just icing on the cake and helped overcome having to sit through another movie with Will Ferrell. I am still having flashbacks from Bewitched, but I will do anything to see Nicole Kidman.I guess I just find Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder to be funnier, and there was no improvement over Mel Brooks work, as he wrote this one too, so the only good thing was Uma Thurman. That is a good thing, but not enough.Watch the original to see it done right, and watch this one just to say you have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Have to See it Twice!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that after the first time I saw this movie I couldn't understand what all of the hype was about...... Until I watched it a second time!!! Wow...what a difference!! After you see it twice you will absolutely see why the musical version won 12 Tony awards. You will fall in love with all of the cast, including Will Ferrell ( who I have never really warmed up to for some reason). My daughter and I have seen it about 16 times and we still haven't gotten tired of it. You will walk around singing most, if not all of the songs and will most likely run out and buy the soundtrack (or sit on your butt and order it from Amazon) like I did. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed, unless you're in your eighties like my dad...he still doesn't get how great it is.</fullReview>

Don't ya get it girls?? Got it? Good!This is by far, one of the best musicals ever! Right up there with Moulin Rouge and Rent...but hysterically funny. We were on the floor with this. YeSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssssss ssssss, every scene is filled with double entendre, absurd and sarcastic sissieness, and tittilating tempestousness, and that's just in the first line! The costume and set design lifts you to Broadway and 42nd, and the musical numbers are some of the most hysterical parts! Usually the diologue, even in musicals, carries the laughs. But not in "The Producers'. Every advantage is taken in song, and no laugh is unturned. "Remember when Ulla dance? Ulla dance AGAIN! See this or be robbed of 1 million or more laughs. This is a movie that will last for lifetimes, and is destined for cult status at some future date. The nose in the air snobs that pan it are obviously no fun at all, and need to get out more.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the 2005 film did not work well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Broadway.com's interview, Nathan Lane said,"?I think we've done the most expensive Lincoln Center archive recording ever made." He's right ? production cost = $45 million and the US gross was $19 million. Each time I've seen the 1968 film, I thought, "They could make a good play out of this." I never saw the Broadway play, but I wasn't surprised that it succeeded. But they would have been better off just filming an actual live production of the play in front of a live audience. The 2005 film does not work - I never laughed once. The 123 minute 2005 film drags, compared to the 88-minute 1968 film. The songs don't substitute for dialogue, but pad and prolong it unnecessarily. Matthew Broderick was embarrassingly bad and Nathan Lane's performance pales in comparison to Zero Mostel.The 2005 film should have eliminated the pointless Opening Night song, and started with the clever accounting office setting. This could have defined Bloom's character, in song, before we even meet Bialystock. It would have said, yes, it's a musical, and no, we're not telling the story exactly as in 1968. But the 2005 film inserted this song while Nathan Lane waits all day at the fountain, damaging the story. When we see how Zero Mostel convinces Gene Wilder to join in this scheme, we understand how he can talk little old ladies out of their money ? without having to see a musical number about it. By comparison, the 2005 film weakens Bialystock's character, since Bloom has to convince himself, without Max around.In the 1968 film, Bialystock tells Bloom that they'll only have to ask Roger De Bris to direct the play; he's so bad that he'll take any work he can get. But the 2005 film again undermines Bialystock's character, by taking forever to get an answer - in order to insert an extravagant "Keep It Gay" number. Andreas Voutsinas' Carmen Ghia in the 1968 film was a virtual clinic on how a subdued performance can be so much funnier than the ever-smiling, overacting Roger Bart. The 2005 film could have eliminated even more of the 1968 dialogue, and had Bialystock and Bloom encounter the song the moment they walked in, with the acceptance as the first line spoken. But that brief elevator ride in 1968 was funnier than the whole 2005 production number, which um, just drags...The way that Zero Mostel introduced Ulla in 1968 was hilarious. While expanding her role might have been a good idea in 2005, her character was poorly written: not believable, inconsistent, and just not funny. Imagine how much fun they could have had, altering the male-dominated story, by having the story end with Bloom the same way it did in 1968, but with Ulla ending up where she went in 2005 - and without her courtroom appearance! Maybe another line or two about painting over the safe's combination lock? Fans of the 1968 film would have smiled at this plot twist for 2005. Bloom's 2005 courtroom appearance defies belief.But the biggest flaws of the 2005 film were the casting of Hitler and the actual premiere performance of the play. The Hitler whom Zero Mostel chose had wandered into the wrong tryout, and forgot his own name. Dick Shawn could be counted on to forget the script and totally screw up the author's play ? which is exactly what happened in that film. When Zero Mostel shouts, "THAT'S OUR Hitler," we sense that he actually HAD been a big-time producer once, because he knew "bad" as well as we do. The 2005 Hitler chosen sang well and could be expected to perform the play as written. But it is completely unbelievable that the 2005 play audience would have been initially turned off and then entertained by what they saw. (Amazingly, the 1968 costumes were far more risqué.) We can tell that the other characters on stage with Dick Shawn realize he is completely departing from the play's script. Part of the fun is that the audience thinks Shawn's performance IS Franz Liebkind's script, and The Producers couldn't have imagined that it could be entertaining. We never even know what Shawn was supposed to do. The 2005 version once again undermines Bialystock, since Roger De Bris' vision IS actually performed (and couldn't have been much different than Franz Liebkind's play.) This proves that Bialystock FAILED to choose an inept director.Bialystock's song and speech in jail adds nothing but insult to the audience, by reviewing the whole boring film for five painful minutes. His claim in court that he's been a crook for 20 years is inconsistent with the story, and undermines his character. He may have been reduced to getting his financing from little old ladies, but he didn't actually try to defraud them until Bloom told him how. Claiming to be a failure for 20 years also contradicts the idea that he had been successful for a long time. The change in the ending is equivalent to saying "Crime pays." If they wanted to change the ending, they should have had Ulla make off with the money, while Bialystock &amp; Bloom went to jail without learning their lesson. And maybe Ulla' mother was one of the swindled little old ladies - and the Dumb Blonde act was just a performance, to become an insider.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Springtime for Hitler is classic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the Gene Wilder version, then I saw The Producers on Broadway, and then, for some reason, I rented the DVD of The Producers remake. I immediately regretted that decision, feeling that Wilder and Mostel could never be replaced, and that the remake had nothing new to offer. But last night I stumbled across it on TV, and have changed my opinion. Throw away the rest of the movie if you must, but keep Springtime for Hitler. That represents about eight minutes of comic bliss, far superior, in my opinion, that the original movie, and featuring Gary Beach as the singing, gay Hitler. Beach is charming and vulnerable, and very American. It made me think that if Adoph Hitler had been like this guy there would have been no Second World War. The humor wasn't anti-gay, it was anti-Nazi (big difference), so I don't think it was politically incorrect in any way. Over the past few days I've watched the Springtime for Hitler sequence about thirty times, and I love it for all the details that weren't in the original version. Hat's off to all concerned, but especially director Susan Stroman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i watched it I thought it was the weirdest movie on the planet, yet i was somehow intrigued to watch it again. The second time I watched it, it was hilarious, the songs weren't so weird anymore, and i couldn't help but laugh, and laugh, and laugh. The jokes are funny, it's completely Mel Brooks, very over the top, which is just fantastic for this movie. Nathan Lane is very funny, almost everything he said made me laugh, Matthew Broderick just brings a childish sense into the movie. The whole plot is just so funny and weird, it's hard not to watch 5 times. I enjoyed lots of the parts in the movie, except for some of the sexual humor, but i'm really not one for sexual humor, but that doesn't means it's bad. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are a pair in this movie, a Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau type of combination, it's hard not to laugh at some of their sequences in the movie, and Uma Thurman shows a little bit of her sexy side. All in all it is a entertaining movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Producers: Not the original but has it's good points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently got a chance to see "The Producers:The Musical" on cable . I say recently, because I had purposely been avoiding watching it. Not that I don't think that Mel Brooks is a comic genius,he is by all means. I didn't want to "spoil" the original. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder were superb. I saw it as a teenager and loved it. As a theater geek, I could appreciate the horrible idea of staging a musical about Hitler. I felt almost as if I would betray the original by seeing the newer version. I rented the musical version a few months back and felt a keen sense of disappointment in about the first 20 minutes because it was line for line the original opening scene in Max's office,but a photocopy,an attempt to be the original. I just kept thinking that the original was better and turned it off.I finally decided I had to watch it and give it another chance. I want to say as a fan of Matthew Broderick's ,I didn't get the same humor as I did in Gene Wilder. In my opinion as a child of the 80's, Broderick was too cool for the role of Leo Bloom an accountant who has a blanket to soothe his neurosis. It didn't fit to me. It was a case of the actor's reputation preceding him and I never was able to make that leap. Nathan Lane made the slimy character of Max his own and he was extremely funny. It stands on it's own merit. It is one performance I feel brings it's own qualities and seeing either movie you get a treat from both performances.I was slightly disappointed in the character of Roger the director. Christopher Hewitt played him so straight,no pun intended, in the original you couldn't help but laugh at how serious he was in a dress and wig because there was no bawdiness behind it. As the movie progresses there is such a sense of each scene having to be flashier than the last, that by the time you get to the actual production of "Springtime for Hitler",it's just not as shockingly funny and becomes just another musical number. I hate to say that, because they are directed with great care by Susan Strohman who makes a seamless transition from stage to movie director.There is just not as much change in the pace when you have been watching several dance numbers by the time Max and Leo's production is staged. This is no fault of the director, but perhaps it just gets lost among the other numbers. Her quality of staging a musical number is so good that you don't get the sheer crassness of it being a bad musical, it's too pretty. I do have praise for two actors in particular for really going against type. Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell really were a surprise and quite enjoyable. I did not expect them to be as talented in music and dance. Overall, it was enjoyable,once I gave it a chance. With any movie remake,and especially this one, I always want to say "If it ain't broke...don't fix it". The comic writings of Mel Brooks are still relative today. Go rent the original and watch the musical if you are a fan of musicals, both are funny in their own right.</fullReview>

I plan on viewing it at least hundred more times - especially the song and dance numbers involving Will Ferrell.The only other thing I need to say concerns Will Ferrell. I just never had any idea he could be so great. This was without doubt the best thing I've ever seen him do. Head and shoulders above anything else I've ever seen.

For starters, there was only one song I really liked and that was the one Uma sings about flaunt it if you got it. There were a few humorous scenes but not enough to make it a good film. And Will Ferrell was not funny in this. He was too over-the-top and silly and the accent was stupid not funny. Broderick and Lane act like they are acting this for Broadway and not a movie. They seemed out of place. While the whole act of "keep it gay" probably goes over well on Broadway, it doesn't have the over all appeal for someone watching this on TV in Nebraska. It you don't get to go to Broadway plays in New York all the time you probably won't get that part much; it works so much better in a play.FINAL VERDICT: You will be disappointed if you are expecting a musical as good as Chicago or Moulin Rouge. There is a reason why this movie made little money at the box office. It's a dud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings on The Producers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do keep in mind that The Producers is a film based on a stage musical based on a film about a stage musical. The story lost some layers of color in the transformation process. The movie certainly isn't anywhere near as powerful and inspired as the 1968 original; and it all too often feels like a filmed stage play. That is, the script and the songs are terrific, and it seems like it ought to be a truly wonderful theatre experience (one that I regret not seeing), but Susan Stroman's direction doesn't go the extra mile to make the film a unique and separate experience that makes the cinematic version worthwhile, in the way of truly great musical to film adaptations ? Cabaret, Chicago and the Rocky Horror Picture Show come to mind, as well as the often overlooked Hedwig and the Angry Inch ? that took, in different ways, a fresh take on the source material that made the film an independent creation. The Producers is more on the level of films like Rent, which bring the play to a bigger crowd but don't really make any new statement.And now that I've said all that I feel hypocritical, because I actually enjoyed The Producers thoroughly and immensely, start to finish. Because it really is lots of fun. The sarcasm of the original film lost little of its edge, and the musical adaptation is terrific, and does honor to Mel Brooks's brilliant original vision. The musical-within-a-musical, which I thought at first might get confusing and unconvincing, actually works remarkably well, and it's very self-aware, with a lot of cynical in-jokes about Broadway and the world of musical theatre. As I said, it's as cynical and dark as the original film, and Brooks avoided the pressure to make it kitschy and happy; any Broadway-style cheesiness there may be in it is self-aware and sarcastic.The cast has its problems, but not too many. Nathan Lane is a terrific Bialystock, every bit as memorable as Zero Mostel's timeless original character. Matthew Broderick isn't nearly as good as Gene Wilder, who was and remains the one and only Leo Bloom, but he gets the job done, and does well on the musical numbers. Gary Beach and Roger Bart are terrific, but I had a problem with Uma Thurman as Ulla, the only cast member not to play the same part on stage; she didn't really deliver with her singing and dancing, and her accent fades in and out throughout. Ulla's scenes were probably the weakest part of the film, and her part in the story was extended far beyond the one she had in the 1968 film, probably because that film didn't have any female lead at all. The real surprise here is Will Ferrell ? one of my least favorite comedians ? who is absolutely side-splittingly spectacular as Franz Liebkind. I regret the loss of Lorenzo St. Dubois AKA L.S.D, but his omission was probably for the best, because the character wouldn't be nearly as relevant or funny today as it was in 1968.Another word of praise for the musical numbers, lyrics by Mel Brooks and music by Thomas Meehan (who also wrote Annie). The best of these are still the Springtime For Hitler segments, which were taken ? music, lyrics, choreography ? directly for the original film, and are still brilliant. But there are other showstoppers, such as "Der Guten Tag Hop Clop", "Keep It Gay" and "Opening Night". Uma being the exception, all the actors do a spectacular job on the songs, all the time making you wish you were seeing this on stage. Still, if you missed that chance, The Producers is a great watch. Not better than the 1968 film, but a very good musical film and a hilarious comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incorrigible comic, Mel Brooks, made the original film, The Producers, turned it into a Broadway musical and produced this movie musical. So you know to expect a celebration of everything ridiculous, vulgar and tasteless. You just have to laugh.Max Bialystock is a wretched producer wooing blue rinsed widows to finance his Broadway fiascos. Then his neurotic, but creative accountant, Leo Bloom, discovers an unorthodox way to make money out of a show that flops. Together they set out to produce the truly offensive, "Springtime for Hitler", hire a director whose motto is "Keep it Gay" and cast their screenwriter in the title role. A guaranteed flop.This movie musical is packed with elaborate, but not-very-catchy, song and dance routines, risqué one liners and farcical overacting. The DVD extras are similarly packed with outtakes (check out the blue rinse brigade), deleted scenes (funny Will Ferrell!) and other behind the scenes stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having first been to see the live show in London starring Reece Shearsmith as Bloom I felt a little sceptical in watching the film of the show of the film and to an extent I was right to be. Nathan Lane is brilliant and Max Bialystock and fills Zero Mostel's money grabbing, granny biting shoes very well. However Matthew Broderick lacks a certain charm and spark that Gene Wilder brought to the original film and I have to say that Reece Shearsmith acted the part a lot better in the live show. Uma Thurman puts in a fairly average performance, sure it's nice to see her dance (When she's not doubled) but you really wouldn't notice if she was replaced with another ditsy blond half way through. Her accent tends to slide as well, this is only a big deal if you really notice something like that however. Will Ferrell is perfectly cast as the Hitler loving neo-nazi, Franz Liebkind and steals every scene he's in. The songs are great, however the cutting of some songs from the original show did irritate me but this will not be a problem for those who have not seen the live show and if they do the new songs will make the experience all the better.Along with this ommitance of songs is the fact that certain things just don't translate too well from the live show to the big screen Ulla asking Bloom why he went so far stage right in the show was funny, asking him why he went so far screen right in the film didn't really have the same feel. Also the inevitable loss of spontaneity and improvisation you get in a live show may result in minor disappointment for those hoping for a blow-by-blow recreation of the show. However these factors don't serve to detract too much from the film's hilarious musical interludes. Songs such as "Keep it gay" and either of Will Ferrell's songs will stick in your head long after the credits role. That being said some of the early and later songs are a bit lacking in spirit. To be honest you can either take or leave the first and last half hours, the best bit is the middle hour and the amazing performance of the famed "Springtime for Hitler," arguably the best song in the film. The film of the show of the film is far from perfect, but it could be so much worse. Rent if you want a decent comedy, by it if you like it but I dare you not to love it on some level. All the Mel Brookes humour is present and in the end that's what makes it as good as it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved every second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of the original film so when I saw the stage show I wasn't expecting to enjoy it. However I absolutely loved it. So when I realised the stage show would be made into a film I was delighted. In the stage-show I saw my comedy idol Lee Evans as Leo bloom, so I wasn't sure how I'd take to Matthew Broderick. I thought he was super though, and as for Nathan Lane. Wow. I just missed his run as Max Bialystock in the London Stageshow, so it was great to see him in the film. Broderick and Lane were hilarious in the title roles, it's a long time since I laughed so much. I thought Uma Thurman (Ulla) was not quite as good as the Ulla I saw in London, but she did OK. And Will Farell was funnier than I thought he'd be as Franz Liebkind. Having the DVD means I can feel like I'm watching the stage-show anytime I like. The Songs are amazingly good. It's a shame that the film missed out "The King of Broadway" from the stage show, as that is my favourite song. However songs such as "Along came Bialy" "We can Do it" and "Springtome for Hitler" were superbly performed in the film. I would love to see Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane in more remakes, such as "The Odd Couple".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a farcical and satirical look at what goes on when putting a Broadway show together or any such show for that matter. The idea of making money out of a show that is designed to close on opening night needs closer examination than the events proposed in this screenplay. Parts of the dialogue are quite risqué and the lyrics for the songs are both original and very funny.The music is bright throughout and songs like "I want to be a producer" and "Make it gay" are the toe-tapping variety. The old ladies with their walking aids make a rattling good chorus, something I have never seen on film before. The sound of the imaginary adding machines in the unhappy accountants' office is also very original.The film opens on a rather quiet unfunny note with some pretty ordinary gags and some not very good singing, but brightens up immensely with the arrival of long-legged Swedish beauty Ulla who is seeking an audition in the proposed new musical "Springtime for Hitler".Opening night brings its own particular problems when the Nazi who is to play the part of Hitler actually "Breaks a leg". But in show business the show must go on, and a gay actor undertakes the leading role giving us some of the funniest antics in the whole film.The fact that the audience gives a standing ovation for a show designed on the poorest taste gives some insight into what the public really enjoys.Beneath all the silly and frivolous jokes, there is a clever and cutting revelation of what goes on in show business before that magic curtain goes up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neat reworking and rewriting of an early classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very rare for a film leader to have a second chance at his first big success. The closest I can think of is Alfred Hitchcock, making THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH in 1934 and again in 1956, and reworking the plot of THE 39 STEPS in SABOTEUR and NORTH BY NORTHWEST. But Mel Brooks's experience with THE PRODUCERS is really unique. The first appearance of the story in the 1960s led to Brooks success as a film comedian and satirist of the top class. It also won an Oscar for best original screenplay. Then, in 2001, he created a musical version of THE PRODUCERS that starred Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom. Like it's predecessor it won recognition - it swept the Tony Awards.It is more than repeating the original with a few more big numbers (though it certainly has more big numbers in it). Brooks reworked the central events of the original script. For example: the beginning. In the original Gene Wilder (as Bloom) goes to the dingy office of Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and interrupts an apparent tryst between Mostel and one of his little old ladies. Mostel basically orders him out of the office. Bloom goes around the corner and finds a mysterious man there before him. The old lady leaves, after giving Mostel a check. Mostel loses the check within a minute to the mysterious man (the landlord demanding his rent). Then Mostel confronts Bloom, and invites him into his office.Here Broderick comes to the office (which is also where Max lives), and finds Lane asleep under newspapers. He explains why he is there, and they are interrupted by a lively old lady. Broderick is pushed into the bathroom, and does emerge briefly to see the tryst. The old lady leaves, and the reviewing of the books of Bialystock is completed. THE CHARACTER OF THE LANDLORD IS TOTALLY ABOLISHED. It is a small loss.A larger one is the loss of the drug addicted hippie actor, "L.S.D." He is chosen by a desperate Mostel to play Hitler, because he is so totally against the right type. Dick Shawn played the part perfectly, and it is hard to imagine that the new musical or film could have duplicated it. But the first film was set in the late 1960s, and "L.S.D." represented the drug counter-culture of the 1960s. The musical version (and this film version) is set in 1959 - 1960: the last years of the Eisenhower Administration). It would be anachronistic to have "L.S.D." in the film at all. Instead, Brooks came up with an interesting change in character roles. First he makes Franz Liebkind (here Will Ferrell) demonstrate a musical dancing and singing ability and he is chosen to play Der Fuhrer. But he is unable to go on stage on opening night, and is replaced by director Roger DeBris (who apparently always wanted to be a singer and dancer on Broadway himself). Building up the role of DeBris for Gary Beach would also mean that DeBris' boyfriend/confidante Carmen Ghia (Roger Bart) has a bigger part in the musical and second film. Also, although Kenneth Mars performance as Liebkind was excellent, he did not show the total commitment to Nazism that Ferrell has - when we see Ferrell the first time, he is using those pet pigeons on the roof of his apartment house to keep in touch with Nazi pals in South America. And at the end, he is pushing the sale of MEIN KAMPF on the film's audience. (Unfortunately another loss in the new script is the landlady in Liebkind's building in the original film - the concierge - has been discarded.)The changes do not hurt the story of the film - though we miss the lost characters. The musical has a bit more depth because of additions to Bloom's character, and even to Bialystok's character (like the opening - the flop of his latest musical). The addition of a romance between Ulla (Uma Thurmond) and Bloom makes sense (in the original Mostel hired Ulla as his secretary/mistress as his toy).My favorite addition is the scene with Jon Lovitz as the hideous Mr. Marks (the boss of Bloom). It leads to the wonderful "I WANT TO BE A PRODUCER" number for Broderick, as he realizes he is an imprisoned drudge as an accountant. One of the pluses to the scene is the surprise shown by Lovitz when he is given Broderick's resignation, and the chorus girls (who are theoretically in Broderick's imagination) pop up and surround Lovitz.Certainly different in many ways to the original, but now a first rate musical comic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, and very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Producers" is one of my favorite films - it's clever, original and - at the time - it was also fairly controversial (keep in mind it came out at the end of the '60s). It proved Mel Brooks had comedic genius inside him (even if his later career faltered somewhat) and the musical numbers were as funny as the dialogue.The remake is dull - in more than just one way. The acting, directing and staging is all very routine, uninspired and - to be honest - lazy. Matthew Broderick may have been great as Leo Bloom on Broadway, but the stage is not the same as sitting in a movie cinema. It basically seems as if director Susan Stroman decided it would be best to not direct the film at all and instead sit back at a distance with the camera and let the audience _pretend_ to be at a Broadway showing. (Hence the movie's extended title, "The Movie Musical.") At a result, Broderick's acting seems hammy, over-the-top and even rather annoying. The scene with his security blanket is an exact replica of a scene in the original with Gene Wilder, and Broderick even imitates Wilder's facial contortions, but it seems like a bad drunken imitation rather than a convincing one. Nathan Lane is better, but still not a scene-stealer. The real stars of this are Will Ferrell (as the Nazi playwright) and Uma Thurman (as the Swedish secretary) - Ferrell's musical number, an ode to Hitler, is hilarious.The other musical sequences go on far too long. And because we're not in an audience watching this stuff appear on stage, the spectacle is gone. I went to see "Guys and Dolls" with Ewan McGregor in London last year - it was amazing because it was a live experience, with a dizzying array of lights and effects, and also very effective stage transitions. But when you see a musical on film the spectacle is lost. The director has to know how to add to it in a cinematic way - look at Baz Luhrman's "Moulin Rouge" or the original "Producers" - there was a cinematic grandness there; Luhrman and Brooks realized they were working with a different medium.Stroman - a novice director - lacks this fundamental understanding, and instead presents us with the equivalent of a PBS recording of "Joseph's Technicolor Dreamcoat" - a direct recording of a play with no cinematic appeal.I like "The Producers," I like the music, I like Broderick and Lane (on stage), I like Brooks' writing here (the opening is better than the original movie) - but the directing and editing really ruins this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh my god, this movie is awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a NYC resident, I've seen The Producers on Broadway five times, the first being with the original cast. Watching the film version of the show made me really angry. Gone was the chemistry between the actors. In the movie, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick just seemed to be reading lines. In the show, there was chemistry between them. And why did Susan Strohman decide to exclude and/or change some numbers. "The King of Old Broadway" was key intro to the show, yet it is omitted from the move. Why?!! And "that face" was completely redone minus the excellent choreography! I want to tell any IMDb readers who might be planning a trip to NYC, please, see The Producers on Broadway... see it the way it was intended to be seen.Of the three recent Broadway shows that have transferred to the "big screen" The Producers is BY FAR the worst. "Rent" wasn't wonderful but it was tolerable. Phantom, once I got over the fact that the "phantom" couldn't sing, was actually quite good. Overall, Rent gets a "6", Phantom an "8.5" and The Producers, a 2.5.Please, if anyone is planning to visit NYC, see the Producers on Broadway. It's FAR, FAR! better than the movie.Bob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amidst all the praise, a downer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited to see this both because the original is one of the best comedies ever made and because I'm a great fan of Nathan Lane ( a natural to play Max) and Matthew Broderick. I was, however, sorely disappointed within the first ten minutes and it didn't get much better. Lane IS very good as Bialy and probably the best thing in it, the other treat is Roger Bart's Carmen Ghia. The elasticity of their faces is quite something. The rest of it I found far too laboured and obvious with a terrible performance from Will Ferrell. Broderick is just plain irritating as Bloom, despite the character's nerviness he is supposed to be the everyman that we identify with who carries us through the story. He plays it just as cooky as the people he encounters and is consistently overshadowed by Lane so there seems no centre to the thing its just a jumble of crazies vying with each other. Uma Thurmann's part seems unnecessary although the love interest with Bloom was a nice addition. Roger de Bris and Carmen Ghia are well played and funny and it was a fun twist to have Roger play you-know-who. However the the gay theme was completely overplayed and not that funny. In the original it is handled much more subtly. By that I don't mean that it is underplayed I mean it is far more sophisticated. It wasn't that they didn't want to say "GAY" in 1968, they didn't need to, they certainly didn't need to hit you over the head with a sledgehammer. The relationships were evident through the acting and Roger's attraction to Bloom was virtually lost in the more recent one. Will Ferrell was pretty appalling as Liebkind. Assuredly, the character is over the top but Ferrell fell right into the trap of playing larger than life characters, which is he made him a caricature and an unfunny one at that. Its a mistake at least Nathan Lane knows not to make.I know it was taken from a Broadway show but I found the songs unnecessary, tiresome and a distraction. They aren't even memorable.This may work in front of a live audience but it's pretty disappointing as a film. Apart from Lane the whole thing lacks subtlety, the acting is often fairly poor and the adaptations largely a mistake. Go and see it on the stage or better still watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cast shines in this musical adaptation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just preface this review by saying that I love Mel Brooks, and the original 1968 movie version of The Producers is excellent. It is one of my all-time favorite movies, because it has such wonderfully ridiculous characters, and the premise is just so out-there that it's hilarious! I also love the stage version of The Producers, which I was privileged to see in NYC with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane (in previews, no less!). It is, by far, the funniest thing I've ever seen on the stage. So I had pretty high expectations for this movie. For the most part, I was not disappointed.Let's start with the one problem I had: it started off very slowly. It seemed that they were trying too hard to make the first scene (in Bialystock's office) faithful to the original movie, which was a mistake because it invited unwelcome comparisons. (Sorry, Matthew; on screen, you're no match for Gene Wilder.) Pretty much everything afterward is great, though. I was pleasantly surprised by Uma Thurman as Ulla, especially considering what a huge departure this is from her usual roles. The rest of the cast was hilarious, and they all worked well together to make this movie a great experience. (I know that some might be ready to stone me for saying this, but I actually think that Lane and Broderick have better chemistry as Max and Leo than Mostel and Wilder did.) The musical numbers were also very well done, and I think that they benefited from the more "stagy" direction that a lot of people (especially the critics!) seem to have a problem with. It's almost old-fashioned, which is more true to the kind of musical that The Producers is.So, basically, despite a slow start, The Producers is one of the funniest movie musicals I've ever seen. Though not quite a masterpiece like its 1968 predecessor, it makes for a wonderfully entertaining movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 1968 film is a screen classic. It launched Mel Brook's film career as well as Gene Wilder's. The original film included titanically funny performances by Kenneth Mars as Franz Liebkind, Andreas Voutsinas as Carmen Ghia, Christopher Hewett as Roger De Bris and the mazing Dick Shawn as LSD! The whole cast right down to the smallest part are comic perfection. Of course the most hysterical performance is by the great Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock (That characters last name coming from a town in Poland that included a well-known Jewish ghetto where bialys were first made. I know my family came from there.) This was one of Zero's greatest comic film roles. The originality of the story and the sheer comic genius of Brook's screenplay made it a tough act to follow. The stage musical was a giant hit, setting attendance and Tony award records. Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane are both worthy talents to take the movie to the stage as a musical, but I did have reservations of just how funny it could be in comparison. I never got to see the play as tickets were impossible to get; and when the film came out the critical reviews were such that I wasn't too enthused to see it. But when the DVD came out My wife and I rented it right away. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was much better than I expected. Broderick and Lane both carry the film and do the very difficult act of honoring the brilliance of Wilder and Mostel while making the parts their own. Plu they are both consummate singers and dancers and they do it so well. In this latter area, Broderick especially excels. His dance numbers are wonderful to watch. Broderick manages to dance beautifully but still in character as the shy Leo Bloom. Lane and Broderick are a terrific comic song and dance team as good as Crosby and Hope. Their comic short-hand is evident from years on stage together.Susan Strohman does a great job as director and choreographer. Her staging of the dance numbers are as good as any 1950's MGM musical and aptly pay homage to them.Roger Bart and Gary Beach also walk that tough tight-rope of using the core of what worked so well in their film predecessors roles, but taking it further and making their own unique stamps on their respective parts as the "common-law assistant" and the director.Uma Thurman does a very good job as Ulla, proving she can sing and dance and keep up with the broad antics of Broderick and Lane; no small feat.Will Ferrel brings a movie name to the film as the crazy neo-nazi playwright Franz Liebkind; but is only adequate in a classically funny role. He is a poor imitation of Kenneth Mars. Perhaps he was handicapped in comparison to the other four male leads who were all in the stage play and had much more opportunity to craft their roles. The part would have been better served by a more zany, able comic a la Michael Richards or Robin Williams.I didn't expect Mel Brook's score to be as good as it was. There are a number of very good songs that also do homage to both the movie and stage musicals of the '50's. The song "That Face" was so good it could have been written for something like, "Singin' in the Rain".The story is not as tight as the original film suspending even comic logic at the end-- and the film has about two or three endings, but seeing that, one can just sit back and relax and enjoy the sheer comedic entertainment and the wonderful song and dance numbers that hearken back to a time when film and TV included more than realism and reality shows. I'm only sorry that I listened to film critics and didn't see the film on a big screen in the theatres.The DVD has a long series of out-takes that you'll want to watch over and over and are guaranteed to keep you laughing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So most Mel Brooks fans and purists may wonder at this.I saw the 1968 version. I adored Zero Mostel, and Gene Wilder in it.And yes,this one does homage to the original. But it has its own sparkle...its own life.Brooks did an amazing job with the first---considering the strictures of film at the time. This was letting the Master loose in a whole new world. And he did a helluva job with it!Nathan Lane is a worthy heir to Mostel's mantle...evidenced by his work with "A Funny Thing..." from Broadway. And Broderick took enough cues from the Wilder performance to make it his own.Uma Thurman was clever, sexy, and wonderful. Will Farell was brilliant. And "Make It Gay" was worth the price of admission!I would suggest a battle of the Mel Brooks Movies. Rent both---pop some corn, hand out the Rasinettes, and let everyone make up their mind about which one is the Big Bialy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Producers is not like any other movie you'll see in this day in age. It's (gasp) a musical! Yes, it's a musical with full dance numbers. And it's great. It's refreshing to see something new even though, it is (sigh) another remake. It is so outrageous that can't not be written by Mel Brooks. I mean really "Springtime for Hitler"! Wow, genius. The story is about a Brodway producer Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) and his accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick). They find out that in theory one could make more money putting on a flop than a hit. So they go on a mission to find the worst play, the worst director,and the worst actors to put on the worst Brodway performance of all time. They stumble across a play called 'Springtime for Hitler' and the hilarity ensues. And the addition of Will Ferrell as the leiderhosen clad former Nazi play writer Franz Liebkind just makes it all that funnier. The acting is extremely over the top but then again it is that way in all most musicals. I highly enjoyed it though. Most of the humor is slapstick but it's pretty witty too. It also features 'Beautiful Girls Wearing Nothing But Pearls' and Uma Thurman in a scantly clad dress. That all adds to the final result which is. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brookes still makes us laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do Mel Brookes and Charles Chaplin have in common ? They both made comedy films lampooning Adolf Hitler, a subject that was hardly suited to fun and frolic. And yet both films were remarkably successful. The original film of The Producers has become something of a Classic, while Chaplin's The Great Dictator is still considered a Masterpiece. The latest The Producers is rather an extended filmed version of the Broadway Stage Show, and while it has some exceedingly funny moments (due to its wild excursion into politically dangerous country) and a clever cast, it lacks the tightness of the earlier film. One feels the need for audience applause, theatre blackouts, interval, and the cast obviously have been through the actions many times. What results is still very amusing, and Uma Thulin lends much exciting sparkle, but it is a bit long winded. The additional song and dance numbers don't add to the zest. The longer sequence with on the roof with the Siegfried Oath is good value, though one misses the manic Gene Wilder of the 60's film. However it is certainly vintage Mel Brookes, and one should make sure to see the end titles in full for a final surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original before going to the cinema to watch the remake. I have to say that I was fairly surprised at how I liked the remake. And normally I don't like musicals that much.But when it's done in a funny way like in this movie, than it's something different. If you know the original, then many scenes will come as no surprise to you. But that's not to say that the scenes are copied 1-to-one. But that wouldn't be possible, because ... the remake is a musical and the original wasn't! ;o) But that's not the only difference. In my opinion some things that didn't work in the original were improved or rewritten.Another positive aspect was the cast, especially Will Ferrell.Only thing that I didn't like that much, was the fact that there should've been 1 or 2 musical numbers less in the movie. And the ending wasn't that great, but then again the ending of the original wasn't good either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen "The Producers" on stage, and the movie does not quite explain to me why the stage musical has been such a phenomenal success. This is not to say though that I question the Tony awards it won, but simply that what works on a live stage does not necessarily work on a movie screen. The very first scene between Max and Leo is a case in point. The exaggerated body movement and idiotic dialogue can work wonders with a live audience, propelling them into wave after wave of roaring laughter. But this simply doesn't work in a movie because you don't have that spontaneous response you get in live theatre.The entire show is cliché ridden. There are some funny moments, funny, but not good enough to be described as witty. For example, who can argue with the immensely profound line "Although we are sitting down, we are giving you a standing ovation"? The musical numbers are mediocre at best. There are some saving graces, mainly in the good performances. Uma Thurman as sexpot Ulla is quite refreshing and sensibly controlled. Will Ferrell is funny as Nazi nut Franz Liebkind. The two principals Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick have done whatever they could to make something out of this forgettable adaptation of a very successful Broadway musical.</fullReview>

I saw the current one at a screening hosted by The LA Film Teachers Association. I enjoy going to them since there aren't any advertisements. Based on the conversation afterwards I'm guessing I may be one of the few there that hadn't seen the original yet.Staying for all of the credits is a good idea since so many films have little surprises in them these days.

This was a musical but i didn't think it would be so well made. i quite enjoyed the outcome of the movie as well so it is a must see. as a dancer i know good dance steps when i see them. some of the dancers where very talented. the big names however were not as professional but they sure did make up for it with their acting. i do think they a marvelous job at doing the dancing as some of the steps and moves were quite difficult and they did pull them off rather well. the singing was well done a few lip syncing problems but the majority was wonderful. this was a very entertaining movie i just don't think it appeals too much to most males due to the fact that it is a musical. its very well written quite clever and witty with characters that you can see in yourself or your friends i give this movie an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was almost disappointed... Until I watched it for the second time... and the third time. And so on. And then the music... and the lyrics... oh boy. "I Wanna Be a Producer" is brilliant. "Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop" must be the funniest idiotic piece ever composed. "Spring Time for Hitler" is, naturlich, the best. John Barrowman as a blond, blue eyed Aryan steals the opening. No, I am not gay because so does a Marlene Dietrich like beauty as the Nazi Germany eagle. The choreography is spectacular. "Watch out, Europe We're going on tour!" is the best historical summary of that period I have ever heard. What to say... see the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1968 Mel Brooks wrote &amp; directed one of the funniest films ever made. THE PRODUCERSA few years back he was the guiding genius behind the Broadway smash Musical Comedy hit , THE PRODUCERS.In 2005 it was magically transformed to the silver screen in all its glory.Mathew Broderick, Nathan Lane recreate their Broadway roles, The perfectly overact &amp; burlesque their parts in the tradition that ZERO MOSTEL &amp; Gene Wilder did in 1968.Uma Thurman &amp; Will Ferrell add much to the fun &amp; pure enjoyment. These 2 were even better than the ones in the original movie.One fine day Will Ferrell will get the Oscar he so richly deserves.The film is long 135 minutes but it moves at a brisk clip, The director (she did the Broadway play) was quite good. I laughed my head off, even tho I knew what was going to happen in every scene.The music &amp; lyrics were great, even tho there were no stand alone songs. this is prevalent in all musicals today.I cannot imagine why this film did not make money,its a fun filled show, a wee bit raunchy for children,BUT they see &amp; hear much worse in the playgrounds nowadays.Rent or buy the DVD you will not be sorry. I know I will when I see it for $ 7.95 at the film club I belong to.Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 94 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10).**** it is a rare musical that gets a **** rating from me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My brother Jimbo likes this film. It is maybe not a good idea to let the kids to see this film. Nathan Lane did a perfect Max Bialystock. I have seen this show in Tampa it was fantastic but there characters where different. In The Producers Hitler says happy fathers day. That Was great show. Will Ferriel was a little stupid in this film but he is a little funny. Gary Beach was historical as Roger DeBris. Uma Thurman was excellent in this song when you got it flaunt it. Roger Bart was also funny as Carmen Ghia. Matthew Broderick was was hilarious as Leo Bloom. Eileen Essell was very cute as Hold Me-Touch Me. You will love this movie it's so funny you will laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my cup of tea!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like the film, maybe a small part of me was comparing it to the original, I did try not to pass judgement on it as the film went on but in the end I found it very hard to watch. I don't understand how people found it funny, I didn't laugh at all and was bored with it at times.I love Mel Brooks. I find him one of the funniest people but this film did not reflect it, it wasn't the fact that it was directed by someone other than Mel Brooks, I just didn't find the actors believable in the roles. Matthew Broderick doesn't pull off Gene Wilder's nervous energy like in the original particularly when he is hysterical and he is getting water thrown over him and being slapped across the face. Nathan Lane was okay in places, I just didn't warm to his portrayal of Max. The actors who played Roger DeBris and Carmen Ghia were the worst, they were very annoying and way over the top.The only actors I thought were any good was Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman who played Franz Liebkind and Ulla. Will Ferrell was just right as the mad Nazi playwright and Uma's dancing was amazing. She also pulls off the accent without making it sound silly.I wondered what they would do with the L.S.D character. I knew it wouldn't work in this day and age because drugs are taken more seriously than they were in 1960's so I wondered how they would mock Hitler in the play, having Roger DeBris play him gay was an interesting idea but it wasn't funny. I just didn't think it worked and I was a little disappointed as that was one of my favourite scenes in the original.The only other good thing I can say about the film was that it wasn't another remake of an original film that Hollywood likes to churn out by the bucket load with the same story but played with different actors. I think in part it is because it is based on the musical on Broadway and not so much on the original film. There are new scenes added into the plot that gives it a fresher angle such as the love story introduced in the film between Leo and Ulla and other new scenes that show Leo and Ulla running off to Rio with the extra $2 million raised for the play and leaving Max to face jail on his own and then Leo returning to stand with his friend to be sentenced. Also, you see Max and Leo getting out of prison and making their play Prisoners of Love a Broadway success.The film was not for me and I found myself struggling to get to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie for a family Friday night in. It was rated 12. From the first 5 minutes we thought this was a 50's Broadway movie from my parents time. The kids aged 13 &amp; 15 checked the date and were aghast that it was not an oldie but a 2005 release. They started yawning immediately. My wife slept within the first 15 minutes. The "jokes" were lame,and based on incredibly old WW2, school locker room jokes, old people and so-yesterday gay jerks. Mel Brooks should enjoy his retirement. He should be remembered for Silent Movie. This must be the crappiest movie ever. Only Dumb and Dumber comes close. Matthew Broderick had reached the end of the line. I felt ashamed for him to stoop to Vaudeville to earn some bucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where did they go wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has the ingredients of a good movie. The acting's good, it has memorable musical numbers, and it's very funny. so where did they go wrong? The problem lies in source material. It's one thing you have one sources, but this has two: the original film and the Broadway musical. In both instances, the film seems flatly imitative. Lane's Max is a throwback to Zero Mostel and Broderick's Leo is a throwback to Gene Wilder. They want to be original, but it's hard to ignore the performances these are harking back to. Quotes and lines that made the original film so memorable are intact, suggesting imitation ala psycho than a bona-fide remake.Well, that's fine, but this also has the Broadway musical as a source. This is where everything goes wrong. Many people did not get a chance to see the critically acclaimed sold-out shows with Lane and Broderick and I believe that's where the idea of the film came in. In an attempt to give fans the chance to see the show, the film tries to replicate it. A direct transfer from stage to screen can be a hard watch. A lesson learned from Chicago should be that some stage shows require a lot of tweaking to be watchable on the screen. This is one of them.But lat's go back further. A director like Robert Wise can take musicals like West Side Story and the Sound of Music and transition them to screen by taking full advantage of the format. It's hard to ignore the wonderful use of scope, color, and cinematography that made these films so great to watch in theatres. They were able to separate the Broadway show from the film. You want to re-imagine the show to fit the medium. Unfortunately, the Producers never takes full advantage of the film format.The film is still fun to watch. Broderick and Lane have wonderful chemistry, as they should by now. There are certain scenes like the one following "Springtime for Hitler" in Leo and Max's office that would have been fun to see on the stage. Most of these actors are holdovers from the stage. Will Ferrel adjusts nicely in his role and was a wonderful casting choice. The only misguided casting may be that of Uma Thurman. She does a good job, but is just believable in the role. It may be because we know her too well now.As for replicating the stage show, I've never seen the original production, but can tell this was designed mainly for the stage. There a couple song omissions, the King of Broadway and Where did We Go Right, but at 2+ hours, it gets a little tiring, especially with the uninspired directing. It's a potentially good film that never takes full advantage of moving from stage to screen. Fun for a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really annoyed me. The original was a pretty good movie, but why did Broderick and Lane have to so desperately and blatantly plagiarize the work of Wilder and Mostel. It was kind of pathetic. They would have been much better off bringing their own style and interpretation to their roles.Apart from the consistently miserable over-acting, I found the songs to be the most lame, over-long and boring collection I have ever heard in a musical - without exception.I am quite stunned to see the number of positive reviews on this site and the relatively high rating this film got. A lot of you must be very easy to please.My advice - don't waste your money. Life is too short to put yourself through an ordeal like this.</fullReview>

I saw The Producers on Broadway without Broderick and Nathan Lane and it was phenomenal. The performance was much more fresh and spontaneous than the movie production. I believe I read somewhere that the Broadway cut aways (or scenes) was around 6-10. The film version was closer to 40. I think there needed to be a bit more minimalism involved. Having said tha, I did enjoy the scene with the accountants singing "I want to be a producer".Nothing quite like the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest movie I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Producers is the hilarious tale of a crooked Broadway producer and the "sissy", timid accountant who figures out how to make big bucks with a terrible show. The producer, Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) convinces accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick)to help him in his quest to produce the worst play with the worst director and the worst cast. They come up with "Springtime for Hitler" and from that moment the rest is hilarious history.I absolutely loved this movie! The acting is brilliant (especially Will Ferrell as the Nazi sympathizing playwright. How he did those scenes with the pigeons and not cracked up is beyond me, I was laughing like crazy during the entire film) and the music is wonderful and catchy. I was singing "Springtime for Hitler and Germany" all day! The sets are bright, especially the ones for the actual production of the play and the characters are so lovable. And the fact that even though Max was in deep trouble after his scheme backfires and is facing prison, yet Leo comes back to stick up for his friend was a nice touch.I would definitely recommend The Producers to anyone with a sense of humor. It touches sensitive issues (Nazism and homosexuality) but does it tastefully and comically. Loved Will Ferrels pigeons, they were one of the funniest characters in the show! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit when my friend told me about this movie, I was a little spectacle at first. A musical!? I don't like musicals. This movie changed my mind completely. Maybe those old Musicals that I watched bored me to death, but this one was different. It was meant to be funny, and pulled it off well. From the opening scene to the end I was laughing out loud, to quirky jokes. Many unfortunately are a tad clichéd, but it's hard not to be clichéd when everything has been done before.I love how every character has their own little quirks and random little differences from your average person. Stereotypes are exaggerated, and the Nazis all act like complete morons, adding to this movie greatly. And the music is great.However it gets a tad slow in the middle, but you can easily get through it, and you may find that the ending goes on, and that a few things in the end are a tad stupid.Simply put, go out and watch this movie, even if you don't like musicals, you may be surprised by how much the music adds to the movie overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, I didn't see the Broadway production, but the original movie is such a treasure in every single way I felt almost protective of it. Then I happened to see the stage version of "Hairspray" and loved it as much as the original movie, so I thought, well, maybe a chance. Not a laugh. Matthew Broderick has no idea what's going on. Gene Wilder's Leo you rooted for, this was never the case with Broderick. The movie seemed rushed... and dragged... at the same time. Expanding the song "Springtime for Hitler" was pointless. None of the newer songs were memorable (OK, maybe Uma Thurman's "If You Got It, Flaunt It" though I don't remember a single other line from it, so maybe it wasn't quite THAT memorable.) And somehow, through this mess, Wil Farrell continues his track record of making me fall into the "Oh, no, not HIM again... why did I like him so much on SNL?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsurprisngly good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One could not be surprised that this film is this good. The original was brilliant and the musical is (I hear) also very good and has been successful. To lift many of the actors from the musical meant that they were more than accustomed to performing their roles. I thought Nathan Lane was particularly good and a more than worthy successor to Zero Mostel's original performance. Matthew Broderick was good but I think my lack of complete conviction is partly due to the unusual character that Leo Bloom is (Broderick's "eye" acting is something to behold!). Having said that, Gene Wilder's performance was very good so maybe Broderick did fall short somewhere.Musicals generally are not one of my favourite genres but I admit being pleasantly surprised by many of the numbers (though I always knew "Springtime For Hitler" was going to delight me as much as it did - and maybe even more so than in the original version!). I also particularly enjoyed Lane's solo summisary song near the end. The physical aspect of the film (dancing and choreography) was particularly pleasing and my faithful accomplice (my girlfriend) informs me that the costumes were rather good too! She particularly enjoyed the film which itself is substantial credit to the filmmakers.Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman provide more than ample support for the two protagonists. Since Anchorman I have been a huge Ferrell fan and he manages to capture the eccentricity (not unexpected) and...well...stereotypical German soldier-ness of Liebkind. His scenes are some of many highlights. Thurman likewise provides brilliant support as the Swedish bombshell (how short is Matthew Broderick?!).It seems Mel Brooks has had substantial input not only into this, but the musical version too (am I mistaken in thinking he provided most if not all of the lyrics and a lot of the music, but with the help of a musician?). Being a Mel Brooks fan (Young Frankenstein is my favourite) this is only different in providing a musical comedy rather than a straight comedy but it's not as if one didn't see it coming what with the stage adaption. The comedy element is still most certainly there. The slew of under the breath comments by Lane are fabulously amusing, the eccentricity of Ferrell and other minor characters (Jason Antoon's hiss and subsequent musical-mouth-fanfare thing had me going for longer than it takes a kettle to boil!) are hilarious and the absolute absurdity of some scenes had me spontaneously cracking up for no reason other than the situation.Admittedly it's not all success (something Bialystock and Bloom failed to avoid). I did wonder as someone who had no previous experience with The Producers (original film or stage version) whether my girlfriend would like the film. I anticipated that its music and visual splendour would please her where the humour would fly straight past. Apart from a shaky start, (she admitted to me afterwards that the initial blanket escapade seemed not a good omen), she even found herself with a broad smile for most of the time.The only real shortfall I found was it seemed to take a long time to end and that it did so very awkwardly. Two-thirds of the way in I struggled to recall how the original had ended so was pleased to have to wait for the outcome...but it did take its time. Then again there was no real way that it could have ended satisfactorily when Lane sung and danced the summisary number. However it did smack a bit of an Adam Sandler ending (well, pre-ending).Unusually for a remake (I guess not technically an exact remake) it equalled its predecessor. It surpassed it in some areas yet failed in others. It really depends on whether you think the songs add to the experience. I think they do. Having Brooks on board, a host of actors lifted from the stage show and a dabble of excellent others to the project certainly helped too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps if I had never seen the original 'Producers', or even the stage production, then I would have enjoyed this film more. As it is, I can't help but compare it to the earlier version. The cast is almost uniformly weaker - Nathan Lane is OK but no more as Max Bialystock but lacks the demented charisma of Zero Mostel and I felt Matthew Broderick was very weak and colourless in the Gene Wilder role; Will Ferrell does his usual demented act but is nowhere near as funny as Kenneth Mars; Uma Thurman makes more impact than the original actress but then the role of Ulla has been considerably beefed up. The best character from the original film, LSD, has been excised on the grounds that hippies are dated - presumably flouncing gay stereotypes are bang up to date? The direction is rather flat and it is really just a filmed version of the stage show as opposed to a piece of cinema. Still, the central idea, and especially the genius that is 'Springtime for Hitler' can't help but shine through a little and saves 'The Producers' from being a complete write-off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why re-make cinematic perfection? Completely pointless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask me to name my favourite movie of all time, and Mel Brook's 1968 film "The Producers" will be right there at the top of my list. I spent years hunting a copy down on DVD before it was finally released a year or so back by MGM, and although I've never seen the stage musical, I was always going to be among the first in the queue to see the 2005 remake with Matthew Broderick.Broderick takes on the part of Leo Bloom, played in the 1968 film by the incomparable Gene Wilder. Nathan Lane does a passable imitation of the great Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock. Will Ferrell replaces Kenneth Mars as Franz Liebkind, author of "Springtime for Hitler", and Uma Thurman takes over Lee Meredith's role as Swedish 'secretary' Ulla.It's practically a scene-for-scene remake of the 1968 original - save for Will Ferrell's Nazi-saluting pigeons, and quite frankly, although all the cast are good enough in their roles, all the original 1968 players were far better. I don't really see the point in re-making this film. Most of it's running time is taken over by all the musical numbers that later made it to Broadway, whereas the only decent songs are those from the original in any case - the infamous "Springtime For Hitler" (all together now, 'don't be stupid, be a smartie, come and join the Nazi party..' - a pure comic highlight of bad taste!) and the final comic number "Prisoners in Love". None of the other songs really come close, despite the best intentions of all involved.I'm only giving this film a two. Maybe that's a bit mean, but quite frankly I'm of the old school who firmly believes that the originals are more often than not the best. This has it's moments, but Broderick is no Gene Wilder, and Nathan Lane will never replace Zero Mostel. Uma Thurman is good to look at, but that's hardly a recommendation to watch is it? If it were, I'd be recommending "Batman &amp; Robin" to all my friends :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Producers was an absolutely amazing movie and I just wish that the Sydney production of The Producers was still playing so that I could compare this amazing movie to an amazing production! If you were not laughing out loud the whole duration (or LOL'ng 4 thos MSN ppl ot der) then without fail you would be cringing, and it would definatlely be unusual if you left the movie without a sore jaw from laughing hysterically for 2 1/2 hours straight. Of course there were some boring parts, but they were not wasted- when the cast was not singing and dancing the narrative was focusing on character development which made the later musical sequences richer and gave us an insight into the character's motivations. Uma Therman has an amazing voice and Nathan Lane was hysterical, however unfortunately I felt that Matthew Broderick let the musical down. Although many thought that he was trying to emulate Gene Wilder from the 1968 original, it simply seemed that he could not act. If they wanted to cast someone from the Broadway production, they should have looked to some understudies or the West End or Australian production for theatrical talent. (Also Australia's Burt Newton would have been much more suited to play Franz Liebkind-- instead of the Hollywood 'funnyman' Will Ferrel (and I use funnyman VERY loosely). Casting hinderances aside, The Producers was an amazing show and anyone that still has an opportunity to see the musical will definitely do so after seeing the motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb and I am so mad at the so-called 'critics'. This was great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just been to see this today on its day of release in the UK. Now, I'm not sure about the States but here in the UK, we don't have a big tradition of movie-going on holidays like boxing day, and the multiplex wasn't that busy at all really so I was happy that the theatre showing The Producers was over half full (it was also a bitterly cold day). I'm not convinced everyone who went realised it was a musical but I didn't notice any significant walk-outs, with the exception of some baseball-hatted youths who didn't look like they had even paid to be there! Onto the movie. Great. Really.I was worried after reading the multitude of reviews and critics who didn't like the movie and who compared it to the zero mostell/gene wilder version. You really couldn't compare like-with-like here. The original was a comedy which was fantastic but does seem very dated now. The new movie is based on the old MGM movie musicals and really does take you back to those classic films when watching. I wouldn't be surprised if The Producers - Musical becomes standard Christmas TV fare in years to come in much the same was as My Fair Lady, Singing in the Rain and Sound of Music.Nathan Lane was outstanding, as was Gary Beach as the hilariously over-the-top director (and Hitler) although everyone carried out their roles perfectly (including the much talked about Uma and Will). The camera-work was good in a retro style which fitted the genre of movie and the direction followed the multiple-award-winning stage show which has to be a good thing. The omission of 'King of Broadway' was a shame, but didn't mess the film up too much. The length was about perfect. I really can't give any specific negative criticism of this movie.Where I think it may struggle is with the public whilst on its cinema run. Not helped by the overly negative critics and reviewers who have focused on a direct comparison with the earlier movie and who clearly don't like musicals. Hopefully its cinema run in the UK will be long enough to bring people in via word-of-mouth. Even if it has a short run, I am convinced this will be a BEST selling DVD title, and as I said before, could well become staple holiday prime-time TV material for many many years to come.If you don't like old-time musicals or comedy then you probably won't like this, but if you do I highly recommend you to see this fantastic movie which will have you leaving the theatre with a grin like a cheshire cat.Strongly, strongly recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Producers f***ing rocked. I am not normally a huge fan of musicals, but when the musical in question was written by Mel Brooks I can't say no. If you think about it, every Mel Brooks movie has musical-esquire scenes, my favorite probably being "The Inquisition" scene from History of the World Part I. The Producers is one of those unique movies that started out as a movie in the late 60s, then went on to be a very successful Broadway musical and has now been brought back to the big screen. One of the interesting things about the movie is that nearly the entire original cast from the Broadway show made the transition to the movie. The only two actors who were not part of the musical cast are Will Ferrel and Uma Thurman.Will Ferrel was absolute f***ing hilarity in his part as Franz Liebkind, the Nazi playwright who penned the play that the movie centers on. The real star of the show, though was Gary Beach, who played the flamboyantly gay director-cum-Hitler Roger De Bris who, with his sassy common law cohort Carmen Ghia (Roger Bart), had the audience in tears along with their merry production team.After the free show (thanks Variety and The Arclight) Susan Stroman, the director of both the movie and the Broadway show talked with a moderator (who's name escapes me at the moment) and then answered questions from the audience:Yes there are real pigeons in the movie, but the ones that dance and zig-h**l are Jim Henson created puppets (you will notice they look familiar) which were operated by 6 puppeteers and a choreographer The voices of the pigeons (they laugh) and the cat (it cries while being swung around) are Mel Brooks, who also makes a cameo after the final credits, which is worth sticking around for. All the songs from the music made it into the movie except for the first number, which was filmed, and will end up on the DVD Almost all of the dance numbers take advantage of head-to-toe shots which is really not very common when you have actors dancing. They really captured the action nicely Uma Thurman and Wil Ferrel spent 7 weeks in voice and dance training for the movie, Uma did especially well and Stroman attributed her aptitude for learning to her training for the Kill Bill movies where she learned martial arts and sword fightingIf and when you go to see this movie, make sure to pay attention to the Musical posters in Max Bialystock's office, I especially enjoyed the King Leer poster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Mel Brooks Fans, and Musical Theater Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just returned from one of the best movie going experiences ever. I attended a the movie the Producers and it more than lives up to what you would wish for. I don't think I stopped smiling once from beginning to end. And I laughed almost as much as I did when I saw this on stage.The performances were top notch, especially Nathan Lane. Wow! Was he incredible. He brought more depth and sadness to the role along with that amazing Zero Mostel comb-over which was sort of a character all it's own. One of my friends said afterward, "It was an honor to see him perform that part". This from the same person who said before the show, nobody can hold a torch to Zero Mostel's performance. We all agreed that Nathan gave the performance of his life. It felt JUST like an old fashioned musical. I felt like I was actually watching an old movie musical with Mel Brooks's politically incorrect humor inserted everywhere. The audience and I were rolling with laughter from beginning to end.Negatives: Uma Thurman's singing really didn't do the part justice. In fact it kind of was out of place in a musical. That said, she was very funny and looked sensational. This really didn't bother me too much because she really only sang in 3 songs.Matthew Broderick, who in my mind was not as strong as the other performers in the play, actually impressed me and made me laugh more in the film than he did on stage. He made me laugh a lot. However, most of my friends thought he was good and funny, but they had some problems with him. And my biggest negative is actually a positive. The songs and jokes that were cut were sorely missed by me. I can't wait for the DVD to see the cut material. Biggest positives in performances besides Nathan:Will Ferrell. As good as you have heard...and in fact, maybe better and funnier than you expect.Gary Beach. My favorite performance in the play, and he more than did the part justice in the film. That Tony he won shows in this film.And finally Roger Bart. His performance in this film ranks in my mind as one of the singular funniest movie performances ever. Every single time his face is on screen, I laughed my (bleep) off. Brilliant. So, to sum up.... if you love musicals and love Mel Brooks and love good old fashioned comedy, go see this movie! And try to see it with a big audience. It is a real communal experience. If you love the Producers the Musical...it is everything you hoped for and more!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Valentine to the old Movie Musical; Hysterical To Boot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a valentine to the old movie musical. It's old fashioned in tone with a new fashioned hilarity. Marvelously politically incorrect insulting every ethnic and sexual group to a hilarious end. I haven't heard audiences laugh out loud in a movie theatre like that in a long time.I don't believe these critics who don't see it as a filmed valentine. What is wrong with them? No, it's not realistic or reinvented for the cinema. What you got is a faithful adaptation of a Broadway Masterpiece--gloriously stagy like an old time musical! I loved it.Lane and Broderick recreate their Broadway roles with hilarious affect and aplomb. For star power there is Will Ferrel and Uma Thurmond. Will is quite good and Uma pulls it off.! On the negative side, I did miss the number King of Broadway although cutting it does move the plot along. The little Old Lady Number didn't work as well as it did on Broadway. It probably needed some reinventing for the screen. I miss the trampolines.There was some odd lighting during the "That Face" number. . And Andrea Martin is there in the chorus of Little Old Lady number with her part obviously on the cutting room floor. But these two negatives are nit-pickyIgnore the critics; go see this film. Prepare to laugh at the outrageousness and political incorrectness of it all, and the sheer fun. This is a crowd pleaser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Managed to see this early thanks to free tickets via the BBC Film 2005 programme. I went to see the stage show version twice in the west end of London, lucky the first time was with Nathan Lane, he is so talented. This new version of the film is just the same, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are fantastic in the lead roles.Uma Thurman is also up there with a great performance, if this is the first time she has danced and sung in a film lets have more, great legs! The show stealer as in the stage version is the character Franz this time played by Will Farrell. Will is very good not to mention his pigeons.Thank you Mel Brookes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Mel Brooks' Best Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think there was much that could be done to improve the original 1968 movie, but five viewings later, I'm addicted. The music, the lyrics, watching Nathan Lane play a straight guy, and Matthew Broderick's incredible performance has lifted this to the top of my Mel Brooks' favorite movie list.I've seen them all, and can quote most, but the music from the 2005 version just can't be beat. I have so many favorite scenes that I have to watch the whole movie or I'll miss them. When we went on a plane trip, I was listening to the soundtrack mouthing the lyrics and hoped no one could tell what I was doing.Everyone who knows Mel Brooks is familiar with the Springtime for Hitler song, but I can't stop laughing when it goes into "Heil to Me..." As a terrible student of German and the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, one wouldn't think this to be politically correct.However, I saw the original movie before high school, and knew that the remake had to be at least as good. I've encouraged everyone I know to see it; even my kids liked it! Of course, they liked it because of Will Farrell, but that works for me. If it gets them to see it, they'll remember it.Even my parents enjoyed it. Not only did we see it five times at the movies, but we have the soundtrack and the DVD. You can't beat this one.One thing we realized after watching another Mel Brooks' film--several of the lines from the movie can also be found in Brooks' "To Be or Not To Be."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understood that this was a remake of an old movie, but sadly for me it failed to come up to scratch. I thought the acting was wooden, the songs went on too long, instead of making a 2 minute song last well over 5 minutes, it would of been better to add more story lines, making it more interesting to watch. Maybe i was expecting too much, but thats what i always do.One sad thing with remakes is that sometimes its better to make a new version of the original and bring it up to date, rather than try and stay in the old theme and just make it boring.Very disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, If Missing the Mel Brooks Touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the stage musical adapted from Mel Brooks' classic 1968 film was terrific and if anything even more outrageous than the movie. So it's strange that this movie based on the musical should feel so tame by comparison. It doesn't have that bawdy, let's offend everyone sense of fun that Brooks projects usually have, and it all feels a little lacklustre. Still, if you like the stage version, you'll probably have fun with this movie, as it's a virtual recreation, and the music sounds great.What I appreciate most about this movie is its willingness to be an old-fashioned movie musical. Unlike "Chicago," which felt the need to justify all of its musical numbers as fantasy sequences taking place in the mind of a principal character, "The Producers" has people just breaking spontaneously into song, no apologies. If you're going to watch it, you have to accept that people are going to sing and dance and get on with it. And since most of the people in the film performed in the original Broadway cast, the songs are sung and danced well. Will Ferrell is new to the material, but he equips himself nicely as neo-Nazi Franz Liebkind and brings a lot of energy to his scenes. I would love to report that Uma Thurman stops the show as Ulla, the Swedish bombshell, but she doesn't. Uma, God love her, doesn't have the chops or the dancing skills to put over Ulla's big number, though the film makers do use her height to humorous advantage.I love the original film, but I don't worship it like some others, so I'm not as averse to playing with the material, and I didn't feel the need to compare Nathan Lane's and Matthew Broderick's performances to those of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. They don't really reinterpret the material as much as recreate it, but that's o.k. We're not talking about doing a Eugene O'Neill revival here, and Brooks's material has only so much depth to mine. This movie is a fun way to pass a couple of hours. It's never boring, and it was wringing plenty of laughs from the audience I saw it with.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't like musicals stay at home. This movie is more Broadway than Broadway and a great joy. Nathan Lane is perfect, Zero Mostell would take him out for cocktails. It is unfair to compare it to the original after all there is only one Zero Mostell but there is only one Nathan Lane. The production numbers are wonderful and if you get goosebumps from a big show tune this will give you plenty. As for Matthew Broderick he is perfect. I just loved this movie but as I said if musicals are not for you this will not convert you. Poor things. The show was very good here in Australia and its a pity our own Bert Newton did not get to star in the movie but why quibble Will is great. The show is in wonderfully poor taste and those old ladies are a joy. The PC brigade will not laugh but as a gay guy myself I found it delightful and not in any way politically offensive. The old ladies number could have gone on longer though as it was a hoot.At times it was like a stage show and it is wonderful to see great performances preserved like Lane. What a shame we never saw Ethel in Annie Get Your Gun. Do see the Producers. I give it a ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoy horrible acting, bad casting, extremely annoying songs, and flaming homosexuals, 'The Producers' is for you. I give 'The Producers' two thumbs down. The entire time, I was thinking "when will this be over?!" Mathew Broderick is extremely annoying. I think that Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick tried way too hard to be just like the original actors in the original 'Producers,' which is completely wrong because Gene Wilder is the only one who can do justice to the character Leo Bloom. Overall, this movie was revolting! The sexual innuendos and references were way too blunt. The flaming homosexuals were even worse. There were men in tight purple pants basically humping each other. It was disgusting! It was a complete waste of my time and money. Don't get me wrong, I love the original 'Producers," but they should have left well enough alone.</fullReview>

There are some great one-liners ('assuming you're a dishonest man ...assume away') and visual jokes(Nazi saluting pigeons). The 15 minutes of the auditions and the musical are really funny and well done....but why did Mel Brooks decide that the rest of the musical had to be bad too. The musical numbers in the beginning are so bad...they're still bad! The numbers at the end are cringe-worthy. Cheese is a too good description for it. The brilliance of the the musical within a musical is outweighed by the main attempt at a musical. Oh why did they mess with a successful format?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't know what to expect when I read so many mixed movie critic reviews of The Producers prior to me seeing it on opening day. The reviews ranged from bad to fairly good. Well all I can say is I thought it was a excellent, fun time at the movies and everyone else in the sold out theater seemed to feel the same. Lots of laughter and positive reaction. I saw it on stage three different times and was very happy the way it was adapted to film. I don't know what some people expect from it, but if you loved the stage play you should really enjoy the film. The only disappointment was the cutting of the number The King Of Broadway, which was one of the funniest numbers on stage. I read that it Will be on the DVD release and I am happy about that. If you haven't seen the play, don't let some of the negative reviews stop you from going to see a very fun movie going experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen virtually all of the great movie musical adaptations of Broadway plays.This is the best one that I have ever seen because they gave the audience the Broadway musical experience. The camera has a point of view and the actors don't belt to the balcony. But what Susan Stroman has done is to capture great Broadway performances without making the mistake of cross-cutting and imposing movie pyrotechnics. This was the mistake of "Forum" the great Mostel stage performance. When you see the movie you don't see the performance or Mostel. What you do see is Richard Lester. We will never see Mostel again.Nathan Lane is the modern day Burt Lahr. Film was never able to capture Burt Lahr's genius. This movie captures the spirit and flavor and performance of Nathan Lane. He sings beautifully and he dances and moves beautifully. And he has a larger than life persona and great charisma. It is a joy to see this theater performer on the screen showing what he can do. It is also an homage to Zero Mostel because his hair is cut like Mostel's crazy hairstyle. he wears his hat like Mostel and he slouches like Mostel.It also has wonderful performances from Matthew Broderick, Uma Thurman (I predict an Academy nomination), Gary Beach, Roger Bart and Will Ferell.If you love movie musicals and Broadway musicals you should love "The Producers".I disliked "Rent" and walked out on it but I intend to see "The Producers" again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I apologize for the caps, but so many people who commented negatively on this movie are such idiots! Simply not liking it is one thing (with "The Producers" you either love it or hate it) but don't be a douche bag &amp; write a review bashing the actors, calling them untalented! Any person with a half a brain can see that isn't true.Also to the people who are mad that Nathan Lane &amp; Matthew Broderick are (in your opinions) inferior to Zero Mostel &amp; Gene Wilder, therefore this is a "pointless remake"....Newsflash You Old Farts: its SUPPOSE to be different from the '68 version! It's a recording of the 2001 musical that was the highest grossing, most acclaimed musical of all time! Not everyone in this country are such philistines and homophobes that they won't tolerate a musical! So if you're an absolute purist of the '68 original, I recommend you don't see it...But respect that "The Producers" the musical is a part of history &amp; many ppl wanted to see it and were satisfied.But all hope isn't lost for you purists! If you love Mel Brooks's droll over-the-top cartooney humor...You'll love "The Producers"...B/c to me the first 30 minutes was like watching a living cartoon show (again if you don't like that sort of thing, avoid the movie) Which ISN'T to imply that the characters were one-dimensional jokes with no emotion! Nathan Lane &amp; Matthew Broderick both have beautiful singing voices &amp; you empathize for their down-&amp;-out neurotics, Max &amp; Leo.If you're a more macho Mel Brooks fan I could understand if you don't like this version... In the '68 original Leo &amp; Max weren't really "freinds" &amp; the ending is darker.But I still very much enjoyed this version...So if you are a Mel Brooks fan you should ignore the haters &amp; give "The Producers" a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I'm not a regular reviewer on this site I felt the need to go to the effort to review just this one film, to warn others from making the same mistake that I did and spending any of the hard earned money on seeing this abominable offering. The film 'the producers' (the 2005 version) was officially the most offencive thing I have ever sat down to watch in a cinema. It was unfunny to the point of being unbearable, the woman next to me laughed but being the festive season I can only excuse her on the grounds that she was drunk. The characters were loud brash and unsympathetic. I think that humour based on the fact that German people are German, gay people are gay and Mathew Broderick is irritating is surely far too unsophisticated for the average movie going audience. Slapstick humour or people falling over is occasionally funny but unfortunately not in this film. If you are considering going to see this film please don't, I suggest instead getting a photo of Mathew Broderick pasting it to a large plank and bashing your head against it repeatedly. This way you will retain the irritation at the wooden Broderick, the pain at the unbearable film and even some of the slapstick humour whilst saving yourself five pounds!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should we listen to film critics?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After much anticipation I finally got to see this movie yesterday on it's opening day. I had to make a 5 hour round trip to be able to see it and right until I and my 15 year old daughter sat down with our popcorn and coke I was wondering if it were going to be a wasted trip, especially after reading what the newspaper critics had to say about it. Well, from the start we realised that the critics were 100% wrong, it turned out to be the best cinema experience I have had in a very very long time. Why was this? Well, for a start I, my daughter and the 20 or so others in this afternoon screening didn't stop laughing the whole time and for the first time in many years I have been able to sit and watch a film without anyone else having a conversation somewhere else in the cinema, that's how enthralled we all were with it. Nathan Lane, well, what can we say. He was superb, he should walk away with the Golden Globe and while he won't win the Oscar as comic roles never do, he should at least get a nomination. I know it's sacrilege to say so, but, I prefer him to Zero Mostel as Bialystock, why? Well, Mostel's Bialy had a meanness about him, whereas Lane's Bialy is a lying, cheating no good ageing gigolo, but, he has more charm and you can understand how he manages to fleece these little old ladies. Matthew Broderick, let me tell you, is not as bad as the critics would have you believe, Leo Bloom is actually quite a difficult character to play with all his neurosis es and such like and Gene Wilder did a great job, but, so did Broderick, especially in the musical numbers. "I want to be a Producer" is fabulous, the choreography is outstanding and Broderick is awesome and best of all he looks like he's having a real fun time, his expression throughout that number is just a joy, completely genuine. I could watch it over and over again. Will Ferrel is a revelation, he is superb as Leibkind and again deserves his Golden Globe nomination, but, I think Roger Bart and Gary Beach were equally deserving of a nomination as they were brilliant too, especially Roger Bart. The only weak link was Uma Thurman, she was not terrible, but, she didn't pull off the musical numbers the way the others did. "That Face" was the only musical number I didn't ooh or ah over, but, it was still good. As for the style of the movie, well, I loved it as I am a huge fan of 1950's musicals and I almost felt I was watching it on stage, which for me, was a complete pleasure. Sure, Susan Strohman won't win any awards for her direction she did stage it beautifully and her talents truly shone in the musical numbers. Having watched the mess that was "Moulin Rouge" this was, in my personal view, entertainment at it's best, not pretentious or big and clever but an excellent transferring of Lane/Broderick/Beach and Bart's stage performances. It's not for everyone, as the newspaper's reviews proved, but, everyone left the cinema very happy yesterday and if my local flea pit deign to show it I will be first in line with my daughter, who adored it too and she's not a fan of musicals and she has already called all her friends to tell them to go see it if they can. In summary this is a movie you can enjoy that never tries to do anything but entertain you and succeeds, heck, there are far worse things you can waste ?13 and 2 hours on. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just come back from a preview of The Producers and I have to say that I haven't had that much fun in a movie since The Mask Of Zorro.I'm very familiar with the original movie as well as seeing the show when it opened in London (with Nathan Lane and Lee Evans). My friend who i took tonight didn't know a thing about it, so she was the perfect person to judge the film. And she loved it.Thefilm is a real hoot from start to finish. The musical numbers are impressively staged and all the performances are first rate. But this is Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick's film. They are dazzling. The comic timing from these two put most comedians to shame. They make you love them so much that you just don't want it to end. Lane in particular is a comic genius. His mugging to camera and slapstick pratfalls are hilarious, and his singing is perfection, giving such energy that you feel exhausted after watching him. Uma Thurman is a revelation. Boy can that girl sing, and Will Farrell once again proves he is one of the best comic performers around.It's the first musical movie I have been to when I've wanted to applaud after each number. A terrific movie and a great night out. A pure, silly, magical joy. If you are tired of fantasy movies like Harry Potter or King Kong, and you want to be entertained, then run to see this masterpiece.</fullReview>

The overacting served atop a mash of pathetic characters with a side salad of cliché is what made it really hard for me to like this movie. Broderick's character is sickeningly childish, the kind of childish whereby you can imagine him referring to his parents and mummy and daddy throughout his life. Nathan Lane's character is also disgusting for the simple reason that he sleeps with old women for money. The songs, what to say about those, if it wasn't for the high ceilings in the theatre they would have found me hanging by my belt from the plumbing when the lights came up. The one character I thought may have been a ray of hope was Ferrell, while not a "quality" actor he is normally reasonably funny. Ferrell wasn't a complete let down but this was far from his best work.In summary I can't quite fathom the rating this movie has been given by the IBDM community, you have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of the classic comedy "The Producers" is actually a great adaptation to the classic. I watched the old again and compared it to the new and I see that the production and musical twist added a whole new stage for the viewer. The hilarious lyrics and new scenes kept me intrigued from beginning to end while being on the verge of tears, at no point and time did I think, "wow this sucked",it was truly a delightful modern musical. Although the actors did not necessarily replicate the original actors, they did a fine job all in all. The movie has been harshly criticized as for some viewers have been struck to their nostalgic roots and did not agree with this remake, personally, I believe this movie deserves more credit then for what it is accounted for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but disjointed and rushed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the original, and as a lifelong lover of movie musicals, I saw this 2005 version The Producers. I didn't think it was bad, but I was disappointed. It certainly looks stylish and glamorous, and the music is great. I also thought the choreography was delightfully kitsch, and that Nathan Lane and Gary Beech were wonderful and Matthew Broderick surprisingly good. On the other hand, Uma Thurman despite looking sensational is in my opinion miscast(I just couldn't get her performances from Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction out of my mind) and Will Ferrell overdoes it. The story is rather rushed, and the script is disjointed, some of the dialogue and jokes are very funny but some fall flat. Overall, not bad but didn't do much for me. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First late me state I love musicals and have an affinity for Mel Brooks comedies as well;I cannot remember being more disappointed with either genre. Was this a faithful adaptation of the stage production and, if it is, how did it win so many Tony awards (holds the record for wins)? I knew Nathan Lane and Will Ferrell would ham it up, but it was Matthew Broderick"s "acting" that stunned me; he was horrible. Every time he said "Broadway" I cringed. Uma Thurman was by far the best performer in the movie and Gary Beach and Roger Bart were okay. The songs were unmemorable.Has Susan Stroman directed any other movies after this or did she flee to the stage?Do yourself a favor and stick to the original. What a mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would happen if you took the exact same script from "The Producers", but added forty minutes worth of musical numbers? That's a question nobody ever asked, but here's the answer anyway, and it's not pretty. The absolute low-point comes somewhere in the middle, when a bunch of uber-creepy gay stereotypes start performing a song called "Keep it Gay". Of course "gay" means "happy", but also they're homosexuals. You better like that joke, because it goes on for about ten minutes. Just one guy after the other singing "keep it gay". Meaning "happy". It's a double entendre. Dig it. The plot is also slow as hell, because any reason is good to break into yet another boring, excruciatingly witless song. They really just crammed them in wherever there was a bit of room, no transitions or basic writing skills required. The only good jokes in this movie were written in 1968, which I'm pretty sure qualifies this as a failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only for the marvelous performances of Broderick, Lane and the sensual Thurman appearance, this one is worth watching. The two main characters are wonderfully introduced in the only longer conversational scene at the beginning of the film, and since then, it is an elevating ride of music, dancing, hilarious costumes and enjoyable punch lines. There is nothing deeper here, and there certainly are no moments of revelation, but it is the perfect movie to relax by. Hilarious, no. Soothing, yes. The musical scenes are the core of this movie, and what should be especially valued is how the rest of this film was made to support the really big proportion of those. Meaning, of course, that not liking musicals is a reason for not wanting to ever see this one. If you're thinking you could try musicals for once... I'd still go for Chicago first, or some of Disney's 90's animated films, say, The Lion King.Still, another vastly underrated movie on IMDb, while the drab that is Transformers scores 7.4 - what a shame. I'd normally give The Producers a 7/10 score overall, but I'm punching eight stars here to push the rating up a dent. Really, this is in no way worse a movie for the general public than Transformers or The Two Towers are. Oh, and look out for the heiling pigeon dubbed by Mel Brooks himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lighthearted comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a musical about a waning Broadway producer and a accountant trying to make money by producing the worst play ever.I have never seen the play, so I am commenting entirely about the film. "The Producers" is a lighthearted comedy, with cheerful people, an uplifting spirit and grand sets. The songs are great, and many scenes are shot particularly well. I enjoyed the scene where the elderly women dance in the park, and Uma Thurman dance around the white couch in the office. However, I think the pacing is far too slow. When Bialystock was in prison, he sang a one minute song which summed up the whole film. That's when I thought, they could have told the tale in a lot less time! If the pace was quicker, I am sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more.</fullReview>

Humour should be funny. This isn't funny. It's just conservative and pointless. There's no reality in it or anything. As I've said, I don't know the original but I would expect a movie like this to be about Hitler and Nazism. A disgusting subject for sure but still the movie isn't even very much about this subject. Instead it has a lot of scenes in it which is about something else. I don't even know why I am writing this review. I guess I just wanted to point out my disgust. When it gets 5 out of 10 then it's because it was a LITTLE funny. I suspect that the original is better. It's like the producers of this movie really tried to make a poor movie, and they've succeeded but still it is not that bad.</fullReview>

The acting by Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick was funny but others like Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell are so much funnier! Will Ferrell is actually funnier in this movie than Talladega Nights!I know it seems like I'm over exaggerating everything but believe me, I'm not!

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, if a little over-silly...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Producers was probably one of the most hilarious films I have ever seen. Even if most of the comedy relied heavily upon the characters' abilities to just be plain idiots, at least they did it well. The whole movie felt like a play from start to finish - it could even have been filmed on stage. It was expertly choreographed and made and gave us some great musical numbers - all with dashes of humour and style. However, I do feel that the "Keep it gay..." number was a bit too long and extravagant, and the character of Leo Bloom was not very exciting. The movie just became too silly at times to bear - it started off quite funny, but after a while became hard to watch. And I don't care if Bloom managed to score with Ulla - his reunion with Bialystock in the court was dripping with homo-erotic tension. Maybe these issues are a little too taboo to discuss on IMDb, but I'm sure this has been said in another review of this film. And for good reason. There's no denying that I enjoyed The Producers - anyone who thinks it is boring and uninspired should be shot, even if they haven't seen it. The film itself is rather bad taste, so we can excuse all the Nazi propaganda and... those areas. The acting was great - not a dull performance was delivered, and the cast were truly an inspired bunch who brought this classic play to the screen with added flair. But I love realism in films, and lights suddenly appearing in prison cells and scantily-clad ladies jumping out of cupboards in the most boring accounting centre on Earth ensure that this film is really just far-fetched nonsense. But hilarious far-fetched nonsense, and far-fetched nonsense that I REALLY enjoyed. I might buy it - I don't know. I'm seeing the actual stage play soon, and having seen this film, I have a good idea of what it will be like. This film is quite a good taster for those who haven't seen the actual stage play, with the rather theatre-style cinematography, music, dances and acting. But I don't think this film did too well at the box office, for the simple reason that some things just lose a bit of their essence in the translation from stage to cinema, no matter how good you think the translation might be... 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In brief, one of the most delightful musical comedies ever made. The original was of course terrific, but this one easily surpasses it, largely on the strength of the performances turned in by Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane. Broderick touches on genius in this movie. Lane starts with genius and then leaps into some kind of interstellar supergenius. Uma Thurman, Will Ferrell, Gary Beach and Roger Bart are also all surprisingly funny in their roles as well. And the scene of Lane wooing the little old ladies is quite simply one of the all-time high points for Hollywood. Then the scene in the prison cell comes along and Lane single-handedly sets a new standard. The singing and dancing are all top-notch, and the whole thing tied together is one of the best ways to spend 90 minutes I can possibly imagine. This one climbs up to the ethereal heights of such Hollywood wonders as "Victor/Victoria" and "The Music Man" and "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." This is probably the very last really funny, witty, entertaining musical Hollywood will ever produce. If it weren't for the determination of a rapidly-aging Mel Brooks, it wouldn't have happened. I'm glad I saw Hollywood's last hurrah before it sinks forever into the depths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Producers" Rushed to Cash In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure...with all the hype surrounding the Broadway smash hit, "The Producers," Hollywood saw dollar signs. You bet--it was the most Tony Award nominated and winning production in Broadway history--nominated and winning in a time when Broadway has seen brighter neon, but, nevertheless, it was destined for celluloid.What I felt like I was watching was a Broadway production. The only problem? I wasn't sitting in a Broadway Theatre. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick were surely bringing the house down in front of a live audience, but, conveyed to film, their performances seemed over emoted and begging for instant gratification. One can only hope that the film crew was in stitches, since the veins in both of their necks were bulging for approval.I'm sorry to live in a world where Will Ferrell is a commodity. As someone who has made a post-SNL career out of stupid, slapstick caricatures over real character development, Ferrell has been able to parlay a paycheck for himself being the ass on film. In a world where farts are funny, Will Ferrell will never cease to be employed.Uma Thurmon stretched herself to the limit and dug deep inside to be able to play the pretty blonde. Note the sarcasm? In a time where Hollywood is striving to be Broadway, and Broadway is aching to be Hollywood, everyone should chill out and start creating work that can stand on its own, rather than attempting to try and cash in on the others endeavors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the Springtime for Hitler sequence - especially as a blonde John Barrowman was a gorgeous surprise! BUT....In the original the writer was driven to try to kill the producers who had made a mockery of his play and ridiculed Hitler in the process.In the remake - the writer had been chosen as the star and had rehearsed the play and only failed to take his place on the stage moments before the show because he broke his leg. So another person substitutes for him because 'he could mouth the words along with the actors' Yet the writer still gets annoyed and says the play has made a mockery of Hitler and tries to kill the Producers.This makes no sense at all as the play is exactly as he would have rehearsed it and so why would he suddenly be angry - instead of angry during rehearsals etc? The original version with the flower power space cadet actor playing Hitler was funnier and made more sense.The songs were too long and not clever, tuneful enough or interesting enough for my taste.But if you don't mind plot holes and like musicals - it is OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Springtime for Karaoke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may not be the first movie remake that practically duplicates scenes from the film that inspired it, but this approach is a particularly bad idea for a comedy. Success in comedy depends on the chemistry of the actors, something that cannot be faked. And this movie makes the colossal mistake of having the actors try to channel the chemistry of the original cast instead of developing their own chemistry. It's like a comedy karaoke machine--new people attempting the same jokes, in the same style as the original actors.Nathan Lane is made out to look and sound just like Zero Mostel, while Matthew Broderick adopts the mannerisms of Gene Wilder's meek, neurotic character from the original film. The two actors even do the entire "I'm hysterical!" sequence, down to Wilder's gibberish. I admit that I laughed a little during this scene, perhaps more from nostalgia than from anything else. But I found the rest of the film surprisingly unfunny. That's because the new film doesn't just reenact the jokes, it beats us over the head with them. The musical numbers are part of the problem. In the scene introducing the gay director, for example, the movie gives us a long parade of gay stereotypes but can't find a twist that would make the material funny. The gay troupe's song is called "Keep It Gay," which violates one of the cardinal rules of jokes about gay people, which is that you never, ever say the word "gay."There's only one really funny scene in the film, and that's the introduction of Will Ferrell as the Nazi playwright. Ferrell is pretty much doing his regular shtick rather than trying to imitate Kenneth Mars. Ordinarily that might be a put-down, but this film is so filled with impersonations that it's desperately in need of an actor being true to his own style. Uma Thurman, as a Swedish bimbo, also looks more comfortable in her role than most of the cast, though she doesn't quite steal her scenes. Still, it is worth noting that Ferrell and Thurman are the only major cast members who weren't in the play. Apparently, they weren't imprisoned by the demands of the play.It's an important point. What works on stage doesn't necessarily work on screen. And Susan Stroman is a first-time director who probably didn't know how to adapt the material properly. I never saw the Broadway show, but my aunt did, and when she described to me the sequence where a crowd of old ladies do a dance with their walkers, it sounded to me like a clever and funny idea, which it probably was--on stage. On screen, the scene is curiously lacking. The surrealism clashes with the more traditional comic material in other scenes. Similarly, the jokes which come from the original film are over-the-top here because plays by their nature are more exuberant than films.I mentioned before that Lane is made to look like Zero Mostel. Actually, he looks more like a shrimp doing a Mostel impression. I never before realized how short Lane is. He looks almost like a dwarf standing next to Broderick, who isn't especially tall. That's not to mention how he looks next to Ferrell and Thurman. He isn't the type of actor like Al Pacino or Bob Hoskins who knows how to compensate for his diminutive size with a commanding presence. And that's a problem, because he's supposed to be playing a domineering character who walks all over Broderick.Actually, the whole relationship of the two characters is different here. When Broderick first refuses to participate in the scam, he, unlike Gene Wilder in the original, offers no moral objections. His entire argument is that he's too much of a spineless coward to break the law. The problem is that we don't see this quality in Broderick's character. When he sings loudly about his cowardice and firmly says no to Lane, there's an irony that I'm not sure is intended. Broderick's version of the Leo Bloom character isn't really weak-willed at all. And he's just as lacking in a conscience as Lane's character is. As the film progresses, he's also revealed to be quite a schemer. I guess none of this is surprising. Broderick doesn't generally play nebbishes: his usual shtick is as a guy whose surface sweetness masks a certain depravity. So why did he even bother mimicking Gene Wilder? Why didn't he develop his own take on the character, more suited to his style? All he accomplishes here is diminishing the relationship between him and Lane. In the original, Mostel was supposed to have inspired Wilder, but you don't get much of that sense here. Broderick's character grows more assertive on his own, without any help from Lane.I should point out that the movie gets worse as it goes along, so everything I've said so far doesn't even begin to capture how bad the later scenes are. "Springtime for Hitler" is shockingly lame here, which makes the whole outcome not make sense. Then Lane has a solo number where the film sets up a joke based on the idea of his life flashing before his eyes. The joke falls so horrendously flat that we wind up wishing the film had stuck to copying the jokes from the original.</fullReview>

I don't know how his act plays on the stage, maybe it translates better, but on film he was uttely putrid. I mean, I spent the entire movie marveling at how bad, how fake he was. In contrast to Gene Wilder's PERFECT rendition of Leo Bloom, Broderick looks like someone in his first day of acting class. He ruined the entire movie for me. Nathan Lane is good as Max. It is a rip off of Zero Mastel, but he does a decent job of adding a little of his own personality to it, and if you are gonna do a good rip off job, might as well be Zero. I love Will Farrel so his Franz Liebkin is funny enough. Overall, it is an entertaining movie, but not as good as the original, and since most of the musical numbers are performed by non-professional singers (Farrel, Broderick, Thurman) the numbers are a little flat. It could have been much better, but it certainly isn't a bad time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great movie musicals that can sit proudly with the bulk of the output of the genre's "golden years" of the 1940's and 50's.Those who have found fault with this film, labeling it as a "photographed stage play" or too broad, were either in a bad mood when they watched it, or else they have had their senses deadened with such heavy handed recent musicals like CHICAGO and NEWSIES. Unlike those films, the gifted cast of pros on display here are hilarious and the musical numbers first rate.I do have one complaint, however, and it is a BIG one. The best musical number from both the stage show and the film is "The King of Broadway." It was shot for the film and is included as a deleted scene on the recently released DVD. It is a vital scene, introducing the audience to Max and showing us in grand fashion how he went from being Broadway's biggest success to a complete failure. It's criminal that this number was cut from the film and I hope the director will convince the studio to re-insert it back into the film. Not since "Together" was cut from the film version of GYPSY has there been such a bad piece of editing such as this.That said, it's still a great film. Just make sure you watch it on DVD in full widescreen!</fullReview>

What a waste of time and money. Broderick and Lane did the best the script called them for, but added nothing as an edge to warrant a replay. Will Ferrell was more bearable than the others of the cast but the movie was far beyond saving.All in all - if you say you liked the movie, I hope it's due to reasons of nostalgia.

		<shortDescription>Well worth a look as a funny, starry and enjoyable piece of musical nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his business basically in the toilet after yet another flop, producer Max Bialystock has taken to extorting old women for small cheques. A visit by accountant Leo Bloom and an off hand remark about insurance puts a plan in Max's mind. With Leo he plans to gather a large amount of investment to produce a play that will be a sure fire flop and claim the insurance money when it closes on the first night; the only risk being that, if it makes money, then they will be in debt to all their investors and be charged with fraud. To make totally sure of a flop they decide on the most tasteless film they can possibly find, the worst director and the most unsuitable cast and, thou, the curtain is soon raising on "Springtime for Hitler", a musical about the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany.I never managed to get off my backside and go to London to see the stage show so I was quite appreciative of this film version for saving me a trip. With the original I found it to be an enjoyable piece of ham that was mostly amusing but had some really funny moments. The running time of this version made me worry that it would be padding it out to the point where it becomes harder work and loses some of its pace. After a while though I twigged that the songs and extension of the plot were the reason for the longer running time and that it still moved forward pretty well. The problems I did have with the film were more in keeping with the genre rather than this film in particular. What I mean by this is the way that even small scenes with one or two simple jokes find themselves running on due to the need for song and dance numbers. Mostly they do fill out such scenes with material but there are one or two scenes that don't add much to the plot and don't offer much to the proceedings other than minutes.Mostly though the film combines solid laughs with Broadway musical numbers. Much like the original film I didn't find it hilarious but it was consistently amusing and produced plenty of chuckles and moments I enjoyed. The use of the original Broadway stars of Lane and Broderick was a good piece of casting in terms of keeping the spirit of the show together as it crosses into film. With the better character to work with it is no surprise that Lane enjoys himself as Bialystock and produces a great turn with plenty of ham and laughs. Broderick is given a harder task ? making a quiet character work on a stage. He mostly manages it by virtue of his chemistry with Lane but the problem he has is that his character isn't that good ? more comedy would have covered the slight nature of his performance and when this comes he is good but otherwise he is overshadowed by Lane. This being a film rather than a daily show we get lots of cameos in the supporting roles. Ferrell is nice in his role while Thurman is also good (even if I personally could have happily seen her character scaled back somewhat). Beach, McKean, Lovitz, Huddleston and others are all enjoyable as they provide solid laughs and are into the spirit of the show regards of how brief some of their screen time is.Overall then an enjoyable and lively Broadway show brought to film. It has the weaknesses that one would therefore expect it to have and those that hate musicals should of course not apply. Occasionally stretched to run longer than it should and not really ever hilarious, the film is consistently amusing and put together with a great sense of spectacle and fun. Well worth a look as a funny, starry and enjoyable piece of musical nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The Original Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie was great but this one was actually better. This is simply classic Mel Brooks at his finest. The production quality of this version is about as good as it gets. This was literally a Broadway production put on film and it was just perfect. I guess the magic was also in the remarkable casting and updated production values. I can see why they did the remake. This version should have one at least one Oscar but I guess it wouldn't happen because of the previous movie won. I guess Hollywood is not as crazy about Mel Brooks as they were in the 1970's. This is comparable to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the original Willie Wonka. The re-make was better than the original but you can't help but still love the original. Rarely can a remake be better but these are examples that it can be done..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...starts just a hair slow, but soon grabs you up by the lapels and makes you laugh. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their lead roles on Broadway, along with a host of support, while the likes of Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell lend notable pizazz. This will never be one of my Top 10 musicals, but your mileage may vary. Debut film director, Susan Stroman, does a fine job of it, along with some superb choreography. The cinematography and editing let the audience enjoy extended sequences of dance and comic timing, which surely must be a relief to theatrical purists. Lane is outstanding, and Broderick, though somewhat a mannequin at times, really impresses. I liked him much better in this than "The Music Man."I don't have much to add; the commentaries already here are more than sufficient to illustrate the old saw that "there's no business like show business," and nobody knows it better than Mel Brooks. I'll be very interested to see how the musical version of "Young Frankenstein" fares on Broadway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was way, WAY better than the other version made with Zero Mostel years ago. That one was, to me, flat, and this movie is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. I really liked it--the songs---and not too many so one gets sick of the constant singing. Just the right amount here, and I am not one who is overly fond of musicals. Uma, Nathan and Matthew were all superior. They are all great talents, and I was especially taken with the superior acting and singing done by Uma. Very good. As I said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was well acted, very funny, I liked the musical numbers and I recommend it. I really do not see why others dislike it. It is a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flop of a Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you saw the original Producers, avoid this remake at all costs. It is nothing more than Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick trying desperately to do imitations of the great Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder and that is just impossible. It is downright painful to watch their attempt, chewing furniture all the way. Oddly the remake seems more out of date than the original does.There is something greasy and almost scary about Mostel's role in the original,and I was interested in seeing whether Lane could make a a more lovable approach work. But his performance is so broad it is a cartoon, none of the sincerity of the original. And Broderick is completely unbelievable. He has none of the charm of Wilder, none of the fire or power, just a nasal attempt at mouthing the same lines.I gave this review three stars just because having a movie remake reminds you of the original Producers. But you should not make the mistake of seeing the remake. Do yourself a favor and see the original. There is no one who can deliver the lines like Gene Wilder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Producers" is quite possibly the best modern musical to date, one reason being the principle actors all do their own singing and they do it well. Also, it pays close homage to its Broadway counterpart, as it was created soon after the show opened and was brought to the screen with many of the original cast members and creative team. I love this film, and I hope it plays a part in helping the musical genre make a comeback.The cast of this movie are superb and talented. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick lead, Lane as incorrigible and hilarious as ever, and Broderick finally able to reveal his gorgeous voice (I was always upset that he didn't do his own singeing in 'The Lion King'.) Uma Thurman make a great Ulla, and I am so glad she put in the effort to sing on her own. My favorite character however, is definitely Franz Leibkind, brought to life by none other than Will Ferrell. He's the last person I ever expected to see in a musical, but one only has to look back at his SNL days to see he's more than qualified.I laugh the whole way through this film. With song titles like 'Springtime For Hitler', 'Keep it Gay', and 'When You've Got it, Flaunt it', you don't have to be a fan of musicals to find this one nothing less than hysterical. "The Producers" may have some off color humor, but it's witty and done, for the most part, in good taste. After all, it is Mel Brooks. I recommend this movie to anyone. You're sure to find something that will make you giggle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes we are all fans of the 1968 Mostel/Wilder pic and if you saw the hilarious stage show, well, it was hilarious. To see a Broadway/film version is peculiar since director Susan Strohman has not adapted it to 'being a film'. Parts look like three 50s musicals: GUYS AND DOLLS or SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BANDWAGON which is gorgeous treatment in 2006 art direction and set design. but......... playing it like it is a stage show with over mugging, pauses and some terrible sight gags (ugly chorus girl in Bloom's fantasy/office, the hissing at Roger de Bris' salon) let this film version down enormously. So self conscious is Broderick's tubby pop-eyed performance, I felt like I was seeing Kermit in a Muppet vaudeville skit. Nathan Lane certainly displayed better timing and delivery, but the fault with the oddness of the whole delivery of the performances lies with a director who was too close to the stage show and therefore did not adjust any of it for the film version. THE PRODUCERS is funny and it is great to look at, but it is not hilarious, like a 50s Warner Bros cartoon eg: ONE FROGGY DAY as the stage show was. The director's fault to me is that she knew it was funny and played it like we all knew it was funny. Well that broke the cardinal rule of comedy: play it straight: like the original 1968 version and like SINGIN IN THE RAIN. Then you have real funny; not 'aren't I funny'. And WHY didn't Broderick lose some weight? Rehearsal time was long enough. Having two tubby shysters isn't funny either. Even Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello knew that. The out takes are fascinating though, clearly showing that they cut the wrong things out and didn't trim the obvious stage moments (above) that did not work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the first row: huge success on Broadway, The Producers turns into a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968, when director and comedian Mel Brooks launched Springtime for Hitler at the movie theaters, all that he got was a minuscule group of impetuous fans - and a fiasco at the box office. In 2001, when the musical The Producers, adapted from the movie, inaugurated, it became immediately one of the most thundering success in the history of Broadway - supported, mainly, by the individual talents of Mathew Broderick and Nathan Lane. It was natural, therefore, that Brooks and director/choreography expert Susan Stroman wanted to amplify the public beyond the more restrict circuit of the theater. Then, the film The Producers (2005). Who hadn't the opportunity to watch the play when it was being staged in New York, and after, London, can now figure out why so much noise for the simple price of a movie ticket (the extremely disputed tickets for the theater could go up until 400 dollars in the hands of an outside seller). That is the spirit of the film, also directed by Stroman: transpose to the screen, with the minimum necessary of visual adaptations, that what was seen at Broadway and in the West End in London. Is a modest proposal, but honest - and if the ticket office retrieves a little bit more then the 45 million dollars investment, is probable that the idea becomes a custom.The Producers treats of how, in the 50's, the broke theater producer Max Bialystock (Lane) unites with the accountant Leo Bloom (Broderick), a wuss that is afraid of everything, in a plan apparently infallible: raise a fortune to make the worst possible play, in order to close it on the first night. This way, the money won't be retrieved to the investors (a troop of old ladies that Bialystock seduces in exchange of checks and that, in a ballet with rands-boys, responds for one of the good moments of the film). Meanwhile, the pair will pocket almost the double of the amount that is hidden in the fraudulent accounting. Bialystock and Loom believe that their wishes has been fulfilled when they run into the play Springtime for Hitler, written by the amateur - and completely idiot - Franz Liebkind (Will Farrel) to demonstrate that the dictator was one cool guy. The next step is to find an incompetent director and terrible actors: there is no way an experience like this could fail. The double, however, are surprised by the reception of their play. Because of an unexpected event, the Hitler that arrives the stage is unequivocally gay, and the public loves the idea to see the nazi portrayed as a diva. With a success on pocket, then, Bialystock and Loom will have to come up with a way to escape jail. As in the theaters, the story has a hesitating beginning. But when it hooks, The Producers becomes really fun. Much of the merit is owed to the sensational Nathan Lane, that has an infallible timing and calibrates to perfection the very difficult performance transition from theater to film (of Broderick, unfortunately, can't be said the same). In the right proportions, there is also to be distinguished Uma Thurman, that continues on her good phase in the role of Ulla, the monumental Swedish secretary of the two. Who doesn't depend on subtitles in different languages to keep track of the plot earns a bonus: the irreverent text of Brooks, riddled of politically incorrect jokes - but not offensive. Real badness he reserves to Hitler - that deserved this and a lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this hoping for some good old tasteless Mel Brooks humor. I loved Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, etc. Mel Brooks is a comedic genius...sometimes. The problem with The Producers is that it was taken directly from the stageplay without bothering to do any kind of visual adaptation. It looked like it was filmed right on the stage set most of the time, complete with the same costumes, lines, and even the same blocking. What works on stage does not necessarily work on film, and The Producers is a shining example of that. I found myself chuckling occasionally and laughing a few times, but for the most part, I was flat-out bored. From what I understand, the original film was much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Springtime for Hitler' a letdown from Broderick, Brooks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>QUICK SHOT: Right off the bat, here's the best thing to do if you must see this movie: get the DVD, so you can forward through the long-winded musical pieces with no fun bits worthy of your time. Save room for the visit to the director's house, and the actual Broadway debut of the show.____ 'The Producers' (2005) perhaps may have served people well who hadn't seen the original film of 1968, nor caught the musical (or related interviews with show bits, or the Broadway musical CD, etc.) or enjoyed any Broderick films aside from 'Inspector Gadget.' For you who fit into that category, this film may not have stunk.Why did it stink? Well, the worse things about the film were Mr. Broderick and the incredibly long-winded singing numbers throughout. Unfortunately, that was a huge portion of the movie. Had Broderick been replaced by someone who could remember they were no longer on a Broadway stage where barely an audience member could see his face, it would have been more enjoyable. As a DVD -- easy to glide past the long, tiring tunes.Mel Brooks' works aren't exactly categorized under fast-paced and funny, but a lot of them are among the best comedies I've seen, from the schlocky ('History of the World, Part I,' 'High Anxiety') and painfully hilarious ('Blazing Saddles,' 'Young Frankenstein'). Not this movie.Whatever happened to the actor Matthew Broderick? Not sure how the first 20 minutes of this film survived the dailies, or the initial review of the shoot. What happened to the professional actor of "Glory" and even "Ferris Beuller's Day Off"? He wasn't in this film, though he was singing and dancing. Just not acting. His very, very bad attempts -- assuming they were meant to be funny -- at panic attacks, squirming faces, outbursts, and fear of the token hottie in the film, were not only distracting but disappointing. He was just going through the paces. In most scenes, he was struggling merely to keep a straight face. Hmm -- maybe he should have just gone with it? C'mon Broderick -- DO BETTER! To be brief, everyone in this show was terrific and most were all-out campy (as they rightly should have been for this funny tale), and were it not for the very icky performance of Broderick, and the needlessly long musical numbers that lacked the humorous touches I expected from this, it would have been a terrific movie.But it only rates a 6 out of 10, since no one could seem to embrace the spirit of this silly tale and let the players (be the right ones, in one case, and) get the most out of the absurd plot. I wish there could have been more funny and less singing in this telling. I'm going to get the original, and see if it was that much funnier. I think it had to have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Difference Between Film and Theatre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the perfect example of why theatre productions cannot be transferred to film. It's not just that this film is up against the double-whammy of being compared to the brilliant original and the Broadway theatre version -- it's that this film makes the mistake of being nothing more than a filmed theatre production. It must be understood that acting which works on stage, if done the same way on camera, comes across as forced and false. The advantage of stage, that the audience is live and has a very real interaction with the performers on stage, is of course absent. But the advantage of film, that the production can GO ANYWHERE and the camera can flow and interact with the story, is also far too underutilized, and largely squandered. The main fault must lie with the director, who while qualified for theatre direction is not experienced at film direction, and doesn't seem to yet understand how film really works.I am, however, fascinated by one of those rare but clear exceptions to the rule: Nathan Lane. His comedic talents work just as effectively on camera as they do on stage (although he was still not as effective as he could have been if he'd been working with a film director).I cannot, unfortunately, say the same thing about Matthew Broderick. It's his performance, which was unquestionably successful on stage, which most clearly does not make the transition to film. He has extensive experience in film, but in creating the character of Bloom for the Broadway stage, he has locked in choices that are simply wrong for the camera. Again, a good film director could have helped him re-translate his character for the camera.Bottom line is, it is unfair to judge this musical production of THE PRODUCERS by watching it on film. It is obvious that if this same production (by the same director) were witnessed on stage, the results would be (and obviously were) an overwhelming success.Do I expect people to disagree with me? Hey, I've lived in the real world long enough to know something about how it works. But I stand by my opinion. And since the film, which had tremendous publicity and built in support for it's success from the theatre crowd, still failed at the box office, I know my opinion is shared by others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want to trash "The Producers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The produce isle of the musical-comedy film "The Producers" was definitely not fresh with healthy cinematic ingredients. "The Producers" is based on the infamous Mel Brooks' Broadway musical that produced itself to be one of the most lucrative ones of all time. In other words, the green dollar neon signs did shine for them "On Broadway". However, the film was a shameless romp that never truly reinvented itself scene after scene. Mathew Broderick stars as Leo Bloom, a timid accountant who is assigned to audit a once popular Broadway Producer Max Bialystock played by the always clowning Nathan Lane. Leo informs Max a passing taxing idea that a Broadway flop could turn out to be a profitable investment if certain conditions are met. Max, who has been struggling in the twilight of his career, wholeheartedly blooms Max into his world and before you can say 'I Wanna Be a Producer" both become partners and plan out the devious scheme. They read horrific scripts and find the perfect ghastly one in "Springtime for Hitler" written by escaped Nazi Frank Liebken played by Will Ferrell. Uma Thurman plays Ulla, Max &amp; Leo's Swedish pseudo-actress but definitely not pseudo sexy assistant. Gary Beach play the part of Roger De Bris, the flamboyant musical director who takes on the project and decides to give "Springtime for Hitler" a "dicktatorship" appeal. The actors of "The Producers" were worthy enough to get them future gigs by other Hollywood Producers. The only performance I thought was not up to par was Broderick as Bloom. Matthew has bloomed before in other performances in his exceptional career, but I think Mr. Bueller himself took a day or several days off from acting with his monotonous work in "The Producers". My favorite thespian performance was from Beach, who was just "beachy" keen as De Bris. Director Susan Stroman was acute with her theatrical musical scenes, but over-exhausted the audience by elongating them way too much. Where was her producer when she was doing this? Writers Mel Brooks &amp; Thomas Meehan wrote up a clever scribe, but it did not creatively deviate itself to be one of originality. "The Producers" will definitely not produce itself in my "favorite films of the year list" for the 2005 cinematic year. Do not be seducers of "The Producers". ** Needs Improvement</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of classic musical misses the mark completely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forced humour, atrocious overacting and filler material conspire to ruin what could have been an enjoyable flick.We all know the classic Producers featuring in particular the wonderfully surreal Gene Wilder. Remaking that movie required the same kind of quirkiness but with true charm and charisma, and with the production values of the modern age.What we got is a seriously cringeworthy and in places shambolic exhibition of hamming it up unnecessarily for the sake of being 'offbeat'.Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are the Producers Bialystock and Bloom; Bloom is initially an accountant for Bialystock but an off-the-cuff remark about a flop musical making more money than a success gets the attention of Bialystock, and after much persuasion he enlists Bloom's help in getting the show started and they set about seeking the very worst ingredients to guarantee the show's failure - even going as far as choosing a script which praises Hitler.This is basically the outline of the story, and along the way we have the crazy German Liebkind, played by Will Ferrell, who's the playwrite, and the glamorous Ola who's the leading lady played by Uma Thurman.Unfortunately, despite all these promising elements, the whole thing is a gigantic mess.The first hour in particular is embarrassing; I have no idea who thought it a funny idea for a gay man to emphasise the 's' in 'yes' for about a minute while Broderick and Lane mugged at each other, or who felt excessively overplayed hysterical anxiety from Broderick would be amusing, but these utterly awful gags are basically about the level of this film. The humour is utterly dire, and feels like no thought went into it other than uninspired schoolkid preparation.It amazed me when I witnessed some of the lines and visual humour - they just seem to come from the bowels of the worst comedy factory known to man.Then you had the utterly unnecessary filler - yes, it's a musical, and yes, numbers are part of the proceeds, but a number of dance sequences just bore you to tears and seem to go on for the sake of filling up time.However, these are only part of the problems of this picture. The actors don't really come away from this one with a lot of credit either.Broderick in particular seems rather miscast - he doesn't look like he's exactly thriving in such a dynamically musical and vocal role - he struggles gamely on but he's just not right for the part.And as for Lane, well he's just wasted here with a script which requires extreme overacting from him; he's more than capable of delivering but it does him no favours in this one. We know how good a comedy actor the guy is, but this is a total insult to him.Thurman puts on a hammy Swedish accent and adds a touch of glamour, but really seems like Broderick; a fish out of water.The only actor who seems more or less in place (Though forced to overact too) is Ferrell who does gamely enough with utterly exaggerated material.This movie just has no charm; it's boring, it's not funny, and the songs are weak. Add to this a lack of interesting direction and actors who look as if they'd rather be somewhere else and you have, if not an utterly dismal failure, a movie which could and should have been a lot better.It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's down there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Nathan Lane was genius. Not only making you "forget" (who can?) Zero Mostel, but bringing the role of Max to life. As another commenter said, and I agree, Nathan Lane is a force of nature. For me when he was on so was the movie, when he was off.....Matthew Broderick does not do a good job of replacing the comic genius of Gene Wilder. His song and dance numbers were completely annoying and far far FAR too long. At the beginning they give him a very long number that almost got me to turn the movie off after I paid for it. But I suffered through it and fortunately Mr. Lane showed up again, delivered some killer lines and I was sold on staying. Then all I had to do was suffer through the numbers with Matthew Broderick. Mr. Broderick is a talented actor - not a comedian. Finally, to his acting credit he was able to capture Mr. Wilder's wilder exclamations to a "T".While Will Ferrell is perfectly cast as the neo-nazi, Liebkind (originally played by Kenneth Mars), he does not hit home runs. Will Ferrell was every bit the part of Liebkind but he was not at every moment. This means the director slipped in their direction to keep Mr. Ferrell's performance top notch. I miss Mr. Mars for this reason - but not due to Ferrell, rather due to the lack of direction.Uma Thurman as the lovely innocent charming and engaging Ulla was not.Gary Beach does a very good job of bringing Roger DeBris to life. Although he was in no way similar to Christopher Hewett he did manage to carry the character and maintain the same tone throughout the movie thus giving DeBris a persona.Roger Bart, who plays Carmen Ghia (I love that name - only the shining brilliant genius of Mel Brooks can think of something like that), does it. He does justice to the brilliant character which Andreas Voutsinas originally brought to life. I enjoyed watching Mr. Bart and was sorry to see him off the screen.Finally, the director, Susan Stroman. This is a period piece, why was this "innocent charming and engaging" Ulla so conniving clever and deceptive? I later checked - this movie was directed by a woman. Once again "girl powa" destroys the creation of a potentially great remake of an already American Classic.So what made this movie a failure? Miscasting of Broderick and Stroman's lack of skill as a director. In more capable hands, this would have been a rare great remake of an already great - unforgettable - American Classic. 7/10PS: After going to the IMDb.com listings, I found that Ms. Stroman also directed "Contact" - one of the most honest movies about the scientific community and unpretentious about our first contact with intelligent alien life. I REALLY liked "Contact" for its honesty and unpretentiousness... what a shame her talent didn't carry over. But alas, this is only her 2nd movie as a director, and I can easily see her doing a brilliant job after many more movies and years of experience under her belt.-LD______________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Mel Brook's Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film tonight for the first time. Knowing that most of the cast are associated with great comedy, I knew it would be a hit. The start was a little slow, but soon into the movie, you will be laughing hysterically. Some topics may be offending, but they are handled in such a way, that they are not offensive at all. That is the genius of Mel Brooks. This movie is a must see for all Mel Brooks fans. I hope he has a few more great stories in the works. The Producer's is definitely one of his best. Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane are a great comedy team, and Will Ferrell is just comic genius. Uma Thurman was a great co-star as well. The supporting cast also are scene stealers. I highly recommend this film to all who need a good laugh.</fullReview>

There's not a dull moment in this musical. It would be better if the didn't act exactly like the play. The names Like-me-bite-me and Touch-me-feel-me are disturbing when the ladies are over 53. Its a Spectacular movie but not for kids, PG-13 {that didn't stop me}. I still don't get how you can get 2 million from a Noe Nazi play? Why did people come to the musical when it said in bold letters SPRINGTIME FOR Hitler: THE NEW NEO NAZI PLAY. Ulla's super long name, Ulla Inga Hansen Bensen Yosen Tollen Hollen Swanson Salsen{later on} Bloom. I enjoyed this movie and hope you do to,Execeped for you Willy, you been naughty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. What a surprise. The Producers is a great comedy musical based on a theater show which I haven't seen. The film is incredibly witty and hilarious. I haven't laughed that much for a long while. The script is shrewdly-written and contains numerous allusions. The gallery of well-outlined characters is a major, but certainly not sole virtue of this movie. The songs are amazing and felicitous. What's more, the cast is well headed and the acting itself is just masterly. All actors display amazing singing and dancing skills, but I will only point out two making an especially good impression on me. The first one is Nathan Lane who with all his gestures and wit is a great Max Bialystock. Although I'm sitting down right now, I'm giving him a standing ovation. The second one is amazing Gary Beach who appears to be incredibly funny as a gay Hitler at the end. I want to see more such movies from Mel Brooks and Susan Stroman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible remake of a comic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Producers film is based on the Broadway play which is based on the 1960's Mel Brook's comic masterpiece. I've always felt the original movie was in the top five funniest films ever so it's no surprise that this remake doesn't come close to the original. Although Nathan Lane is excellent as Max Bialystock, Matthew Broderick is lame by comparison to Gene Wilder's original Leo Bloom. Uma Thurman plays the Swedish sexpot. Will Farrell is the nutty Nazi playwright. Once again, he can't compare to Kenneth Mars' original character. This film does have enough new lines and songs to make it an interesting viewing. But stick with the original if you want to see real magic between Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glitzy, high octane, nonstop enjoyable romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a lot to make a successful musical, especially a movie musical. There really is a certain level of energy that is required to fully sell the idea of people singing and dancing in character, and not have it come across as ridiculous and a waste time. It takes steady, careful direction, a dedicated and talented cast ready to go above and beyond the call of duty, lavish sets and outrageous musical numbers. All of the above were shown in full glory in director Susan Stroman's glitzy adaptation of Mel Brooks' beloved musical, detailing the story of a crooked, over the hill Broadway producer (Nathan Lane) and his mousy accountant (Matthew Broderick) trying to make money off creating the biggest flop in Broadway history. The musical numbers are wonderfully staged, and surprisingly catchy, filled with enough energy, enthusiasm and joy to make the audience themselves want to stand up and sing and dance along with the characters on stage. All the actors, especially the two leads throw themselves exuberantly into the fray in front of huge dancing chorus lines, defying conventional laws of physics and reality in such a glorious fashion only a musical can truly achieve. The sets and costumes are wonderfully elaborate, setting the lavish yet carefree tone excellently. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick particularly impress as leads Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom. While the always hilarious Lane impresses as usual, it is a surprise to see normally deadpan Matthew Broderick actually able to raise laughs, and display some particularly impressive singing and dancing talent. But as in most such comedies, there is considerable joy to be found in the supporting characters as well, namely Uma Thurman giving an excellent and very funny performance as Swedish aspiring actress Ulla, never afraid to show off her "natural assets" in order to win others to her favour. Will Ferrell is also sidesplittingly hilarious as bird obsessed neo-nazi playwrite Franz Liebkind, and he also displays some rarely seen singing and dancing talent, easily carrying his own alongside the Broadway veterans, and in fact undeniably stealing the show under all other more than impressive actors' feet. Actors Gary Beach and Roger Bart also raise many a laugh as the play's very gay director/star and his... partner of sorts. It's wonderful to see a well staged and very well written musical, due to Brooks' genius and refusal to back down from parodying any subject, no matter how taboo. (though it would have been interesting to see the reaction the film's content would have gotten in the 60s when it was released...) It's also hilarious to see little in jokes as to the nature of musicals, such as Bialystock cutting off Bloom at an incredibly sentimental moment only to say "I had no idea you were such a good singer". The Producers is a wonderfully enthusiastic and inspiring wonder of a modern movie musical, just as entertaining today as the original must have been back in the 60s. If in need of a good time, or just searching for an enjoyable, contagious and energetic movie outing, The Producers is just the thing! Expect to leave the theater humming "Springtime for Hitler" still! -9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but the old one is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a BIG fan of the original I wondered if the remake would be just as good. Actually, I knew it wouldn't be as good but I wondered how different it was. I was really surprised at the differences, like how this one is a musical. The old one wasn't at all. Also the main characters didn't seem as great as Gene Wilder's or Zero (I think that was the actors name that did the fat guy, I could be very wrong) character. But in the end you've got to know that these actors were given respect to the late characters. Matthew Brodwick was not trying to imitate Gene Wilder's Leo Bloom, he was searching for a different identity and a different personality. And so was Nathan Lane. For that I respect what they did. When you pay lots of attention to it, Matthew Brodwick's Leo Bloom and Gene Wilder's Leo Bloom were very different. Gene Wilder's Leo Bloom was like a cannon that could go off at any second if you weren't careful, one minute he would be calm and the next he'd be hysterical. I think Gene's acting help with that. Also, he would listen to himself less. If Max (Nathan Lanes/Zero's character) told him to go jump off a cliff he'd probably do it. Matthew Brodwick's Leo Bloom on the other hand is much calmer and seems like a little mouse trapped in a big world. You could sense nervousness in every scene it seemed like. He also was a thinker. He'd decided for himself what was right and what was not and he didn't need help. The same goes for Nathan Lane's and Zero's Max too but I won't get into that. In the end it's which Leo Bloom you prefer. I, for one, like Gene Wilder's more. But that's just me. There were things in this movie that were cooler though and better. Like Will Farrell and how you got to see him interact with this birds more. I also liked the director and his assistance more in this one. They had more personality to me. They'll be things you might see in the movie and go, "WTF?? That wasn't in the original!" But it gets accepted easily. The ending is very, very different also. Not to mention Leo Bloom has a crush on that Sewish women and you get to see more of the two interact more. This was a good movie. Although I slept though some of it. but still, the original always beats the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie of the Musical of the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This pretty much felt like what it was: a movie based on a successful stage musical based on a successful movie. Not a whole lot original here. I can understand why it was made into a stage musical, as such an adaptation brings another dimension, but making it back into a movie again? The magician did one trick too many and blew the secret. Its not a terrible film. Were it to stand alone it might have actually been OK. But to compare it to the original exposes all the brilliant subtleties are completely lost due to insider jokes and general staleness. The (new) film seemed often to be laughing at itself, rather than making something genuinely funny and allowing you to laugh at it. Nathan Lane did a fine job as Max Bialystock, and was probably the shining part of the film. Matthew Broderick, who I usually like, seemed to be desperately trying to imitate Gene Wilder, an impossible task, rather than making the character his own. Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman played their characters so broad I found myself amused more at the idea of what they were doing than what they were actually doing. I'd say my biggest complaint of the film though, apart from its general pointlessness, was the fact that the pinnacle moment in the film, when Springtime For Hitler is finally revealed on stage to a stunned audience, it actually seems less over-the-top than most of the stuff that happens before and after it. In the original when that moment is revealed, we are grounded enough in reality and falling off our chair laughing at the absurdity-- because we actually buy it. In general The (new) Producers feels like one of those Saturday Night Live skits (and not a very good one) that goes on way too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the good fortune to see The Producers on Broadway with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick in the lead roles (7 rows from the stage no less!). That's why I didn't score it a 10 I guess, because it is impossible for the movie to live up to the live show.The movie was very true to the Broadway play and although I felt it got off to a slow start, it was excellent and I had many laugh out loud moments. Nathan Lane is an absolute tour de force - his eyebrows alone deserve an Oscar! His jail-cell solo is simply one of the best pieces of acting/singing/dancing ever - I applauded in my living room. Will Ferrell was fantastic - I had to play back "der Guten Tag Hop Clop" several times and I'm still chuckling thinking about it.My wife was skeptical, warning "it won't be as good as Broadway you know" but by and large we were not disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have long been a fan of Mel Brooks, including his 1968 The Producers. His timeless Springtime for Hitler is as hysterical (or more so) than his 1968 version. I was especially interested in how many different "homages" there were to Mel Brooks' earlier features. These would not be noticed by anyone but a die-hard fan! Matthew Broderick's "WORK, WORK, WORK, WORK, WORK, WORK", the timeless, "WHAT NICE GUYS" and many other quotes were directly lifted from Mel Brooks' other movies.He is a true comic genius and I hope he will eventually be recognized as such. His movies, always intelligent satire and often extremely intelligent comments on popular culture, have enriched my life and the lives of many of my contemporaries. I believe, for the most part, that people who do not enjoy a Mel Brooks movie are less intelligent than those of us who do.Mel, keep us laughing.

I even remember the great Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in the first movie with such warm feelings and admiration. A few weeks ago I rushed to see the latest version and never even smiled and could not raise a laugh. Every actor was bad, every movement was awful and I should have left early but i never walk out of movies. So tell me what happened to the greatness that there was before. I could not believe that it had lost so much by going on the screen but it proves the old adage that stage shows can lose a lot by going to film --in this case it lost everything.

		<fullReview>I actually wasted over 2 hours of my time watching this horrible film. Someone loaned it to my wife so we watched it the other night. It was awful. If I could give it less than 1 out of 10, I would.What made it so awful? First, the story was constantly interrupted by excessively long musical numbers that added little or nothing to the film. Now I realize that this was supposed to be a musical, but in a good musical the music tells part of the story, or at least enhances part of the story. In this case the musical numbers went on forever and added nothing to the story line. In several cases I ended up fast forwarding through many of them because they never seemed to end.The story itself could have been an interesting one but it could have been told in about 1/4 of the time this film took. The "jokes/humor" and I use those words lightly, were not very funny and lacked any connection to intelligent humor. The entire sequence of the homosexuality of the director and his entourage detracted from the movie only making it more revolting by portraying homosexuality as acceptable.In the end I expected much more from Matthew Broderick and Uma Thurman. If I were them I would be embarrassed by the fact that my name was attached this this fiasco.There were virtually no redeeming qualities to this film and it should be avoided at all costs. It was not even entertaining. Mostly it was an endless bore that occasionally touched on the revolting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better on stage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why was Susan Stroman hired to direct the movie? Choreographer I could agree with. She's not Onna White (who did the stage and movie versions of The Music Man), but it's pretty good, and it's not like there's really anyone else. But director? I can only suppose that what they wanted was a movie of the stage musical and not a movie musical. As such, it works reasonably well, but I can't help but think longingly of how absolutely amazing this could have been as a movie. My Mom saw Chicago on Broadway with the original cast and absolutely loved the movie. That is the best example I know of a musical that is truly great on both stage and screen. As The Producers stands, I think the only people who will really like it are big theatre people, particularly those who've seen it on stage.Fortunately, the good points are nearly as big as the great flaw. Nathan Lane and particularly Matthew Broderick take some time to warm up -- they don't hold a candle to Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel in the first office scene -- but once they do (a few minutes into hiring Roger), they're superb. I couldn't keep my eyes off Nathan Lane in "Betrayed". If he wins the Golden Globe and/or gets an Oscar nomination, it'll be for this scene. "'Til Him" was close second for the best done scene/song. Roger Bart and Gary Beach are fabulous and have a chemistry from the start that is sadly lacking between Broderick and Lane in the beginning.Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell are much better than I expected. Thurman actually keeps her Swedish accent better when she's singing than Cady Huffman, who won a Tony for the Broadway show. Ferrell is completely believable as Franz Liebkind, the nutty Nazi. (Frankly, I was shocked. I wasn't under the impression that he could act.)Overall, it's worth the ?6 movie ticket, but I'd feel gypped if I'd payed any more. I'm afraid this must go into the category of Good Movies That Could Have Been Great If Only X. The actors and script deserve better, but that's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stage show + camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your enjoyment of this will hinge largely on what you have seen previously. If you've seen the original movie, it pays to leave all your memory of it at the door: though many of the gags are the same, this is very much a movie of the stage show.If you haven't seen the stage show, then prepare yourself for a musical extravaganza with glitz and glamour, hilarious characters, visual spectacle and hilarious musical numbers like you haven't seen at all in recent years. If you have seen the stage show, then prepare yourself for a musical extravaganza with glitz and glamour, hilarious characters, visual spectacle and hilarious musical numbers...exactly like the one you saw on stage.The film is the stage show: larger sets, a few new stars, a few more cutaways, moving scenes and fountains that weren't possible onstage, but otherwise it's not so much the movie musical as the stage musical as movie.However, that's not necessarily a negative comment. After all, the stage musical was absolutely wonderful, so what could go wrong?Well, for a start, many things don't translate wonderfully to screen: the two leads are recreating the exact movements that they did several hundred times on Broadway, and it shows. The actors appear to have taken a stock character: theatrical, nervous, camp, sexy, German, etc and play every line and movement to that stereotype.That's not to say the acting is bad; Will Ferrell is magnificently funny, a show stealer right from when he walks into frame, and Nathan Lane carries the movie along with panache and sympathy. Poor Matthew Broderick is faced with a task that no actor, no human being, should ever have to face: filling Gene Wilder's shoes. Especially the ones he got an Oscar nomination in. And he pulls it off - his Leo Bloom is adequate and sympathetic, but he's no Gene Wilder for sure. Uma Thurman is wonderful however; she may not be the bendy chorus girl of the stage, but she manages the music and makes a wonderful Ulla, getting laughs every time she steps into frame with her vertically challenged co-stars.With so few changes from the stage show, it is unsurprising that many of the shows spectacles work beautifully, while some fall flat. Many of the gags that had people rolling in the aisles in the theatre (Ulla and Leo behind the sofa, the ugly chorus girl in 'I Wanna be a Producer') don't work at all, but the majority do, and the humour is timed to precision. Naturally, the Springtime for Hitler number is the showstopper, as is the zimmerframe dance number, though the gag of the seeing the hunky male chorus dressed as old ladies is unfortunately binned.Another thing on which the film trips up is its moments of self awareness. The stage show is very aware that it's a stage show, with characters referring to things happening in the intermission and references to stage directions, and these look messy when put on the screen. It would have been very easy for someone to realise this at some point and just given then the trim.But nagative comments aside: all in all, the movie is good. It's enjoyable, it'll keep you laughing, toes tapping, and it really is a shame that we don't get more movies that risked being like this. However, it would have been nice for someone, anyone, to have put in something original for the people who remember the stage show well.</fullReview>

The actors-especially Wil Ferrell in an inspired performance as a neo Nazi playwright-have been given free reign to do whatever they want and they make the most of it. The biggest problem with this movie is-it's a Broadway play on film. You felt like breaking into applause after the lavish song-and-dance numbers, as you would were you at the theater. Not that this is bad per se, but it just works better in live theater than it does in a movie. Nathan Lane stares into a silent camera at the end of his big number and it seems lonely. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it, but I think the director needs to know next time to translate these things a little bit better for the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better representation of a Broadway Musical than Hollywood normally gives us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Producers" manages to be the exception that proves the rule that Hollywood usually messes up Broadway musicals with poor casting decisions. This time, Mel Brooks got most of his way with Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Gary Beach and Roger Bart recreating their roles of Max Bialystock, Leo Bloom, Roger de Bris and Carmen Ghia respectively. Susan Stroman is also retained as director/choreographer. Hollywood cast two roles, Will Ferrell as playwright Franz Liebkind and Uma Thurman as Ulla. Ferrell in particular shows of his song and dance chops and Thurman's singing is acceptable while her dancing is superb. Lane and Broderick moderate their performances from their all-out on stage and it works. All the laughs are there even though two songs are fully cut and others are shortened. Movie goers are urged to sit through the final credits for a surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting - not sure about the storyline changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a well acted movie. I did not see the Broadway play but I would imagine that if you never saw the original and saw the play first, you LOVED this...But if you were like me and really LOVED the original and did not see the play, you thought it was not as good. I believe that when the Franz Lipken character was chosen to play Hitler, the storyline kind of jumped the shark. I am sure that is how it was tied in to the play, but for the movie, There was nothing the original like when they chose Dick Shawn who was in the wrong set at the wrong time to be the "Love Power" Hitler. It may have been better to pick someone completely ridiculous and unassociated with the the show to play the lead role...like Shawn. Maybe I was looking and comparing to the original..That was probably the only reason I rated this a 7...otherwise..I would have rated it higher. Overall , a very entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Producers (2005), a remake of the 1968 original as well as the 2001 Broadway musical, is a funny musical film that brings Mel Brooks back to the top of his game. This is the guy who brought us such hilariously funny films as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs (one of my favorites!), and Robin Hood: Men In Tights. Although I thought Matthew Broderick was slightly miscast, Nathan Lane and Uma Thurman were over-the-top funny (and great dancers especially Uma!). The funniest part of the film was the "gay" Hitler performance and Nathan Lane having another guy's life flashing before his eyes! A riot of a film at 8 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fun musical, but I missed the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The musical version of The Producers should be viewed in the light of being compared to most contemporary fare. Unfortunately, the comparisons to the original (non-musical) with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder is inevitable.The good: Nathan Lane was fantastic. Will Ferrell was very good as the screenwriter. The music was funny and entertaining, and Uma Thurman's dance bit was very amusing.The almost good enough: While I felt Nathan Lane did a good job stepping into Zero Mostel's shoes, I didn't quite feel that Matthew Broderick was quite up to redoing a role made famous by Gene Wilder. (Johnny Depp had the same problem earlier this year.) The early "I'm wet!" scene really made me feel this way. He didn't quite convince me that he was a terrified accountant as well as Gene Wilder had.Ultimately, though, I remembered that this is a musical, and you pretty much have to suspend some of your other demands if you want to enjoy a musical. A few years back, "Chicago" got a handful of Oscar nominations. "The Producers" is a considerably stronger musical, in my opinion. I think it's a good thing that this film featured the same actors who had had so much success on Broadway. I'm hoping that Nathan Lane gets some recognition come Oscar time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broderick and Lane great together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw The Odd Couple with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick and I enjoyed the play and watching these two actors together. I never saw the original movie or the Broadway production of The Producers so I was curious to see this movie. From the beginning, I noticed all the characters were very quirky and colorful so I kept an open mind as I watched the film. I thought the movie was very funny and entertaining. It is good to see that the musical genre is not completely dead and can still work. Some of the choreography reminded me of something out of a Gene Kelly movie. I was impressed with the supporting casts strong performances; Will Ferrell as the Hitler loving playwright, Gary Beach as the gay director and Roger Bart as his gay assistant. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the team of Lane and Broderick and who didn't get to see them in the stage version and to anyone who likes musical comedies. After seeing this movie, I wish I would have seen the Broadway production with these fine actors but I am happy that it has be made into a film that will be preserved for many to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Producing Nausea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then Broadway Theatre showcases its creative rigamortis with revivals of the great musicals from Showboat to Cabaret. Another gimmick this artistically dead arena offers every now and then is a musical version of a famous film. Sunset Boulevard comes to mind as the first and today we have Spam a Lot, a musical send down of the classic Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Both of these parasitic creations became the toast of Broadway garnering praise and Tonys. In between came the most successful of them all, The Producers. Made in 1968 by Mel Brooks with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder it was a raucous if uneven work very much in keeping with the audacious humor of the time. It was no Sunset or Grail but still very funny. Decades later Brooks turned it into a monster commercial and critical success. Now we have the movie version of the Broadway play version of the original version. From start to finish it is a merit-less waste of time.Brooks wisely avoids blame on his nearly forty year old idea by employing the shows two leads and the director, Susan Stroman to helm this archaic looking lifeless bore filled with tedious songs, dull choreography and performed by inferior leads. The role of Max Bialystock calls for someone with the diplomatic skills of a dictator single minded, forceful and persuasive. Mostel had that magic, with a mad look in his eye and an over-sized ego that would come up with the crazy idea that is the premise of the film. With Nathan Lane we have an anxious, fretting queen, void of the confident Zero bluster. Matthew Broderick as Leo Bloom is even worse. This ultra light weight actor brings these same qualities to singing and dancing, his amateur theatrics invoking memories of college play try outs. I realize Nat and Matt wowed'em on Broadway but from what I see of them in this film has me wondering if the closest seats were in the second balcony?One major change but no improvement to the cast is the addition of super fantasy babe Uma Thurman who figures prominently on all posters and advertising. This alluring gamin has the height of Tommy Tune and not a step of his talent. The Rogers-Astaire moments she and Matt have look more like a wrestling match in which Broderick may well be tossed into the orchestra pit by the gargantuan Uma. Will Farrell as Franz Liebkind manages not to embarrass himself but he too fails to be as convincing an author of "Springtime for Hitler" as Kenneth Mars was.Do yourself two favors. Watch the 68 and avoid this 05 travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PRD strikes again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, here the terrible PRD makes another stab. PRD, Pointless Remake Disease, is striking Hollywood with a vengeance these days. Why does it never hit the bad movies in an attempt to make them better? Why does it only strike at wonderful classics and fail to even remotely get up to par with them, instead getting at least a double bogey on each hole? Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder were perfect roles for the part- Zero, the sick, mean con man and Gene, the nice accountant, were so good at their roles it made me cringe to see this version. Nathan Lane is nothing in comparison to Zero. He has an obvious nice underside, a good side, which we never saw in Zero. Matthew Broderick, an actor with good talent, has been again brutally exploited by Hollywood- he's too cute in the part. Poor Matthew can't seem to escape PRD- he's been cast in this, The Music Man, Inspector Gadget (which was my favorite childhood cartoon show, and I hated the movie with a passion) and probably many others. Gene Wilder just did the part so well that Matthew could never have matched up.I also hated that Mel Brooks got rid of LSD. LSD was such an incredible character and made the "Springtime for Hitler" part classic; the use of Roger DeBris as the actor for Hitler was terrible. I didn't like the idea of making Hitler gay. The use of Adolf "Elizabeth" Hitler was also terrible.However, the part I did like better was Will Ferrell. He, in my opinion, was better than Kenneth Mars as Franz Liebkind. He was perfect for the role and was the only character who was true to the part. His only things done wrong were done by Mel Brooks, who used to be a great director and writer but screwed up on this one.So my tip for those who haven't seen this: Don't. See the original, it's far better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie breaks all bonds of absurdity and heads firmly into the category of total nonsense. Which is a good thing, considering Mel Brooks is behind it. Admittedly I've only seen a few of his movies (which were hilarious), but The Producers ousted(sp?) it by far. Young Frankenstein, classic. Spaceballs? Goofy, very funny. Blazing Saddles? Again, very very funny. But this movie made me laugh every few seconds, seriously. The stars were purposefully overacting and going completely nuts on screen, which is flat out hysterical, in my opinion. Especially when Leo Bloom loses his blue blankie and starts screaming and fainting.I went to this movie with the promise that it was funny when it was first made. Well, they were right. I saw it with a friend, and he agreed with me 100% that it was probably the funniest movie we have seen all year. And probably for some years to come, as well. Buy The Producers, it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks' original film version of "The Producers" is a classic of satire. Susan Stroman's 2005 remake is a garish, uninspired mess which does nothing but tarnish the legacy of the original. the musical numbers are, to put it charitably, forgettable, and Lane and Broderick's performances are the worst kind of stagy mugging, yet still fail to capture the manic brilliance of Mostel and Wilder in the original. The best character, Dick Shawn's LSD, is missing for no good reason. Susan Stroman's direction suggests merely pointing a camera at a stage production, and shows no knowledge of the cinematic medium whatsoever.Perhaps this played better on stage, but in the film, it's all but unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...does not transfer intact to the screen.First, let me say that I am a big fan of Mel Brooks' kind of humor and laughed out loud a lot at this movie. However, I think the slapstick should have been minimized. Exaggerated physical shtick that is needed on stage tends to overwhelm on the screen. The sound was too loud; I should have brought my earplugs.I liked the June 16 calendar page in Bialystock's office. Appreciators of James Joyce know that the date is that of the action in "Ulysses" and is still observed as Bloomsday. Others would not have noticed. And of course the name Leopold Bloom...thanks, Mel. Thanks too for the marvelous show titles on the posters in the office and at the end of the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming but dated entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen The Producers on stage but I saw the film yesterday and I'm a bit disappointed. It felt charmingly old-fashioned, but it just wasn't very funny, and I found the music and lyrics rather dated (however recently written) and obvious. I wasn't expecting Sondheim clever-cleverness but Mel Brooks is a witty chap and should have been able to do better with the lyrics.I was expecting more sophisticated humour than people repeatedly falling over/on a sofa and slightly offensive gay stereotyping. My early giggles over the posters showing the names of the shows that Bialystock had previously produced were not followed up by the guffaws I had been expecting to follow. Nothing really got me above a chuckle. Nathan Lane effectively carries the movie, mugging splendidly and clearly having a great time, bordering on scenery-chewing excess in places but generally delivering a big-screen-worthy performance. The memory of Gene Wilder's performance in the original looms over poor Matthew Broderick, who plays Bloom like a secondary character and his performance feels rather lifeless and static (his delivery of lines like "But I'm going to wear that hat some day, because I'm going to be a producer!" made me raise a pitying eyebrow), though his singing is lovely. And who cast Uma Thurman? She looks fabulous, really amazing, but she's so out-of-place it stings. And what's with the thirty-second-long lisp? And why did those bloody animatronic pigeons get so much screen time when they look so incredibly rubbish? It's a shame that I can only really remember bad points as the overall effect of the film was entertaining enough. There's a charmingly knockabout air about the whole thing, the production design is flawless and the choreography is great fun in places. It's just that the songs themselves are uninspired and sometimes simply pointless (any of Will Ferrell's numbers would be a good example, as would the one in the prison cell where Lane recaps the story). The only numbers that really stand out are Broderick's "I Want to Be a Producer" dance break and of course "Springtime for Hitler", though that was far more effective in the original film.</fullReview>

The song he sings in the original movie with his backup singer is one of the funniest parts of the 1968 movie. Having Lorenzo St. DuBois playing Hitler was an important part of the script. Not having him in there is almost like having Franz not be a German.I can't wait to see this in the Theater though.

		<shortDescription>What a boring piece of crap..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am amazed that this movie made it onto the screen. I was very excited to see it as I am a big fan of movie musicals but the numbers ( I Want to be a Producer ) were just so boring I could hardly keep my eyes open. There was nothing catchy or fun about them and the acting and gags were tired, cliché', overused-you name it. I mean, honestly, when Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are walking out the door and get jammed in together? Come ON! That kind of slapstick crap was funny about 60 yrs ago. Will Ferrell was just silly enough to entertain a 6 year old and by the time his character was on screen, I had to give up. It was just too painfully embarrassing for everyone in the film by that point. The only reason I can possibly imagine for the popularity of this film is that it is a true to life example of the film's premise and that is that if producers set out to make a complete disaster, it will make more $$ than a hit. That is most certainly the case with this snoozer...Oh yeah, the cinematography and styling were fabulous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now that's What I Call a Musical Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PRODUCERS is the film version of the Mel Brooks Broadway musical that won 11 Tony Awards, which was the musical version of the 1968 film that won Brooks his only Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (everybody got that?). The story is about a washed-up Broadway producer (Nathan Lane, recreating his Tony-winning Broadway role) and a nebbish accountant (Matthew Broderick) who conspire to produce a flop Broadway show, oversell percentages in the show and then leave the country with the money. Brooks wisely allowed director/choreographer Susan Stroman (who also directed and choreographed the Broadway show) to take the helm here because Stroman has a keen eye for musical comedy and knows exactly what a musical comedy should look like. She knows exactly what audiences expect from a movie musical and she delivers. With solid assistance from Mel Brooks' superb screenplay, music, and lyrics, Stroman has mounted this film with great care and attention to detail, expanding it nicely for the screen and makes wonderful use of NYC locations for the production. Nathan Lane's bigger than life stage presence translates to the screen beautifully here with the performance of his career as Max Bialystock. His solo number in a jail cell called "Betrayed" where he practically re-enacts everything that happens in the movie, is just brilliant. Matthew Broderick practically channels Gene Wilder in his recreation of Leo Bloom. His paranoid, pantaphobic Leo is a joy to watch, especially when he has his security blanket taken away from him. His fantasy production number "I Want to be a Producer" is a throwback to musicals of the 1930's and is a delight. There is also a brilliant production number called "Along Came Biayli" with Lane leading a chorus of little old ladies who do a tap dance with walkers that is inspired, purely Stroman's brainchild. Will Ferrell steals every scene he is in as Franz Leibkind, the author of SPRINGTIME FOR Hitler and Gary Beach and Roger Bart hilariously recreate their Broadway roles as the very gay director of the show and his lover/assistant. Their number "Make it Gay" is also hysterically funny. Uma Thurman makes a lovely Ulla (though her singing appeared to be dubbed). I couldn't help but imagine Nicole Kidman in this role, who was originally cast in the role. Her duet with Broderick "Her Face" was a lovely nod to Astaire and Rogers though. The actual production of SPRINGTIME FOR Hitler was a musical comedy classic...hilariously staged and performed, the likes of which will never be seen again. Even though Susan Stroman directed this film, Brooks' hand is definitely all over this film. There is a poster for a show in Max's office called "The Breaking Wind." At the end of Lane and Broderick's duet "Till Him", Lane walks up to Broderick and you expect him to thank him for his friendship, but instead he says "You're a really good singer." Even the shots of the audience watching SPRINGTIME FOR Hitler were hilarious. If you like stage musicals, movie musicals, or Mel Brooks, this film is an absolute must and I can't wait for it come out on DVD. I know it's going to become one of those films I can watch over and over again.</fullReview>

One thing ran common in all reviews, "This movie is a copy of the musical." Critics have to realize that not every person is rich enough to see a musical four times. People like me, who have not seen the musical, had no idea if it was a good movie. I went tonight, and it was the first time I clapped during the credits, ever.

		<fullReview>First of all let me start off saying that I loved Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in the original movie. When I saw The Producers on Broadway, the only performance that seemed molded after an original was Broderick's Bloom. Nathan Lane made Max his own in the show. Now for the movie Lane has definitely put forth extra effort to be like Mostel. They have taken everything I loved from the smash hit Broadway show and bottled it together with two new ingredients: Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman. When I heard Will Ferrell was going to be in this movie as Franz, quite frankly I was upset because I have seen him too many times and he always seems to be the same character in every movie. Was I wrong about him? Dead wrong. Will Ferrell not only owned the role of Franz but he definitely earned his nomination for golden globe. A lot of the critics kept saying that Susan Stroman's directing was amateur. I simply did not see what they were talking about. She intended for this to be as close to the Broadway show as possible and it was with some newly added jokes to keep it fresh. The audience I sat with loved the movie and even applauded at the end. Do yourself a favor and stick to your own opinions and thoughts about a movie. Don't listen to critics. For some reason I always disagree with them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Producers" pretty much is a carbon copy of the stage show, with the exception of two songs. The performances are broad to say the least. Nathan Lane is good though a little over the top for film. Matthew Broderick sleepwalks through his role giving a very uninteresting performance. Gary Beach and Roger Bart steal every scene they're in and provide a good deal of the laughs - especially Beach's "Heil Myself". The "Springtime for Hilter" production number is still a highlight. Uma Thurman is okay, if a bit old for the part, and I've been informed she uses a dance double. Will Ferrell is also pretty good and his "Heben sie gehort das Deutsche Band" is quite funny. Nathan Lane scores with "Betrayed" and "Along Came Bialy" is also fun. One of the best numbers was "Keep It Gay". The film may have been funnier if Mel Brooks directed it - he always knew how to get a real laugh. But it follows the traditions set by the MGM musical and is entertaining. Recommended.</fullReview>

Also, Will Ferrell is very very funny, as always, and Uma Thurman is great opposite Lane and Broderick.The film's musical-numbers surprisingly capture upbeat and lively personality, which very much resemble a live Broadway Show. The dance scene with Matthew Broderick's character, Bloom, and Uma Thurman's, Ulla, was one of my favorites, as it is very rare to just see an simple, and graceful dance.One of the problems with Broadway Musical adaptions is the lack of and audience and lack of...well, energy. The Producers is one of the rare movie-musical adaptions that does not. If your looking for a very fun and funny holiday film, The Producers is not one to over look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite an Improvement upon 1968's Claim...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the show on Broadway last March (though with a less-than-original and perhaps rather dry cast), I mentally decided, quite frankly, that I was "obsessed" with The Producers. I did EVERYTHING I could possibly think of to find out more about it- and I saw the '68 film, which I was quite disappointed in. I found the character of LSD to be rather entertaining, but it didn't take me long to get bored.My expectations for the 2005 revival were extremely high, and they were quite nearly met.Many professional critics, or so it seems, complained about the over-theatricality of the remake... however, having lovingly seen the stage show 4 times and so dearly hoping it WOULD be theatrical, I was quite grateful at how loyal to the original show it was.One thing I certainly wasn't looking forward to was Will Ferrell- he completely destroyed "Bewitched," and I was incredibly bored at "Elf," so I was guessing he'd ruin "The Producers." However, my expectations of him were exceeded. In fact, Ferrell was quite amusing as the role of Franz Liebkind.Of course, I've come to believe it is impossible to get through this review without mentioning Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick... who, may I say, did wonderfully. After adoring both of them in, urr, The Lion King when I was ten years old, I saw several more movies with them... and my expectations were always met.That's just another reason I was so eager for this movie to be released- it very much intrigued me to see those two in their roles. May I once again say, their performance was incredible.And, I really must say- stay for the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triumphantly Hilarious Stage Version Arrives Intact Mostly for the Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult for me to be objective about "The Producers". The original 1968 film is one of my favorite movie comedies, and I was fortunate enough to see Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick in the smash 2001 Broadway musical version directed by Susan Stroman. She handles this responsibility for the film adaptation, her first time behind the camera, and her lack of experience in the medium shows with the constancy of medium shots and the general staginess of the whole venture. However, this doesn't turn out to be as detrimental as I worried it would be. The more critical aspect of this release is that the stage version has been captured on celluloid.What Stroman does very well is capture Brooks' no-holds-barred comic spirit with this broad-based burlesque revue. She takes an already over-the-top concept and one-ups the original version in hammy schtick and sound decibels. The story is the same with minor tweaks ? a larcenous impresario reeling from his latest Broadway failure partners with a by-the-book accountant in a grand scheme to produce a costly flop to reap the write-off in closing the show on its opening night. In a grand recreation, Nathan Lane captures much of the spirit of Zero Mostel in his rimshot-driven portrayal of unscrupulous producer Max Bialystock. He only lacks the fearless desperation that Mostel brought to the role. As nebbish accountant Leo Bloom with a fondness for his blue blanket and a tendency toward uncontrollable tantrums, Matthew Broderick is a game performer but doesn't have that saucer-eyed, slow-burn mensch factor that makes Gene Wilder particularly unique.Also coming back in thoroughly exaggerated turns from the stage version are Gary Beach as flamboyant transvestite director Roger DeBris and Roger Bart as his mincing assistant Carmen Ghia with the snakishly long ssss. Working seamlessly into this ensemble are Will Ferrell, uninhibited and very much at home as always as the old-school Nazi Franz Liebkind, who composes the failed flop in question, "Springtime for Hitler", and Uma Thurman, again proving what a sharp comic actress she can be and also quite a singer-dancer as Ulla, the sexy Swedish secretary, with whom Leo falls hopelessly in love. Jon Lovitz even shows up with a comic Lionel Barrymore impression as Leo's stingy boss, Mr. Marks.The production numbers are great fun even if most of the songs are not all that memorable except, of course, for "Springtime for Hitler" performed in all its gaudy, tasteless glory. Village People look-alikes show up appropriately for the typically ridiculous "Keep It Gay" number, and Stroman wisely opens up the "Along Comes Bialy" number to a Central Park setting where a multitude of old-lady investors dance in unison with walkers. However, there are some missed opportunities along the way, at least moments I thought were classic in the stage version ? Beach's wonderfully fey Judy Garland tribute at the end of "Springtime for Hitler" is lost by having the camera too close, and Lane's showstopper, "Betrayed", seems to beg for some sped-up flashbacks to duplicate the blitzkrieg momentum of the song.But there are also wonderful surprises like Thurman's triumphant solo, "When You Got It, Flaunt It", and Ferrell's hilarious reprise during the end credits, "The Hop Clop Goes On". And please stay in your seat after the credits for the fun free-for-all performed by the entire cast, "Goodbye!". If I have one complaint, it may be self-inflicted ? since I have seen the original version so many times tirelessly, I just knew what every plot turn would be well before it happened. Regardless, this one is a treat even if it feels like the performers are playing to the back row of the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stroman faithfully brings musical to the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good musicals are few and far between and good movie adaptations are fewer and farther. Musical comedy fans should applaud Susan Stroman's faithful film adaptation of THE PRODUCERS. The big, wide-screen spectacle recalls THE MUSIC MAN in its skill for bringing musical set pieces to the screen.Stroman bucks the trend of filling leading roles with film stars who are singing and dancing (or being dubbed and doubled) for the first time in their careers. Nathan Lane finally gets the chance to show movie audiences why he has won two Tony Awards for roles originated by Zero Mostel. Gary Beach is side-splittingly funny in his dual role as Roger Debris and Adolph Hitler. Matthew Broderick, whose face is frozen in terror during his dance moves, shows the weakness of casting movie stars in Broadway musicals but he faithfully recreates his stage performance here.Of the supporting roles cast with film stars, Will Ferrell holds his own against even Lane in his scene chewing performance as Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind. Uma Thurman gets everything there is to be gotten out of the stereotypical Swedish blond bombshell Ula.For the most part, Stroman resists the temptation to "open up" the musical with actual New York settings. In an even shrewder move, she resists the urge to slavishly preserve all of the musical numbers. The nips and tucks help keep the two hour fourteen minute comedy moving right along. I suspect that The King of Broadway, which finds its way onto the soundtrack album will also make it to the DVD. Also note that audiences are amply rewarded for sitting through the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you only see one movie this year, make it The Producers. This is one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. Even though I am a big fan of Gene Wilder, this newer version is definitely superior to the 1968 version. I think that this longer movie better expands the idea that Mel Brooks wanted to portray in the original movie. Brooks's revisiting of The Producers with 23 great songs certainly showcases his genius, and shows America that he can still make one hell of a good movie. The characters in the film could not have been cast better, especially Nathan Lane as Max Bialystock (absolutely hilarious). This new adaptation of The Producers brings it from being outrageous to being completely, over-the-top, insanely outrageous. I especially liked the elaboration of Springtime for Hitler; what a fantastic number! This film has restored my hope in the future of film-making, and shows that great movie musicals can still be made. Keep it happy, keep it snappy, keep it gay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>woeful, tedious, generally abysmal, so many more problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Would you believe it? It's the worst show in town!" sing the opening chorus of Mel Brooks' film. Over a forty year period, via the theatres of Broadway and the London West End, "The Producers" has completed its comeback. Sadly, just like the opening song says, what we have here is woeful.When Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) meets Producer Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane), he comes up with a brilliant idea. Produce a flop at a discount price, and keep the profits. Now, led by shyster Bialystock and aided with a neo-Nazi play, Bloom is dragged on the scam of a lifetime. Let's not cut corners here, the 1960s version starring Zero Nostel and Gene Wilder was a classic. Funny, witty, hilarious, it is up there amongst Mel Brooks' finest moments. Clearing up at the Tony awards, Brooks' fresh new take was also magnificent. So where have we gone wrong? Well firstly, there is absolutely no magic here. While the first film survived on it's unique feel and starring partnership, the theatre production survived on the simple fact that it was a Broadway show. It sounds confusing, and for that I apologise, but let's look at an example. Towards the end of the play, we have Bialystock locked up in prison. Recapping the story so far, the actor is required to sing and dance at heart attack pace and with such vigour that one or two performers have actually referenced this scene as the reason for their retirement. Come the film therefore and the scene SHOULD be a crucial moment, but no, disappointment. Perhaps the number one reason for this is that you are no longer seeing someone perform it in person. It's like watching a magician on television. You might think about the effectiveness of the trick, and in person you will be stunned. However, on screen doubts appear about the authenticity of the event. Here we have the same problem. How do we know Lane actually does this in one go, and truthfully, why should he? There is time to repeat it, he can do it in bits. Now where is the magic in that? Next we have the obvious directional flaws. Directed by Susan Stroman, a lady who put the magic into the theatre production, the film is amateur in structure. So much of the time, it honestly looks like you are watching the stage show on the big screen. I say much of the time, but for one simple moment, I'd be tempted to suggest a constant. That moment is when Broderick and Uma Thurman are dancing together. Unfortunately, whilst he is relatively average built, Thurman is your blonde giant. So when we see the two dancing, Broderick strains the neck upwards. This in itself is fine and I have no complaints with this. When the scene cuts however the two are looking at each other straight in the eyes, you have to start wondering what idiot shot this movie. It's the most obvious blooper I have ever seen, and it just shouldn't be there.Onto the acting, and firstly the one major highlight of the film. Nathan Lane.For as long as the poor man can probably remember, Nathan Lane has played Max Bialystock. Taking over in London when the replacement dropped out, Lane played Bialystock across the world. In fact, he has played the role so often that he has it down to a fine art. Lane IS Bialystock, and for so much of the film, he is beautiful in his performance. Vivid and funny, Lane has all the best lines, and he doesn't fluff one. He also avoids the theatre attitude of the other cast members and avoids shouting every single line. Lane knows the characters subtleties, and he never once feels like he has to scream at the back row. In a film of bad performances, bad direction, and weak songs, Lane is the rare joy.Finally let's have a brief rant about the other cast members. Ignoring the disappointing Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman, let's focus our attention on the dreadful Matthew Broderick. Broderick has never been a particularly good actor, but here we see him at his worst. I confess that when I saw the stage version in the London West End, Broderick was long gone. We were given the much more flamboyant Lee Evans, and truthfully I'd imagine he would have been better here working alongside Lane ("Mousehunt" anybody?). So I don't know how Broderick performed on the stage. I'm sure since the play was such a big success, he probably nailed it perfectly, so that makes this performance even more depressing. In this film, Broderick looks awkward and often does a feeble attempt to copy Gene Wilder. I mean, we know Brooks likes things done his way, but whilst Lane is a terrifying replica of Nostel, the character of Bloom is not somebody you can recreate. Wilder did his finest performance in the original film, and when it comes to screaming, baby like acting, few can match him. Broderick tries of course, but whilst Wilder made us laugh with his yearning for his blanket, Broderick makes us want to feed the blanket down his throat. He irritates, he makes you want to scream, and truthfully after ten minutes of the guy, I almost walked out.I honestly wish that this could have been good. I adored the play in the West End when I saw it and to this day I still love the original, so yes I genuinely hoped this would be a favourite too. Boy was I disappointed. Like watching a recorded version of a live music event, here I felt that the magic had gone. The whole aura of the production has faded away. When the end credits role and the song plays with the line "There's nothing like a show on Broadway" I found myself agreeing wholeheartedly.</fullReview>

Frankly I would like to say as little as possible but IMDb insists I write ten lines so here's my thoughts. This film is truly dreadful, the humour is dated, there is no complexity to anything in this film and it managed only a small chuckle from me on one occasion, the rest of the time I sat there fixed in disbelief! If this you enjoyed the original AND you like musicals then there may be something for you here but otherwise spare your life a wasted 134 minutes! Really, Mel Brooks' time has passed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually like plays that get made into movies (I really did not like Chicago, and Rent was just OK.) And I had not heard a lot about this movie, although I did hear that the Broadway show was great. When I got to the theatre, nothing else was starting at the right time. I figured hmmm, why not. So I went into this movie not knowing what to expect.I have not laughed so hard in a movie theatre in a long, long time.Will Farrell is great, and Nathan Lane is amazing.People complaining about this movie are either brain-dead or upset that it's not exactly the same as the play or the 1960's version. If you have never seen the play or the original version, and you want to laugh your ass off, then go. There were times when I wanted to clap after each scene, and the whole audience applauded at the end. It's that funny.Interestingly, some people snuck in towards the end of the movie, since Syriana was playing next, and they were laughing as hard as anyone else. I think a lot of people find most plays to be uptight or boring or high-brow, and this is just plain fun.Thank you, Mel Brooks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film critics were 100% accurate, I found this film to be so tedious, I nearly walked out half way through. What was hilarious on stage, at an audience's distance, becomes mugging and over-acting when shown in film close-ups. Having seen the original Broadway cast with both stars, I had high expectations of the film version, and it didn't deliver. The original film version was reworked for the stage musical and the limitations of a stage. The thought of what was possible when re-transposed to film had me very curious.At first I thought the director had decided to film the stage play "as is" using the original sets, as the opening of the film suggests. The Broadway street scene is obviously a set and in Biallystock's office at no time do we turn around and see the fourth wall, everything is filmed front on, like a stage. However, later in the film, the camera goes outside into the real streets of Manhattan for one scene only. The sudden change to real life made the rest of the film seem boxed in. Keeping the original costumes made the outdoor scene surreal. On stage it may be OK to have every old lady wearing the same costume, the same wig, but in the street it looked like the cast of a Broadway show doing an outdoor performance. Obviously not old ladies at all.Zero Mostel molesting very old women was rude and funny, Nathan Lane molesting Debra Monk, pretending to be an old lady, is not funny. Monk is only 7 years older than Lane.Uma Thurman was adequate, not voluptuous enough and can't sing. Will Ferrel is also adequate.The rest of the cast were as brilliant as this unimaginative filming allowed.It is interesting to read that some people thought this was a work of genius and some have said "as good as Chicago". I found Chicago to be the worst adaptation of a stage musical in film history. So maybe if you have no idea who Bob Fosse was and found Rob Marshall's attempt at choreography entertaining, rarely visit the theatre and are easily amused, you might find the same razzle dazzle here.This work deserved better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with my daughter the week between Christmas and New year's eve. It was the low point of the week. The actors universally overacted, far beyond the point of entertaining or even amusing, and even beyond the point of pain inducing. If Matthew Broderick ever gets another movie role, the casting director of that movie should be shot.Possibly my view of this movie is colored by the fact that I saw the original version that actually had good actors and good acting. Nathan Lane, though valiant in his attempt to "be" Bialystock simply is no Zero Mostel, and Matthew Broderick is no Gene Wilder. Even Will Ferrell failed to live up to the standard set by Kenneth Mars (who?). And where the heck was the Dick Shawn character from the original?Just about the only relief from the pain of watching this travesty was provided by Roger Bart and Gary Beach. While Uma Thurman provided some sorely needed eye-candy, she would have been a lot better at that if they had taken off a little more of the wrapper. Even the audio-animatronic birds were bad.Avoid this movie. Even my daughter, who loved the musical on Broadway agreed. Save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much fun! I love movie musicals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review as I posted it on Broadwayworld.com: I TOTALLY understand why all these critics are bashing this movie. I will bet you, to the man (or woman) they are people who hate musicals to begin with or, for whatever reason, hate this show to begin with and went in expecting to hate it. What's on the screen IS the musical currently being seen on Broadway, with a few cuts that in the end didn't really harm the movie (I missed King of Broadway for about ten seconds - though I can't wait to see the footage on the DVD, and I missed "The Intermission" joke in "Betrayed" - but it's made up for by a slight alteration of another meta-joke a few moments earlier.) The other criticism of this movie - it means nothing, it's fluff, etc. etc. Well, yes, it is. It's not a serious piece of theater or film and doesn't make any pretensions to being more than that. What the play and the film do is transport the audience to a time when musicals were FUN. It's a light, fluffy entertainment where you can go for two hours and laugh. In this time of "serious" movies (this trend of films like Syriana, Munich, Memoirs... etc.) and serious movie musicals (what was the last successful COMEDY?), there's absolutely nothing wrong with a movie where its sole purpose is to ENTERTAIN! What Susan Stroman has managed to do is to ACTUALLY make a movie of a Broadway musical that really gives the feel of what that experience is like. If you hate the show, or hate musicals, you have no hope here. This movie is 100% theatrical - I feel like I just got back from the "theater" - not the cineplex, but the theater we all love.Are Lane and Broderick completely over the top? Hell yes, and thank God, because that's what made the show so funny in the first place. Faults with the show itself aside (I agree with those who say some of the music isn't exactly the best the Great White Way has ever offered), this movie is VERY funny and entertaining as anything I've seen in the movies this year. The actors are all spot-on in their performances - I could go into individual performances, but there's no point. They're all great - and Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell (who I usually can't stand) are great fill-ins for their Broadway counterpoints (though I felt very bad for poor Brad Oscar, reduced to a two second cameo!). And that's another great thing for this community -- catching all the Broadway cameos filtered throughout the movie! I had so much fun identifying them - and I don't want to spoil the surprise of who's in here. (Though I have to ask - does anyone know if that was Victoria Clark in the Opening Night sequence - I thought I saw her at the VERY end of it, but it was so fast, and I forgot to check in the credits...).Anyway, I think this movie is an absolute success. Those criticizing it for being "too theatrical," - I don't think there was any point to NOT making this movie theatrical! We already HAVE a movie of The Producers. What this film does is capture forever the stage show - and yes, at times it literally looks like a stage. But so what??? (And thank you, Ms. Stroman, for filming dance sequences full body rather than "Chorus-Line-from-the-waist-up").The crowd at the 3/4 full theater I was in (Christmas afternoon), laughed almost continuously through the film. There were even a couple of points where I could FEEL the audience holding back from applauding after a couple of the songs (someone got in two claps after "Betrayed" before realizing what they were doing). The theater ERUPTED in applause afterwards - probably more than I've ever seen a crowd do in a movie theater.We've seen shows turned into movies countless times, we've seen recordings of stage shows -- this is the first true blending of those two forms. This is a love-letter to Broadway, a wink at the fans of Broadway, and hopefully a sneak-attack on those who would NEVER go see a musical live in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular! Nathan Lane must be nominated and Mel Brooks as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.Having seen the original producers and the Broadway show this movie is simply spectacular. Mel Brooks is a genius and we wish him 20 more years and send condolences to him on the loss of Annie. Mel Brooks is to the movies what Richard Pryor was to comedy on stage. He crosses the line and does it so fabulously. The entire cast is superb from Nathan Lane who deserves an Oscar nomination to the entire movie. All of the cast are great Matthew Broderick, Will Farrell is a scream and the supporting cast could not be better. The singing the dancing the acting the comedy absolutely perfect. Congratulations to Mel Brooks and his entire company. Susan did a great job in transferring this from the stage to the Movie. WOw WOW WOW</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll never love the Broadway version of The Producers as much as I love the 1968 movie -- and this 2005 edition is basically an on-screen version of the play -- but it's still Mel Brooks, and it's better than 99% of the other schlock on movie screens today. Plus, it's an opportunity for those who never got a chance to see Lane &amp; Broderick as Bialystock &amp; Bloom. I've seen two other stage productions, one in NY and one traveling show; seeing Lane &amp; Broderick is a big improvement. They left out a couple of great songs from the play, but otherwise it's pretty much Broadway on the silver screen. So go out and have fun -- and by all means, stay UNTIL THE END. There are some fun bits after the credits, and you won't be disappointed. I was one of about 15 people who stayed out of about 350 people in the preview showing I attended; those who left early missed out on some good stuff. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Success-Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who have any level of sophistication and enjoy some wacky humor, go and seen this show. There were people in their 20's all the way to their 70's in the audience and every age group laughed and left the theater smiling (one work of advice, don't leave until Mel Brooks appears after the credits, no more hints). Everyone in the show I attended was gone by that time, plus there's a nice new number "There's Nothing like a Broadway Show" over the end credits and a great balled of one of the German songs). I don't put the story of the movie in any of my reviews, because everyone else seems to.I have noticed that some people reviewing this film keep stating that it's too bad they really just filmed the Broadway show. First of all, that's not the case, and 2nd of all, if that's what they did do, Thank God, because they succeeded! If you have seen it on stage I think you will agree that this is an excellent representation of what was seen there (except for the "Very" unwise move of deleting Lane's "The King of Broadway," one of my favorite songs) (since it is on the soundtrack compact disc, perhaps the DVD will have the number re-instated? let's pray).Nathan Lane is fantastic, although I think Broderick overacts on some scenes, he was never that zany on stage playing a crazier person, thus taking away some of Broderick's shyness. I feel that the song Betrayed worked so well on stage, but here is not as good, and I think audiences might get bored with it, should have been shortened and King of Broadway should have been Nathan's big number, especially for the film version. The direction (from original stage director Susan Strohman) is generally good, but more of this should have had great camera pans and more angles...and they just aren't there. The art direction is first rate, as are Mel's songs, with the added pleasure of a much larger orchestra and better orchestrations than on the Broadway cast album (these in the film are excellent).I am not a fan by any means of Will Ferrell. When I heard he was cast, I thought to myself that finally here is a role I can really see him in and he is just great. Not so much for Uma Thurman . Acting Swedish, she is just fine, but holding those tough musical notes, she just can't do it. Still, much better casting than Lucy in Mame (hehe). I wish they would have dubbed her singing, because this is the version of her song(s) that will be seen forever unless you go to a live performance. Roger Bart and Gary Beach are really very funny, I just love that scene. The sad part was all of the younger audience (some teens in the back) were starting to make "Fag" remarks...too bad teenagers have no level of sophistication these days, and way too much prejudice. In any case, I had them thrown out (not the the specific remarks, but I hate people talking during movies, especially annoying teenagers who can't respect others).Eileen Essell, who played the hilarious tenant in Duplex and is in many movies these days, was brilliant as "Hold Me, Touch Me." She's one great actress in demand.I feel some of the good numbers were really opened up, especially the old lady number, and I don't agree with those who say everything was done exactly like the stage. I am really tired of reading references to the old Producers movie. For God's sake, this is not that movie, OK? Comparisons to anything really don't make much sense here as this is the same story but a different movie now with a musical score and different actors and some scenes. I am thankful this was filmed and was left for people to see what they missed on the stage. I sure wish this type of treatment was done to more stage musicals (like Miss Saigon or La Cage Aux Folles).The Producers is a great movie and I will buy the DVD and I know it will be played often. Treat yourself to a lot of fun and laughs and some great Broadway tunes, the first "tradional" show-music really since Fiddler on the Roof was filmed. Some of this feels like an old Mgm musical, and I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having been able to afford to pay the exorbitant prices being asked by the producers of "The Producers", now running for a few years at the St. James theater on Broadway, we waited for the release of the film based on the musical that is based on the original 1968 film written and directed by Mel Brooks. In fact, we paid about one tenth of what it would have cost seeing it in the theater and we thought we were in for a treat, especially, if that genius Mel Brooks, was involved in the screen play. Wrong! The film, while not a total failure, could have used a different treatment as it plays flat at times.In theory, "The Producers" was the right candidate for making the transfer to the screen since it involved the same director, Susan Stroman, and the two principals, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, who were paid a cool million each to come back to the show, last winter, when sales were lagging because the substitute actors weren't pulling in the crowds the original stars did. The film looks as though it's a poor imitation of what might have been in the theater.The music is the first thing that is wrong with the film. The musical score by Mr. Brooks leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, the whole film could be considered a vulgar attempt at the musical genre. But alas, that's another problem with the New York Broadway theater that prefers to revive third rate musicals with people that have no talent for the stage and only serve to attract the tourist crowds that jam the large theaters with its theme park musicals.Another problem are the two principals. Perhaps when the show opened on Broadway both Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick might have given the show a different flavor with their interpretation of Max Bialistock and Leo Bloom. The director doesn't seem to use them for the new medium effectively. In fact, both Mr. Lane and Mr. Broderick, left to their own instincts can be awful, as proved by their recent appearance on Broadway in "The Odd Couple", a show which we caught a preview recently. This pair of charismatic actors are seen in the film doing their own shtick.Uma Thurman is fine as the long limbed Swedish secretary in a fun role that seems to be the only thing right in the movie. Gary Beach's flamboyant gay director is fun to watch."The Producers", in this reincarnation doesn't show anything new as a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it the music???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie was based on a Mel Brooks' screenplay/movie. I saw that Matthew Broderick, Uma Thurman, Will Ferrell and Nathan Lane were in it as well. But then I saw it was a musical. I normally don't enjoy musicals, but this movie had the cred that I stated above so I gave this one a chance.C'mon people! The musical ballads were pointless and the whole movie was just a mess from top to bottom. It's supposed to be AT LEAST part comedy, and I laughed maybe twice and those were polite chuckles. The most important and entertaining characters were generally kept away from the screen and this movie just dragged.When I read the description of the movie, I saw musical, but it seemed like a comedic enough presence to give a chance to...which I did. There was nothing funny about this movie. Again, I loved the cast, but Ferrell was only on screen for bits at a time and he never had any sort of spectacular or entertaining scenes. Broderick was so far out of character he almost looked scared in every scene he was in throughout this movie.If anybody ever reads my reviews or talks to me on the boards, they know that I never, ever walk out of a theater and never, ever take a DVD out of the player. My gf, whom I was watching with, wanted it out after an hour, but I stuck with it. Bad decision. This movie was horrible through and through. No REAL plot, no character development, I couldn't even tell there WAS a director and any character's strengths that could've been used to make this movie more palatable were left out in the cold.I watched to the end expecting something out of the ordinary to help make the film along and to get something out of it. But that elusive "something" never came. Bad movie in just about every sense of the word. The only reason I give it a 2 star out of 10 is due to the fact that I could watch it until the end. Anyone on the border about renting this one or not, I'm giving you a resounding NO! But everybody has their own tastes. Me and my gf both hated this movie and we, combined, can at least tolerate almost ever genre of movie. We both hated this one. If you rent it, good luck! In my/our opinion? Terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely tasteless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a huge disappointment. It's sad that great actors like Matthew Broderick and Will Ferrell had to completely humiliate themselves by acting in such an awful excuse for a movie.So much in this movie was so over-dramatic, it was painful. Also, certain aspects were just disturbing, not funny. The characters really had nothing to love about them, especially Nathan Lane's character.The thing that bothered me the most were the very poor "gay parodies". I understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but the homosexual jokes were not even close to being funny; they were tasteless, stereotypical, and offensive.I'm disappointed in Mel Brooks' for this "comedy" disaster. He can make better movies than this. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is for the amazing singing job by Nathan Lane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Producers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mel Brooks film production of The Producers is an extraordinarily, hilarious film. Mathew Broderick is the perfect straight man for Nathan Lane. He (Broderick) wonderfully portrays the 'wanna be' producer with low self-esteem who makes it to the top. Nathan Lane is an extremely talented, multifaceted actor who can evoke laughter and tears all in the same moment. His is quite animated and his facial expressions are priceless. He is a pleasure to watch and a natural at 'old time type' musical comedies where 'overacting' may be seen as a aux-pas to the 21st century eye. Nathan Lane is a jewel that deserve all the praise and compliments that one can offer. Least we forget Mel Brooks whose genius created this delightful farce and deserves a standing ovation from all of us for the laughs he has brought to the screen and theater. I'm glad this Broadway version was put on film for us to enjoy for decades to come. With love to cast.margherita</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I know that it's a remake of the Broadway play that was inspired by the original movie,but the movie version of the play comes up short on virtually every level. Hey Matthew Broderick, stop overacting! This is a movie. You usually play your movie roles w/ dedicated professionalism,why act like your still on the Broadway stage for this movie? Is that what the director told you to do? Nathan Lane,(as great as he is) is nowhere as good as Zero Mostel in this version of The Producers. I had low expectations, &amp; this movie was even worse than I expected. Uma Thurman was hot for about 20 seconds in it so I can't complain that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Normally I love musical movies but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Producers 2005 had several mistakes which can't be overlooked.The most obvious were the songs. This wasn't Chicago or Little Shop of Horrors, where the songs were amusing, most of the songs here were long, annoying, and pointless (OK some in Chicago were too long as well).The second problem was Matthew Broderick. He was no Gene Wilder, Gene Wilder did the "crazy-unstable" guy perfectly, but with Matthew it just seemed silly, they should have adjusted the part to better suit Matthew's skills or hired someone who was more like Gene. But I know they hired Matt 'cause it was a musical, and he does sing very well.Now the good parts. Nathan Lane was RIGHT ON! He was a lot younger than Zero, but he was cast perfectly and did the part exactly as he should! I think this movie just might typecast him as the Zero of this generation.Will Ferral was cast right, but was a little overly dramatic. It worked in Elf, but didn't work for me here. He was still good though.I'm not sure what to say about Uma's part. So I won't say anything... :) My advice would be, just rent and watch the original. Or if you do choose to watch this remake, just keep watching Nathan Lane and you'll be OK.5/10 -- acceptable but nothing special</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane can hold their own against the original film with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder without question. They are superb. As for the rest of the cast I'll take the original ensemble. Their basic eccentricities and comic demeanor were much more hilarious.The plot revolves around a musical and in the original Mr. Brooks had enough song and dance to complement the comedy. This new version has a host of very lengthy production numbers that constantly overwhelm the storyline. In short we have a musical within a musical and a lot less devotion to the brilliance of Mel's comedic style.Ms. Thumann has natural talent and obvious beauty but sadly wasted here. Director Susan Stroman has an outstanding resume and her choreography is beautiful.By all means see this film and then the original. Judge for yourself. In either case it will be fun. I look forward to Mr. Brooks and his new version of Young Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I had never seen the original, this may have been decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No question that the original 1968 film is one of the greatest comedies of all time. Anyone who's seen the original is going to have a hard time not comparing this film to the original. As soon as this movie started, I knew I was in trouble. Let's just say that Nathan Lane &amp; Matthew Broderick don't even come close to Zero Mostel &amp; Gene Wilder. But it doesn't stop there. There is nobody in this film that is better than anyone in the original film. I realize they needed people that could not only act, but sing &amp; in some cases, dance. But one cannot look at the first 10 minutes of the film &amp; think, "Those are the worst impressions of Mostel &amp; Wilder I've ever seen." Broderick is the hardest to look at. He just doesn't come off as natural when he becomes hysterical or when he's explaining things to Bialystock. Nathan Lane fares better, but somehow the jokes come out very stale &amp; unfunny.Some of my favorite jokes from the original are just awful in this film. For example, in the original, Max says, "Well, you know what they say; smile &amp; the world smiles with you." He then turns &amp; looks into the camera &amp; says, "This man should be in a straight-jacket." Crossing the 4th wall works so well. Yet, in this film, Lane says the line to a statue. During the out-takes on the DVD, we see Lane deliver the line to the camera, ala Mostel. But he stops, realizing that he's not supposed to do it the same way as Zero, but the new, lamer version. The Hitler tryouts are also ruined in comparison to the original. In the original, the man singing "Have You Ever Heard the German Band", points to the piano player &amp; orders, "You Vill Play It!" Hilarious. In this one the same character turns &amp; say, "Play the song, please." or something weak like that. And finally, when the man (who has become a mentally challenged man for this film) goes to sing "The Little Wooden Boy", he goes into a stupid little dance, &amp; when he is just about to start, the director yells, "Next!" Nowhere near as funny as the original, where we see a man so sure of himself &amp; so confident get ready to sing &amp; then is cut off with the much funnier, "Thank you!" More problems arise with the changing of the story from the original. The main change is the omission of LSD (Dick Shawn's character). I heard they removed him as a hippie wouldn't work today. So, instead of just making him something other than a hippie, let's get rid of him &amp; throw the character of Franz in there. Doesn't work. Then, when the play is finally put on, the director, a very homosexual Roger DeBris, comes out &amp; sings, creating an obviously gay Hitler. And the audience then loves the show. How weak. There are other changes too, none of them good.Now, let's get to the good points of this film. Some of the original songs are pretty good. Broderick redeems his bad acting for some good singing &amp; dancing. Even Will Ferrel does a pretty good job. I can't say the same for Uma Thurman though, as her song is annoying &amp; screechy! There are some funny parts in the movie, &amp; they are all new to the story as all the original jokes fall flat (even without comparison). But there are not enough of the funny parts to save this film.I can see how some may like the Broadway aspect of this film &amp; I myself might have if the film itself didn't stink on the whole. So, I'll stick to the original film, this film had no reason to be made &amp; now that I have seen it, it had no reason to be watched either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gay old time for 'The Producers'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gay old time for 'The Producers'By Andrez Bergen / de-VICE Director: Susan Stroman Cast: Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, Uma Thurman, Gary Beach, Will Farrell Arguably Mel Brooks' most rib-tickling movie, the 1968 production of 'The Producers' showcased Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel at their comedic best. Then it lay dormant in the vault, before being dusted off in the form of a Broadway show at the beginning of this decade with a few bonus song-and-dance numbers penned by Brooks. In the polished renewal, Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane filled the formidable boots of Wilder's Leo Bloom and Mostel's Max Bialystock and, according to most reports, their shoe sizes were compatible. Lane in fact won a Tony award. This movie, based in turn on the Broadway rejig, reveals just how much the whole shebang relies on the '68 original. Everything is the same. Well, almost - aside from the tunes and one or two plot changes. It's 1960s New York. Max, a failed theatrical producer who's lost his musical shtick as the architect of a string of Broadway flops, crosses paths with the meek, anxiety-ridden accountant Leo--who just happens to conjure up an ingenious plan for raking in millions of bucks on the back of a bona fide Broadway bomb. First they have to raise the funds from Max's aged female financial backers, to whom Max acts out the role of toy boy, offering to sell the old dears a stairway to the stars with half the steps missing. Step two? Locating the worst play ever written: 'Springtime For Hitler', penned by German helmet aficionado Franz Liebkind, whose lasting memory of the Fuhrer is that he was "a good dancer." Add to this an egocentrically self-preoccupied director and an utterly incompetent cast, and all that's left for Max and Leo to collect are their plane tickets to Rio. Or so the plan goes... While Broderick's interpretation of Leo is occasionally (high) pitch-perfect, he isn't up to the persona that Gene Wilder so effectively nurtured 28 years ago. By contrast, Lane genuinely excels as Max, the double-dealing slimeball impresario with a heart buried somewhere deep beneath his hefty production money belt. It's a similar story with the rest of the cast. Uma Thurman positively smolders in the role of the sexy Swedish blonde bombshell Ulla, but Will Farrell - who strangely was nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance - fumbles his take on playwright Liebkind, a part that equally off-the-wall comedian Kenneth Mars had down pat back in 1968. And absent here is one of the more hilarious characters from the earlier celluloid production - that of Dick Shawn's flower-tossing Lorenzo St. DuBois, known as just plain "L.S.D." to his friends, who took on the stage role of Adolf Hitler and rendered him a hip-jive flower child with a swastika armband. This time around the honor of goose-stepping the boards for Germany goes to cross-dressing director Roger DeBris--played by actor Gary Beach, who also camped it up in TV series like 'Queer As Folk' and 'Will &amp; Grace'. Gay, it seems, has replaced flower-power in the mind of Mel Brooks some three decades after he originally wrote and directed the yarn, this time with emphasis on the characters of DeBris and his catty, posturing partner, Carmen Ghia (Roger Bart), along with supporting players modeled on the Village People. Brooks' script is loaded with other high school-level sexual innuendo, vulgarity, occasionally offensive racial stereotypes, ageism and anything else he wants to bludgeon with a blunt instrument - all delivered with such banal exuberance and gusto it somehow works. Great for a bit of toe-tapping and a mild guffaw or three, The Producers may be set in the 1960s - but the superior 1968 version it's not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect movie musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing I found about this movie is that it admits that it is a musical. It takes the "falseness" of Broadway and turns it into a movie. For example, the theater, the huge group of old ladies, the "Unhappy" number, and even the over-the-top characters. In the first few minutes of seeing the movie, I thought Matthew Broderick's voice was a little too much for me, but then I realized that it set the stage and practically came out and said "this is Broadway on screen".Admittedly, this movie appeals greatly to people who love musicals and theater, though not so much to the "common" person. It's problem in the press is that they don't take that into consideration. I mean, the movie critics are, well, movie critics. Also, there are more things that you can get away with on stage, but not in a close up on camera (facial expressions, some voice things, etc.). If you noticed, the characters had great diction, and some of the lines seemed over-acted. That's Broadway, and if you've ever taken an acting class in your life, you know that's what you want in a show so sarcastically funny.The show takes a "terrible" issue (Nazism) and makes it funny. I mean, stormtroopers tap dancing? A gay Hitler? A whole number about keeping Broadway gay (in many meanings)? It takes things that we look at and hear about-- the sort of strange things that are around us-- and comes straight out and says them in the strangest, most outright way.It's Mel Brooks... singing. About Nazis, who tap dance and sing about the "Master Race". There were many parts in the movie where I was laughing for many minutes after the joke (or the song). Hilarious, but doesn't appeal to the common man as much as it appeals to the Broadway and/or Mel Brooks fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classically Typical Offering from a Prodigiously Multi-Talented Master Craftsman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1950's, while still honing his craft by gag writing for other comics, Mel Brooks co-authored the musical comedy "archie &amp; mehitabel". Based on a series of newspaper columns the play was about a cockroach named Archie, who had literary aspirations, and his relationship with Mehitabel, a street-wise alley cat. "archie &amp; mehitabel" starred Eartha Kitt as the alley cat and had a (very) modest run on Broadway but the script showed flashes of a comedic style that was to become uniquely identified with Brooks. Some forty years later, after writing, directing and/or starring in many more notable successes in film and television ("Get Smart", "Blazing Saddles", "Young Frankenstien"), Brooks returned to Broadway with another musical comedy "The Producers". This play recycled the plot of a largely forgotten film of the same name for which he had won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay in 1968. The plot revolves around down-on-his-luck Broadway producer Max Bialystock who teams with his meek and mild accountant Leo Bloom. Using typically Mel Brooks logic they scheme to make their fortune by producing a spectacular flop (the worst play ever, a guaranteed first night closer). They decide to produce "Springtime for Hitler" which, of course, becomes a huge success. As Bialystock laments, "We got the wrong play. We got the wrong director. We got the wrong actors. Where did we go right?"As a stage musical "The Producers" went on to become a smash hit on Broadway and around the world. In the time honoured Hollywood tradition of cashing in on Broadway's successes Brooks turned his script into a film starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, both reprising their Broadway roles as Bialystock and Bloom.Having not seen the stage musical, or the film from which it was derived, I viewed the current film version of "The Producers" without any pre-conceptions. Without having to compare it to earlier versions I found this film to be refreshingly funny and a return to the madcap on-screen mayhem that endears Brooks to audiences. The screenplay, co-written by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan, is chock full of Brooks' trademark one liners and his verbal and visual slapstick, all of which are delivered with impeccable precision by the actors. Brooks also wrote both the music and the lyrics.I can assure those of you groaning this is just more of the same that this film is not formulaic. Although it has Brooks' inimitable style, the script is refreshingly different and funny. I may have found it so because I am old fashioned but my fellow audience, who were from all age groups, also seemed to agree. It has been a long time since I have sat through a film where I have heard so much laughter from the audience. The film flags a bit in the second act, as is common in musicals, but not to the point of boredom.First-time film director Susan Stroman, who also choreographed (and who directed/choreographed the stage version), does not hide the film's Broadway origins which is not always a successful strategy but seems to work here. Stroman also seems to have let the actors have their head (normally a recipe for disaster) maybe because most of them had been playing their characters for so long on Broadway. The ploy has worked for this film. Every one plays their roles to the hilt with general agreement appearing to be that over-acting is the order of the day. It takes some time to get used to the over-the-top style, particularly from Will Ferrell as Franz Leibkind the Nazi playwright. Ferrell goes a bit further than I believe necessary for his character but this may be just my prejudices showing as the younger members of the audience seemed to like him. Broderick's meekness as the accountant is also a little too forced in the beginning but this is soon forgotten as we warm to his character. Continuing with my small list of dislikes, Uma Thurman occasionally drops out of her supposedly-Swedish-but-more-pan-Scandinavian accent. But she is otherwise excellently effervescent as Ulla (which is short for an unbelievably long name) the stage struck starlet hoping for her big break. Shining through them all is Nathan Lane as Max Bialystock, a role that Brooks may have envisaged for himself. With seemingly effortless ease Lane schmoozes and breezes and blusters his way though the film, outclassing (but not upstaging) everyone around him. It is yet another flawless performance in a long list of great performances from this actor.All are brilliantly supported by outrageously camp performances from Gary Beach as Roger De Bris, the Director, and Roger Bart as his... ahem... personal assistant, Carmen Ghia. (Following his forebear Shakespeare, Brooks even finds comedy in naming his characters)While perhaps not the greatest movie musical ever made, "The Producers" can hold its own with any of them. It is a welcome return to a genre that provides entertainment through sharp scripting and classy production values instead of CGI effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still kinda would like to see the stage version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six years ago,Mel Brooks had his cult movie "The Producers" re-scripted to be made into a stage play,then putting it on Broadway. The play ended up exceeding expectations as a smash Broadway hit thru 2001,2002 and 2003,and prompted Mr.Brooks and others to put together the film version of that.And that's how we get this offering,which is not quite a remake of the 1968 original,but is sort of an "inflating" of it. The story is the same as before: morally-challenged theater producer Max Bialystock(Nathan Lane,who MORE than carries this film/musical on his back)is hemorrhaging money and needs a way to make some serious cash before (other than the usual method:seducing rich,elderly women,which leads to one of the many fitfully fun musical numbers here). In walks one Leo Bloom(Matthew Broderick,charming but seemingly overwhelmed at times),an accountant sent to do Mr.Bialystock's books. When Leo muses aloud that Max could make more money from a flop than a hit,through a loophole in the tax code. This inspires Max,and it terrifies Leo at first,but soon the bombastic producer and the shy accountant agree to go in on this scheme.The supporting cast--Will Ferrell as the bird-loving Nazi playwright,Uma Thurmann as the sweetly sexy Swedish secretary,Roger Bart as the flaming director,Gary Beach as his lover/choreographer,Andrea Martin as a particularly feisty elderly patron and Jon Lovitz as Bloom's snarly,buzz kill of a boss(And this is among others)--seem to be having a lot of fun here,even if they seem to be in danger of making this a little TOO over-the-top for the screen. The musical numbers are fun and catchy,and if you're up for a bouncy,clever,self-aware movies,then this show should be quite the treat.My one lament is that,as stated in the summary,is that seeing this almost makes me wish I had or could see this on Broadway,because the movie is so big and bold that it feels like it's somewhat of an uncomfortable fit on the screen. Director Susan Stroman,who directed the show on the Great White Way,wisely chose to keep the appearance of the show to have a more "stagey" look. Being a fan of(and sometimes a contributor to)theater,I can say that I think I would've REALLY appreciated this in a live venue,if not with this cast,certainly with a competent,talented cast of no-names. Still,if you can't get to NYC to catch it,this film is plenty good enough to find in a cinemaplex near you.</fullReview>

The pigeons were also brilliant: watch out for their props! If you generally like musicals, appreciate satire and are reasonably broadminded, I think you will like this movie.

		<shortDescription>Best Film Musical in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Producers is everything a musical should be. It's funny, loud, brassy, over-the-top, and it aims to please. It seems almost exactly like watching a play, and that's exactly how it should be. A movie so determinedly old-fashioned, I felt like I was watching Singin' in the Rain, only better. As I watched in theaters. I found it impossible to be unhappy, even during the films sadder moments. Mel Brooks is my hero, and if there were any story in the history of mankind that I wish I could claim as my own, it would be The Producers. It's a story so simple, and yet so very unique, that it absolutely captivates me. I hope more than anything to be in show business one day, and this movie is one of the greatest inspirations I've ever come across. I've felt for a long time that the original 1968 film is one of, if not the best screen comedy of all time, and this version might be even better. It's certainly funnier, and the music is a showcase of some of the finest showtunes ever, a true testament to Brooks' genius. And although Matthew Broderick is no Gene Wilder, I think his personality works better in this musical version than his predecessor, and Nathan Lane is absolutely perfect. Even the sets, costumes, choreography, technical aspects seem like characters themselves, and it's well deserving of an art direction Oscar (I would award it Best Score, Best Screenplay, Best Actor (Lane), Best Song (I Wanna Be A Producer), Best Costume Design, and even Best Picture). The Producers hearkens back to a time of truly classic films, and goes above and beyond them. Critics may say it may be too theatrical, but that's exactly how a musical ought to be. Mel Brooks' magnum opus, this is entertainment in it's purest form, a love letter to show business, and an appropriate swan song of one of America's greatest entertainers.</fullReview>

If you're not into extravagant musicals, I'd advise you not go and see it, as I have an inkling that you may find yourself walking out before the end as well. I'm sure the reason for this was because it left the 'average' viewer (I hate to use stereotypes, but in this situation, it is a must to clarify my opinion) feeling a little uncomfortable, or confused, to say the least. With the frequent use of close-ups, vibrant scenes and exaggerated characters, the movie was rather 'in your face' (please excuse the pun). This re-make/adaptation really should have been left in its original form(s) where the audience was given a lot more 'space' (both literally and figuratively) and 'over-the-top', 'larger than life' occurrences were expected. But don't get me wrong - it certainly had its moments (some parts were simply hilarious) and the acting was superb. If you've seen the original(s), or enjoy these types of films, you'll probably love it. But if you're not really into random outbursts of song, dance and unrealistic personality, or if it just plain scares you, it's probably not for you. To Mr. Brooks: your movie was wonderful, and I respect and appreciate its reputation, but I wish that you'd seen that the 'average' person was warned what they were going to be seeing in the trailer before they bought their ticket. It would have saved a lot of people some time and money - but as you'll get your money's worth anyway, I don't think you'll mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep It Gay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night and it has to be the first time in months that I have actually laughed out loud in the cinema - and not just once either.I went to see this film, not really knowing what to expect. I knew it was a comedy and I knew the basic outline of the plot. I didn't actually realise it was a musical, and I'm glad I didn't because I might not have seen it otherwise, due to my deep hatred of musicals. But this film has changed my perspective on musicals, which I've always viewed as boring, old-fashioned and mushy. This is the total opposite.Now I can't compare this film to its original, as I haven't seen it, but to be honest, i couldn't care less. This film was hilarious from the very start, with the pensioner seducing Max meeting a hysterical, pathetic Leo. It just got better and better, with clever, enjoyable songs, amazing sets and dances and a fantastic cast. My favourite characters and accompanying song being Roger, his assistant and their song 'Keep it Gay' which had me in stitches.A definite highlight has to be Will Ferrell in top form as an insane Nazi. The whole rooftop scene was genius, topped off by dancing Nazi pigeons. Uma Thurman also proved herself as a great comedic actress, cast perfectly as Ulla.The best thing about this movie is how brilliantly un 'pc' it is. Leo and Max's Broadway play contains Nazis, a gay Hitler, ridiculously offensive songs and I don't think I stopped laughing during the whole 'Springtime for Hitler' sequence. Bad taste at it's very best.What also gave this movie a great feel, is that it was filmed in a very Broadway style, and I felt as if I was seeing the film in a Broadway theatre. It's a very original concept and highly entertaining.The one criticism I have of The Producers is that the end was a little drawn out for my liking. I felt the 'Springtime for Hitler' sequence should have been closer to the end, as it felt like a finale, and then having to watch half an hour more didn't feel quite right. The Jail sequence also felt a little unnecessary.But overall, this is a fantastic film, it's the funniest film I have seen in a very long time, and I assure any fellow musical haters that this, if you only ever watch one musical, is the one to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Amazing, Wonderful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. I laughed out loud throughout most of the movie and found it very entertaining. Matthew Broderick did an amazing job as Leo Bloom. Matt and Nathan Lane were also a great team. The movie is made like the Broadway and sometimes it felt like I was watching it on stage which I found absolutely awesome. I thought that was cool! Will Ferrel also was very entertaining to watch as Franz Liebkind. In some ways I sort of found this movie like Monty Python. So if you like humorous entertainment with great Broadway music then head down to see The Producers! It is definitely a great choice, and even if you don't like the music so much, the humour in it can make up for it. I highly recommend The Producers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading mixed reviews about this film, I decided to go and see it for myself. With the preconception that this film was a Broadway play, I couldn't help thinking about the stage to screen process while watching certain scenes. I felt some of the jokes seemed a little forced and maybe a bit too much slapstick at times, but thought it was hilarious overall. I had a smile on my face through the whole film. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick were shining as the leads, while Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell were fabulous and funny as Ulla and Franz. The funniest parts were those which contained Roger Bart and Gary Beach as the bitchy, glitzy lovers Carmen and Roger. I thought that Roger Bart was a scene stealer whenever he appeared because he shone. The songs were very catchy and managed to work a lot of comedy into them. I was laughing and tapping my foot through every one.Overall, I'd give this a 4/5. Great cast, comedy and songs - but some parts a little too cheesy for my tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks has a stroke...of GEEE-NIUUUS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968, Mel Brooks, aka the King of Spoof, brought us a clever little comedy called The Producers. It starred the great Gene Wilder, who gave an unforgettably impressive performance as the nervous, mousy accountant Leo Bloom and of course his partner in crime Zero Mostel who was absolutely brilliant as the down-and-out Broadway producer Max Bialystock. It was a terrifically funny little gem and it's certainly Brooks' more mature-ish film to date. Then, the film was turned into a hit musical and now the story has been re-transferred to the big screen?for some reason.Brooks' career has been quiet as of late, and the sadly unfunny mess that was Robin Hood: Men in Tights showed signs that the great man was losing his magic touch. And even though the wrongly underrated Dracula: Dead and Loving It received godawful reviews, it was quite a promising effort in my opinion, made me laugh anyway.This time, Brooks turns to the classic that made his name and even though the director this time is Susan Stroman, not himself, this is very much his new baby. The ebullient Nathan Lane is Bialystock, a certified romancer of the elderly who gets his funding for Broadway stinkers like his Hamlet musical "Funny Boy" from "chequies" he receives from old ladies looking for a last thrill on their way to the cemetery. He receives a visit from the safety-blanket-stroking accountant Leo Bloom (Broderick on top form) who has come to do his books. The rather fragile little man notices that under the right circumstances a producer could make more money with a flop than with a hit. Hearing this, Bialystock goes nuts and tries to convince Bloom to join him in the search for a sure fire flop that will bring them millions and send them off to Rio, worry-free. From then on, the rhythm of the film is accelerated considerably and things get increasingly camp, loud and toe-tappingly brilliant. They find the worst play ever: Springtime for Hitler, written by neo-Nazi pigeon-lover Frank Liebken (Will Ferrell), a disaster certain to close on page 4. Then, they hire the worst director, an extremely camp, cross-dressing queen who would make Ed Wood look like a genius. Enters Ula, a Swedish wannabe actress and dancer who helps the guys out as a secretary/receptionist and gets a part in their stinker. Of course, they need the worst Hitler they can find, and who better to play the man himself than his biggest fan Frank?However, things go pear-shaped, to say the least, when their musical is a surprise hit and is even called a "satiric masterpiece" by a critic. The script, co-written by Brooks and Thomas Meehan, is very close to the original film, dialogs-wise anyway, but it does include some interesting changes which bring a certain freshness to a familiar, straight-forward story and some depth to previously unexplored characters (mainly Bloom and Ula). This being an adaptation of a stage musical, there are songs agogo, the highlights being "I Wanna Be a Producer" and "Springtime for Hitler". The choreography of those musical numbers are brilliantly inventive and occasionally even, dare I say it?: Pure genius. I must say I haven't seen such a multi-talented and energetic cast in a very long time: everyone knows exactly what they're doing and they do it to perfection.Nathan Lane (The Birdcage) is absolutely superb as the slimy Bialystock, he adds a campness and theatrical manner to Bialystock which is simply charming: someone give this man an Oscar. As for the ever underrated Matthew Broderick (Cable Guy, Inspector Gadget), there's no doubt he cannot equal Wilder's amazing work in the original and that he will be endlessly criticised for attempting to do that, but as far as I'm concerned I think he gives an impressive performance and manages to use Wilder's style whilst adding his own cartoony ways, which is very admirable. Ferrell is obviously hilarious as Liebken and Uma Thurman is simply stunning as Ula. Actually, the whole cast is Oscar-worthy to be honest and I dare you to find a bad performance in the film.Being a fan of Brooks ever since I saw Young Frankenstein a long long time ago, I had high hopes for this "remake" of The Producers: needless to say I wasn't disappointed one bit. It was what I expected and much more. Not only is it extremely entertaining and gut-burstingly hilarious but it still manages to be a bit shocking which just goes to show how the horrors of WWII are still engraved in our minds. The Producers is not only hands-down the funniest film of 2005 but it's also one of the best films of the year and the best musical I've seen in a very long time. It certainly puts Moulin Rouge to shame that's for sure. Mel Brooks has returned with a Boom! and ends the cinematic year with a Bang! and a quiet yet still very much audible fart noise. He's turned a classic comedy into a classic musical. Be good to yourself, go see this masterful laugh-fest, if you don't, "ze penalty iz dess!" Which is just as unpleasant as death. Is The Producers any good? One word: Yeeeeeessssssss...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marriage of the high-brow and low-brow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Producers is a well-crafted marriage of low-brow and high-brow entertainment. On the one hand it's a classically conceived musical, the one to come out in recent years (including Moulan Rouge, Chicago, Rent, Phantom of the Opera, Evita, etc.) that comes closest to recapturing the form of the golden era of MGM musicals. On the other hand this was produced by Mel Brooks, the same guy who brought us such films as Robin Hood: Men in Tights and Spaceballs so it's got a few twists thrown in. The story is based very closely off of the mega hit Broadway show, The Producers which is based on the 1968 movie The Producers, which was in fact Mel Brooks' feature film debut. I haven't seen that film but it has a lot less over- the-top humor (he was just starting out) and is described by some as even being a little dark. As for the play, which I also haven't seen, to be honest, it's nearly a line-for-line copy with probably just a little bit of a loss in the production value. The story follows Matthew Broderick (Ferris Beuller's Day Off, Stepford Wives) as an accountant and Nathan Lane (The Lion King, Birdcage, Mouse Hunt) as a Broadway producer who come up with a surefire way to embezzle money off a Broadway show, provided it flops. Their task, therefore, is to find a play with absolutely no chance of success or they risk going to jail, so they recruit an ex-Nazi (Will Ferrell) who's written an ode to Hitler and mix things up even more by hiring a flamboyantly gay director (Roger Bart and Oscar Beach, pretty funny guys) which makes for an even worse play. Lane and Broderick are exclusively at the center of this show. One of the only reasons to have made this movie was pretty much to bring the success of this Lane/Broderick tandem to the masses, so you already know that the two make quite a team. Each of their characters is severely dysfunctional in different ways and good comedy results when you put them together. This picture also differs from the 1968 movie because the original wasn't a musical, except for one song, "Springtime for Hitler," which I thought was this film's only memorable song, anyway. I read the blandness of the rest of the songs as part of the joke, parodying the generic quality of most musical songs. It's also ironic that with all the build-up of how disastrous this play will be, that the "Springtime for Hitler" number turns out quite entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a musical masterpiece. Although it may not be the original, it is defienently worth seeing. The comical stature of this film in unbelievable. The ONLY flaw, I believe, was that it was too long. Usually musicals/Broadway plays are about 2 hours in length, where as this show went from about 6:30 to 9:20 for me when I went to see it. A little too long, but it's a great movie for the whole family to see! I highly recommend this movie for you Broadway goers who want to get a good laugh and a very inexpensive chance to hear the memories of New York Broadway. Truly, this movie will please any age mature enough to understand what it takes to produce such great music, great acting, and absolutely fabulous directing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love and enjoy the Broadway Musical Theater you will love this movie. I saw the original with Broderick and Lane and they are as good in the movie as they were on the stage. This brings back memories of the Broadway stage in the late 40s and 50s, before all the gimmicks that shows now need. Nathan Lane is the perfect one to follow in the footsteps of Zero Mostel who did the original movie in 1968. Mel Brooks proves once again his genius when he told the director to do the exact Broadway show on film. Needless to say he topped his own original movie with both the show and the movie. To me the pleasant surprise in the film is Uma Thurman. I always knew she was talented and beautiful, but I had no idea that she had the singing and dancing talent that she exhibits in the film. If you have never seen a "good" Broadway musical comedy, and aren't used to Broadway singing voices and dancing, you will not appreciate all that this movie has to offer. The little "shticks" that Mel Brooks has put into this production can only be appreciated by people who have had this experience.</fullReview>

His voice isn't that strong, but it didn't really hurt his part at all. And Nathan and Matthew certainly have "chemistry". They worked well together, and both men fit their parts.

		<fullReview>As a person who has not seen either the original or the stage version of The Producers, I found the film to be excellent. It was well-written and the musical numbers and songs were contagious and amusing. The film as a whole is completely hilarious (and had my friend and I crying and nearly wetting ourselves). Matt Broderick was excellent, to the point of being surprised at his skill at playing neurotic (you'll see what I mean). Nathan Lane never disappoints, and he was at his best here, as was Will Ferrell. I was immensely surprised by Uma Thurman's part as Ulla. I'm not generally a fan of her, but I was surprised to be loving her character more and more as the film progressed. All had excellent singing voices (or made you believe that they did). There isn't an over abundance of 'dirty' humor, just enough, and it's presented in such a way that not matter what the joke, you're going to laugh. The relationship between the characters played by Lane and Broderick is surprisingly heartwarming. Thurman's character adds just the right amount of 'sex appeal,' while Ferrell's adds the perfect amount of... wackiness. This makes for an excellent time. It might not be Oscar worthy, but it's definitely a good time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another outstanding Mel Brooks production.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is obviously difficult to make a movie about a play that is based on a real Broadway musical based on a movie about a musical. All That aside this was the most enjoyable time I have spent in a movie theater in years. Susan Stroman did an excellent job of translating her Broadway direction to the large screen. Sets were outstanding, you actually felt you were on Shubert's Alley. Great tribute payed to the original movie. Having seen the Broadway production with Lane and Broadrick and then on film I feel they an excellent team, like a musical Newman and Redford. They properly played the movie as a musical-comedy rather that just a comedy and brought a new life to the movie.Nathan and Matthew should do limited productions, as with the Odd Couple, because they have great chemistry together. However, they should not over do it, burn out themselves and the audience. They should split the Oscar.I highly recommend to those who are not fans of musicals. This production grabs you from the beginning. Will Farrell as Franz is a classic. His true acting ability came through here. His range is excellent as is his complete performance. Oscars galore for the movie, the director, the score, the actors and for Mel for just being Mel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into The Producers with fairly high hopes, and I must say I was impressed. Other than "Chicago", this is the best stage-to-film adaptation yet. It really made you feel that you were in New York, on Broadway, watching these class-A actors. Nathan Lane is a camera-hogging producer who can only make bombs. He meets a meek accountant played well by Matthew Broderick, who finds that one can theoretically make more money with a flop than a hit. "Springtime for Hitler" is the result. Homosexual jokes and Nazi propaganda make for laughs aplenty. I did, however, find there to be one too many songs, even if it is a musical. (One song continuously breaking the fourth wall is great, though.) It also dragged on at over two hours- still enjoyable, especially the big play and the resulting... oh that's a spoiler! Check it out. 8/10- good stuff.</fullReview>

After all, I find Mel Brooks "comedies" to be the lamest, lowest-common-denominator style of comedy, full of unfunny puns and slapstick overacting. But I like musicals, so I thought I might at least get some enjoyment out of it. I should give it a shot.It's even worse than I thought.The first scene with Lane and Broderick, which seems to go on for about half an hour, is agonizing and interminable, I almost turned it off (again - I started watching it once LONG ago and never made it through that scene), but I powered through and kept watching. The movie never got much better. The songs themselves are slightly less awful, but the rest of the film is just too rooted in bad, laughless Mel Brooks style. The performances are equally painful, even from some of the otherwise-decent actors. It's so overdone and exaggerated - fine if you're playing to a large live theater, but in a movie that kind of exaggeration is not needed and just comes across as dumb.</fullReview>

As far as classics go this obvious attempt for a studio to make money off of a masterpiece. I hope they failed miserably. They took a work of art and tore it while using the original script as toilet paper. It was a completely horrible waste of time. Not a new take on a Mel Brooks classic but a horrible watered down version. The spirit of Mel Brooks was that he was edgy and controversial. They got rid of that and what was left is a horrible movie with no spirit of the author or life in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood and Broadway have been long-standing friends, engaged in the very profitable business of sharing materials, sending scripts flipping back and forth from stage to screen and vice versa. "The Producers," first a film in 1968, was adapted for Broadway performance in 2001 and has been recently transformed back into movie form in late 2005.Mix the cultured sophistication of a musical with the long standing humorous talents of Mel Brooks and one gets something?well, something in between. "The Producers" follows a simple recipe calling for one washed-out-money-grubbing-has-been-producer named Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane), his counterpart, a repressed, self-conscious accountant with secret aspirations of life on Broadway, Leopold Bloom (Matthew Broderick), and a scheme to make them both rich: raise an exorbitant amount of money for a Broadway play so terrible that it is guaranteed to close after one night while pocketing the remaining unspent cash afterwards. Throw in a love interest with a bad Swedish accent and singing voice to match, Ulla Inga Hansen Bensen Yansen Tallen Hallen Svadon Swanson (Uma Thurman), a remarkably gay Broadway director Roger De Bris (Gary Beach) and an outlandishly dull witted Nazi script writer Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell) and let the hilarity commence.After finding the worst play ever written, Liebkind's "Springtime for Hitler," the most terrible director in the business, and raising two million dollars, everything seems like it will run according to plan. However, when the play becomes a surprising Broadway hit, it leaves Max Bialystock questioning "where did we go right?" Ending with an attempt at a soft and sentimental touch, "The Producers" fails to elicit any other emotion than laughter from the audience, except for possibility of evoking distain at having to spend money to see it.Everything about "The Producers" is completely overdone, from the outrageous characters to the musical numbers, one involving a platoon of dancing grandmas with walkers. While "The Producers" is a pleasantly fun movie that is sure to get many genuine laughs from any audience, it is fundamentally nothing more. Predictable even for those who have never seen its predecessors, the story is straightforward and quickly brings nothing new to the table. There are sections during many of the musical portions where the outrageous humor wears off and it seems like the number should have ended five cuts back."The Producers" is a movie stuck between two worlds. It feels and acts like a play (sometimes drawing audience applause in movie theaters at the conclusion of musical numbers) but is still fundamentally a film. Camera shots in some scenes are limited to one particular angle as it would be were it viewed on stage where others move freely around to show viewpoints that would be impossible on Broadway. The acting, which seemed more geared for the stage than screen, cannot be judged from either vantage adequately. "The Producers" runs like a hybrid between the two arts, neither one nor the other, giving it a somewhat unique and schizophrenic taste.For some, a taste is all that is needed before they've had their fill of "The Producers." Mel Brooks' humor has been both acclaimed and shunned by different audiences. Admittedly it does take a special person to find the humor in Bialystock playing grandmas for cash and appreciate things like Will Ferrell's acting but the film does possess some authentic laugh-out-loud moments. Like a fast food meal, "The Producers" lands well short of a five-star restaurant but will fill you up for the time being. Just don't forget to bring some Pepto-Bismol as a precaution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original movie of Mel Brook's The Producers is hilarious, sentimental, fun, and silly...a fine movie. The stage production of The Producers is hilarious, sentimental, fun, exciting, and silly...a truly great musical. The movie of the musical The Producers is not too great. It isn't truly awful, but it's not the fantastic production it could have and should have been.This movie seems to be more of a video camera set up in front of a stage production rather than being reworked in ways to get the audience involved (compare stage productions of Chicago with the movie version to see what I mean). There are many fine moments in this film, but there are many chances not taken, which is a shame considering all the chances made in the script already.I guess my biggest problem is that I know the musical score so well. One of my favorite songs, "The King of Old Broadway," was cut, but the re-orchestration of much of the show and occasional single measures of music being cut made it distracting. The casting was great...adding Will Ferrell to the mix was fun, though Uma Thurman's singing and dancing certainly don't compare to Cady Hoffman's.This is a really good movie to purchase to add to your musical movie collections, but I didn't feel that it was worth the $65.00 it took to take myself and my two children to see it. My recommendation, though, is to see it and the original 1968 movie on screen before seeing the Broadway or touring production. It will make you appreciate both more.</fullReview>

The rest of the audience were also holding their sides in pain at the relentless barrage of jokes and the bravura performances - particularly that of Nathan Lane as Max. Why isn't he up for an Oscar? Prior to seeing this movie, I would have bet serious money that no-one would ever top Zero Mostel's portrayal of the character in the original film but Nathan Lane takes the prize!

		<shortDescription>hilarious film based on the Broadway musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see "The Producers" with the original Broadway cast led by Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. It was one of the most sensational nights of theater I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of big shows. I was not in any way disappointed by this marvelous film, which boasts Lane and Broderick in their Broadway roles, as well as some other Broadway holdovers from the production, including Roger Bart and Gary Beach.One of the show's first numbers, "The King of Broadway," was eliminated, and some of the other numbers were changed to accommodate opening the space beyond a stage. The delightful number "I Want To Be a Producer," one of the cleverest numbers in the stage show, was changed here but still comes off well.Broderick and Lane are Broadway's new Lunt and Fontanne. They have tremendous chemistry together, and as of this writing, are appearing on Broadway again, this time in "The Odd Couple." Nathan Lane does what is called his "Nathan Shtick" but it's hysterically funny, and Leo Bloom fits Broderick better than any role he's played in a while, and that includes Felix Unger. Uma Thurman is beautiful and sexy as Ulla. Will Ferrell is hilarious as the playwright of "Springtime for Hitler: A romp with Adolf and Eva on the Rhine." Gary Beach and Roger Bart were perfect on Broadway, and they're perfect here. Unfortunately, the talented and funny Andrea Martin's part was cut to a mere bit. She plays one of Max's old ladies. Jon Lovitz has a nice role as Leo's Boss. Many Broadway actors were used in the film, including Jim Borstelmann, Debra Monk, John Barrowman, Brent Barrett, Colleen Dunn, Holly Cruikshank, and Hunter Foster.Susan Stroman didn't do much to adapt the stage show to film - it looks like a filmed version of the show - lots of closeups, everything done in a huge, stage-like way. Nevertheless, the time just flew by. "The Producers" is outrageous fun, although not for all tastes. But if you want/need a laugh, this just might be the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is Not A Movie Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit to being more than a little wary of the musical incarnation of the Mel Brooks classic, 'The Producers', despite it's recent success on stage. I suppose I'm just sick of pointless remakes ? 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' being a mirror-written motto which should be etched with a razor blade on the foreheads of studio executives. Predictably it's a mixed bag. Nathan Lane is in fine comic fettle, very much taking his lead from Zero Mostell's original portrayal of the monstrous Max Biallystock, and Matthew Broderick demonstrates a genuine talent as a hoofer, marred only by his lack of expression. His wide-eyed rabbit-in-the-headlights look would work well on stage, but on film makes him look a little as though he's just been smacked in the face with a plank. Perhaps he saw Uma Thurman's quite astonishingly awful performance. I'm no admirer of Thurman (aside from in the excellent, and underrated 'Jennifer 8'), but this isn't even an adequate performance. Will Ferrell, another individual whose appeal I fail to grasp, is slightly better, but gives a pale imitation of Kenneth Mars in the original. The music is patchy, though some set pieces - a Busby Berkley type chorus scene with old ladies on zimmers, and the 'Springtime For Hitler' routine (led by my landlord's nephew, John Barrowman), are inspired. The humour, particularly the homophobia and sexual innuendo, is very much mired in the 1960s, and there seems to have been little effort on the part of director Susan Stroman (a theatre director with no real experience of the different disciplines of film) to make this more than just a filmed stage musical, make the whole thing seem very dated. Not awful, but not a patch on the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trickle Down Theory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First came the original Mel Brooks film which was hysterical, edgy and a rare (for it's time) sardonic look at the theatre. Then Brooks had the brainstorm to create a full-scale Broadway musical of "The Producers" which swept the Tony Awards to much ballyhoo. TV stations aired opening night celebrations - airing clips from every scene except "Springtime for Hitler" (spoilers?). So, by the time I caught up with the musical on tour in Washington DC, I felt I had 'been there, seen that.' Now, to preserve for posterity the Tony-nabbing cast of Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Gary Beach and Roger Bart, original director Susan Strohman (a woman with Tonys for doorstops) and the urging/backing of Brooks has turned the camera lens back onto Bialy and Bloom. The result, sadly, is that awful 'watered down' feeling of what was once a stroke of pure genius.Mel and Stroh give us an 'in your face', 'fourth wall be damned', presentational flick that is supposed to recall the film musicals of yore. A movie is a naturalistic medium, and here it is too, too far removed from reality by the addition of music, theatricalized scenery, fantasy sequences, larger than life performances, and the lack of a fourth wall. In short, it is all too much. Lane and Broderick (who've turned their awkward partnership into a cottage industry), never erase the memory of either their stage success or Mostel and Wilder's intonations. The casting of a Hollywood star (Uma, meet Ula; Ula meet Uma) only further distances us from the piece, as the rest of the ensemble is culled from Broadway's finest. Award winning performers like Debra Monk, Karen Ziemba, Ruth Williamson, and Andrea Martin (to name a few) are reduced to 'blink and you miss 'em' cameos. The highlight of the stage incarnation was the 'zimmer frame' tap number. Without an Act One finale to work up to, this song ("Along Came Bialy") is a let-down. Similarly, "Springtime for Hitler", so wonderfully funny in both previous incarnations, feels underplayed here. Worse, the film limps on far too long after this climax.Like the recent "Rent" film, I suppose that future generations will be glad to have Broderick and Lane immortalized in their Broadway sensation. But until that time, it feels like Brooks and company should have quit while they were ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critics are a bunch of jerks.The musical version of "The Producers" is a bunch of frivolous fun. There is lots of singing and dancing and vaudeville style comedy.This is an old fashioned style film. The musical style is like the Judy Garland films for MGM. The comedy is like the Marx Brothers. Mel Brooks is trying to get a laugh about every 30 seconds and will go to great lengths to do so. A lot of the jokes in the film are funny only because they are in such bad taste. The musical numbers are loud and brash and funny.I don't really like serious musicals like "Phantom of the Opera" and "Rent." I like musical-comedies that are light and fun and "The Producers" fits the bill nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun musical, as long as you don't expect good songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that needs to be said about this movie is, stay to the end. I was going to walk out when the credits started rolling but my girlfriend wanted to stay, and she turned out to be right; one of my favorite moments in the movie is at credits' end.Now that we've got that out of the way: The original Mel Brooks movie The Producers was brilliant, but I wasn't expecting this musical version to be as good, so I wasn't disappointed. At times the movie is actually pretty close to the original, notably in the first meeting of the two principals, and the closer this movie is to the first one, the better it is. Nathan Lane is a perfect replacement for Zero Mostel, perfectly capturing the character. Matthew Broderick is quite good, but he can't match the pure brilliance of Gene Wilder. Few could.The musical departs from the original story more in the second half, but that's not really that bad. The main problem with The Producers is that the songs are painfully generic. A critic once reviewed a musical by saying you entered the theater humming the songs, and so it is with this one; everything sounds very familiar. The best song is easily Brooks Springtime for Hitler, which perhaps works because it is a take off of generic show tunes rather than an actual generic show tune.But the musical numbers are fun, the pace is brisk and the whole thing is more fun than not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Producers" is (for lack of a better word) Interesting. This film is simply either a hit or miss.The story is:An out of work producer Max, (Lane) meets with an accountant Leo,(Brodrick) who learns that from Max's previous play earnings, there is $2,000 unaccounted for. Together, they figure out that they can get more money by producing a flop instead of a hit. They find the worst script, director, and cast and THINK they have got it made. The acting is good, but over the top. All the principals are wonderful here. People have commented on Brodrick's performance. I think he was great. Remember- he played the role on Broadway.This film is very funny. Over the top and has wonderful jokes. The music is OK, but not award winning material. If you are into musicals, this is a hit. If not, I'd skip this film.</fullReview>

Even the most liberal among us have had it up to here with extremists who want, for instance, to ban Christmas in English schools in case it offends Asian terrorists and in that respect this is a gem and illustrates the age-old concept, where do you go to hear the best Jewish jokes, where else but to a Jew and who else but Mel Brooks could concoct a delight such as this good 'old fashioned' entertainment. A movie like this shows just what a joke Moulin Rouge was - that's the Baz Luhrman version not the far superior John Huston film - and reminds us what a joy movies USED TO BE. Okay, I could have done without Uma Thurman whose appeal/talent (if any) has always eluded me but that's really a minor quibble. Okay, the academics and Sight And Sound pseuds aren't going to find much analytical meat on these funny bones but that's their tough luck. For the rest of us, See; Kvel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Producers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Producers is a version of the 1968 film written and directed by Mel Brooks. It was then made into a Broadway musical in 2001 with music and lyrics by Brooks and Thomas Meehan. Now a film has been made of the musical based on the original film. The film is about a Broadway producer named Max Bialystock who meets an anxious accountant named Leo Bloom. Leo tells Max that if he funds a musical worth more than it costs to make and the musical is a flop that he would be able to keep the remaining money. Max thinks this is a great idea and persuades Leo to join him in producing the next big musical flop. Leo agrees and then they are off to find the worst script they can. When they finally find it they get the writer to sign a contract and hire the worst director and actors they can to make the musical a flop. Finally, it comes to opening night and there will be a few surprises in store for Max and Leo. The Producers has good direction, a good adapted script, good comedic performances by the entire cast, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction and good set decoration. While I didn't like this musical version of The Producers as much as the original 1968 film I still enjoyed this musical version. There is still a lot of laughs to be had and there is a lot of energy in the actors that play these characters and there are some new laughs added in some of the songs which I had never heard before having never seen the Broadway play. The film is fun and silly and the cast seems to be having a ball. All actors do a good job of singing and dancing as well. For some silly fun and some good laughs The Producers is a good film to check out during the holidays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film that Does not Bruse nor Abuse its past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few weeks ago, I flipped the CALENDAR pages of the Los Angeles Times and noticed that THE PRODUCERS would once again hit the streets. Having seen the original film (and its current DVD release) and a revived theater presentation at The Pantages in Hollwood in 2003, well...I was not interested to disturb my enjoyment of the past with a potential disappointment.Later (this week) I gave the option to a friend to pick a film for a Wednesday matinée. He would not tell me the film title nor did he know that I had no desire to see THE PRODUCERS.Well, we arrived at the theater. I was disappointed in his selection, yet I would weather the storm. That is what friends do for friends.For the first half hour or less, I was very pessimistic as I parsed this and from what I remembered (or probably forgot). But, soon that antagonism became vapor. I was slowly releasing myself to the fact that I was watching and intimately involved in a fantastic stage production on the screen.I was soon extremely involved, and started clapping after each song or dance. Yes, there were a few of us in this timid Asian community of San Gabriel, CA who broke the rules. We applaud the songs. We could no longer hold back our pleasures and emotions.Yes, this was much like a live and alive stage production.It must be seen on widescreen, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film. Everything that I could have hoped for and more. The cast shines and the direction is very good. It is beautifully made. I will treasure it forever! Lane and Broderick are perfect, as they always have been in these roles. Gary Beach and Roger Bart steal the show, and are so thoroughly entertaining. Will Ferrell is terrific, I would say he is the best Franz I have ever seen. Uma does a very nice job and looks gorgeous. I did miss some of the cut moments, but their absence did not make me like the movie any less. It is just a little different than the stage show. The film was exactly what I hoped it would be, and for that I am so relieved. I had grown concerned that many of the poor reviews would turn out to be correct, or that they would taint my experience. I should not have read them, but I could not help devouring every bit of info I could in the months (and years) leading up to this exceptional movie.As it turns out, I had nothing to worry about. And I really knew that I didn't all along. I constantly reassured myself that Brooks and Stroman knew what they were doing, and that the way they wanted to make the film would be the way that I (and many of the die hards) would appreciate it, whether or not the general public would agree.It sure is great. Pretty much just the way it should be. I guess I get very sentimental for all things Mel Brooks, especially this show. And this movie is no different. It really pleases me to see this material handled so brilliantly. I would have been devastated if they had botched the job.If you look hard enough, you can see me laughing and excitedly applauding in the audience shots during Springtime and Prisoners. How appropriate for me to be immortalized cheering for Mel! It was, and will continue to be, a real thrill to not only thoroughly enjoy the film, but to also see myself up there as a small part of it.Cheers to Matthew, Nathan, Gary, Roger, Will, Uma, and all the rest of the glorious cast. For me, they are, and always will be too good to be true. Yet they are true, and now we have them forever! Hooray!!The Producers is still the love letter to Broadway that it always has been. But now it is also a love letter to the movies, and most importantly to that lovely man, who has meant so much to me..... Mel Brooks.I hope that he is around for another twenty years, at least. I am not ready for the laughs to stop. And I know that I will not be able to hold back the tears.Though, somehow, I have a feeling that he will be around for another 1,920 years (as long as he stays away from fried food, and keeps eating his nectarines, "Half a peach, half a plum...it's a helluva fruit!"). And I am sure he will keep us laughing all the way.Thanks Mel, I love ya!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the Broadway musical that is the basis for this movie and only part of the 1968 movie that is the basis for the play. On its own this is a funny movie with decent music.Leo Bloom (Matthew Broadrick) is an accountant assigned to review the books of Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) a Broadway producer. Boom realizes that with a really bad play, creative accounting could lead a producer to make more money than he would with a smash. He tells this to Bialystock and Max decides he must find the world's worst play, with the worst director and stage it. He persuades Bloom to help him.Max and Leo find "Springtime for Hitler" by Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell) and decide that this is the play that will make them rich. They find a flamboyantly gay director Roger to stage their play. Unfortunately for Max and Leo their audience finds their play very amusing, it makes money and the 2 face prison for trying to cheat their investors.The movie's director Susan Stroman tries to make this movie like attending the stage show. Her actors emote too much, like they are trying to be heard at the back of a play's theater. This is especially true at the beginning of the movie. I know the play was one of Broadway's all-time biggest smashes but she and Mel Brooks should have tried harder to adapt the play for its new environs in the movies.Nathan Lane and Will Ferrel got Golden Globe nominations but I think Broadrick and, especially Uma Thurman, as Swedish bombshell Ula, are the film's funniest characters.The song's are alright. The lyrics are very clever and help advance the story. The music is not that original but, as a comedian originally, Mel Brooks is probably much more comfortable with words than creating music.I like this film pretty much and think it is well-worth seeing; especially if, like me, you never saw the stage play.</fullReview>

He did a good job of playing that weird foreign guy.Roger and Gary have so much chemistry. They were really funny. Susan did a fabulous job directing a choreographing. Just plain amazing!The dances were perfect. I think my favorite scene of all had to be the court scene when Leo came in to defend Max and the two of them sung Till Him. It was so emotional. And Nathan managed to throw in a little comedy by exiting the courtroom and being forced back in by the cop. I cracked up.The movie was great and anyone who doesn't think so obviously doesn't know musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PRODUCERS Written by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan Directed by Susan StromanIt should be noted right off the bat that I spend my life accounting with figures and such and that I have a not-so-secret desire somewhere deep in my soul. Yes, that's right, I wanna be a producer of a big show on Broadway! Well, maybe not Broadway as they are more frequently interested in commerce more so than art (when is that "Apprentice" musical opening??). I also had the chance to catch the Broadway musical earlier this year, albeit not starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick as it was originally cast a few years ago. I saw it and I did not love it. There's nothing terribly exciting about watching an actor put on a bad Nathan Lane impression (or in my case, an understudy putting on an impression of an actor putting on a bad Nathan Lane impression).The film interpretation, directed by choreographer Susan Stroman is very loyal to the stage production and a lot more enjoyable to watch with Broderick and Lane in the leads. Stroman gives a refreshing taste of the classical Hollywood musical, staging some musical numbers on stages themselves (revolutionary!), some on sound stage sets that recreate the streets of New York and others on the actual streets of New York. The result is a lively, energetic film with many hearty laughs at the expense of the absurdity of the theatrical world and Broadway itself.The one thing I did not see was this supposedly perfect chemistry between Broderick and Lane that helped the stage production amass a record setting number of Tony's. As Max Bialystock, a middle-aged Broadway producer slash scam artist, Lane is slimy, quick and crafty. He always has an answer and his timing is on cue at all times. It became obvious to me how vital Lane is to this show as Bialystock highlights his strongest traits, a smooth liar who constantly fumbles but knows how to wiggle himself out every time. This will replace his role as Albert in "The Birdcage" as his signature. On the other hand, I found Broderick to be annoying and difficult to watch at times. To begin with, the character of Leopold Bloom is a pathetic coward, prone to overly dramatic panic attacks if one steals the remaining scrap of his childhood blue blanky. Broderick then takes this character and overdoes every movement, every expression, almost every line. Bloom may be an awkward guy by nature but Broderick himself looks uncomfortable and unsure how to make this character work on screen. As a result, instead of going forward side by side, Lane ends up carrying Broderick along with him. Broderick works much better opposite Uma Thurman as Ulla. Thurman has never looked more like a classical movie star and together they generate some genuine sparks during an enchanting number called "That Face" in which the walls that prevent love from growing between an unobtainable woman and a bumbling, mumbling accountant are broken down with a dance and a kiss. Another addition to the cast, Will Ferrell, continues to enhance his character work with more depth and less Will Ferrell. As Franz Liebkind, the author of the supposedly worst play ever written, "Springtime for Hitler", Ferrell is infallible, maintaining the caricature of a neo-Nazi musical nut job throughout without giving into his own self- indulgence.Caricature is typical Mel Brooks and "The Producers" oozes caricature, from a blond bombshell who can barely speak English to an entire parade of gay theatre folk in costumes as cliché as sailors, leather cops and Indian chiefs. My issues with Broderick aside, Brooks' incapability of seeing characters other than one he could conceivably play (think white, straight, Jewish type) as characters with actual personalities is what ultimately stops "The Producers" from selling. Hysterical laughter one minute, an awkwardly hushed theatre the next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We loved this movie - although we've loved the Broadway musical soundtracks for years! I think Susan Strohman should be commended for bringing us a true "musical" to the screen - thankfully, Chicago opened the door for studios to consider this genre again. But the performances in the Producers were not only faithful to the original Broadway production, they were successfully enhanced for the big screen. This is the first time I can honestly say that I can't pick out a favorite performance, since they were all so wonderful. And the new additions to the Broadway cast held their own with great success - Uma was terrific, and Will Ferrell is hysterical! I could watch Gary Beach and Roger Bart's numbers over and over. And of course, BOTH Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick were exceptional. I knew Matthew Broderick had extensive musical theater experience, but his song and dance numbers in this movie are high points of the film. And Nathan Lane is sensational - Zero would be proud. Go see this movie if you love musicals, comedy and big production numbers - trust me, you'll want to see it again and again. Now, I just wish the DVD was immediately available - I'm hoping "The King of Broadway" number was saved for its release!</fullReview>

We also both understand that musicals are not everyone's cup of tea, but we both feel the guardians who are paid to tell us what to think have missed the boat completely. They appear to be pandering to the homophobic religious right rather than recognizing the genius of Mel Brooks and the boldness of Susan Stroman for directing it her way; rather than conforming to preconceived notions about what elements make a good musical movie. I hope the general public won't be swayed by the charlatan's who claim to be looking out for our best interest. I thought the casting was excellent and all of the performances were credible.

		<fullReview>I saw "The Producers" on Christmas Day with my husband, daughters (19 and 15) and son (17). Imagine a movie that a family with three teenagers can go to, can laugh like crazy and enjoy thoroughly! We are all fans of the original 1968 version and we have looked forward to this for a long time. we were not disappointed at all. The movie was funny, well-paced, and brilliantly acted. It was wonderfully vulgar and tasteless, and from the genius Mel Brooks we expect no less! It became very apparent why Nathan Lane has been nominated for a Golden Globe. His number in the jail is a one man show within the movie. If this were not a year with tons of amazing performances, I am sure Matthew Broderick would have been nominated too. However, as good as they are, I expected them to be that good. The happiest surprise of the evening was Uma Thurman. She was hysterical...sexy, funny (like laugh out loud funny) and an amazing dancer and singer. Please note the ages of my kids...I don't think this is a movie for little ones...maybe stick to 13 and up. In this day and age I would hope that a lot of the off color humor would just go over the heads of younger kids, but kids are aware of just enough to be upset with some of the comments and dialogue. It could lead to some awkward conversations. Better to leave them with the sitter and give them something to look forward to. After all, that is how we teach them to appreciate the finer things in life...by making them wait to see the fun stuff!</fullReview>

I thought the movie was very good and kept me entertained. The music and numbers were great and I do think most people would like it. However, I must admit that leaving "The King of Old Broadway" out of the movie was a big mistake. The line "It's good to be the king" is a Mel Brooks classic and to delete this was a shame. Perhaps the wording in the show was too strong for the movie but I feel that they could have included it anyway. As I said I did not see the show, but I have the album so I know the music.People should see the movie to make up their own minds. So go and enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the trajectory of the genesis of this movie is truly a lot of work, but it is interesting. In the film, we are treated to a close up of how absurdity and dementia can go along way when one of the main leads is Nathan Lane, who is absolutely hilarious and can do no wrong. There are a couple of times in the film when Roger Bart and his companion (the director and common in law assistant) nearly do that, but Lane is a force of nature, and one could only wish Mel Brooks had hit three home runs in a row and gotten himself a much better crew to work with. Mercifully, he kept Lane and hired the amazing Uma Thurman who fits in like Cinderella's slipper.It is always difficult to transition from one medium to another, and it is done successfully in very few occasions. "Marty" went from TV to the movies and captured every award in the world along the way, and several musicals have been beautifully adapted to tremendous success. The big question is whether "The Producers" can succeed in his third reincarnation. I had the pleasure of seeing the original and thought it was a good funny film, the play was amazing (saw Jason Alexander and Martin Short in the traveling company), but I was a bit disheartened by the overall effect of this film. There are some elements to praise; sadly the overall average is not in the positive range.Loved the fact that a lot from the play remains, in fact some scenes should have never been changed and are kept to hilarious effect. Some were opened up and crashed and burned. There are times when there seems to be not much going and unbelievably, I felt like falling asleep. Brooks always tended to his material with plenty of care, and he must have been under a lot of pressure from the studios to plug in a certain actor who is known for his one dimensional portrayals with mediocre results.Have to admit that I wasn't too impressed with by Broderick. I thought he was trying too hard and kept wondering what it would have been like to see the amazing Martin Short loose on the screen. I loved seeing the cameo by Andrea Martin, the irresistible Uma Thurman, and the superb Nathan Lane.Maybe there will another reincarnation, and we will have the pleasure to see a true musical genius in charge of this amazing material. It is enough for an enjoyable evening. It is just that one was hoping it would have been a superlative occasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cringe-worthy Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe that people are calling this genius. This is the most cringe worthy remake I've ever seen. Both Lane and Broderick are trying to imitate the original film actors (Mostel and Wilder, respectively) and do a lousy job of it. Of course, how could anyone match their genius? Had they tried to do the parts their own way, this movie might have had a chance, but instead, they took the easy (and bad) way out. And while Broderick could have been wonderful had he done his own wimpy geek character, I'm not sure Lane could have pulled it off at all. He doesn't know how to do sneaky while being overbearing, which is essential to this part. He's a bit too blustery and nerdy for this part altogether.If you get a chance to see the original film, you'll never want to see this one again - and that's a promise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For anyone who loves A LOT of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To quote one of the reviews for Bialystock and Blooms 'Springtime For Hitler' in the film 'The Producers', "It was shocking, outrageous, insulting...and I loved every minute of it". I guess a similar thing can be sad about this film. It was stagy, over-the-top, corny, cheesy, predictable...and I, too, loved every minute of it.Critics have been, well, divided on this film. And, to a point, I understand why. It's not exactly an Oscar-worthy film like Chicago was. It doesn't have the film innovations Chicago did. It is very over-the-top, very in-your-face and very loud. There isn't an ounce of subtlety in this film but I can't imagine this film BEING subtle. The characters are painted larger than life in the script so why should they be anything less on the screen? Critics are critics because they look for the "art" in film-making. They prefer films with a dark social conscience, films that are more like essays in the human psyche. Films like "Fight Club", "Brokeback Mountain" etc. They're looking for the film equivalents of a Van Gogh or a Picasso. If 2005's 'The Producers' were a painter it would probably be the type of painter who paints your portrait on the street for $20. It's not deep and meaningful, like a Van Gogh or a Picasso, but it serves a purpose. It ENTERTAINS which is the whole purpose behind a musical.Having seen the 1968 version with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, I do have a point of comparison and I must say that this film comes out on top. Maybe that's the Broadway bias in me but there you go. While few can match Zero and Gene for their performances Nathan Lane does come extremely close and Matthew? Welllll....Although I had my doubts both Uma Thurman and Will Ferrel were terrific in this film. Will I believe was perfect for the role of Franz Liebkind (sorry Brad Oscar). I knew from the moment they announced the movie that he was born to play this role having seen him in action many times before. Uma was a pleasant surprise though. After suffering the disappointment of not having Nicole Kidman play Ulla (perhaps another bit of bias from me wanting an Aussie in there), I was sceptical. I didn't know whether Uma could fill the boots of Cady Huffman who originated the role on Broadway. And, after hearing a sample of the song "When You Got If, Flaunt It" sung about 5 notes lower than Cady's version I must admit, I groaned. However, she was wonderful, had a lovely tone to her singing voice and had the character perfect.However, the real starts of the show, in my opinion, were Gary Beach and Roger Bart as Roger De Bris and Carmen Ghia, respectively. The one-liners from these two were delivered brilliantly and the small idiosyncrasies that they had were dealt with brilliantly. They stole the show, in my opinion.The film version, while essentially a carbon copy of the stage version (and, let's face it, nothing beats live theatre) is far more superior in the scoring. The songs have more musical depth to them and sound less disjointed than in the Broadway Cast Recording. They've also been extended in some parts and some songs have been seamlessly blended in with others. Mel Brook's score has often been criticised as being mediocre but I feel that it is brilliant because it brings us back to the grand old days of Broadway and the simple, hummable, show tune. Except in 'The Producers' there's more than just one great tune in here, there's 15.The direction lacks any innovativeness true but I wouldn't say, like a lot of critics, that the camera was "bolted to the floor". Susan Stroman wants us to be able to see the full bodies of the dancers and the entire set in all it's glory. And why not? What I loved most about this film was the comic timing which, I think, Stroman had a lot to do with. It was so much like the stage version that, at times, there was even that pause that actors give after they've delivered a joke as they wait for the audience to stop laughing before they say the next line. I couldn't help but notice, and love, that.This movie does have it's faults, let's not disguise that. When I said before that I loved EVERY minute of it, well....I lied. I loved all but the first 40 minutes of it which I felt were rather lukewarm. It seems like a while before it gets moving. I'd heard that the first 40 minutes, essentially the first scene in Max's office, were slow so I braced myself but they didn't turn out to be too bad. However once "I Want To Be A Producer" came on, I was hooked. The other gripe that I had with this film was in Matthew Broderick. While he wasn't as bad as he has been made out to be, he was, for my mind, the weakest actor. While his portrayal of Leo Bloom was, at times, charming and witty, it was, just as many times, annoying and whiny.I don't like to make comparisons with other films (esp. ones that suck) but I'm going to have to say that 'The Producers' will be this years 'The Phantom Of The Opera'. The camp, cheesy musical that may end up getting a handful of Oscar nominations but only in the lesser categories. Most likely for Best Song ("There's Nothing Like A Show On Broadway" which I think is the favourite for the gong.) But anyone who had this ear-marked for the Big One were kidding themselves anyway. It's a farcical, enjoyable, witty, hilarious film musical that is among the most entertaining films I've ever seen. Hardly Oscar-material eh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where did we go right?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Producers, the 1968 version, is perhaps my favorite movie, at least comedy, of all time. It's a close call between Mel Brooks' loving salute to his favorite Nazi and Dr. Strangelove for the top of my comedy leader board. I never saw the Broadway production of The Producers, written by Brooks, except for the few scenes shown in a classic Curb Your Enthusiasm episode last year, so when I walked into the theater to see the movie version of the Broadway musical, I was going in with a clean slate, as far as the singing and dancing was concerned. As far as the story goes, I basically have the entire movie memorized. From the throw-away lines first uttered by Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, to the ultimate result of Springtime For Hitler, I knew what was coming, and I knew it would be funny. So I concentrated a lot on how well the song and dance numbers supported the story I loved so much. For the most part, the singing and dancing was just fine. The most impressive of the 8 or so song numbers that made it to the movie shows an office filled with unhappy public accountants, and Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) telling us the viewer why he wants to become a Broadway producer. He is wooed into the business by Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane), who was once king of Broadway, but now has fallen on tough times, where he shows are so bad, the theater has installed a sign that goes from "Opening Night" to "Closing Night" before the end of the first act. While going over Bialystock's financial records, he discovers a play that flops could make more money than a play that does well, sending the two on a quest to produce a sure-fire flop. This leads them to Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell), a former Nazi who wrote a loving salute to Hitler. The producers also consult the man regarded as the worst director on Broadway, Roger De Bris (Gary Beach) and his common-law assistant, Carmen Ghia (Roger Bart), who may have been together for too long. Their appearance, though, brings on perhaps the funniest song of the movie, "Keep It Gay," where you have to hear it to believe it. Bialystock and Bloom also hire Ulla (Uma Thurman) as their secretary, even though she speaks very little English, but her Swedish assets woo her bosses into giving her a job. The songs are good, though do add to the overall length of the movie. If you are a musical fan, you'll love the fact they kept most of the songs from the play in the movie, but others may feel it slows the movie down a bit. The ending could have been shorten a bit too, it just felt like everyone has having such a great time that they kept adding to the final scenes, just to make sure it never ends. The movie plot is almost scene-for-scene the same as the original movie, though one main character (Dick Shawn's off-the-way funny LSD) does not make it into this new version, possibly because no one would ever be able to match Shawn's performance for the original. Fans of the original movie will appreciate this version overall, but may quibble with the performances of Land and Broderick. I didn't like the whiny, feeble version of Bloom in this movie, and Lane's Bialystock is fine, but not Mostel, as we knew it could never be. One problem? Nathan Lane has too much hair. His comb-over looks reasonable. The musical numbers look like they are right out of Broadway, they look wonderful and sound wonderful too. And here's the most important part: Mel Brooks did not mess up his original genius. Now, if only he could get Mostel and Wilder to sing again, we may have something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Producers - The story of a down on his luck producer (Nathan Lane) and his accountant (Matthew Broderick) and their get rich quick plan to reep the benifits of a terrible show. Thankfully, this movie makes use of it's forum, something that Rent really neglected to do, and director Susan Stroman does more with the script and songs than just a faithful re-telling of the musical, like Chris Columbus did.Lane and Broderick work well together (and they should after all the time spent doing the show on Broadway) and are very funny. Uma Therman is very sexy, very tall, and does well with what little she's given to do. Will Ferrel is very funny and he finally has a musical outlet to show his theater talents (I loved his rendition of "Afternoon Delight" back in Anchorman). He should do more of this and fewer "Bewitched"s and "Kicking and Screaming"s, for all our sakes, seriously. Gary Beach and Roger De Bries are also very funny.On a side-note, has Uwe Boll seen the original of this movie? Cause I swear the premise is what his career has consisted of, German ties aside.The humor and gag routines are all very tougue and cheek. There are those that don't go for this sort of thing, but most of them also don't enjoy musicals. For the rest of the world, this is a treat. Some negative note are one or two flat moments and a few minor pacing problems. Enough chit-chat, go see it! This gets a B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop comparing it to the original!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do I keep reading so many reviews where critics are comparing Lane and Broderick to Mostel and Wilder? This is a film version of the Broadway PLAY, and who better to perform the roles than the actors who originated them? These are two different animals here. Besides, a vital component of playing a CHARACTER is bringing your own interpretation and personality to the role. They are not playing Mostel/Wilder, they are playing Bialystock/Bloom. Lane won a Tony for the role and Broderick was nominated. There didn't seem to be such a mass "comparison" going on in 2001, why should there be one now? And don't get me wrong, I love Mostel and Wilder - but I also know that comparing is not what we should be critiquing. What we SHOULD be critiquing is the actual film-making - the missed opportunity to really utilize what we've learned in technique over the past 50 years. Stroman is no filmmaker - it was a mistake to have her direct. Musicals are one of the most challenging works to transfer to film, but once in while someone figures it out! (ie Chicago, Fiddler, Music Man, etc.) Why didn't they use that know-how here! In the past decade we've seen the movie musical struggling to make a comeback, and it has succeeded to win over a new generation of musical theatre fans. I just hope the antiquated and amateurish film-making doesn't turn them away. By the way, The Producers is my favorite show of all time and of course I loved it regardless of the problems :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was terrible, it started seeming to be funny and witty, much like the original. However as the film progressed the aamounts of songs in the film progressed from about one every 5 minutes to one every single line. Now although people will argue that this is a musical and that is what should be expected this was just to much and became very annoying. Therefore i had to find a way to entertain myself and the exit seemed the only option.Only watch this film if you are made to or love hundreds of rubbish songs sung at flat notes (especially by Uma Therman). I fyou feel you really must watch this tripe then all i can say is rent it out of blockbuster where you can just turn it off and go to bed.Terrible stuff DO NOT WATCH although i must say one positive and humorous factor about the movie was that of Will Ferrel who played the nazi amazingly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>should have stayed on Broadway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max Bialystock is a failed producer, with his current production 'Funny Boy', a musical version of Hamelt is a complete failure on the opening night. While his accountant Leo Bloom is looking over Max's books, he realises that a Broadway producer can make more money from a failure than a hit production. With their plan set, they set out to make the worst show ever; Springtime for Hitler. The scripts writer Franz Liebkind, a Neo-Nazi still faithful to Hitler's conquest. The leading lady, Switz beauty Ulla, topping off with overly gay director Roger De Bris. Getting this show off the ground, Maz swoons every old lady imaginable for funding; which they plan to take. Leo falls for the Switz bomb shell Ulla, while trying to overcome his constant panic attacks and unable to detach himself from his blue blanket which he carries around. With everything set, Max and Leo prepare themselves for the unimaginable back lash their hoping.Going from Mel Brookes original version of The Producers, than to a Broadway production, now back to film, The Producers is a highly energetic musical which sees Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprises their original roles from the Broadway production. This does a have that distinctive satire of Mel Brookes, pulling every time of stereotype and cliché, yet twisting them around, giving them a new flavour. Only Mel Brookes could have the guts, and get away clean for poking fun at Adolf Hitler.Stealing the show in every scene, Nathan Lane relishes in his role as the sleazy Max Bialystock. This role is perfectly suited to him, and he just takes every bit of the role making it his own. His acting though is perfectly match by his singing, with a flawless effort. Uma Thurman is great as the sexy Sweadish actress Ulla. While her accent at times did seem contrived, she pulls it off. The big knockout is Will Ferrell. It's amazing how good he can sing, and he can sing. He perfectly hits all the eccentric idiosyncratic of Franz. While I haven't been a fan of Matthew Broderick, once again not won over by him. This is one of the better roles he's acted, yet the weakest links in the acting.The downfall of The Producers is that it hasn't survived the transformation from Broadway to the screen. While the Broadway version is based upon the original film, this one leans towards the Broadway version. It feels that it is still stuck there on Broadway, not feeling like a film. There they have also indulged in every whim, taking it to the n'th degree on the production value. The Producers also needs editing. They have crammed in as many songs possible, while many could have been removed and increased the pacing. When the punch line finally arrives, Springtime for Hitler, everything before it seemed superfluous to the sheer hilarity of the show, yet instead of ending on the hard punch it delivers, it wears its welcome by an overly drawn out ending.The Producers is a guilty pleasure, yet it could have been a brilliant comedy satire, but comes out as an over blown musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Producers yesterday and I loved it! It was so funny, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick were great in it, and so was Will Farrell. There was one person I didn't expect to see in it was Roger Bart as Carmen Ghia. I had no idea that the guy playing Carmen Ghia was George the crazy pharmacist on Desprate housewives, and I watch it every week! He had his hair slicked back and he looked completely different. My favorite sense was the "Keep it Gay" song it was extremely funny!! I don't go to the movies often and when I do I like to see a good movie and The Producers definitely fits the bill!

		<fullReview>I went into this with all the warning; no King of Broadway, Uma doesn't sing well, etc. etc. So I was expecting a big disappointment. Which, when you're expecting it, doesn't usually happen - and it didn't.Most of the complaints I've read so far I can't agree with. Lane and Broderick, while rehashing their roles with often stagey presence, do the job perfectly. Broderick floored me - I expected it from Lane. Every time Broderick did something, one of his quirks, whatever - great. Stagey, yes. Works in this movie.Ulla dance good. Uma looks better than Cady, but doesn't sing as well. BUT - she did NOT sing badly. All her pitches were on, and though she used some "poppy" stuff to get there, it all sounded just fine. And who are we to say Ulla is a great singer? She is hired for a purposeful flop, after all... I thought she was great. Standing ovation.Ferrell ate it up, and the ballad was HYSTERICAL. He did the part justice, nothing special. Just very good. Beach and Bart; naturally amazing. Ghia's "sssssss" gets me every time (everytime being the 2 times I've now seen it).The only problem with the movie is Stroman. Nothing but a medium length shot for the whole movie. But it didn't distract me enough from the film for me to care that much about it - I wanted to see the stage version, and that's pretty much what I got. Upset that they cut some of "Springtime," but whatever.One of the most enjoyable movie experiences this year - up somewhere in the top 5.NOTICE PEOPLE - they didn't try to work the lyrics of the cut songs into the script. NEVER try to do this, it will never work, and automatically sink any prospect of goodness.My love for Mel Brooks was enhanced by the film. Man's a genius. Now lets work getting Blazing Saddles on stage...A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tasteless, Crass and HILARIOUS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand the NY Times film critic gave The Producers a largely negative review, calling it "tasteless and crass." Well, duh! What does he expect from the man who gave the world bean-eating, flatulent cowboys - Ibsen and Strindberg? Of course, it's crass, but that's all part of the fun of it. I was lucky enough to see Lane and Broderick in the Broadway production and we can all be thankful that their brilliant performances have been captured on film for all eternity. I've read complaints that they are too big for the screen and seem to be playing to the second balcony, but when parts are written so broadly, it would be wrong to try to be subtle. The bigger the better, I say! Also, it was a great decision by Susan Strohman to film the dances so that we actually get to see the dancing. Strohman, Broderick and Thurman pay tribute to Astair &amp; Rodgers with their wonderful dance to "That Face" where the camera films their entire bodies without a lot of quick edits (think Rob Marshall's "Chicago"). It looks from the credits that Andrea Martin and Debra Monk had their scenes cut out. That's unfortunate, but hopefully they'll be in the DVD. Thank you, Mel Brooks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I will say I love musicals and I love comedies, this movie is barely above average in either category. It is funny solely because it is such a bad movie that you can't help but laugh. I sat through the first half hour of this movie sad that I parted with money to watch it, but then Will Ferrell's character's appearance changed my mind. At that point, the movie had finally sunk *so* low and was *so* bad that it became a different type of comedy for me -- the type of comedy that 'Howard the Duck' is. I could finally appreciate it, but it was all laughing AT the movie. As the music goes, it is by no means Phantom or Chicago by means of talent or general musical quality. And on top of that, there is no variety in style. It's all the same, for two hours. So it is a funny movie, but I can't really say that anybody on earth should be able to appreciate it for any reason other than how bad it is. Buy some Coke to wash the bad taste out of your mouth every couple minutes. Get it supersized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1968 movie is one of my all time favourites, Mel Brooks is one of my all time favourites but this latest incarnation is not.A hashed up Broadway spectacle full of pointless roles and character extensions to allow stars like Thurman and Ferrell pointlessly ham it up.The exclusion of LSD from the whole movie is without doubt a strange decision and even more so having Roger DeBris play Hitler detracts.Uma Thurman, as lovely to look at as she is, doesn't actually do anything. Will Ferrell is just dull as Liebkind. Broderick pulls off a cheap Broderick impersonation but the saving grace of Nathan Lane, who adds to the essence of the movie, is delightful.The courtroom scene is without doubt the most pointless scene in the movie, it drags out and its unnecessary as much are the scenes in Rio and the Broderick/Thurman sofa dance.Lanes' jail scene performance is a shining light in an otherwise dumbed down version of a 68 classic.Winter for Hitler and Germany.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to watch this film at the VUE (where I believe they held the UK premiere) a mere couple days after the film was launched, and was first surprised to see hardly any people sitting at the cinema but after watching the first fifteen or so minutes of it I decided that the unorthodoxly undersized crowd of audiences served the film about right. Monumentally Cheesy is a rather underestimating description of it, let alone tacky. Did I mention cheese? It was so much so that it almost got to the point of being unbearable, and the whole experience of sitting and watching it seemed as if the film lasted twice as long as its actual length. The characters were but irritating and I failed to see humour in any of the cracks. The camera angles throughout were notably peculiar, showing close-ups of the characters' faces unnecessarily and in an excess. And what's with the annoying mechanical pigeons? I took along my baby sister who adores the theatre production of The Producers, and after having to watch the film she remarked how it might put people off from going to see the theatre production. I myself haven't watched the theatre production of The Producers but now that I have seen this appalling film I do not dream of going to watch the live version of it.</fullReview>

And maybe my reaction was, in part a let down from loving the original as much as I did.

		<fullReview>It is a very difficult task to make me laugh out loud -- this film did it, several times.Is it perfect? Nope -- but what is? It hurts me to say this, but the biggest disappointment for me was Matthew Broderick's acting. When he was singing, dancing, or hysterical he was great, but the spoken moments that should have made us like Leo fell flat for me. It's like he never found a film version of his stage Leo.I am a big fan of the original film, and I liked the choices of what was left out or changed to make it a musical. Expanding the role of Roger Debris was especially effective. Will Ferrell is hysterical, Uma Thurman is funny and likable as well as being the Official Sexpot, the pigeons are a riot (I did miss the "concierge," though). And Nathan Lane manages to include lots of homage to Zero as well as making Max his own.There are wonderful musical parody moments in this film, touching on everything from Fred and Ginger to Jerry Herman to Judy Garland to every-show-that-has-a-spotlighted-soliloquy-number to Chicago. Watch carefully - some are surprisingly subtle. Yeah, you read that right -- Mel Brooks, subtle!Watch for visual jokes in the background -- the sets and costumes are part of the fun here. And there are a few fun "hey, look who that is!" cameos.The friend with whom I went to see it was looking for a tribute to Anne Bancroft in the credits. I told her that the tribute was the casting of Uma as Ulla! Speaking of the credits, stay until the end of them -- trust me! They contain some of the funniest things in the film, especially if, like me, you gag at some of the theme songs written (gotta try for that Oscar nomination!) for movies.Go, laugh -- you won't be in pain, you won't be wet, but you may be hysterical!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look we are dealing with three different entities on the same theme. They all were good and they all should be viewed in their own context. If there had been no basis of prior comparison I think the critics would have gone nuts over this film, because it really is a lot of fun and is filmed very well. All the actors give a lot of energy to their parts; in particular Nathan Lane, Will Ferrel and Gary Beach and Roger Bart. This is not your Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.Who else but Mel Brooks would write music with lines like "weve seen sh*t but never like this". If you don't come out with a big smile on your face and a very satisfied feeling it's time for some anti-depressants and a little therapy. As for the critics, well every so often they blow the call en-mass, and they really did here. I saw the film at the Ziegfield in NYC in it's limited release, and the audience was applauding after many of the musical numbers and at the end. You just done see people applauding very much at the cinema these days. GO, you won't regret it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the raunchiest movies I have ever seen and I am by no means a prude. In fact, I am quite liberal. How this got a PG-13 rating escapes me. It should have been a hard R. Every time I was shocked and horrified at something in the movie and thought I had seen the worst of it, Mel Brooks stooped to something even lower and more shockingly raunchy. Fortunately, we walked out before Nathan Lane started singing about "schtuping" every old lady in New York. Don't, I repeat, don't take children under 16 to see this movie. In fact, don't take children of any age. You will be too mortified to sit through it with them. Several other families walked out as well. The only consolation is that I saw this on film for $7 a head instead of on Broadway for a hundred a head. Terrible, terrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this with no expectations, without even knowing what sort of film it was. I went with my theatrical other half, so i believe this is a fair opinion from both of us.We almost left half way through. It was un-funny, packed with awful one-liners, pointlessly musical, repetitive. I've never seen so many people leave early - at least 25 of the audience left after half an hour, and after that in ones and twos until the end. Really would rather shove needles up my nailbeds than watch this again.The person behind fell asleep and snored for the last 30 mins, occasionally woken by his other half.The film has been mentioned on National radio in the UK too, described as being awful there too. I've yet to hear a good review from anyone but the critics TBH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Producers in London last year with Nathan Lane, and it was hysterical. Inspired, even. And the British actor who did Bloom had us rolling in the aisles, too. But what on earth happened when this became a movie? The movie is lifeless, uninspired, and just dreadful, as if there weren't enough money in the budget to do good sets and costumes. And Matthew Brodrick! What a bloated toad he's become, and he can neither act nor sing nor dance. Nathan Lane had a few of his good stage reactions, but they are still "staage" reactions. They worked on the stage. On the screen, they look contrived and unconvincing. And the Springtime for Hitler number was bargain basement. The audience in the theater was for the most part silent throughout. You can tell they had expected something more, something funny. Will Farrell, whom I usually can't stand, did a respectable job as the crazy Nazi writer. But the mechanical pigeons he raises were the same silly props used on the stage. Didn't the director know we don't want to see the stage show just filmed? Listen: If you are determined to see The Producers, fight down the urge. You will have wasted your money. There's nothing here that is clever or stunning. A big brown disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a musical film fan that has never seen the original play, I entered this movie with no hopes or expectations. But as the opening scene began, I found myself shaking my head in dismay at the atrocity I was witnessing. From "Opening Night" to "Prisoners of Love," Director Stroman communicates to her audience one important message?she has no idea what she's doing.From what I understand, she is an excellent stage director and I applaud her for her Tony Award-Winning work. But her theater staging and choreography are painful and sloppy to watch on screen. It's as if she just pointed the camera at the actors and told each of them to do their usual stage routine for the film. The result is a canned, careless combination of camp and worn-out wit.Mel Brooks' songs are a joyful delight (I own the soundtrack and listen to it on a regular basis), but even his catchy tunes can't make this poorly directed romp worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since the likes of The Stupids and Dumb and Dumber have I disliked a movie so much. I absolutely hated it from the first frame to the last. I hope never to be reminded of it, again.As much as I enjoy watching both Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, and Mel Brooks movies, I can say, without reservation, that they have committed a travesty against the movie going public with this total disaster of a movie.The irony is that the movie is about making an abysmally bad play. Well, they succeeded in making a BAD movie about making a BAD play.The acting was too animated, too campy, and just plain too stupid to enjoy. They utterly failed at getting me to like even one person who had the misfortune to appear in it.I was shocked at how quickly my instincts kicked in to flee from the theater. But, I forced myself to watch it in its entirety, anyway. In fact, I'm usually rather ambivalent about the ratings of movies on IMDb; but, to see this movie get a rating of 7.2 when it should have been thrown in the trash and forgotten was too much for me to bear. I just HAVE to warn others NOT to spend their money or their time (it's not worth watching, even if they paid YOU $8.75 to see it). I would be more entertained by doing my taxes.Please, Matthew, Nathan don't ever do anything like this ever, again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent screen treatment of the Broadway musical hit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been anticipating this film for months. And I was not disappointed. I enjoyed the original 1968 film version, but always thought it a somewhat low-budget production lacking in polish. It's obvious Mel Brooks has used the intervening 37 years well, as this new production has all the polish and sizzle anyone could want. The pacing and comedic bits have been tightened up and perfected as can only be accomplished after thousands of performances before a live audience. The new PRODUCERS is essentially a filmed version of the hit Broadway play. Compared to the original film, it has many more musical numbers (all written by Mr. Brooks) making it a true musical. Most of the songs are not particularly memorable, but the zest with which they are performed is something to behold. I smiled throughout the film -- something I can never recall before. The film very much has the feel of a lavish Broadway production. The sets, the timing, and even the acting style are more stage-like than film-like. Which is a good thing, because it retains the charm and spontaneity of the Broadway musical it's based on. To appreciate this film fully, you need to see it with an audience. Then it will come alive!If you sit through the credits, you'll be rewarded with a short curtain-call, including a cameo by Mel Brooks. Mt recommendation: If you like musicals, you'll love THE PRODUCERS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining version of the Broadway musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a screening of the completed film last Tuesday in NY. It is an excellent transfer of the stage musical. Fans of the original will be pleased. The producers of "The Producers" were smart to immortalize the charismatic performances of Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick on film. So often the stage stars of musicals have been replaced by film stars (i.e. Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady," Lucille Ball in "Mame"). The supporting cast is mostly intact too (Gary Beach, Roger Bart). The film star replacements are wonderful (Will Farrell, Uma Thurman) and, hopefully, will bring in a young audience. The musical numbers are presented pretty much the way they are on stage. The location of New York City is used to great effect in the Along Came Bialy number (with the Little Old Ladies dancing with walkers), as well as couple of others. One major song has been cut. It is probably one of the best songs in the show (King of Broadway). On the CD of the film soundtrack, the King of Broadway is at the end as a bonus track. The producer Jonathan Sanger said that the number was cut for length and any information imparted by the song is related in the next scene(s). He said the song will be on the DVD as a deleted scene. Later on a Director's cut will be released and cut songs will probably be inserted into the body of the film. I said, double dipping! He replied, absolutely. Anyway the film harks back to the classic musicals of the 50's. No fast cutting as in Moulin Rouge or Chicago. Sanger noted that Susan Stroman, the director, went back and viewed many of those classic musicals (i.e. Singin' in the Rain) and used them as inspiration. Inspired is the word for "The Producers", over 2 hours fly by. At the end you'll have a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a member of the theatre community or a lover of Brooks, the original movie or the musical adaptation, don't worry! I am too and I went in with high expectations and was not disappointed in the least! I think a lot of critics' problem (and a common problem with remakes or film adaptations in general) is that they are viewing this movie in comparison with the other existing versions instead of a completely separate entity. If you are a fan of the past versions like myself don't worry, pretty much all of your favorite moments from the musical or 1968 movie are still there displayed in a fresh, yet dedicatory fashion (and if they're not they will be in the extended DVD edition). However don't (and you can't) expect Gene Wilder or Zero Mostel or a mere filming of the Broadway show. This is a new movie. However it's a new movie that respectfully pays homage to its previous productions and more importantly to "old school" Broadway and Hollywood. I agree with other comments that this is a movie reminiscent of classics like "Singing in the Rain," and highly deserving of your money and time! And if you are a virgin to "The Producers" be forewarned this is a movie and i quote "that will offend people of all races and religions." In other words if you can't laugh at Hitler yet or are under the age of 12 you may not want to see this. However, everyone else- go out there and see it! And for Der Furor's sake STAY TIL THE END!</fullReview>

I have waited for this film to come to Charlotte and it was worth the wait. Nathan Lane was at his best, and filled the shoes of Zero Mostel who originated the role. I was surprised at the versatility of Matthew Broderick, who has a nice voice and looked pretty good dancing with all those beautiful woman dancers. Uma Thurman was beautiful in her role, and was very striking. Overall I would say run to the opening of this funny movie as it is worth the price of a ticket no matter the price.

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see this show on Broadway (before it created a huge buzz) with the original cast members, and I can say that this movie was just as great. Obviously a live performance is preferable, but for a movie adaptation of a musical adaptation of a movie, ya can't get any better! The music was identical, the sets were dead-on, the actors just as hysterical, the jokes were still wonderfully raunchy, and the singing abilities of Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman were surprisingly good. This movie is great for those who can't always make it down to Broadway, and hopefully this movie will start a trend for Broadway hits to make a silver screen debut this way wonderful shows can reach more of the public, as well as eventually go on DVD so you can re-watch your favorite scene in more than just your mind's eye.</fullReview>

It's like watching the Broadway show, only on film. I loved the quirkiness, the songs, the dances, the slapstick humor, the dazzling costumes, and the endless energy. I felt exhausted just watching it! It's truly a classic movie-musical that, while not perfect, certainly deserves more praise than it's getting. I highly recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noble attempt for a first-time filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third incarnation of the story of The Producers, where two producers attempt to put a giant flop on Broadway then take all the money and run away, and this one is the one that works least well. That doesn't mean it's bad, it's like saying that someone is the dumbest of the Nobel Prize winning Physicists. The story is VERY good, and a great set up for some incredibly entertaining characters and situations. This version is based on the multi-award-winning Broadway musical, which was based on the original movie starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. Replacing them in the roles of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom are Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, who are reprising their roles on stage. Also in the cast are Uma Thurman as Ulla, Will Ferrell as Nazi playwright Franz Lebkind, and Gary Beach and Roger Bart as "common-law partners" Rodger DeBris and Carmen Ghia. There are also several cameos peppering the movie, including Deborah Monk, Andrea Martin, John Lovitz, Michael McKean, Thomas Meehan, and even Mel Brooks. All the performances are very good overall, despite some snags here and there. Thurman seems to pop in and out of accent and Broderick takes some time to warm up to what turns out to be his best performance since "Ferris Buller's Day Off". The standout performance was Roger Bart, who is having a banner year now that he has finished his role of the insane pharmacist on TV's Desperate Housewives. Bart easily steals every scene that he's in, which is no small feat considering the list of talent in this film. Lane, as usual, proves that he is a dynamo of energy that, fortunately, can be guided and utilized to produce amazing things. He easily carries this film.The entire look of the film is very stylized. And that stylization is, unfortunately, very stagey. This is director Susan Strohman's first film, and it shows that up until now she has worked exclusively in theatre. Much of the movie lacks interesting camera work--the characters are in the center, framed nicely, while they perform their play. There is also a good deal of talking directly to the camera. This is certainly not the first movie that has done this. It's not even the first time that Matthew Broderick has done this (see "Ferris Buller's Day Off"). At first it is a little distracting, but Strohman is smart in that she realizes that this is the style of the piece, and she sticks to it throughout the entire film. Indeed, the first and last people we see are talking directly to the camera (Stick around after the credits, by the way). The way that the film is staged also makes it seem stagey. There are many jokes and bits of scenery moving that are more fitting for a stage than a screen. I don't mean to make this sound like a bad thing, after all, who says that movies must follow such strict guidelines? I enjoyed the film greatly, and there were many things about it that I think other directors could learn from (especially directors of movie-musicals). The main thing that this movie achieves over other musicals, "Chicago" or "Rent" for example, is that Strohman allows us to watch the performers perform the musical numbers. They're NOT over-edited like the other two musicals I mentioned. It was a remembrance of the golden days of movie musicals where shots lasted forever, and we actually got to see the actors dance. Make no mistake about it, Strohman is an AMAZING choreographer. The numbers "I Wanna Be A Producer" and "That Face" show that she really does rank up there with the great choreographers of movie and Broadway history.Many people ask why film this version? It's not as good as the original, and it works better on stage than on film. The answer seems to be that a $10 movie ticket is cheaper than a $100 theatre ticket, and now a wider audience gets to see the great performances. And they should. Despite the movie's flaws, it is incredibly funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love musicals, and this one does not disappoint.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am chalking up some recent movie musicals (and never enough, as I note in my other reviews), including "Chicago", "Moulin Rouge" and "Phantom of the Opera". I have also seen some newer dance movies including "Shall We Dance" and "Take the Lead". Some of these I have not yet reviewed, but give me time, LOL.Don't pay attention to the detractors of musicals. Some hate musicals, and they don't know what they are missing. They are not 'educated', meaning that their background is to boo-hiss all singing-dancing spectaculars as wastes of their precious boring time. They would rather watch baseball, snoozing after seven minutes of 'batter-up'.I had seen parts of this movie on TV recently; snippets here and there and it looked really interesting. I kept thinking about 'Guten Tag Hop Clop' and that insanely zany Will Farrell. I used to watch him a lot on Saturday Night Live, and I remember his outlandishly funny characters.Ahem! All this trash talk that says people should be embarrassed about the Hitler references. Sure, that would be politically correct, but: People, get a life!Earth to whoever's listening: Mel Brooks is Jewish. If he can produce satires, spoofs, songs and dances about Hitler, everybody else should just join in and get over 70+ years of villain-bashing, LOL. Yes, lots of people have Holocaust ancestors and friends, and no, I am sure Mel Brooks is not saying Hitler was Mr. Clean by any measurement. I am studying for a B.A. in History, and I guarantee you Herr Hitler was right up there with all of the major baddies/devils in our memory.Don't forget that the devil himself is spoofed on "South Park". In this way, and Mel Brooks can remind us, we can laugh at the psychological shortcomings and unhappy childhoods of all the wannabe contenders for Public Enemy Number One. I guess next will be a spoof/satire of Saddam Hussein, but guess what? "South Park" has already done that, too!! I finally saw the entirety of "The Producers", and even 'Hop Clop' for the umpteenth time. Did I mention that the rooftop scene of Franz Liebken with his loved (and named) pet pigeons reminded me of a similar scene with Marlon Brando in the movie "On the Waterfront"?? Don't forget that the beloved "Sound of Music" was about Hitler and his minions, yet people still revere and love the singing and dancing in that movie. There was even a singing and dancing blond young man (later a Hitler soldier), who was Liesl Von Trapp's boyfriend in 'Sixteen Going on Seventeen'.13/10 for "The Producers". Condolences to Mel Brooks on the passing of his wife, Anne Bancroft.Mel has made us wholeheartedly laugh for several decades, and we are the better for it. Thank you Mel, and I loved your cameo.P.S. The walker-ladies' dance was totally absurd and hilarious, and perfectly choreographed. Kudos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Broadway! I haven't been so happy since we crushed Poland!" - Franz Liebkind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2001 Mel Brooks stunned Broadway with his incredible musical adaptation of his beloved 60's film 'The Producers'. In my mind, 'The Producers' was one of the best shows ever to see Broadway, and in my opinion the Broadway musical was far superior than the Gene Wilder / Zero Mostel film. The movie adaptation of the beloved musical follows the Broadway musical very closely, and this can either be a positive or a negative thing. People would say it's negative because it doesn't show artistic integrity, but I say it's great because it's still wildly enjoyable just like the stage production. Even though on the stage 'The Producers' is much better, the musical version of the film is still excellent and most likely the most fun you will have at the movies all year.The story follows big-time Broadway producer Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane), who seems to be turning out flops left and right. On his last leg he meets the shockingly stereotypical Jewish accountant Leo Bloom (Mathew Broderick) who gives Bialystock the idea he could make more money with a flop than with a hit. The two become partners to produce the biggest flop of all time - "Springtime for Hitler" a story romancing the memory of Adolf Hitler and all the good he did for Germany and the world. After getting the rights of the musical from the writer who's a crazed ex-Nazi in exile, Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell), they are off to pitch the show to the ultra-gay cross-dressing director Roger DeBris (Gary Beach) and his even more swishy assistant Carmen (Roger Bart). Then along comes the breathtakingly beautiful Ulla (Uma Thurman) to be Bialystock and Bloom's new assistant and female lead of 'Springtime for Hitler'.First of all, I enjoyed 'The Producers' a tremendous amount. Why wouldn't anyone? It's funny, it's charming, it's edgy, it has great musical numbers, memorable tunes, fantastic acting, marvelous dancing, and the German Ethel Merman, Adolf Hitler. Nathan Lane is brilliant as always although he shows his age by not being able to hit some of the notes he did in the show. Mathew Broderick, in a less awe-inspiring role, is also great. Gary Beach and Roger Bart are the two funniest parts of the film (also the Broadway production) and I actually like Will Ferrell's hilarious take on Franz Liebkind better than the original Brad Oscar. The only real disappointment to the cast is Uma Thurman. Sure, she's more attractive than Cady Huffman by popular standards but she is terrible when it comes to vocals. Huffman had a powerful and beautiful voice, and Uma Thurman's voice is weak and squeaky.Besides Uma Thurman and other minor things (like how they cut out 'King of Old Broadway' and 'Old Bavaria'), 'The Producers' will completely enthrall you from start to finish. I highly recommend it. Grade: A- (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 1/7/06)</fullReview>

Although, you maybe shouldn't look at it as a movie and more of a Broadway musical.This movie manages to successfully get the audience involved in "the show". Nathan lane is very good at *mug to the camera* shots. There isn't one point during this movie that you think "God i wish i'd stayed at home" or "Is it nearly done yet?" There are incredible performances by Nathan lane, Will Farell and, surprisingly enough Uma Thurman, who i thought may not be able to quite pull it off. Mathew Brodderick puts in a shift too but i just can see Leo Bloom as anyone but Gene Wilder.I am a huge fan of the original 1968 The Producers and i have not been let down by this movie. It is more of a musical than its predecessor but that adds to the fun and enjoyment of watching this movie. The critics who have branded this movie a flop are, in my honest and completely unprofessional opinion, wrong!

		<fullReview>I saw the play twice on Broadway...once with Lane and Broderick, and the other with Brad Oskar and Broderick. The play was absolutely the most hilarious entertainment I have ever seen. The movie, unlike the play, started out a little disappointedly. The opening scene omitted one of the play's funniest songs. The first one-third of the movie somehow lacked the sparkle of the play. Lane particularly seemed unenergized. The last two-thirds, however, turned it around. I laughed so hard that I embarrassed myself. What was the problem with Nathan Lane in the first third that he so spectacularly overcame in the last two-thirds? Gary Beach was again more than stellar, and should win an Oscar. The old lady walker scene in the movie was even funnier than in the play. The love scene with Ulla was a little too long (at the expense of devoting more time to many other funnier themes). p.s. Don't leave the theater until after the credits...you'll hear new songs by Broderic, Ferrell, and a final 5 second scene with Mel!</fullReview>

Matthew Broderick was great too, the I WANNA BE A PRODUCER was great!I was a little disappointed that KING OF Broadway was cut, but the rest of the movie certainly made up for that. Best of all was the SPRINGTIME FOR Hitler sequence, I could not stop laughing. All in all, THE PRODUCERS is one of the best movies I've seen all year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just what I needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's time for members of the WGA to dutifully trudge out and see a batch of films before casting ballots for film writing. And indeed I've started trudging. And the experience is the usual mixture of fulfilling and dismaying.But I purposely scheduled seeing THE PRODUCERS for when I just wanted to have a good time. Yes, I know the original backwards and forwards, and I saw the show on Broadway a few times (friends kept getting cast as replacements), but I really wasn't quite prepared for the pleasure I got from the film.Most of the old jokes are there, and there are tons of new ones, tossed on with all the casualness of a sloppy waiter putting a little too much pepper on your order. Relieved of the effort of following the jokes I already knew, I kept my eyes on the new stuff -- the little quotes from old movies, the inside references, details in the scenery. God in heaven, there were even jokes in the orchestrations! I can't remember the last time I found orchestrations funny.I'm sure there are well-reasoned opinions out there from some grumps who refuse to be amused. I'm not one of them. I think maybe the last time I laughed this hard at a movie was THE OPPOSITE OF SEX, and that was a different kind of laughter (and indeed a very different kind of movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Producers" in 1968 at age 14. Men who fought in WWII were only in their 40s, and more than just a few holocaust survivors were alive. The sheer temerity of the film and its humor was lost on me as were the gay references. It was only after multiple viewings and life experiences that the full impact of that film registered with me.The 2005 incarnation contains all the same energy and the same "f- you and all your hang ups" attitude. Yet the musical numbers remind me of 1940 musicals. I thought I might see Fred Astaire dancing in this.The only complaint I had was with my internal comparator, which finally shut off and quit remembering Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel in the original.The music is wonderful, the lyrics audacious, the energy is high, and for the critics who pan this for the camera work, well, go get stuffed. Don't be so Prince Mishkin.For the rest of you that want a rollicking good time at the movies, go see this film. Then have a bagel. Then screw someone's grandmother. Then cheat on your taxes. Then have another bagel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insight about Uma's performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife saw "The Producers" on Broadway with Nathan and Matthew. I had a ticket too (a damn good center orchestra sixth row ticket!) but ended up in bed in the hotel with the flu. Not all bad - the wife sold my ticket to a retired lady who lives in the east 70's on Manhattan and has subsequently become a good friend. It's great to have a New Yorker for a native guide on our yearly trips there.My wife and I saw the movie today together, I loved it, and my wife says it's every bit as good as the stage production was with the "boys" in it.For those who have read that Uma is only "okay" as Ulla - the wife's an old gypsy herself and she thought Ulla was played by the same actress on Broadway as in the movie - she doesn't instantly recognize Uma like many film buffs. So if Uma's right there with Cady Huffman what's the problem? Myself? Until tonight I was absolutely certain the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen on film was the "Cell Block Tango" number in "Chicago", the choreography and lighting in it is amazing. I'm think of changing my personal "Most Gorgeous" award to Uma in the "Producers" - but not for reasons of lighting or staging! Go see the movie - it is absolute fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the funniest movie I have ever seen but it is very close (Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles are still better). At one point I was nearly in tears laughing uncontrollably. The movie is certainly worth seeing even if you have seen the musical with the original Broadway cast. The movie is much more intimate than watching the musical. Even if you had the best seats in the house you would not catch the expressions in the actors faces like you do in the film. A lot of the humor results from the actors reactions and that would be lost in the Broadway musical. The film is a mix between the original movie and the Broadway musical. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder originated the roles of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom but Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick do a great job. Nathan and Matthew's chemistry is fantastic. I don't think any other actors today would have been able to play these characters so well. I was surprised to see how well Matthew Broderick can dance and sing. Uma Thurman does a great Ulla. Will Ferrell is perfect as Franz Liebkind. I loved this movie and I will definitely buy the DVD as soon as it becomes available. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

They wanted this to be be a throwback musical, to feel like a Broadway show. They did it all.You don't have to be a musical theater fan to appreciate The Producers. It is hilarious. If you don't laugh, you probably should get your pulse checked.If you go into this movie expecting to see Citizen Kane, or Casablanca, you might as well leave. It is not a great movie technically, but it doesn't try to be. It doesn't try to use flashy camera angles or quick paced editing. It wants you to laugh, and you will.Go in with an open mind and get ready to laugh. The humor appeals to young and old and everything in between. The best comedy of the year!</fullReview>

So what if Matthew Broderick was portraying his character as a crazy lunatic (very funny), and on how he looks at the camera. Like he had a direction he has to follow from his director and he can agrue like someone had said in their review of the movie. Also i hate it when people compare things, obviously the first movie is never going to be the same as the remake, i had friends that had seen the movie Chicago and when the went to NYC too see it they where disappointed on what the saw because it wasn't the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie almost two years ago and I, being a die hard fan of the original 1968 film and Broadway musical, thought it was all a wonderful dream. I was later proved wrong when there was buzz on IMDb and articles in the newspaper about it. Two years? I could not wait two years for this, this historical event to take place. But wouldn't you know it, two years passed by and I was only one minute away from finally seeing it and I gotta say, it was worth the wait. Mel Brooks is still the genius who brought us Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein and this film is living proof. The satire, the sarcasm, the physical humor, all of the zazz with the spice only known by writer Mel Brooks and who better to bring this spice to a flame than actors Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, the original Max and Leo from the Broadway smash? Not to mention the frenetic style of Will Ferrel as Franz Liebkind and the luscious vocal work of Uma Thurman as Ulla the Swedish secretary/receptionist. All of these people came together to make this a movie that no one will ever forget and I say "Bravo!"</fullReview>

It took my breath away and kept me speechless even now, an hour after I got home from watching that's how good it was.. Definitely worth watching! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can purchase it. The cast was picked well with popular actors/actresses including Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Uma Thurman, and Will Ferrell, all of whom I loved in this movie and in other movies. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick have much experience together (Lion King series and performing this same show on Broadway), so you get that heartwarming feeling with them at certain parts in this movies. I definitely think almost everyone would love this movie and it is definitely worth the time and money to go see, and if you don't think it's for you rent it when it comes out, either way, everyone must watch this movie!</fullReview>

The singing, the dancing, and the interaction between the characters was awesome.Some of the comedy bits were perfect, especially during the "Springtime for Hitler" musical.

		<fullReview>I rarely rate a movie a 10. If fact I do not think I ever have. I am a huge fan of Mel Brooks. This movie did not disappoint me at all. I have the original movie, sadly not the play. I loved it! This movie I believe does justice to the original! Compairsons are natural to make with older movies, plays, musicals, whatever. Think that Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick did Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom just a well as Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. Will Ferell cracked me up as Franz Liebkind. I think he kind of brought that childlike look to such an interesting part that Kenneth Mars did so well the first time around. I loved the songs. I went home singing them. I even came to work singing them. Uma as Ulla was good and that shocked me. I am usually not a big fan of hers. I thought did played her really well. OH and they left in some of my favorite lines from the original. Grant, this is not for people who are easily offended. However, it is an equal opportunity offender...therefore making it easier to laugh at it with out feeling guilty. It makes fun of gay people, Nazi (duh), people with social issues,taking money from old ladies, and even can insult women with objectifying women (ie Ulla). So What.

		<fullReview>Sure, there were some mistakes made. There were a few scenes (particularly an early scene between Nathan and Matthew) that went much too far over the top, but overall, I thought the movie was terrific. After the cinematographers got over their penchant for excessive close-ups and got down to business, it was a 10 in the visual category. Nathan earned himself an Oscar so far as I'm concerned, and his "Betrayed" was nothing less than brilliant. Matthew sure held his own. The big surprise to me was Uma Thurman. I honestly didn't see how anyone could replace Cady Hoffman, and no one did. But Uma was fun, credible and certainly sexy. I am still puzzled by why cameras feel the need for medium range to closeups during what is obviously a great dance number. Yea, Yea, I know....visual variety. Well, I loved the movie. I think the movie critics have been just panting to get their chance to trash this hilarious musical and they may do it yet. My best guess is that a good worth of mouth will overcome it. At the end of the performance I saw, the audience was applauding as Leo and Max vanished into the background!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original still the best; but this musical is fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I admit I did have reservations about remaking this classic comedy from 1968 (it won director Mel Brooks his only Academy Award ? for Best Screenplay ? and gave Gene Wilder his only nomination). It's one of my favorite movies, almost perfect in design, acting, plot and execution, so this musical version seemed a little blasphemous. And while there were some funny scenes, I kept asking myself if the enterprise had a point (I answered just as quickly, "Yes, profit was the point").Based on the '68 picture ? but motivated by the recent popular, long-running, Tony Award-winning Broadway musical ? this film tells the story of a nerdy accountant, Leo Bloom (Mathew Broderick) and a sleazy producer, Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) who concoct a scheme to make millions by putting out a flop play.Evidently, if someone raises a ton of money for a play and it bombs, the lost funds could be written off. The trick, Bloom explains, is to raise much more money than it costs to produce the thing ? then pocket the rest. Bloom is reluctant to participate, but is soon talked into it by the blowhard producer on the verge of financial collapse. Of course, if the play's a success, there would not be enough money to pay the backers, so ...Bialystock begins to seduce old ladies for the seed money, and soon a play (one which both believe is the most putrid of all-time), "Springtime For Hitler" ("A gay romp with Adolf and Eva in the Bergesgarten") written by an insane Nazi sympathizer, Franz Liebkind (a hilarious portrayal by Will Ferrell) is chosen.The two then enlist the world's worst director; the cross-dressing Roger De Bris (Gary Beach, "Defending Your Life") and his foppish life partner/personal assistant, Carmen Ghia (Roger Bart, "Desperate Housewives" TV series).A bad play, a terrible director, horrible actors, inane music and a hyper politically-correct audience should mean this project is doomed and the scheme will be a complete success. However, a monkey wrench is thrown into the plans when people actually start to like the production.Liebkind breaks his leg on opening night, forcing the director to camp up the role, which leads the audience to roar with laughter. Seeing Der Fuhrer prancing about like Harvey Firestien in "Torch Song Trilogy" had me snickering as well.Overall, I like the original film better than this one (some of the songs, including the one by Uma Thurman, could have been eliminated), and Mathew Broderick is no Gene Wilder, but the performance of Will Ferrell and the expansion of "Springtime For Hitler" still make this one worth seeing.</fullReview>

I have enjoyed this production immensely on the stage and just couldn't "see it" in this venue. Although the singing was "good" many of the best numbers were left out.

		<shortDescription>Make it Gay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is bad for two reasons. Both are deadly in my opinion.The first is the way it was envisioned, as a video recording of a stage production. There's a world of difference between what works on the stage and the screen. They made no adjustments whatever in the character's mannerisms, and the staging.The result is a dreadfully ineffective movie. The only time it works is when we see the show within the show, the "Springtime for Hitler." Alas, less time is given to this than in the original movie. Really, almost nothing works. One or two of Lane's facial reactions and his number in jail. All else is a horrible mistake in terms of the production decisions.The other deadly element is the gay humor. The 68 original was based on this too, but in those days queers were considered fair game, as were blacks. Since this one broadens all the jokes, the gay jokes are more extreme. Yes, I know that the "gay community" thinks it is all in good fun, and the show is amazingly successful.But it still strikes me as ironic that in defusing the holocaust (against Jews, Gypsies and gays) with humor, that humor is based on what are essentially antigay attitudes. Look, I even liked "Freddy got Fingered," so the humor of debasement is okay with me. But not when it claims to be something else.Mel, you need to be ashamed.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

If you want a film that has zero entertainment value and zero comic relief (except for the sporadic gay jokes that will make even the homophobic cringe), then you should definitely see this film. Between the corny, random bursts into song we heard dialog equivalent to that of my excrement splashing into the toilet water. Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane should honestly consider working as telemarketers for their future careers because I will never see another movie starring them. This is the only movie I have been to the theater and instead of watching scenes in the film I pondered ways to commit suicide with common theater objects like popcorn boxes or M&amp;Ms.Worst movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had really high expectations going into the movie. As a fan of Mel Brooks, the original film and the Chicago &amp; NY productions, I went into the screening with the mindset of comparing/contrasting it to the other experiences that I enjoyed so much. What to expect? A feel good movie? A theater production? I couldn't classify it right away. It gave me the same feelings as other Brook's movies (yes, the extremely funny, the hooky, the grimace, the etc...) and had elements of a Broadway musical, yet something was different. Once the story got rolling I quickly stopped analyzing and started to really have a good time. Unlike the theater, movie houses usually are very impersonal... yet this movie was able to get the audience involved. It started with a chuckle here and there and then some folks started bursting out in hysterical laughter. From then on people let their defenses down and I think that's the key to enjoying the movie. If it makes you laugh, don't be afraid to just laugh out loud. Laughter is contagious and the movie experience is too... heck, be the catalyst! The performances were all very good... Nathan especially. I wonder how many people will see this and think... wow, that Nathan Lane can sing! It would have been fun to see Cady &amp; Brad in their original roles... but Uma &amp; Will did a good job and definitely have more Hollywood power.After leaving the theater I realized that maybe what I just experienced was a genuinely fun musical movie, the likes of which I had never experienced growing up... a throw back to the 'ol Singing in the Rain style musicals. I'm sure that there will be many in depth comparisons/reviews of the film after its wider release.All in all, if you're looking for a fun time this is a great movie for everyone, except pre-adolescent kids... unless you want to teach them a bit about life early on. Oh yeah, if you have a fun time, just like waiting for the curtain call in a live theater, you should sit through the credits... a lot of time and love has gone into the experience that is "The Producers," and everyone that worked on it should be recognized.9/10 with a single star reserved for all the behind the scenes and extra features that will hopefully appear on the home release.Here's to Mel! And always, thanks for all the laughs.PS - If you can't get enough after seeing the movie you should check out the original Movie, The Broadway Production &amp; Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 4. If you want to know more about Mel, a great book is "The Big Screen Comedies of Mel Brooks" by Robert Crick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incredibly Fun Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to see this movie at an advance screening. What can i say?? I will try not to give a biased opinion because i am a great fan of musicals, i really enjoyed the Pahntom of the Opera. This movie is different. It is different because it is a comedy. First of all, Mel Brooks is a very talented comedian, he is a very talented producer, writer, songwriter, etc.. He's style is very much this movie. The acting was overall good, Broderick was somewhat lacking, but his dance numbers and singing kind of made up for it. Uma Thurman did a good job, her singing was acceptable, all in all she really could be a possibility for an Oscar nomination, Will Ferrell was good also, and since he hasn't really ever had a great performance (apart from possibly elf), this is his best movie performance yet. Now on to Nathan Lane, who really really is the star of this movie and he proves it, with a great comedic performance, great singing, he too was good enough for the Oscar nomination at least i feel.Apart from some camera problems, the music is catchy and fun, the movie is a laughing riot, everyone performed very well. And i can safely say this is a lock for Gloden Globe for best musical or comedy.I'm still unsure of how critics will respond to this. The response to Phantom were very mixed, more bad than good, yet the public seemed to had liked it. Yet, even the Phantom stage show at first did not get critical acclaim as many thought it cheesy. While the Producers stage show did get much critical acclaim, and this could be a good sign for this great film!After a year of pure crap, finally some light at the end of the tunnel... Highly recommended!! Go see this! Enjoy it! Laugh! Have a great time! I will be definitely seeing this again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All timing Tony champ Broadway musical has been turned into a pale shadow of its sources</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the worst movie musical of all time, but some of it ventures very close into that territory.This is the story of Max and Leo who decide to put on a flop so they can keep the money, only to get a hit instead.Its based on the Broadway show that won the most Tony's in history (which was based on Mel Brook's Oscar winning comedy- which started out as an unsold play). It has most of the original cast and has been put together by most of the original creative team.Oh, how the mighty have fallen.I'm sure that this will play better if you haven't seen the musical on stage, but as someone who's seen it three times (including its very first New York performance) I really didn't like this much at all.An odd combination of play and movie, more times than not this plays as little more than a filmed stage musical, even the outside shots, with the exception of the Central Park sequences, seem to be on a sound stage somewhere. The comic timing is nonexistent. The camera moves left and right on a plane that would be where the audience would be. Spot lights come on from time to time and almost every member of the cast plays it as if they are shouting to the last row of the balcony. Its awful (Matthew Broderick's affected performance being one of the most awful things I've seen on screen all year). What was Susan Stroman thinking and why didn't anyone stop her? As good a stage director as Stroman is, she's a bad film director. Hasn't she ever seen a movie musical? I don't want to beat up on someone I admire a great deal but, ugh. I do not have the heart to go into the changes from the musical which account for several serious losses, though why did they lose the King of Broadway number from the start of the play?There are a few moments when this movie shines. I was very pleased by Jon Lovitz' brief role as Bloom's boss. Actually I was extremely happy by the entire "unhappy/I Want to be a Producer" number, which seems to be one of the few moments, and only musical number, that actually works.Don't get me wrong this is a mildly amusing movie, but is not, absolutely not the Broadway show, nor is it even close to the original movie (which I don't care for). I felt as though I wasted the money I spent to see this film and would gladly have spent more money to see it on Broadway (Heck its 35 minutes longer).If you're curious do see this on cable something, I just can't, in good conscious recommend you pay to see this on the big screen.4 out of 10. A major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see, what did I do with my sense of humor? Where did I leave it? I know I had it when I went to see the movie, but I must have lost it before I went inside.No matter, I went to a movie today. It was called The Producers. When it was over, I left. I must say, that was one of the longest endings I ever saw. It seems like the ending began about three-fourths of the way through. At least I think they did it that way on purpose. The ending actually began shortly after the movie started. And it just went on and on and on...I felt like the audience of "Springtime With Hitler" looked. I was stunned. I wanted so much to have a good laugh at this movie but the first good laugh didn't come until an hour had passed, when Uma had made her first appearance. She was by far the funniest. Why Uma? I am not sure. But I think it was because she was the only decent actor who didn't act like she was part of a play. Will Ferrell was acting like he does every other time he performs - unimpressive, sometimes giggle-worthy, and gradually becoming predictable and boring.I like Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick is good, but their characters were not movie characters. Instead, they were stage characters trying to pass themselves off on the big screen. Neither were expressive enough. Broderick was often too stiff. Lane came across as if he was going along with a gag with hesitation.I am still stunned and disappointed as I write this. I wanted this movie to succeed. It might have succeeded if it had been treated more like a movie with movie actors rather than a movie of a stage musical with stage performers. Maybe that's why I liked Uma best.Yes, I give it a 5/10 but I still suggest you see it if you like musicals. You might stand a better chance of liking it. Good luck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth The Hype? Nah.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Producers" is a great Broadway show. It's fast, funny and the music is great. However, the movie is far from great. It's bland, really. The main problem with this blandness comes from the directorial skill of Susan Stroman. Most first time stage-to-screen directors don't succeed. However, Stroman is almost frightened of the film medium. The film is shot as if it is a PBS special showcasing "The Producers" on stage with some celebrity guests. We rarely see any interesting camera angles and rarely leave the close up view of actors. Her choreography, however, is a marvel. One of her only interestingly filmed scenes is the "I Wanna Be a Producer" number. Her choreography (and poor camera skills) shine there! And the actors? Eh, nothing special for the most part. Will Ferrell makes us laugh as always, but he's in so little of the film, it barely makes up for its blandness. Nathan Lane is as always, hilarious. He mugs his way into every scene and like magic, it works. He also makes the bland film look better. Roger Bart, also from the stage play, does a nice job as Carmen Ghia and sings well. However, the actor that steals the show here, is Gary Beach. As the uber-gay director, Roger Debris, Beach is hilarious in his first scenes of the picture. However, his show stopping moment comes in the "Heil Myself" section of the "Springtime for Hitler" number. He goose steps his way through the number beautifully ala Judy Garland. As for the two actors I haven't mentioned. Why bother? But I guess I will. Matthew Broderick, as usual, gives a boring, mousy, quiet performance. His Leo Bloom is like his Felix Unger and his Felix Unger is like his J. Pierepont Finch and his Finch is like his Robert Gould Shaw. He is one of the weakest elements of the picture. And Uma Thurman! Oh God! Uma Thurman! (This isn't a good "Oh God.") This woman cannot sing, cannot dance and cannot act. She looks good, thanks to the makeup department, but her musical and comedy skills are so bellow average, it's sad she was cast. The music department, like Nathan Lane and Gary Beach, also save the show. Mel Brooks has written a very funny end credits number. Broadway orchestrator Doug Besterman has spruced up his Tony winning Broadway orchestrations and has made them sound glorious, just like the days of the great MGM musical. But this is far from a great move musical. Kudos to Mr. Lane, Mr. Beach, Mr. Bart and the music department. However, everyone else could have done a much better job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why there should be no adaptation (to regain the funniest parts of the original movie upon which the musical had been adapted)mystifies me. There are funny moments in it. Nathan Lane does have talent. A few of the musical numbers that are new to the Broadway play do have their charms. All in all, though, it doesn't have the power that the original had. This for a couple of reasons. 1st, Zero Mostel. There is no replacing him in this role...by anyone (the same goes for Gene Wilder as the other half of the team). 2nd, the structure, which had been changed from the movie to work on the stage, doesn't do service to the original idea. The 1968 movie exploited the relationships much better; it had a cohesiveness in structure that the Broadway play doesn't have at all - even if you forgive it having made certain changes for the stage. The biggest problem is having Franz Liebkind as the star instead of L.S.D. This wipes out the whole 3rd act charm of having Franz fuel the lunatic, destructive climax. The second biggest problem is to not have the scene in the bar across the street where the producers discover that their play was a hit. The third is having Uma Thurman's role extended into one of some meaning. This destroys the buddy element of the original screenplay - and this is a big problem since it meant that there is no real relationship at all in the story. There isn't one between Max or Leo and there isn't one worth anything between Leo and Uma's character.It's not a total loss. It's amusing but it could be easily ignored and nothing would be missed. The 1968 picture can't be bettered - and if it's changed too much, it can't be swallowed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broderick, Lane, and Stroman are Incredibly Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, Susan Stroman can not and should not direct a movie. This movie needed competent direction and editing. Mathew Broderick's embarrassingly over-the-top performance was solely the fault of the director. Yes, Bloom is supposed to be hysterical, but Broderick looked like he was trying to be a mime, his facial expressions so ridiculously exaggerated that it was uncomfortable to watch. And Nathan Lane limped through the entire movie like he could not wait for it to end. Uma Thurman's so-called Swedish accent sounded like someone from Berlin who spent many years living in South Carolina...she would switch from a pseudo German accent to a southern accent throughout the movie. I would have rated this movie much lower if not for the brilliant and superb performances of Gary Beach as Roger De Bris and Roger Bart as Carmen Ghia. Along with John Barrowman as the tenor trooper, Beach and the "Springtime" scenes made the movie worthwhile. And to my surprise, Will Ferrell was great...though his performance was almost ruined by the pigeons (sure they looked great on stage, but on screen they looked tacky). Overall, I would say that the movie was bad whenever Lane and Broderick were together, but the supporting cast improved the movie a great deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the 'new' Producers- shinier, bigger, Hollywood budget, still funny, in a slightly different way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks is a comic mastermind, giving new meaning to what can be done in satire and parody. This statement can be argued, of course, though many have only first come upon him through his Producers musical on Broadway and abroad. Nevermind that he made Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, this IS Mel Brooks to a good lot of people, even if they've never seen the 1968 masterpiece with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. So the movie version of the musical version of the film may carry some expectations with it, for some. Some may just want a good laugh for a couple of hours. As someone who counts the original as a possible candidate as the best comedy of its time, I can say at least from my perspective that it wasn't disappointing. I had seen the 2001 production with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, and it was a killer (in a good way I mean), taking certain possibilities perhaps not fully realized (or only up to a point) in the film and stretching them out into a Broadway musical pathos to the brim. The movie does this as well, and although the stage show itself brings a little more intrigue and involvement for the audience, this will suffice Brooks junkies for now.It may also be hard for some fans of the original film to go into this film with what could be lightly called an objective view. Many may want to compare the actors, the jokes, the scenes. It's near impossible to do, as the two films (and this is as much a credit to Brooks' debut as it is to his refashioning) can stand alone on their own terms. Mostel and Wilder are one of the great on-screen comedy duos in history. If this is the case, equal credit is due to Lane and Broderick, who fill the shoes their own way. It may be hard even for myself, who can laugh just as hard the tenth time as the first time seeing Wilder flip out over potentially getting 'jumped on', to look at the same scene now filled up by Broderick. Shifting out comparisons can be tricky in some respects, but once eliminated, the actual fun and delight of Susan Strosman's direction (likely through input by co-writer/co-producer Brooks), which integrates a 1950's movie-musical look to the film.In fact, that's another thing that makes this Producers interesting; although it retains its satirical elements- homosexuals, nymphs, old-lady jokes, and of course Nazis by the bushel (LSD, of course, is eliminated here)- it actually gains its momentum as a musical in an of itself. I could see the resemblance and respect it must've been paying to Singin' in the Rain and Guys &amp; Dolls. But this, however, could be something that hardcore Brooks fans, used to the occasional song, could be turned off by. The era of the musical may be long gone, but in almost all of the musical numbers ("We Can Do It", "When You Got It, Flaunt It!", "Betrayed!", and of course the show-stopping "Springtime for Hitler") the sort of free-fall spirit is still in full shape. Add that all of the actors, including the fresh-to-the-musical Will Ferrel as Liebkind (awesome pigeons by the way) and Uma Thurman as Ula (maybe not as terrific as could be, but very much 'fits' the part), are top notch, makes it an intriguing kind of entertainment.It's possible that maybe a film like this goes against my better judgment as a reviewer. The film is over-the-top, not very subtle most of the time (not counting the hilarious expressions on Lane's face at times), and sometimes doesn't give the audience to breathe after one of the big numbers. One could argue against whether Broosk still keeps a balance in the zaniness in his material. But by the end I really didn't care. The musical/movie version of the Producers will either catch the fans by the you-know-what and leave them happy, maybe pull in some newcomers, or leave everyone else very disappointed, sticking to the the Oscar winning original like crazy glue. I do admit I will likely go first to the one that started it all if I need be. However I probably won't hesitate in picking up a copy of this either when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the ten worst movies I have ever seen - out of THOUSANDS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, just a quick comment about the excessive level of "positivity" here on IMDb. I think it translates to a general lack of standards in our culture. It's okay to dislike something, to even hate it, and to express that opinion. Please - all of you - stop apologizing for being critical. If there is one thing we need more of nowadays, it's critical reasoning and standards.That said, this film is simply awful. AWFUL. Back in ancient times, when a king was buried, they would kill all the slaves who built the tomb, and all the soldiers and priests who witnessed the burial so no one would know where the tomb was. This is what should be done with all reels of this movie and everyone involved with it. It is THAT bad.Brooks 1968 film was brilliant, a quirky work of genius that reflected the true talent, and eccentricity of various members of its cast. The quirkiness and eccentricities were what made the movie so brilliant. That, and the obvious factor that Brooks was trying to finally destroy the Nazis and what they had done through the medium of his satire. That 1968 movie had conviction, and a heart. This 2005 movie is nothing but a series of clichés and formulas strung together in the most heartless, calculated, totally unfunny way. I have literally watched thousands of movies, and have only walked out on two, but I was strongly tempted to do so with this one. It was only out of curiosity to see how Brooks managed to maim his own masterpiece, that I stayed.Nathan Lane does not have the solidity and persuasiveness that seemed inherent in Zero Mostel. He's obviously fake - you would NEVER believe that he's a macho, conniving Broadway producer. He's far too simpering to be convincing. Broderick is okay, but one longs for the unique appearance and style of Wilder - Broderick is far too tame in the role. Will Ferrell is not bad - actually he's pretty good - the unfortunate thing is how Brooks again - MAIMED his own original movie by changing the role of Leibkind. The rest of the cast basically filled any number of loathsome stereotypes, whether it be about gay theater types, or little old ladies, with none of the charm or originality or uniqueness of the originals. None of these people are convincing in any of the performances. One of the most wonderful things about the 1968 movie was the sense that all of these characters actually could exist somewhere in real life. They seemed alive and vital and unique - nothing could be further from the truth in this utterly dreary piece of dreck.The one bright spot was Uma Thurman, who is not only one of the most gorgeous women in movies, but can also sing and dance.Speaking of singing and dancing, the music also stunk. THere was nothing memorable in any of the music except the original music from the old movie. The choreography was plodding and unimaginative where it varied from the old movie.Bottom line for me, and most disappointingly, this movie was not even funny. That people were laughing at this is a sad reflection of the general lack of taste and sophistication in our society. I found it not only disappointing in respects to the 1968 movie, but quite depressing as well. This production adds NOTHING to the 1968 movie - if you want to see Mel Brooks at his peak - rent the 1968 version. Don't bother with this complete piece of garbage.</fullReview>

Don't waste your money, or petrol to go watch. If you live in the UK, pay a couple of extra pounds, and watch it live. You will leave the theatre with sore stomachs, rather than matchsticks underneath your eyelids if you walk out of the cinema. Nathan Lane (Bialystock) is OK, but (Bloom) is dreadful, he only uses one facial expression throughout the film. Uma Thurman could of acted better also. THEATRE THEATRE THEATRE!

There were only a couple of scenes that touched on risqué topics or concepts but luckily, my ten year old was clueless and had no idea a taboo topic was introduced.

		<fullReview>"The Producers" is one of the first film versions of the recent musicals based on a popular film. Because of that, the piece would have lent itself to film very easily, but this film did not succeed in translating from stage to screen. Director/Choreographer Susan Stroman has taken most of the blame for that, and most of that is justified. The film is virtually identical to the stage version in physical appearance,giving the whole film a stagey, artificial atmosphere. What's more, the performances seem to be playing to the back row, making them seem over the top. Nathan Lane does the best of the actors recreating their stage roles. Matthew Broderick, on the other hand, seems to be impersonating Gene Wilder, who played his role in the basis film. Gary Beach and Roger Bart are both fairly over the top in their stage roles. New to the film are Will Ferrell, amusing but over the top as the Nazi playwright Franz Leipkind, and Uma Thurman, who is sadly something of an embarrassment, neither a singer nor a dancer and lacking in the warmth that Cady Huffman brought to the role on stage. Since the film is so similar to the stage version, it seems to me that it would have made more sense to have filmed the stage version and broadcast it either on PBS or HBO, where it would have seemed more lively and less artificial</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if the rest of the film were awful, Mel Brooks' 1968 classic THE PRODUCERS would be worth watching just to see the great "Springtime for Hitler" sequence. Fortunately, Brooks was in peak form as both director and writer and his clever and concise Oscar-winning script was performed to perfection by Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in their best screen performances, making THE PRODUCERS one of the all-time great American film comedies On the other hand, this 2005 musical version truly is worth seeing solely for the "Springtime for Hitler" sequence. Restaged and slightly rewritten, the scene nonetheless retains the goofy tastelessness that makes it a classic bit. It's not as good as in the original, but it is still very funny.Pity the same cannot be said about the rest of the movie. Based on the Broadway musical that was based on Mel's masterpiece, 2005's THE PRODUCERS is at least two giant steps removed from perfection and none of the many changes in the story have improved it.On Broadway, THE PRODUCERS was a smash, but if it is anything like this film one can only assume that it was staged in a burlesque house rather than on the legitimate stage. The material seems to have less to do with traditional musical comedy than with vaudeville; every line and every gag is delivered with an elbow-to-the-ribs subtlety. The 1968 film was fairly outrageous farce, but it is also Brooks' most restrained and nuanced effort; the farcical elements are balanced with low-key wit. The musical film, though at times relying on dialogue lifted word-for-word from the original, reduces all the humor to the broadest of shtick; no attempt seems to have been made to tone down the stage material for the intimate movie screen, let alone allow it to be delivered with sophisticated flair. The result is self-consciously hokey; worse than vaudeville, it's like bad sitcom.The basic story remains the same: Down on his luck Broadway producer Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) seduces milquetoast accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) into helping to defraud investors by putting on a play that is guaranteed to flop. When moving a story from screen to stage -- and adding musical numbers to boot -- one expects changes, but some of the changes seem arbitrary at best and ridiculous at worst. For instance, apparently to avoid making the stage version a two-man show, relatively minor roles like those of Ulla, Roger De Bris and Carmen Ghia have been expanded, meaning that these one-joke characters stay long past their expiration dates. This is particularly true of Uma Thurman's Ulla; as the producers' Swedish receptionist she was played by Lee Meredith as a two scene sex joke in 1968, now suddenly she has become Leo Bloom's newfound love interest.And that brings up the most disturbing change in the material, Mel's decision to "Make It Gay!" For obvious reasons, the beatnik humor supplied by Dick Shawn in the original has been dropped as being horribly dated for today's audiences (even though the story itself now takes place in 1958, when the beatnik humor would be topical). So instead THE PRODUCERS '05 wallows in gay camp, indulging in flamboyant, over-the-top gay stereotyping that is almost as out of date as Shawn's beatnik posturing. You know that the film is in serious trouble when Village People jokes start getting tossed in. The camp factor, a minor element in 1968, pretty much takes over the 2005 update. Thus, the using of Ulla as a "beard": despite ratcheting up the gay content, the film invents the romance between Ulla and Leo in an obvious attempt to let the audience know that there is nothing queer going on between Leo and Max. THE PRODUCERS is homophobic, not because of its endless parade of tired gay clichés, but because of its desperate need to deny a homoerotic subtext that wouldn't be apparent were it not for the attempts to deny it in the first place.Ignoring the gay stuff, which isn't easy, the film is still embarrassingly amateurish. The film seems amazingly cheap, looking a lot like one of those TV remakes of classics like THE MUSIC MAN; BYE, BYE BIRDIE or GYPSY. Though she directed the phenomenally successful stage version, first-time screen director Susan Stroman falters by imitating Brooks at his worst and not at his best. And she shows she has no eye for camera movement and placement making all the musical numbers seem static and stagebound. Of the musical score written by Brooks, only "Springtime for Hitler" and "Prisoners of Love," both from the original film, are at all memorable. Of the cast, Broderick in particular is terrible, having opted to play his role like a jittery teenager with stage fright.In theater terms, watching the new PRODUCERS is like watching an out of town tryout of a Broadway bound production; you see the genius in the material, but also all the flaws and can see what roles should be rewritten and what songs should be cut. But like Max and Leo, the filmmakers seem to have purposely put the bad stuff in to sabotage their own production. I think someone should audit the books for this production -- both sets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the stage version of The Producers and really liked it. Not only is the dialogue very witty and the situations lots of fun, but it is also one the very best directed musicals I have ever seen. I that sense Susan Stroman is a genius, pure and simple.So it was with great enthusiasm that I looked forward to the film version, and her first shot at directing a movie. But it just doesn't work for me.What has been attempted here is to try and give the screen version the "look and feel" of the stage. This has been tried many time before and it has never really worked. The best way to bring a musical to the screen is to cast aside the restrictions of the stage and embrace the film medium. Some notable successes have been Chicago, Cabaret, Jeasus Christ Superstar and Moulin Rouge.Susan has tried very hard but has really just moved the stage show to the screen, and it feels flat. A nice try anyway. I hope she gets the chance to make more films.</fullReview>

That being said, the biggest problem for me in this movie was how the actors, for the most part, played their respective roles. They acted in the same manor as they would have had the been performing on stage. That is, the characters talked at the audience rather than to each other. This is delightful for some, but was annoying for me. I did enjoy a few moments but I only laughed a few times, mostly out of pity. Again this movie was not made for people who don't like musicals, I just wish I'd known that before other people paid for me to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very silly, uncontainably hectic film of the successful Broadway/West End show. Sensibly, Brooks has gone for a cast drawn straight from the theatres with only two major substitutions: Uma Thurman as a preposterously tall swede (I first assumed she'd been elongated in the same way that Peter Jackson's Hobbits were shortened) and Will Ferrell excelling as a demented Nazi pigeon-fancier playwright. Wow, three tautologies in one sentence!Like many of Brooks' films, this works on the basis of a sound idea stretched into feature length with corny jokes and slapstick. With respect to Broderick who's very entertaining, Lane is untouchable in flogging this melange, which is probably why his entirely superfluous prison-cell solo sequence stayed in the picture.You can take or leave the whizz-bang gags, but the film is about the duplicity of trying to sell something (the film opens with Hamlet-as-musical 'Funny Man'); consequently there are PC-left-at-the-door sequences about pensioners, gays, libidinous Europeans and, of course, the Nazis. It all works but only with some well-positioned signposting lines (Ferrell - 'Nein! Die Fyoorer vas Butch' and then Lane reading a notice that the show is satirical).It's all as deep as a contact lens, but you can't help but be showbludgeoned into enjoying most of it. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few hilarious scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love musicals, you will probably like this movie. Otherwise, avoid the hype, and wait for it on video or better yet rent the original. Nathan Lane did a fine job in the lead role, but many of the support characters stole the show even with some obvious blue humor. Will Ferrel once again showed his talent as the writer. Gary Beach and Roger Bart were hysterical. Uma Thurman did a good job of playing the sexy love interest. I had two major complaints with the film. First, I found it painful to watch Matthew Broderick doing his bad Jerry Lewis impersonation. He played it like he was still on stage and it did not work. Second, it dragged in too many places. I laughed out loud at certain parts but rolled my eyes and checked my watch much of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a pale imitation of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films have made as complete a round trip through the entertainment world as Mel Brooks' "The Producers," which started life as a movie in 1968, became a smash Tony Award winning Broadway musical in 2001, and now returns to the silver screen, all spruced up but with much of its heart taken out.Virtually everyone is familiar with the story of Max Bialystock, a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer who discovers that, through some loopholes in the tax laws, one can actually make more money from a show that flops than one that succeeds. Thus, he and his milquetoast accountant, Leo Bloom, set about putting on the worst Broadway show of all time, a musical entitled "Springtime for Hitler," that is guaranteed to bomb at the box office, making the two producers instant millionaires. What Max fails to take into account is the old show biz adage that "no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public," and, thus, much to his dismay, he soon finds himself with a certified hit on his hands.One of the problems "The Producers" faces right off the bat is the memories the audience brings with them of the original movie. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, good as they are in the lead roles (and they are VERY good), still cannot rise to the level of the great Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder who came before them. One need only compare the two movies side by side and scene by scene to see that Mostel and Wilder literally own these roles. That doesn't mean that one can't enjoy Lane's and Broderick's on-screen antics here - just that it helps if one doesn't come to the movie already prejudiced by over-familiarity with the source.Brooks himself has penned the musical score which features clever lyrics and jaunty, if not exactly memorable, tunes. The song-and-dance numbers are reasonably well mounted, although Susan Stroman's direction leans, for the most part, towards the boxy and the stagy.When "The Producers" was first released in 1968, it seemed wildly iconoclastic, daring and cutting edge, a perfect reflection of the no-holds-barred, everything-goes decade that spawned it. Now, coming back to us in the form of a high-priced, award-laden musical, set inexplicably in the 1950's, it feels strangely like a relic - old-fashioned, claustrophobic, stuffy and embalmed. Gone is the freshness and immediacy and glorious bad taste that came with the original. It's just not vital anymore.There are still sporadic moments of pleasure to be had with this "Producers." But it's not in any way comparable to the real thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PRODUCERS (2005) *** Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Uma Thurman, Will Ferrell, Gary Beach, Roger Bart, Jon Lovitz. Fairly decent big screen adaptation of the smash Broadway musical hit based on Mel Brooks' original film about a scruple-less has-been producer Max Bialystock (a wonderfully duplicitous Lane) who teams up with a guileless accountant Leo Bloom (tics a plenty turn by Broderick) to create a sure-fire windfall in profits by scamming for a lame production guaranteed to bomb : "Springtime For Hitler" (!) Funny and a tad dated yet it works especially for someone like me who had the joyous privilege of seeing the original stars in the play onstage to compare (the only set back is the film feels like a play with the leads mugging with no mercy) and the addition of Thurman is truly inspiring as the Swedish giantess Ulla (who knew Uma could sing?) while Ferrell's manic neo-Nazi playwright is admittedly taxing on the nerves.

		<shortDescription>Mel, it doesn't work as well as a musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that the first Producers movie was arguably the funniest movie ever made. This movie loses it's comedic pace with each musical number. Nathan Lane is really the best thing about it, and Will Farrel has studied Kenneth Mars' performance well. Matthew Broderick is a lox, and not in a good, Leo Bloom way. How does this guy get hired?Uma is Uma, long legs and all. Nuff said.She really tries, but she's no Lee Meredith.Mel, why not do Spaceballs on Broadway next? Then you can have Spaceballs, the musical, breakfast cereal. No matter how many times the Emperor shows off his new clothes,he's still naked. Really, don't waste your time on this one. Rent the ORIGINAL, and give yourself a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike some other reviewers I don't take issue with the traditional filmed musical style with which Susan Stroman directed this film; it's some of the performances that don't quite hit the mark. They are either too theatrical for film or the comedy timing is wrong; there is no need to leave a pause for laughs when you shoot or edit a movie. Let's face it; the cast is just not as good or as well directed as they would have been on the original Broadway Show. Suffice to say that the performances from Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick (in particular) seemed tired and lacked conviction and that's not surprising, as they had done it so often on stage. Lane does a nice enough homage to Zero Mostel without losing his own style but don't even start to compare the stodgy Broderick with the neurotic Gene Wilder. Some of the musical numbers are very nicely done in this film though, especially the outdoor ones and the famous "Springtime for Hitler". It is good that Stroman does the musical numbers mainly on wide shots where others might have tried to cut close. I have seen excellent ballet films ruined by too much cutting and too many mid-shots and closeups so it is good that she shot the musical numbers in this film in a traditional style.The usually wonderful Uma Thurman was terribly miscast in this film and so was Will Ferrell. Thurman just does not look right as Ulla and can't "belt" as well as Cady Huffman (who was Ulla in the original Broadway production). Ferrell is just too young looking for the role of Franz and he lacks menace. He really should not try to pull faces like Jim Carrey; one Jim Carrey in the movie world is quite enough. On the plus side, Gary Beach is wonderful as Roger and is probably the best reason to see this film.Continuity freaks will love the various jumps in people's positions or expressions between shots and a few hairstyle variations too. I don't normally spot dodgy edits but there are quite a few in this film, even though I only saw it the once. Maybe the hairstyle variations were deliberate, in homage to Roger de Bris' wig jumps on the original 1968 film but I don't think so somehow.Having not been fortunate enough to see the show on Broadway when it first opened then, without a doubt, for me the best version of this very funny musical is on the DVD documentary entitled "Recording the Producers" (2001) and I urge you to watch that even if you already have the resulting CD of the soundtrack from the Broadway show. It has a cast still fresh from the first opening of the musical on Broadway. Lane and Broderick give perfect performances too. OK, so they are singing the songs and not acting out very much more than a small part of the plot but you will see and *hear* far better performances in almost every role I can think of compared with those on the feature film version of the musical. Cady Huffman does a much better Ulla than poor old Uma and a few of the people who only played bit parts in Stroman's movie version (including Peter Marinos and Eric Gunhus) get a chance to shine on the DVD documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless you really enjoy watching bad actors over act. Do your self a favor and see the far superior original. I feel like I had $20 dollars stolen from me. HAS Nathan Lane ever not played the same vampy character? Has Matthew Broderick ever been able to act? Will Uma ever recover from her Batman role? See this movie and have all these questions answered.Mel Brooks is really raping the public on this one. I thought the Broadway show stank too. Neither the show nor the movie are relevant to 2005.Maybe early 60s 'Springtime for Hitler' was considered rip-roaring but it does not hold up.There are plenty of good movies out there..... see one.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate to be able to see a free preview of The Producers. I wondered if I could be open minded enough to seeing a film remake of what I thought was one of Mel Brooks best films. I was determined to try my best to do so. Nathan Lane must have loved Zero Mostel's performance so much,that he not only wore his hair in a comb over, he delivered every line exactly the same way Mr. Mostel did in the original film. Matthew Broderick actually got Gene Wilder's hysterics down pat as well. The only one who seemed to make the part his own was Will Farrell, who played Franz. On a positive note, there were some interesting new songs. There was some improvement in plot by getting rid of the dated but very funny "LSD" character played by Dick Shawn in the original, and having Roger Dupree, the drag queen director ultimately play the part of Hitler. Another problem with the movie was that it did not know when to end. Unlike ending with "Prisoner's of Love" in the prison, as they did in the original, they proceeded to bring that to Broadway as well. But the movie didn't stop there ether. It just kept going on. All that said, everyone else in the theater seemed to love it. They applauded and laughed at everything. Had they never seen the original? One could only guess.</fullReview>

Awful screenplay.This is a classic "Why did they bother" film -- there was no reason to remake the classic 1968 film. And the new songs? Distorting and pathetic.The Broadway musical wasn't much better, but it was a live performance that gave an excuse -- sort of a "The Producers Greatest Hits". As a film, it's just plain flaccid.One of the worst stage-to-film musicals ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Producers Movie is no good because...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie (The Producers) is rotten because...Dick Shawn's character "Lorenzo St. DuBois (L.S.D.)" is nowhere to be seen.In his place are a colorful bunch of "other characters" lets just say.What a pile. Will Farrel and Uma Thurman steal the show... so way to pump up the superficial "B" characters and leave another "classic" one hanging... oh and create 6-7 more who are nothing more than names with puns and limited dialogue.Anyone know the motivation behind this? Mel Brooks is a hack and or sell-out. ...and here is reason number 2: During production of Spaceball there was a staff meeting held to discuss the first few days and talk about the future shooting schedule. During a sort of round table discussion a lowly serf of a member of the crew says, "You know what would have been cool, if they called the "Dark Helmet" (Rick M's) character "Oi Vader". Everyone in the room laughs as they get the joke. Well long story short, that guy was fired like a cannon because you don't take Mel's joke and make it better and then suggest an idea that makes him look unoriginal or at a time when nothing could be done about it.I wonder if anyone along the line of the Producers mob said much about the missing St. Dubois character? Save you money and see the Broadway play? oh anyone know if the Broadway play has bastardized the original in this way as well? Bleh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suspect the people who walked out of our screening probably had no idea that this was going to be a musical, as they left quite early in the piece. After that, the rest of us stayed and it wasn't too bad - really! As far as lyrics and music go, this was no Rogers and Hammerstein epic. In fact, it was all quite basic. If it wasn't a comedy, then it would never have been good enough. However, the laughs were there, and that's what carried it through. Nathan Lane steals the show. He's a great comic, and boy can he sing! Matthew Broderick is an adequate counterfoil for Lane, and the addition of Uma Thurman as Ulla is a cute touch that actually worked for me! And Gary Beach steals the show within the show (Springtime for Hitler) - it's a shame the staging of their big production couldn't somehow be wangled with a bit of "time-warping" so it's the climax of the movie, as everything after this seemed to struggle to match it. Definitely one for die-hard musical fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broadway, with the accent on BROAD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like its stage antecedent, the movie musical of "The Producers" is an engagingly broad farce that has lots of hilariously funny moments as well as several ponderous stretches where the characters try to get on with the plot without the benefit of any real human interaction to help them along. The performers who are really adept at spinning shtick ? Nathan Lane, Roger Bart, and especially Gary Beach as the outrageous director cum actor Roger De Bris (all from the original Broadway cast) perform absolute alchemy with the thin material, making you laugh so hard that you forget that you're really not watching anything more than an elaborately produced Burlesque skit.Far less amusing are Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman. Ferrell sings and dances disarmingly well (be sure to stick around for a hilarious German ballad he sings at the end of the credits), but he lacks menace as Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind so it is difficult to buy Lane and Broderick's cowering at his presence in their scenes together. Thurman tries her best as the title characters' Swedish sex toy, but isn't a patch on the part's Tony-winning stage creator Cady Huffman. She is also a bit long in the tooth to be playing a character who is the living embodiment of sex, especially as she lacks any chemistry with love interest Mathew Broderick.Broderick proves himself once again to be a marvelously talented musical theatre performer, but his acting is forced and lacks the naturalness (and manic comic inventiveness) of Gene Wilder in the 1968 film version. And while Lane is undeniably brilliant when performing his unique brand of shtick, the celebrated Broadway pair display surprisingly little chemistry so that the friendship which emerges as their supposed bond never materializes.But with a movie like "The Producers," it's best not to delve too deep. The film has some wonderful dance numbers (cleverly staged by Broadway original Susan Stroman), a terrific production design and a funny script by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan (although like in the Broadway show, Brooks' score is fairly lackluster and doesn't contain any memorable songs beyond the "Springtime for Hitler" number from the original film). If you're looking for a movie that will bring you a few belly laughs that you can then forget about an hour after you've seen it, "The Producers" delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Producers" (1968) is easily one of the funniest movies of all time, with fans as loyal as Al Queda fanatics. Mel Brooks, never one to pass up a bawdy joke or politically incorrect remark, wove an insanely brilliant screenplay that lampooned the obsessions of the era.Though his Broadway play was a monster of a hit, it was a paler version of the original. Not one to give up on a good thing, Brooks has now cloned his baby one too many times. A lot can fly under the radar in a live performance-- the audience is sharing a collective vibe. But film is literal and unforgiving. Why ape the original, when you can buy a priceless DVD? Let's say a little something about Zero Mostel, rumored to be one of the angriest and most brutal actors who ever lived. That turbulent performance is what gave "The Producers" (1968) its stunning audacity. Likewise, Gene Wilder's real-life neurotic obsessions translate beautifully on screen. Together, they were like nitro and glycerin.Good freaking luck to anyone who tries to re"produce" that kind of chemistry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Surprises from this familiar Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new musical version of Mel Brooks' The Producers is literally a straight adaption of his Tony Award winning play. Susan Strohman, who won a Tony Award for direction of a musical play, should have NEVER been given the assignment of adapting this classic to the silver screen. Her knowledge of cinema and the camera is limited, making the film feel like a "filmed" version of a performance of the play. Very little thought went into using the camera to its maximum advantage. The actors (most of them straight from the play) all give great performances, but unfortunately for them, their director gives little direction for the screen, and thus lets them do their same performance as if it was being done for the stage.Too bad..because Mel Brooks' really deserved a re-imagining of his musical by taking it to the next level on to the Big Screen. Instead, I was reminiscing of the classic film, directed by Brooks, which took advantage of using the camera, and awesome performances by Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder! As a director Mel Brooks has always been known as someone you could get a surprise with gags on the screen. You could watch Blazing Saddles 100 times, and each time see something different that you hadn't seen the previous 99 times.If you've never seen the stage performance of this GREAT Musical, you'll enjoy this film. If you've seen the stage version..you'll also wish that Strohman would have pulled some new tricks out of her hat, as well as kept some of the most humorous numbers, "King of Broadway", and "Where Did We Go Right?" in the film. Stohman's "version of the play", makes me wonder why Brooks didn't just tape the musical like so many other Broadway shows, and air it on Showtime and HBO, saving the 2 studios (Columbia &amp; Universal not Brooks' usual studios Warners or Fox) a heck of a lot of dough!Come Oscar time, I'm confident the voters will think of The Producers as "Best Broadway Film Revival" and not smile too favorably and think of it as the "The Old Musical filmed for the Screen"!</fullReview>
