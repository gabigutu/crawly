		<shortDescription>A Self-Sacrificing Father</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WAY OF ALL FLESH (Paramount, 1940), directed by Louis King, is a remake of an old 1927 silent tearjerker that starred the then great German actor, Emil Jannings (1884-1950), in the drama, along with "THE LAST COMMAND (Paramount, 1928), that earned him the honor of being the first actor ever to win an Academy Award. Jannings' career in Hollywood was successful but short-lived. After silent movies converted to sound, Jannings returned to Germany by choice in 1929 where he resumed his film career, quite successfully with Germany's first all sound film, THE BLUE ANGEL (1930) with Marlene Dietrich. The leading actor in this remake is the Russian-born Akim Tamiroff (1900-1973), a resident character actor of numerous features for Paramount since 1934, who, by this time, had risen from minor roles to occasional character parts to occasional top-billed leads in second feature films. While Tamiroff could have been Paramount's answer to Emil Jannings of the 1940s, possibly appearing in remakes to his Hollywood silent films of the late 1920s, Tamiroff returned to supporting character parts, ranging from comedy to drama, with two Academy Award nominations as best supporting actor to his credit, but sad to say, THE WAY OF ALL FLESH is not one of them.Tamiroff stars as the bearded Paul Kriza, a European by birth living in mid-western United States with his American wife, Anna (Gladys George), and their four children, working as a bank cashier. A loyal employee, Paul is entrusted by Mr. Hanzel (Roger Imhoff), a bank president, to go to New York City to deliver a large sum of money for the bank. After a sentimental farewell to his family, Paul goes on his way. While on the train, Paul lets his responsibility lapse when he innocently becomes involved with Mary Brown (Murial Angelus), a dubious adventuress, who, after learning of his mission, gets him drunk and seduces him. During a drunken revel, Mary, accompanied by Reginald L. Morten (Berton Churchill), her middle-aged partner, steal the bank's bonds. Aware of what has happened, Paul searches for the thieves. He later becomes the victim of cruel circumstance when he encounters a thief who tries to rob him, beating him unconscious. Paul awakens only to find the thief had taken his watch and ring, items of sentimental value. A fight ensues, which ends with Paul's attacker getting pushed in front of a passing train, killing him. Rather than return home a disgrace, Paul decides to exchange identities with the dead man, letting the deceased be found with his personal belongings on him. As for Paul's wife, Anna, she receives the news that her husband died a hero defending his employer's trust. Years later, Paul continues to live in New York working odd jobs for the city, such as collecting rubbage in playgrounds, keeping only to himself, telling those who ask him about his family by responding that he "has nobody." One of the most poignant scenes in the story occurs later when Paul, reading in a newspaper about his eldest son, Paul Jr. (William Henry), now a famous violinist, scheduled to play in a concert. Paul manages to attend by earning enough money for a gallery seat, and being moved to tears when he not only watches his son play to a full and attentive audience, but seeing his wife and grown children from afar.Also seen in the supporting cast are Darryl Hickman, James West, Marilyn Knowlden and Norma Jean Nelson as the Kriza kids; with John Hartlet, June Haden and Betty McLaglin as the Kriza children as young adults.With Hollywood producing so many tearful dramas over the years, such as IMITATION OF LIFE (1934) and/or STELLA DALLAS (1937) for example, which focuses upon self-sacrificing mothers, THE WAY OF ALL FLESH is one of the known few that centers around a self-sacrificing father. Trite and old-fashioned at times, with a storyline resurrected from the bygone silent era, which to some, that's where it should have stayed, THE WAY OF ALL FLESH relies solely on Tamiroff's skilled performance to carry the story through. But because this drama lacks top named actors and director, and being of some interest to a limited audience, it would be unlikely that this film will ever see shown on television again. Had it starred a bigger name actor like Edward G. Robinson, who, too, would have given a good solid performance with this role, then THE WAY OF ALL FLESH would not only be shown on a classic movie cable channel, but distributed on video cassette. On and all, it's worth viewing if it could be available again, but be warned and have a box of tissues handy. (***)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film once--in 1968, when I was 8 years old, on the late, late show. I cried myself to sleep that night, the ending was so sad. In the intervening years, the basic plot of the movie, and especially the ending, stuck in my mind, but I couldn't remember the title, the stars, or anything else. For the past four years, off and on, I've searched the IMDb to no avail, trying to find out what movie this was. Then I came across this entry by accident. Now, after 37 years, the mystery is solved. I couldn't find anything about The Way of All Flesh at the Turner Classic Movies website. I wonder if they even have it in their film library. it certainly would be interesting to see it again after all these years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Way of All Flesh when I was about 8 years old. I always called it "The Man Without A Home". It was such a tear jerker that I thought my mom would need a rowboat to get out of the theater.The most poignant scene, as I recall, was when the father trudges towards his home through the snow on Xmas eve, looks in the window and sees his entire family sitting around the Xmas tree, reminiscing about their father, worshiping his soul (they all believed he died many years ago, as seen in the film). Instead of breaking the bubble, and trying to gain entry, the father turns away and goes back away from the house. This may have been the final scene.It is really sad that this movies is not available on VHS or DVD. I would have loved to see it. I agree that because the movie did not have any big-name stars to draw a wide audience, it slipped away.Could you imagine the tidal wave a pairing of "The Way of All Flesh" and "Stella Dallas" would cause?Stan Flax</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great weepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in a 'fleapit' in Dublin when I was about 11 years old (I think about 1942) it has stayed with me all my life and I am amazed that so many others were affected in the same way, as with some other of your correspondents I was deeply moved by the ending. I seem to recall the son coming to the door and inviting the 'old tramp' inside and with the father's refusal and walking slowly away the whole cinema burst into tears! I am also surprised that the film is not shown on television although if it was shown I doubt if I could watch it, a grown old man crying is not a pretty sight! I would however recommend all my friends and family to watch it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old movies need to be preserved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the last hour of this film when I was about 10 years old,....which would have been about 1965,...the end is so sad. I cried and cried and I have searched for many years to get a copy of it. American Movie Classics does not even have it,.....but if anyone knows where to find it please let me know,....I never got to see the whole movie only the last part,.....so I would very much appreciate it! It's really sad to see some of the old classics like this disappear, I hope that someone somewhere has saved this wonderful movie. it seams like we are in an age where everyone wants what they want when they want it, which usually means right now! And the good old days when things were simple are a thing of the past, and many movies are disappearing from the Archives due to this hurry up got to have it now attitude. This movie teaches patience and self sacrifice. Good values that also seam to be a thing of the past, we need these old movies cause they were part of our heritage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have purchased a DVD copy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mum just recently found out the name of this movie after 20 years of first seeing it on late night television. A movie which she has never forgotten and which left her in tears. We thought we would never find it as other users on this site have had such trouble. So we couldn't believe our lucky stars when we finally tracked down the internet site http://www.movielead.com/buynow.html This movie was listed as available so we purchased it and crossed our fingers. Low and behold we received our DVD copy a couple of days ago. Delivery only took 3 weeks from U.S. My mum was absolutely delighted. For any future users or those who have had trouble, this will save you some searching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where to find The Way of All Flesh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, too, saw this movie as a child and cried at the ending. It is the greatest tear-jerker of all time. I think I know where you can find it. A book by Priscella Presley noted that Elvis liked the movie so much, he purchased the rights to it.It is a shame that no one may ever see it again, and many have never even heard of it. Long ago, I tried to write Ms. Presley about this. But I did not really know how to contact her. I fully believe this movie would be successful if shown again, or perhaps remade. I am glad to hear that someone else knows of it. It is the most powerful movie I've ever seen from the standpoint of making the movie-watcher need a Kleenex.Does anyone else who has seen it have a comment?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>searching for my dad's 80th birthday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I have found someone who has a VHS copy of this film. My father has talked to me about this film all my life. It's his number one favourite and I would love to get him a copy to watch one more time. It's his 80th birthday in December and I've now set myself the mission of getting him a copy by then. If anyone can point me in the right direction (even to borrow) in any format, I'd really appreciate it. Someone in 2001 mentioned buying it from the 'backwoods' in the US - can you give me details? Does anyone know why it hasn't made it onto TV in UK? I love a good old weepy and this sounds like it's up there with the best - WOnderful Life and all that. I saw a similar one about a girl who denies her black African heritage and thus her mother until the mother dies and she weeps over the coffin - buckets. Sadly I can't remember the name of that film, one I'd like to see again so I understand my dad's feelings HELP!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was a young girl and cried like a baby. What a touching story. It was played on television, since that is where I saw it. I wish I could get a copy. I think Akim Tamiroff in the lead role of the father was excellent and an underrated actor. I might be mistaken but I think this story was first a book, but I don't know who wrote it. I will continue to do some searches on that. I wish AMC or TMC would at least run the movie on television. There was an earlier version of this movie, 1927, but I have not seen that one. the final scene of the movie is unforgettable! A must see.Too bad this film isn't available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Way of All Flesh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This message in for Sharon Pennock. I also have been searching for this movie for the past few years. Ideally i wanted to get it for my father for his 80th birthday, however, i didn't have much luck! My father told me about this film years ago and said it was one of the best film he has ever seen and such a tearjerker. I, like my father love all the old classics. It's my Dads 82nd birthday this year and i would just love to get the ideal present for him. Can you tell me where exactly you tracked down your copy of the film. I would greatly appreciated if you or anyone else who is reading this comment could assist me in my search. I'm living in Dublin, Ireland. And now after reading all the comments about the film i'm even more determined to get it. Thanks guys!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved the film The Way of All Flesh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film oh so many years ago(about 1959) on an RCA southbridge black and white TV.Although I only saw it the one time (I was in my early teens),I cannot forget it. It was such a tear jerker and had nothing to do with Butler's book. I loved it then and do so to this day. Akim Tameroff ,although in some ways similar to Peter Lorry was, I always thought, a much sharper actor.You might remember him from Five Graves to Cairo,playing a a conniving realist and the original Oceans Eleven. I would be extremely happy to be able to own a copy of it on tape or DVD Can you believe ,I was able to find an original lobby card of the film thru e-bay!!(Of course I bought it and today it hangs proudly in my law office (where it appears,unfortunately ,no one but I truly appreciate it) I have spoken to many about this film but ,unfortunately, no one seems to know of it .Quite sad,really. Great Great movie .Desrves to be made available.Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the way of all flesh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen this movie, but it's story has been related to me many times by my mother who is now 83 years old. She has often expressed a wish for me to see it, and for years i have trawled the net looking for the film. The only information i could find was that the film was destroyed by fire, but i never gave up searching.. Waterloo bridge was another favourite of hers and must have been made around the same time, i saw that as one of those Sunday afternoon films while i was still at school, i will be 50 this year and thought i would give the search one more go... well i may have come up trumps, i have just ordered my copy on VHS of the way of all flesh and it should arrive from America soon, i'm hoping i can give this to my mum at long last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a teenager on television. It was wonderful and I thought the lead actor, Akim Tamiroff was also wonderful. I cried like a baby at the ending. It is rare to see him in a lead role and even rarer to see him portray a person who isn't some type of villian. I wish I could find this film on tape or even played again on tv.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there any way to purchase this movie ? I would love to have it !My mother thought this was one of the best movies she ever saw. Unfortunately I never saw it. I would pay anything with in reason to have this. Is it in any way available ? The actors and actresses in this movie are superb. Now you don't see people like them in the movies. i much prefer the older movies and stars to what I see today. Please make this old classic somehow available !I know it appears this is not available but hopefully with enough requests this could change. I have purchased movies older than this ( 1940 ) so I think this could be done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Father saw this film as a young lad,on its first showing in the U.K. in 1940.He remembered the film with great passion,and awaited its release on television. This obviously never occured,much to His disappointment.I went ahead on a mission a few years ago to locate a copy of the film in any format,contacting film societies and their like.this achieved no success.I then gave up and just presumed the film lost forever and Dad would never again see His beloved enchantment that He kept relating to Us all Please remember ,this was pre-internet days and my sarch was limited to smaller resources.A friend approached Me as to the problem and told Me He had recently gone onto the"net".I didn't understand much about it all at the time,so I just allowed Him to go ahead and make a search.Magically,He came up with a copy on VHS!! He discoverd asmall firm in the backwoods of the U.S. and they kindly forwarded the copy at approx. ?18-00(U.K.) How pleased I was to present MY Father with this wonderful surprise,He cried with joy and We all fervently watched and thoroughly enjoyed "THE WAY OF ALL FLESH"-Something My Dad Hadn't seen in some SIXTY years!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Way of All Flesh" is a Four-Hankie extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1940 movie "The Way of All Flesh" is a remake of a popular Emil Jannings vehicle from thirteen years earlier. This time Akim Tamiroff plays the lead role of the hapless and doomed Paul Kriza. Kriza is a much-beloved family man who works for a bank and is sent on a simple assignment to deliver some important and valuable securities. Along the way, Kriza ends up meeting some very bad people who know a sucker when they see one. Kriza is soon drunk in a bar and getting seduced by a floozy named Mary Brown (Murial Angelus). He wakes up the next day with the worst hangover of his life and without the securities. But that's only the beginning of his troubles. Later he's robbed again and accidentally pushes the thief in front of an oncoming train. What's a fellow to do? Instead of going home and admitting to his family and boss that he had a rough time in the big city, Kriza decides to exchange places with the dead man by placing his personal effects on the mangled corpse. In doing so, he inadvertently makes it appear that he died a hero's death trying to protect his company's assets. Now the only thing he can do is start a new life without his loving wife (Gladys George) and his wonderful and well-behaved children. "The Way of All Flesh" is a tear-jerker of the highest caliber and audiences of its day needed all the extra handkerchiefs they could muster. Akim Tamiroff is perfect for the role as he sinks his character into one depressing situation after the other. It's a wonder that the guy doesn't just commit suicide, but then the movie would end prematurely. Director Louis King ratchets up the bathos and pity and the ending is one of the saddest you'll ever see in any movie in any era of film history. If you're looking for a good "cry", this is it.</fullReview>
