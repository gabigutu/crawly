		<shortDescription>Very Cool.....Marie-France Pisier is Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have a playful sense of humor and enjoy films with an early Fellini (celebration of life-quirky characters) flavor, you should make it a point to watch "Cousin Cousine". Released in 1975, on the surface this is just an off-beat love story about two middle-aged "cousins-by marriage" who are drawn to each other by a shared playfulness. These kindred spirits awaken in each other a zestful and irreverent attitude toward life that distances them from their large (and somewhat strange) extended family. They want to experience as much of life as possible, the man has made it a practice to change professions (not just jobs) every three years so that nothing gets stale. They are very open about their affair, reasoning that the rest of the family will think the worst anyway. Not surprisingly their affair also distances them from their respective spouses, who do not share their fun-loving and irreverent attitudes.The lovers are played by Christine Barrault (nominated for an Oscar) and Victor Lanoux. Although they are fun and likable characters, most of the comedy in this film emanates from the performances of the actors who play their respective spouses. Guy Marchand plays Barrault's husband as a cranky and pathetic Cassanova whose philandering lifestyle is cramped by his inability to cope with his wife's sudden infidelity. Marie-France Pisier, as Lanoux's neurotic airhead wife, subtly steals each scene in which she appears; when a character introduces themselves with the revelation that the only time they have ever been happy was during hypnotherapy, you know that interesting moments are ahead. And for what it is worth Pisier is breathtakingly beautiful.The affair causes the Marchand and Pisier characters a great deal of pain for most of the film, but by the end they have pretty much adjusted to everything. Marchand has resumed his pursue of other women and Pisier has returned to her main source of pleasure-therapy. Marchand's regeneration occurs with his first playful moment, he mounts a knife (fake) in his back and staggers into the living room to the shock of the assembled relatives. While Pisier's regeneration is the best scene of the film. Alone and fully clothed in the bathroom, she half-heartedly tries to slit her wrist with a razor blade and falls backward into the empty tub, which she unexpectedly finds a pleasant and relaxing place to think. And how appropriate since the bathtub is a device we associate with privacy, purgation, relaxation, openness, and regeneration.They say that all films are political and "Cousin Cousine" is no exception. Films have the power to deconstruct the traditional values of society and this love story is also a social commentary on the hypocrisy and double-standards of 1970's western middle class culture. And while pointing out these issues it offers psycho-political messages that each viewer can relate to personally and specifically. The theme is that each day should be a celebration of life, experience, and growth.The grandfather is shown as someone whose long life has given him a real perspective. He is pleased when his teenage granddaughter reveals that she has discovered sex and found it to be wonderful, delighted that she has found something see finds wonderful and amused because her joy is so contrary to the nihilism she had been embracing. He is self-sufficient, the widowed grandmother from the other side of the family enjoys being with him but realizes that he is perfectly comfortable and prefers living alone. He is disturbed by the failure of the family to take any significant time from their lives to mourn his brother's passing.The strange antics of the adults in this extended family are a source of great amusement to the observant children. The carnival music score gives the many extended and flowing group shots a pleasing circus side-show attraction flavor.Note how the film opens with one of families driving to the wedding; parents in the front seat, brother and little sister in the back seat. The parents are agitated and scolding, the children calm and attentive to the experience of the moment. They go out of the scene with the little sister sliding over to be closer to her brother and smiling in adoration. The same little observant girl appears in close-up periodically throughout the film, smiling in amusement at the antics of everyone around her. The film ends with the little girl smiling serenely out the window as she watches the lovers leave on their motorcycle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cousins and adulterous romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cousin Cousine" had a huge popular success in the United States (as probably everywhere else) when it was released in the 1970s. It is nothing more than a love story about a middle-aged man and woman who are estranged from their respective spouses. They openly profess and privately consummate their love, everybody be damned. The movie's value lies in its anarchic and refreshingly droll (drôle?) spirit. The lovers are the lovely Christine Barrault and her cousin by marriage, Victor Lanoux. They win our sympathy because they are such a delightful contrast to the sham and self-pity of their respective mates, Guy Marchand and Marie-France Pisier. Marchand is an especially hilarious cranky type. Jean-Charles Tacchella directed this bubbly and, yes, "gallic" comedy with wit and sensitivity, and you can't help enjoying it immensely. So all this makes adultery OK? Well, we at least are supposed to think that. The movie was remade in 1989 as "Cousins" with Isabella Rossellini and Ted Danson in the two leading roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Reason I Love France</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cousin, Cousine directed by Jean Charles Tacchella was probably the first French movie I ever watched, at least in French with English subtitles. I was in my first year of college French at Indiana University and this movie was suggested by my teacher, a very enthusiastic grad student and mentor to all of his students. At that time the Midwest was my birthright and I had rarely traveled outside its familiar confines. I knew that I wanted to get away from where I had lived almost my entire life up until then, but I didn't know how to do it or know where to go. I was studying French mostly because it was a required part of an undergraduate degree. I suppose that I just saw it as another course, like economics or history. After watching this movie at an off-campus art house movie theater, I couldn't help but think that the French were very different from the people I knew. At that time, as far as I was concerned, "different" was the same as "good." I immediately developed an overly-romantic view of France that I hold to this day. Cousin, Cousine also gave me an overly-romantic view of love that I have maintained to this day.I just watched this movie again recently, a film that was made in 1975 yet holds up extremely well, both as a timeless work of art and as something capable of speaking directly to me. In some ways I think that I haven't changed a single bit over the course of what has been my adult life. I still think this movie is just about the sexiest thing ever put on film, a story about two people who become best friends before consciously and deliberately deciding to be lovers.I don't even know where to begin as far as my praise for this beautiful film. I love everything about it, even the music remains wonderfully whimsical?a lot of movie scores from the 70s are woefully dated. Cousin, Cousine has soured me on a generation of American films that don't have the slightest clue about how to portray ordinary people. The central characters are a handsome couple but not movie star perfect. They haven't been air-brushed, surgically enhanced, and stair-mastered to within an inch of their lives. All of the characters in this movie have ordinary (if not dumb) jobs. Hollywood's idea of a normal person's job is an advertising executive, and forget about accurately portraying all of the other details of middle class life. I think it was this movie that started my prejudice for books and movies about ordinary people, people I can recognize from my own very ordinary life.If you haven't seen Cousin, Cousine I think you should give it a look, if you can find it. It should only take about the first 15 minutes or so to turn you into a Francophile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cousin, cousine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pleasant romantic comedy about French social mores with Barrault and Lanoux starring as cousins - by marriage - who first become friends who eventually fall in love. They finally have an affair, flaunting it beautifully to their entire family. Some early development of farce, but not taken far enough, although there is a wonderful funeral sequence where everyone seems preoccupied with other things, rather than a deceased member of the family. (Pascal incessantly looking at his watch; the children assuming the funeral is another party.)Great performances from Barrault and Lanoux highlight the fun. Barrault and the film were Oscar nominated in 1975.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charming Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in high school when it first came out.It is very charming and sweet.It was one of the first foreign languages I saw with subtitles. Since then I have been a strong follower of foreign films.It is interesting that there are some strongly negative responses in the other comments, that such a gentle sweet film can register such strong responses.I look at it as a bit of a fantasy ... that it is not there to really ask us to work out the nitty gritty of what happens to children or the other relationships. It sorta says ... how would you be in this situation? Anyway .. a very nice foreign film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so lightweight, it almost evaporates on the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two adult cousins go well beyond the kissing stage in this lighthearted French comedy, a popular choice for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, thanks in large part to its casually forthright attitude toward the joys of physical affection. The two lovers, each already married, are blithely unconcerned with the opinions of others, taking an altogether healthy pleasure in scandalizing their extended (bourgeois) family by retiring to the bedroom for hours on end during holiday reunions, and so forth. A surplus of natural charm, combined with a refreshing (and typically French) lack of romantic melodrama, make it an easy film to enjoy, and an unsurprising candidate for the inevitable glossy Hollywood remake, fourteen years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet, subtle, good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cousin Cousine" is a French comedy from 1975, directed by Jean-Charles Tacchella, who co- wrote the screenplay. We start at a post-wedding dinner which nailed post-wedding dinners: adults drunk, kids bored to tears, too much said for comfort. The plot is that Marthe (Marie-Christine Barrault) and Ludovic (Victor Lanoux) become friends, platonic at first, but we watch the relationship blossom into love, then reach fruition.The twist is that they are married. Marthe is married to Pascal (Guy Marchand) and Ludovic to Karine (Marie-France Pisier). Marthe and Ludovic meet at the wedding because Pascal and Karine are off having sex, and Marthe and Ludovic are having to wait for the couple to return. Marthe and Ludovic are distant cousins (he's cousin, she's cousine), but then everybody at the wedding is more or less related.It's a quiet, subtle comedy where not much ever happens. We just get to watch the blossoming of new love. The families, of course, know all (or imagine even more) that's going on between them, and Karine and Pascal are somewhat indignant at the goings on between the Marthe and Ludovic. But there's a whole movie in those other family members, so we get to spend some quality time with the aunts, uncles, and other cousins as we follow our lovers to other weddings and a funeral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a run-of-the-mill novelty from 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Retrospectively speaking, this French comedy's dark horse success mainly can be attributed to the fact that it opportunely corresponds with the sex liberation trend in the 1970s, not just a commercial hit in its homeland, it also has conquered the audience in North America, entering Oscar's BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM race, and most absurdly, it even procures two other nominations BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY, and BEST LEADING ACTRESS for Barrault. Why it is absurd? Simply because it is one of those out-of- the-blue nominations in Oscar's history which don't make any sense to even be encompassed as the fillers among the year's best. COUSIN COUSINE is about two cousins by marriage, Marthe (Barrault) and Ludovic (Laloux), she is married to a philandering Pascal (Marchand) and they have a teenage son, whereas he is in his second marriage with Karine (Pisier) and has a teenage girl from his first marriage. The film blithely opens with the wedding of Marthe's mother Biju (Garcin), the new husband is Ludovic's uncle, Marthe and Ludovic meet for the first time and they gradually grow a platonic affinity while Pascal and Karine enjoy a brief fling on which they turn a blind eye. Labelled as a Gallo farce with its radical anti-monotony feel-goodism, the film is not parsimonious to ridicule all its supporting characters as a mean to attest that the click between two soul-mates cannot be bridled by common shackle of marriage or morality, and quite obviously, the platonic slogan cannot sustain too long in a French romance. Still, Director and co-writer Jean-Charles Tacchella steadily presents their inappropriate relationship through the prism of family gatherings, a wedding first, a funeral follows, then another wedding and the film ends on Christmas eve, each time Marthe and Ludovic become more and more intimate, meanwhile, Pascal and Karine's senses of jealousy and exasperation become more and more comical to behold.Granted, one cannot speak ill of the nonchalant attitude and freewheeling spontaneity of the film's core romance, Barrault and Lanoux register convincing chemistry through the journey, sauntering with tacit rapport, sharing a knowing smile, revelling in their first-time copulation in a hotel, or bathing together; while facing their respective nuclear families, they never sink to awkward evasions or flagrant lies to their spouses or stage a scene to befit their own benefit.Guy Marchand occasions most of the buffoonery as a deplorable womaniser cannot overcome the blatant adultery of his wife, the only threatening moment comes when he fiddles with a pistol, but indeed he is really not that gruesome kind, he is vengeful truly, but not homicidal. Marie-France Pisier comes off appreciably as a jittery trophy wife who is much interested in her sleep therapy than her husband, openly admits she doesn't mind Ludovic's affair, but to really assimilate the facts and convey a healing process, it is another pair of shoes for her.Overall, this light-hearted relationship comedy is a run-of-the-mill novelty from 70s, actually it has spawned a Hollywood remake COUSINS (1989) by the very prosaic Joel Schumacher, and as expected, the rehash is a much more forgettable offering. However Tacchella's career has already hit its crest in his second feature and all his luck runs off since then, he retires permanently in 1999.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>COUSIN COUSINE (Jean-Charles Tacchella, 1975) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This popular French comedy deservedly received a lot of international acclaim and awards on its original release and still pleases when watched today almost 40 years later; apart from the Cesars and the Golden Globes, the film received 3 Oscar nominations for Best Foreign Film (which it lost to Ivory Coast's BLACK AND WHITE IN COLOR ? which I also caught up with just now), Best Actress (Marie-Christine Barrault losing out to NETWORK's Faye Dunaway) and Best Original Screenplay (again won by NETWORK). Interestingly enough, in both the Actress and Screenplay categories, there were two foreign nominees apiece: Barrault and Liv Ullman in Ingmar Bergman's FACE TO FACE and, for Screenplay, Lina Wertmuller's SEVEN BEAUTIES and, incidentally, both directors made the cut among the final 5 nominees for Best Direction! Barrault and her female co-star Marie-France Pisier (a Cesar winner herself here and, for my money, more deserving of an Oscar nod than the latter) are the only familiar names in a sympathetic cast; even director Tacchella seems to have been a one-hit wonder. Bafflingly, COUSIN COUSINE had been 'announced' as an upcoming Criterion title since the earliest days of DVD (in fact, the copy I watched culled from a US TV screening sports the tell-tale "Janus Film" header before the film's opening credits) but this release never came to pass! For what it is worth, this is one of the earliest examples of a Gallic success being revamped for Hollywood consumption, when it was remade by Joel Schumacher as COUSINS (1989) with Ted Danson, Isabella Rossellini and Sean Young.In any case, the plot line is simple enough: an extended family is reunited for two weddings and a funeral (anticipating the popular 1994 British farce FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL by 20 years!) and a series of infidelities come to the fore between two particular couples. Barrault's chronically womanizing husband (Guy Marchand) had been cheating on her with (among many others) the vulnerable Pisier, whose own restless spouse (Victor Lanoux) starts an initially secretly platonic but subsequently openly passionate affair with Barrault. There are several memorably delightful episodes which add to the charm of the film: during the wedding reception of Barrault's mother, the groom proposes to sing but when vetoed, proceeds to indulge in "mooning" (baring his buttocks in public); when Marchand decides after the opening wedding ceremony to mend his philandering ways, he is shown running from one flame to the next to end their relationship...ultimately being thrown off a bus by the burly female driver!; at the second marriage, Marchand again keeps getting into fisticuffs with the bridegroom's father, a former business partner who had defrauded him, etc. The whole is set to a jaunty musical accompaniment courtesy of yet another obscure element, one Gerard Anfosso.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seem to recall seeing an American version of this French film about about a woman in her early 30s meeting the nephew of her mother's new husband at her mother's wedding. The French version is able in just 96 minutes to capture the quirky personalities in all three generations as the extended family gathers again at another wedding, a funeral and a children's party. In the moments in between the gatherings, the two cousins get to know each other very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie about having an affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great. It was shown on Bravo cable channel here in America. I was a little buzzed from a night out and came back and found this flic on.I got it right at the beginning and was taken by the charming chemistry between the two cousins and the very sly and low-key nature of the relationship. That was a great part of the appeal of the movie for me. I also liked the two lead performances. Both were quite quietly confident and did not feel the need to throw themselves at the viewer in order to be seen.I enjoyed the fact that they thought about how best to get a rise out of their significant others. Well, I thought that was interesting and it showed two thoughtful people considering how best to achieve their goal and not totally consumed by lust. The reactions of the two effected spouses were very funny too. The two who were in the affair were very funny as they tried to contrive more and more ways to get back at their spouses. It was very interesting and not as glossed over as Hollywood films in which it takes the two cheating partners about 17.23 seconds to jump in the sack together. This movie played itself out and one could see how they moved from a platonic to a full relationship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danielle Thompson, one of the most consistent high quality screenwriters in late twentieth century French cinema, still had another fourteen years until she turned hyphenate (writer-director) when she wrote this charmer in 1975. Unmistakenly Gallic - other countries have attempted the basic premise succeeding only in snatching suet puddings from the jaws of souffles - it's lighter-than-air treatment of a heavy subject is note perfect not only in the two central performances but also in the wry portraits of their extended families beginning with their respective spouses and children and working outwards. Watching it for the first time some thirty-seven years after it hit the salles I was totally captivated by it's charm, dispensed via an eye-dropper and its overall enchantment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very much a product of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A French comedy about adultery. Two distant cousins meet at a wedding--Ludovic (Victor Lanoux) and Marthe (Marie-Christine Barrault). They're both married with children. They hit it off and become good friends. Their respective spouses think they're sleeping together. They're not but they decide why not try it?HUGE SPOILER!!! A BIG hit in the US (and even nominated for Best Foreign Film) this is a light-weight, fluffy and totally unremarkable film. It's flatly directed and the story wanders all over the place. It also presents adultery as being no big deal (!!!) At the beginning when Marthe's husband Pascal is breaking up with the multiple women he's been sleeping with it's presented as cute, charming and even funny! This was obviously long before AIDS but I still find that attitude pretty disgusting. Adultrey is not funny and cute and shouldn't be presented that way. Seriously, how about the kids in the respective families? Their feelings or thoughts are never bought up. To make it worse it ends with Marthe and Ludovic run away with each other and THIS is presented as a good thing!!!! The morals (or lack of them) in this film is bewildering. It gets a 4 only because the whole cast is good, it IS pleasant (if morally bankrupt) and Barrault and Lanoux play off each other well. There's also some minor female nudity. I can't recommend this at all but a lot of people liked it back in the 1970s. Use your own judgment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abominable look at failed, faithless marriages about which no one cares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Cousin, Cousine when it was released and saw it again this evening. In the guise of a light comedy (with twinkly peppy little music), this movie is virtually a dirge for matrimony but is yet more striking for the gaiety with which humiliation is deliberately caused the outsider, and the astonishing ease with which even youngsters treat their parents' abandonment of their marriages. It is an extraordinary movie - as foreign from reality in its treatment of the young children's reaction to their middle class parents' humiliation of their other parents before all their relations, as any science fiction movie. ***SPOILERS*** Moreover, the movie shows the utter indifference of those alive toward those newly dead - the impatience to leave the funeral, the distraction at the gravesite by the possibility of sex with an attractive stranger, an absence of family feeling so devastating that the brother of the deceased cannot get a single person from the family to lunch with him upon the funeral's conclusion - exams, work, swimming all take pre-eminence. Although presented as a "comedy", this is one of the gravest indictments of the destruction of the family. The protagonists: a man who's destroying his second marriage by his deliberate infliction of humiliation upon his second wife in front of his daughter - he pushes his wife into attempted suicide and attempted abandonment of her stepdaughter; and a woman who repeatedly says she sought to kill herself a year before, has previously been unfaithful to her husband and now does so again in spectacular fashion - before her young son. Their spouses: a man whose train of affairs has led him to merely 30 fewer than Casanova and a woman whose inability to cope with her husband's feckless approach to life (e.g., the changing of jobs every three years), has led her to most enjoy sleeping - these two will leave their spouses to have sex during the course of the wedding reception of their spouses' mother and uncle. In its portrayal of a family past all caring, the movie is fascinating. As the rest of the family celebrates the birth of Christianity in one room, two of the members commit adultery in the next - yet other family members pleased at the humiliation, prevent their interruption. The amazing thing is the absence of the humiliation's effects on the zombie-like remainder of the family who seem to romp: a) in the knowledge that their parents and children, sisters and cousins, will again divorce due to the betrayal of their spouses, and b) in the humiliation of their parents. But perhaps the effects are indeed there - one daughter announces her intention of killing all human beings - when she announces her retraction of the decision - it is only because human beings are not worth her trouble - and the other couple's son is often cranky - he wants to go home, but must wait for his father to finish sex with another. The stories the children tell each other all revolve around the debauchery of family members; the pictures the female child takes at weddings are of fornicating members of the family, the drunken exhibitionism of the grandfather, and the sickness of other drunken members. Toward the end of the movie, the girl announces to her grandfather that she had sex the previous week - the grandfather kisses her forehead! Perhaps the moviemaker does realize the awesome effects of the debauchery on the family. The movie is quite dark - the female protagonist asks that she be made to cry because she has never been able to do so - the male middle aged protagonist who shrugs when asked about what work he would ever like to do in life. Neither has any sympathy for the spouses upon whom they seek to inflict public humiliation as frequently as they can - at family weddings, at family funerals, at gatherings at restaurants. When one spouse leaves after attempted suicide, there is parental indifference and smiles by the children. **** End of Spoilers **** This is an amazingly creepy and depressing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To quote Mrs. Lovejoy, "What about the children?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the movie had just been about a man and a woman having an affair after their partners first had an affair, this might have been a good movie. The first unfaithful pair consisted of a guy who was a serial adulterer who should have needed a case of Viagra just to keep up with his many affairs and the lady was a self-involved neurotic. SO, when THEIR spouses get together and build a friendship and then eventually sleep together, you have some sympathy for them. BUT, what about the children? They both have kids (and one of them is pretty young), but all they are concerned about is their infatuation and getting back at their unfaithful spouses. While this might have been accepted by audiences when the film was released, I just felt this was ugly and selfish. They could have divorced their slimy spouses, but neither showed any regard for the innocent kids. The film is well-made but way too self-centered to have any positive lasting message.</fullReview>
