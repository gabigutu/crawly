		<fullReview>One of my long-term favourites. Horror-comedy with a mystery element. Bob Hope is in prime, breezy form here, and while the lines are good, his throwaway style of delivery and nervous energy puts the film over. The atmosphere of acceptance of the supernatural (in the zombie element of the movie)is reminiscent of "I Walked With a Zombie", which might sound like ridiculously high praise for a Bob Hope comedy, but it's probably best if you see the film and check it out. There's an element of racial stereotyping which some might find bothersome now. That said, Willie Best in the potentially offending role, gives a hilarious performance as "the family detainer". The comedy and horror elements complement rather than interfere with each other, the director and stars do a trememdous job, and this is one of the more enjoyable pure entertainment pictures you're likely to come across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way Before its Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picture this scene (mild spoilers): Shapely Paulette Goddard, `working girl, honest but tough', is swimming ashore from the hired boat that ferried her from mainland Cuba to the island she has inherited from a Cuban relative. The ferryman will not land on the island after nightfall because it is supposedly haunted by ghosts and zombies. It is midnight, there is fog on the water and the moon is out. Paulette carries afloat a minuscule pyramid-shaped celluloid tote bag, which contains a dressing gown and a pair of sandals, which is the sum total of her wardrobe in the remainder of the film. Her swimming cap, Hollywood-style, has left her long brown curls miraculously dry, fluffy and manageable. She makes her way through the ferns of the parrot-infested jungle and into the haunted castle's moonlit cathedral-like main hall. She calls for Larry (Bob Hope), who is supposed to meet her there. No one answers but the echo of her own voice. Suddenly overcome by the strangeness, loneliness and eeriness of her situation and surroundings, she starts hearing her own inner voice, whispering at first and then shouting more and more urgently: `Get out? Get out? before it's too late!' She goes to exit the castle hall when she is confronted by the vision of a moonlit Black zombie stumbling towards her with murder in his eyes. She lets out a piercing scream and runs to the castle's monumental staircase. Her white bathrobe gets caught on a splinter of the balustrade. For interminable moments, she tries to free herself, immobile as in a nightmare where the dreamer runs to no avail. Finally the bathrobe tears apart, revealing one half of her swimsuit-clad body and her beautiful, long legs. She rushes upstairs and disappears behind the first door she sees.What is remarkable about this scene is that every one of its elements is now a cinematic cliché that didn't exist before `Ghost Breakers' was shot. Everything from the script, the atmospheric lighting and photography, to the wardrobe, the sets and the music is a precedent-setting tour de force that would inspire all the Universal Studio horrors to come without ever being equalled for suspense and immediacy. And this is a Bob Hope comedy?I love this film because it is really before its time. It's a successful blend of mystery, horror, chills and fine comedy. Bob Hope's manservant Alex (Willie Best) has all the best lines, which come in very handy to defuse some of the tension created by the most atmospheric package to ever grace an American movie screen until that time. The film never stops being intriguing from the opening scene of a thunderstorm above Manhattan to the hilarious epilogue. The night photography of the moonlit castle is especially gripping. The theatrical trailer for this film (which comes with both the VHS and the DVD version) is probably the first known instance of the use of the theremin in a film soundtrack. How cool is that!This is also one of Bob Hope's funniest performances and a great way to remember him.P.S.: Like many commentators, I first saw this film on the late show as a kid and remembered it as the most chilling horror picture I had ever seen and only got to understand the jokes later. It's really that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Bob Hope Who-Done-It Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Hope comes to his own as one of the screen's best comedic actors of the 40s. Following his successful mystery/comedy THE CAT AND THE CANARY, Paramount was wise to recast he and Paulette Goddard as the romantic pair of the picture. Add the colorful (no pun intended) Willie Best as Hope's sidekick, a creative script, George Marshall's direction, two Anthony Quinns and you have movie magic. This, walking Zombies, crisp dialogue and real live ghosts floating about in a dark, dank deserted castle with flying bats and that long winding staircase and it's actually scary, even for television. I saw the original in the movie house and remember, although I was very young (ha ha) how it scared me.And, of course, I fell in love with Paulette.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic Hope investigates a haunted island off the coast of Cuba</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movie fans who were raised seeing Bob Hope strictly in the slightly depressing films he made during the 1960s and his periodic TV specials may be surprised to learn that in the 1940s he was one of the best "fast patter' comedians working on the radio and in films. Generally playing a coward who still managed to come up on top in circumstances over which he had no control, the comic starred in a number of successful films.I admittedly have a preference for "old dark house" mysteries, and I spent years trying to catch up on this one. The only version of the script which had been readily available through the 1970s was the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis remake, SCARED STIFF, which used the basic premise but altered some of the gags and inserted musical numbers.The action opens in New York City where Lawrence "Larry" Lawrence (Hope) is preparing for a radio broadcast as the city is hit by a storm-created blackout. Larry broadcasts gossip which includes, with tacit approval from the mob, news on some of the local crime kingpins. Unfortunately, his latest broadcast annoys Frenchy Duval (Paul Fix), and Larry is invited over for a few straight facts.In the meantime, one of Larry's listeners is conferring with a lawyer who informs her she's inherited an island off the Cuban Coast. Mary Carter (Paulette Goddard) is thrilled at the news and makes plans to sail at once, in spite of the island's grim reputation as a hotspot for ghosts and worse. Fending off an offer from an unnamed third party to buy the island, she starts packing.Larry arrives at Duval's hotel, which happens to also be the one where the heiress is staying. Suspecting he's in for more trouble than he can handle (i.e., any at all), Larry borrows a gun from his servant Alex (Willie Best). When a mysterious stranger is shot at the hotel, Lawrence panics --- assuming he killed the man -- and ends up in Mary's room. The police arrive and she offers him refuge.Picking her trunk as his hiding place, Larry winds up aboard her cruise ship. Spotting a death threat that had been delivered to her stateroom, he decides that he and Alex will stay and protect her.En route to Cuba, they encounter Geoff Montgomery (Richard Carlson, starting his move away from playing college-aged characters), with whom Mary's tokenly acquainted. He offers to play guide once they arrive in Havana.Mary vanishes from a nightclub, heading out to heck out the island by night. Larry and a reluctant Alex hire a rowboat and also make for the isle. Arriving, they briefly examine the hut of a local woman with a "zombie son" (Noble Johnson in a fairly creepy, deadpan performance) and proceed on to the bay haunted castle.It quickly becomes obvious that there's someone else on the island. Alex and Larry have a run-in with a real ghost and the zombie son. Mary arrives and, her clothing torn, puts on a dress once owned by an ancestor for which she's a deal not so dead ringer. This confuses the zombie long enough for them to lock him away.Investigating the cellars, Larry and Mary find her lawyer in one of the coffins. He'd been attacked by the mysterious individual who had wanted to purchase the island. He dies before he can reveal the killer -- only giving a cryptic clue. This turns out to be a hint at a fabulous treasure hidden underneath the castle.The killer makes himself known, but is dispatched before he can eliminate the witnesses.A fun little outing, and a decent example of one of the fairly early sound "old house" mysteries. These films were popular in the silent era, generally pitting one or more characters against an unknown killer in a rambling, storm-tossed mansion. Hope and Goddard had also starred in a sound remake of one of the better known of these creakers, THE CAT AND THE CANARY.GHOST BREAKERS is well worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Hope's Funniest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my few Bob Hope "keepers," not that I didn't like the man; i just found most of his movies too corny.However, as corny as this one is, too, and stupid and silly in parts, it's also very funny and very entertaining.....and that's the name of that tune, as "Baretta" used to say. The story moves fast, exhibiting that entertainment value, and has a good mixture of comedy, drama, horror and romance. Paulette Goddard is a very attractive, likable female lead and Willie West provides a lot of laughs as Hope's valet-friend. Yes, his Negro role is degrading, so a warning to those who would be very offended at that. It was interesting to see Anthony Quinn in this early role in his career.All in all, a movie that a lot other folks would agree is one of Hope's funniest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willie Best at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Hope's early movies were rare gems to be watched over and over. Even the Road pictures with Bing are still fun. Too many of today's viewers only remember Bob's turkeys such as "A Global Affair," "I'll Take Sweden," and "Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number." These viewers would be surprised to see a fresh young comic that could quip with the best of them. Another able funny man Willie Best, who never got his due because of the racial stereotyping rampant in Hollywood at the time, makes a better sparring partner for Bob than anyone else including Bing Crosby, although Crosby and Hope were also a winning combination with plenty of chemistry between them. The inspired teaming of Hope and Best reminds one of the later inspired teaming of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. In "The Ghost Breakers" Bob Hope and Willie Best are together through much of the picture. So each is able to strut his stuff. Many of the asides and lines are as fresh and humorous today as in 1940. For example, Geoff Montgomery (Richard Carlson) tells Larry Lawrence (Bob Hope) that A zombie has no will of his own. You see them sometimes walking around blindly with dead eyes, following orders, not knowing what they do, not caring. Hope replies, "You mean like Democrats." Would many Americans find that amusing today? I think so. As for Best and Hope. Hope tells Best that if he sees two ghosts running down the stairs, "Let the first one by because that one will be me." Best retorts, "If you see another one pass you,let him go because that one will be me." And the fun continues at a scatter gun pace.An added attraction is the wonderful and beautiful Paulette Goddard. She and Hope make a charming couple. Yes, when he was young, Bob was considered a romantic leading man to some extent. Never taking himself too seriously Hope would later use this earlier image as a continual joke.The story based on a Paul Dickey play is also a good one. Goddard inherits a supposedly haunted plantation in Cuba. Bob, who thinks he committed a murder, accidentally ends up aboard ship with her. Are the ghosts real or is someone trying to scare her away from her inheritance? If so, who? Watch and see. Getting there is a lot of fun, combined with thrills and chills aplenty along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob Hope's best movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Hope's death really shocked me. Not that I knew him personally, or thought about him often. In fact at that time I doubt if I had ever re-watched one of his movies for at least ten years. But it saddened me nevertheless.You see, during my early teens, it was often only Bob and his movies that kept me going, that made me survive the hostility (well, that's how it seemed to me at the time) of life at school. I devoured any book on Hope that I could lay my hands one, caught as many movies as television broadcast, good ones bad ones, I saw the lot.After school ended (in the mid-eighties), I discovered that I didn't need Bob any more. I gradually stopped watching his movies, gradually forgot all about him as I forgot my teenage worries. His death changed all that, like the burst of adrenaline you get when you slam hard on the brake, the memories flooded back. I ordered several DVD's; re- watched his movies with new interest.The Ghost Breakers was a favourite of mine as a teenager and age hasn't diluted its quality. The ?forties was Hope's decade and he was never the same after it. Perhaps he needed the danger that the war years provided, as, in his best movies, the comedian thrives on danger. His was an uncertain world, with death at every elbow, yet, while not a hero, he managed to survive and come out top (perhaps it was this quality that my adolescent mind grasped on to). In The Ghost Breakers, the supernatural chills are there and are still effective; the zombie in particular, remains a very eerie creation. In fact, there are times when it is easy to forget that this is a Bob Hope comedy and not a straight horror movie (you can easily imagine, that Val Lewton, say, was out in the original audience, taking notes).Hope is helped by the cast. Sexy Paulette Goddard reunited from the almost as good The Cat And The Canary, Anthony Quinn, perhaps a villain, perhaps a good guy. While Hope and the splendid Willie Best make an ideal partnership (though Best is sadly politically-incorrect these days).Atmospheric, chilling and very funny, this is how I will always remember Bob.Cheers Bob and thanks for the memories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite films because it has a perfect balance of comedy, a strong sense of place, and it takes its ghost seriously. Beautiful production design and photography! The old dark house is beautifully set up. I highly recommend this. A sequel to "Cat and the Canary" with Bob Hope. Ghost Breakers resides alongside the more serious "Uninvited" and "The Innocents" as a perfect ghost story.</fullReview>

It also has a diverting , intriguing plot, suspense, and an eerie, funny old house part towards the end . The old house one is a fine set, and you won't have a clue who done it till the end. Paulette Goddard looks fetching, and the film is dated only by black stereotyping. The zombie scene works both seriously and as a spoof. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies and Ghosts and Murder, Oh My</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Bob Hope first signed with Paramount what they had in mind for him were some B picture comedies playing the bottom half of double bills. Mr. Hope proved he was considerably more than that and his two films with Paulette Goddard and the film Never Say Die with Martha Raye proved he was a box office attraction.The Ghost Breakers is the second of two Hope did with Paulette Goddard, the first being The Cat and the Canary. In this one Hope is Lawrence Lawrence Lawrence from parents as he said with a lack of imagination. He's a Walter Winchell type radio broadcaster and columnists and he spills some gangster information as Winchell was wont to do many times. Of course Winchell had the best source of information going in J. Edgar Hoover whereas Hope has raspy voiced stoolie Tom Dugan as his source.When a story gets a little too close to home, Hope gets a summons from one of the gangland lords for a conference. But in the same hotel is Paulette Goddard who has just been warned by Anthony Quinn not to close a deal on a castle in an island off Cuba. When Quinn gets murdered Hope thinks he did it and Goddard and he are soon involved in every which way possible.On my VHS copy is the trailer for The Ghost Breakers in which it's advertised that this new Bob Hope film will feature his 'boy' Syracuse played by Willie Best. Of course this is a play on Jack Benny's valet Rochester. Would that Willie Best was as fast on the uptake in putting down Hope as Eddie Anderson was as Rochester. Instead Best had to endure the indignity of being referred to as 'boy' in the trailer. He played the part as servile as the norm. Funny thing was his name in the film was Alex, he was never referred to as Syracuse.Still the film does have its funny moments, especially when Hope and Goddard arrive at the haunted mansion. It's obvious there is more than ghosts haunting this place and Director George Marshall has a nice group of suspects to throw at us with Anthony Quinn, Paul Lukas, Richard Carlson, and Lloyd Corrigan. Yes, I did say Anthony Quinn who plays his own twin brother.At the end it's actually Willie Best who saves them all. But what a surprise ending it would have been if Best had been the real villain of the piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite horror-comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like others, I first saw this as a kid and was so scared I didn't realize it was supposed to be a comedy. I watched it again last night and was still impressed by how effective the horror scenes are. Noble Johnson in his subtle but terrific zombie make-up is as chilling as anything in a "straight" horror film of the period. The sets are great and the cinematography wonderfully atmospheric. George Marshall was a very underrated director and his pictorial sense is frequently stunning (note the two shot of Paulette Goddard in her period costume and the painting of her ancestor on the wall). Goddard is strikingly pretty and charming, Bob Hope seems fresh and energetic (and very effective in some of his straight moments) and Willy Best gets to shed his "scared darky" persona and play a funny and reasonably straight role. Those who've commented on the humiliating racial stereotype Best seems to be playing here are understandably confused. THE GHOST BREAKERS is years ahead of its time in its treatment of Best's character. This is a guy who began his career under the stage name "Sleep'n'Eat", yet here he plays a rational and reasonably intelligent character named Alex, a comic sidekick but one that might easily have been played by Edward Everett Horton or any number of white actors. He's the one who figures out that Hope couldn't be a murderer because he was carrying the wrong caliber gun, and while he's as scared of a zombie as anybody would be he also pitches into the fight when the monster has to be subdued. If Best didn't consider this one of the best (sorry about that) roles of his career I'd be very surprised.</fullReview>

Bob Hope's humour as "Larry Lawrence" is at its best. The leading lady and sidekick-man servant support characters really compliment the lead actor. The story line is funny and scary at the same time. I feel the special effects of the "ghost" were superb for the time it was filmed. It still sends chills down my spine &amp; roll with laughter.

		<shortDescription>Comedy Classic--Bob Hope, a Mysterious Castle, and a Great Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This I assert is one of the most-imitated films and the funniest of all time. The producers for once let Bob Hope play a real person; one whose reactions in an extreme situation involving zombies, gangsters, death threats and the need for derring-do made his sensible fears seem believably. In fact, I suggest that the complex plot works quite well. delivering a realistic background to the comedic doings. The great George Marshall did a beautiful job keeping the action going, as he almost always did. Credit for the involving and hilarious story and screenplay are due to Walter DeLeon for the screenplay itself and Paul Dickey and Charles W. Goddard for the play from which it was adapted. The storyline concerns a lovely young woman (Paulette Goddard, the sex-symbol of her era) who inherits a castle on a small island just off Havana, Cuba. Her romantic co-star in the film is Bob Hope as a radio personality, Lawrence Lawrence Lawrence. She is warned off by Senor Perada (Paul Lukas), who tells her everyone who has spent a night in the castle has gone mad. In the meantime, a gangster takes exception to Hope's broadcast and send a man to kill him. Hope believes he has shot the man, really killed by Perada; so he ends up fleeing to Cuba, and helping Goddard. An old acquaintance of hers, played amiably by Richard Carlson, and twin brothers played by a young Anthony Quinn (one of them the murder victim)complicate matters; so do some hard-to-explain zombies, and sinister accomplices of various sizes. Without a scorecard it is difficult to separate the players, but one of the most important is Hope's aide, ably played by master straightman Willie Best without a trace of racial stereotyping; he is loyal, at least as brave as his boss and a great asset to the movie. There is the usual treasure that is causing the villains to scare off the normals; and there is a surprise ending, which I will not divulge. In their parts, Hope is at the top of his considerable powers; Goddard has a merely o.k. voice but has the character strength and charisma necessary to her essentially decorative role as a young woman. Willie Best is outstanding as Hope's sidekick and straight man; Anthony Quinn is promising, young and sullen as twin gangsters; Richard Carlson does a bright job of playing off-type as a duplicitous villain; and Paul Lukas is extremely powerful as Senor Perada, a wonderfully villainous red herring. others in the large and attractive cast include Pedro de Cordoba, Virginia Brissac, Tom Dugan, Lloyd Corrigan, and minor roles by Robert Ryan and Douglass Kennedy. The film's fine cinematography was done by veteran Charles Lang; the music was supplied by Ernest Toch and Victor Young 9uncredited). Art direction by Hans Dreier and Robert Usher was outstanding and atmospheric; Edith Head did the costumes and the interior decorations were the work of A.E. Freudman. The film to my eyes is stylish, consistent and varied; from the sailing into Havan harbor to the sequences in and under the castle to the shipboard and preceding city scenes, everything is beautiful, funny and of a piece. A comedy classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bob Hope made some wonderful, fun movies in the '40s, and "The Ghost Breakers" costarring Paulette Goddard, Paul Lukas, Willie Best, and Richard Carlson is a prime example. Anthony Quinn has two small double roles in an early appearance for him.Hope is a radio gossip who talks about the mob and sometimes upsets them; Goddard is a woman who has just inherited a castle in Cuba. The two intersect at a hotel after a shooting which Hope thinks he committed. He ends up in her trunk and therefore, in Cuba with her, along with Lukas, Best, and Carlson, an old friend of Goddard's. The castle is supposedly haunted, and some mighty strange things occur while Hope and Best investigate.This is a great haunted house mystery with Hope letting the zingers fly at a rapid pace. There was something about the younger Hope that is terribly appealing. He brings a boyishness and an energy to these '40s roles that was lost later on. Goddard is beautiful and lively, Lukas excellent as the mysterious Parada. Though there is some political incorrectness, Willie Best and Hope spar as equals. The film keeps a strong atmosphere, with the scenes of thunder and lightning in the beginning especially effective. And that haunted castle - yikes. Call a ghost breaker!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pioneering Comedy/Haunted House Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The old studio system had at least one advantage over the methods used for movies today. No matter how wacky the premise of the movie, they worked from a script. From the opening crash and thunder of the storm that is pummeling New York City to the closing credits, you can tell this story was carefully crafted from beginning to end. Paulette is a delight to watch as she brings her sparkling and happy personality to an environment which would scare the crap out of most people. Bob Hope always thinks he is bigger than he is, and we are terrified along with him as he jokes and pans his way through this classic and original haunted house film. His valet delivers a delightful performance which is now not considered to be politically correct, but in the context of comedy, which is the way it was meant to be, is right on target. A movie which knows where it is going, because of the well-written and well-directed script, will take you on a beautiful journey of light entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bob Hope is Larry Lawrence, a radio personality who thinks he has committed murder. He meets Mary Carter (Paulette Goddard) and she unknowingly helps him out of his jam. Mary is on her way to Cuba to visit the supposed haunted mansion she has inherited. But Mary has more problems than a few ghosts. It seems that someone is willing to commit murder to keep her from taking possession of her inheritance. Larry agrees that one good turn deserves another and decides to go to Cuba to help Mary.The Ghost Breakers is a very entertaining mix of comedy and horror. Unlike a lot of movies of this type, much of the comedy is actually quite funny and some of the horror is actually quite chilling. While much of the best comedic material is delivered by Larry's servant, Willie Best, Larry has one of the best lines I've heard recently. When told that "A zombie has no will of his own. You see them sometimes walking around blindly with dead eyes, following orders, not knowing what they do, not caring", Larry's response "You mean like Democrats" had me laughing out loud.As for the horror, the haunted house set is one of the better examples I've seen in this kind of movie. It's the stuff of nightmares with its creepy corridors, secret passages, and ghostly activity. Add to that the "zombie" couple who guard the island and you've got some fairly effective horror elements.Hope and Goddard make a great team. They work together effortlessly and make a very natural, believable pair. Best does his "best" to rise above the standard 1940s servant role and shines in many scenes. The rest of the cast is more than adequate.Overall, The Ghost Breakers is one of the movies I've wanted to see for a long while and I'm glad I finally got the chance. My only complaint and the thing that keeps me from rating the movie any higher is that it's far too easy to spot the bad guys. Still, I had a lot of fun with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ghost Breakers is a sort of sequel to Paramount's 1939 hit The Cat and the Canary, also starring Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard. Directed by George Marshall {who would direct the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis 1958 remake, Scared Stiff, as well} it's adapted by Walter DeLeon from the play The Ghost Breaker by Paul Dickey and Charles W. Goddard. The premise is simple, after mistakenly thinking he has shot a hoodlum type, Larry Lawrence {Hope} flees into another hotel room, that of Mary Carter {Goddard}, who is packing for a trip to Cuba. Befriending her, it's not before long that Larry is on his way to Cuba as well, but Mary is under threat from shifty characters and to make mattes worse, their destination castle is rumoured to be haunted and tales of zombies seem to carry some weight.Hope and Goddard really do have a rich chemistry here and the results are excellent to say the least. They would work again for a third time a year later in Nothing But the Truth. But really it's with the writing that most credit is due here. Hope of course was an excellent deliverer of a line, but first you have to have quality lines to work from, and here with DeLeon's screenplay we get some delightful stuff for Hope to work with. From Basil Rathbone to sly political leg pulling, the gags come quick and fast and compliment the visual fun as Hope, Goddard and Willie Best are all aboard the fun creeper express. Charles Lang is on photography duties and captures the eerie atmosphere of the island perfectly, while a nod of approval should go to Edith Head for her costumes.Ultimately it's fun we want and fun we get, with a cowardly hero and a sexy leggy lady as our protagonists, one can only hope the zombies don't get in the way too much. As either a stand alone movie or as a double bill with The Cat And The Canary, The Ghost Breakers showcases a fine double act, from a fine time in cinema. Enjoy 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather enjoyable light-hearted ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just watched The Ghost Breakers for the first time and rather enjoyed it and was creepy in parts.A woman has just inherited a castle on a small island which turns out to be haunted. She goes over there with some other people and as soon as they arrive, they become nervous. They are terrorised by bats, phantoms and a zombie. They also discover some treasure. After a final battle, they leave. A good decision.We have a thunderstorm in this movie, but not at the castle where you would expect. This happens in New York.The Ghost Breakers reunites Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard from The Cat and the Canary and are joined by Richard Carlson (Creature From the Black Lagoon), Paul Lukas (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea) and an early role for Anthony Quinn. The zombie is played by King Kong actor Noble Johnson. Good parts from all.I rather enjoyed The Ghost Breakers, even though it is a comedy which I am not a huge fan of. Great fun.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic film this was. Depending on your point of view of course it had everything in it: thrills, chills, love, laughter and legs. Decent and atmospheric photography, direction and acting too ? yes, just another throwaway Bob Hope Paramount movie! They pumped them out cheaply yet seemingly effortlessly created films people still watch with pleasure generations later ? will the same go for todays crop of romcoms?The story opens in the middle of the storm of the century, with plenty of low light opportunity for sinister and brooding candle shadows and Bob Hope's endless quips about it. Paulette Goddard plays Mary Carter the beautiful heiress to a castle in Cuba who goes there to check it out against all the stern warnings, and with dashing radio dj Lawrence L. Lawrence from the class of 32 who thinks he's being hunted by the cops for murder. It seems the property is ghost and zombie infested, of which something neither of them believe, although Hope's manservant Willie Best isn't doubting it for a second. Amidst all the smart ass one liners from Hope and Best there's even a couple of genuinely spooky scenes, especially the zombie on his bed turning his head to look (dead) at them and the transparent ghost getting out of the casket at midnight to take a stroll around to their decided consternation. As for the "castle" itself - where apparently no one had lived for twenty years even though someone had died there only two months before ? the sets are simple and simply perfect in their spookiness.Serious people will probably have a problem overlooking the white master/black servant relationship depicted, but compared to many other Hollywood films from the era Best is almost treated as an equal and Hope really reduced only once to a rude imperiousness to Best. Just as well the organ grinder gag had it as Best and his tame monkey though! But if not always apparent the white superiority was inferred and always latent; it's an annoying ancient custom which will eventually result in all films like this being banned then burned. It doesn't always follow that enlightenment brings about intelligence and toleration.It's smart and swift with no scene lasting too long, no point to make or axe to grind, with a knockout abrupt conclusion that doesn't stand up to a re-view so pay attention! It's always a joy to watch and listen to a guy at the top of his game; I think this is one of Hope's best films and as a comedy-horror (olde style) also probably the best of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ghost Breakers is a black and white movie from 1940 Starring Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard.Bob Hope plays a New York City radio newscaster, named Larry Lawrence that specializes in political gossip. When he inadvertently offends a local gangster, his attempt to get back into the gangster's good graces results in him being accused of a murder he didn't commit.Enter Paulette Goddard as Mary Carter a damsel in distress who has just inherited a haunted castle in Cuba. To escape the police and impress the beautiful damsel in distress Larry accompanies her to Cuba. (1940 Cuba is pre-Castro) Upon arrival at the castle they are met by a zombie, a witch doctor and a genuine ghost...but THEY aren't the villains of the piece! This movie pokes fun at stereotypical ghost stories without grossing you out. This parody is pure INNOCENT fun. No, fancy special effects, no blood or gore, just plain simple FUNNY characters reacting to exaggerated circumstances</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Comedy/Horror Movies Of The '40s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly one of the best comedy/horror movies of the 1940s--perhaps of all time--and almost on a par with the great "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), the 1940 reremake of "The Ghost Breakers" manages the tricky balance between yukyuks and chills with considerable deftness. In this one, Bob Hope plays a radio personality named Lawrence Lawrence Lawrence (his parents had no imagination, he tells us), who escapes the Mob and the cops by hiding in Paulette Goddard's steamer trunk Paulette's just inherited a creepy haunted mansion off the coast of Cuba, and before you know it, the two are up to their jutting eyeballs in bats, ghosts, murder attempts and zombies. Hope's character is surprisingly suave and dashing in this film, and much less cowardly than usual (if just as fast with the one-liners). Paulette is vivacious, spunky and incredibly beautiful (whotta smile!), and Hope's valet, Willie Best, doesn't embarrass us too much with his stereotyped '40s "yes, massuh" black humor. The film provides numerous laff-out-loud lines (and I'm not an easy person to make laff out loud) and several scenes that really do chill...especially Noble Johnson's appearance as a blank-eyed zombie. Paulette's Gothic-looking mansion, with its glass-coffined mummies, is quite eerie, and, as in "A&amp;C Meet Franky," the actors play their parts arrow straight. This film, I might add, is perfect for the kiddies, too, and the crisp-looking DVD offered here, loaded with extras, only adds to the enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have watched the movie over 300 times. It is one of my favorite movies,I was lucky enough to have talked to Mr. Quinn about the movie. Mr. Quinn was in Chicago at the time filming,Only the Lonely. Mr. Quinn stated that Bob was always joking around on the set. and Miss Goddard was a real beauty and they all enjoyed each others company. The sets all where very well constructed and real spooky,said Mr. Quinn. The Zombie and his Mother scared everyone,even visitors to the set. Mr. Quinn:stated his salary was about $5,000 dollars,he said after all he played twins.This movie to me is a great film,the sets are by far the best,So real is the painting of Paulette. Mr. Best is truly a great actor and Mr. Hope knew this as he chose him for the role. The entire cast is truly doing their best to have you in the mood for mystery and more. You feel that you are in Cuba,in the Castle,with the Zombie,seeing the Ghost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Haunted House Comedy with Bob Hope as Larry L. Lawrence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early Bob Hope vehicle features the lovely Paulette Goddard at the peak of her beauty and under-appreciated Black comedian Willie Best in probably the finest work he ever did in film.Haunted house comedies are a unique genre, because it is so difficult to successfully blend the spooky and potentially dangerous aspects of the supernatural with the humorous possibilities usually lurking under the surface in such situations. Hope and Goddard pulled off an enjoyable haunted house romp in the earlier "Cat and the Canary" (1939) but "Ghost Breakers" tops it.For fans of such films, I heartily recommend that you seek out a rather obscure movie directed by George Marshall ( the same director who gave us "Ghost Breakers") titled "Murder, He Says" (1945). This time the comic lead is played by Fred MacMurray as a hapless pollster and the film is more in the slapstick vein----but it is very funny nevertheless. Unfortunately, "Murder, He Says" is hard to find.What a pity that Hope and Best did not work together again (except for the forgettable "Nothing but the Truth" (1942). The great chemistry between them is obvious. However, the times being what they were, such strong bi-racial pairings were very difficult to pull off in Hollywood during the Studio Era. This one is really quite special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bob Hope is energetic in this spooky comedy. Paulette Goddard is very good though seeing her now, I wish she could have gotten more film roles. The supporting cast is very good including classic support by Willie Best who always adds to any film he is in. Overall, this one of this story is much better than Scared Stiff, the inferior Martin &amp; Lewis remake.Goddard inherits Black island near Cuba. As soon as she does, she starts receiving threats &amp; offers to sell it. Hope is a radio show man whose show exposes the goings on of mobsters. His chance encounter with Goddard happens in a hotel where a mobster has called him to straighten out some details about his last radio show before his vacation.Then, Hope mistakenly thinks he shot &amp; murdered someone at the hotel &amp; wind up with hiding in Goddards trunk &amp; stowing away on the liner heading for Cuba. From Cuba, they all wind up on the mysterious island populated by zombies, ghosts, &amp; a delightful little mystery. Hope has a few punchlines. Bob Hope referred to Best, as his comedic co-star in The Ghost Breakers (1940), as one of the finest talents he had ever worked with.It's all very funny &amp; this film kind of set up the model that Hopes solo comedy films would use in different variations throughout his career when he wasn't with Bing. If you haven't seen this, it runs about 90 minutes &amp; is a pleasant diversion. A clip from it about Democrats is very popular on You Tube.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Bob Hope's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all of Bob Hope's films, this one is my favorite. It has a fast, funny plot and a creepy, crawly ghost story that fits in well with it. Hope and Best share the funny quips and one-liners between them as Hope flees New York for a murder he didn't commit. He runs head on into beautiful Paulette Goddard who is in trouble so he tries to help her. Years before Ghostbusters became a media frenzy, he passes himself off as a ghost breaker, it's like a tax breaker but with ghosts he explains. The spooky atmosphere and the jokes run very well side by side although the zombie angle is a bit tagged on and unnecessary. This movie, though, was again spoofed with less satisfactory results with Martin and Lewis years later, but even with Hope and Crosby in a cameo, it couldn't be saved. This movie is the superior version of the original screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amid thunderclaps and flashes of lightning Bob Hope turns to Willie Best and quips, "Basil Rathbone must be giving a party!" And it goes on that way thoughout a fast-paced comedy mixing thrills, chills and horror in a fun way, as did an earlier Hope film, 'The Cat and the Canary' (which, by the way, has never been released to video for copyright reasons). Bob plays a bumbling radio man being chased by gangsters. On the lam, he runs into Paulette Goddard, who has just inherited a haunted castle off the coast of Cuba. When he inadvertently becomes a part of her luggage (this you gotta see to believe), he ends up on the ship to Cuba and from that point on the plot thickens with zombies, ghosts and all kinds of supernatural mayhem thrown in for both horror and comic effects. Anthony Quinn turns up in a double role, as does Richard Carlson--but it's Hope and his fast-paced comic timing that makes the movie so watchable. Paulette makes an excellent foil for his quips and looks pretty wonderful as the nervous heroine. My dim memory of 'Cat and the Canary' (with the same two stars) makes me feel it was even spookier than this--with all the old dark house thrills--a murderer's hand reaching out through a secret wall panel, false bookcases concealing dark passageways, mysterious housekeeper, numerous suspects, etc., but until that film becomes available this one will do just fine! The Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis-Lizabeth Scott remake ('Scared Stiff) in the 1950s was passable but not half as scary as this one.</fullReview>

I didn't dislike him or anything, but his brand of humor is just not mine. Typically I prefer the biting wit of the Marx brothers or Lubitsch. But here, he surprised me (though it was more the plot than him).We have one of the early Hollywood zombie stories, in the same era as "White Zombie" and "I Walked With a Zombie". This is not as "horror", but should definitely get more notice by the historians because they really make a point of describing Haitian (or Cuban?) voodoo. There is also a scene that I feel must have inspired "The Goonies", though I don't know how to confirm it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie in "Spooky Haunted House" Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Ghost Breakers is probably the greatest movie in the "spooky haunted house genre" of the B&amp;W era. Bob Hope is in top form, Paulette Goddard does her usual first-rate job and Willie Best puts in an amazing performance. The minor characters are played by wonderful character actors, with some roles, such as Quinn's, foreshadowing the actors' future success.The film really is in two parts: The first part is set in Manhattan and on the cruise ship to Cuba. The second part is after Hope, Best and Goddard's characters arrive in Cuba. I think the first half is the better, but the second part is the spookier.I've seen this classic probably 100 times, and I never tire of it. I watch it over and over, and it just gets better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This early Bob Hope movie hits all the right tones...mostly because of the ghost/zombie angle.My sisters and I saw this as kids. What a surprise! It starts with the usual comedy role for Hope, but then the movie transfers to Cuba. Lovely Paulette Goddard is there and the wonderful Willie Best who I love dearly. There's a surprise cameo by a very young and handsome Anthony Quinn. And of course, the ghost and zombie. Actually the ghost scene where he rises from his glass coffin was the part that truly scared me as a kid. The zombie was an added attraction.This movie was funny, creepy and delicious. I still look for it on TCM, and I might try to get it on DVD.ABOUT WILLIE BEST: By the way, if you read biographies of black actors like Willie Best, you will find that they remained employed when others were treated like dirt and getting paid for much less than other men doing the same job, and to quote the wonderful Hattie McDaniel....when questioned about playing a Maid, (earning $700 a week!)...."I'd rather Play a Maid than be One.!"</fullReview>

However, she accidentally gets a couple of chaperones when broadcaster Bob Hope (Lawrence Lawrence Lawrence) and his valet Willie Best (Alex) make a get-a-way from a murder scene. The three of them head for Cuba and the haunted house despite warnings that Goddard will be killed if she sets foot there. There are a cast of suspects that pop up, but can you guess who the villain is? This film starts on a fantastic stormy night. It's a great start to the film as you settle into a comedy that makes you feel safe with a cast that are all a joy to watch. We travel through some amusing situations and then, about two-thirds of the way through?. Bam??!......., we hit genuine spookiness. When we arrive at the haunted house, and we see zombie Noble Johnson and his mother Virginia Brissac, we could easily be in a creepy horror film. They are very convincing.The set for the house is perfect and we get memorable sequences unfolding there, for example Paulette Goddard coming down the stairs dressed in a black dress as portrayed in a giant portrait above the staircase. This is eerie stuff worthy of a true chiller.I have to say that it is one of the few times that a film succeeds with the comedy/creepy house combination. Such films usually fall flat on both counts. Not here. The film resolves itself neatly and is an entertaining way to pass the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this isn't all that funny a film, it is pleasant and enjoyable and a lot better than most of Bob Hope's films. In general, I have found that I liked Hope's earlier films far more than the ones he did in the 50s onward--they just seem fresher and more compelling.Bob and Willie Best come to the rescue of poor little old Paulette Goddard. She has inherited a mansion in Cuba, but she receives warnings and threats NOT to take possession--of she will die!! While I have read several places that this is a remake of THE CAT AND THE CANARY, I just didn't see this at all--and I recently saw both films. While it is somewhat reminiscent, they are really very, very different films. Both are worth seeing, though.By the way, there are some tacky remarks concerning mentally retarded people in the film that were not at all unusual for the day, and some might take offense to Best's character. However, compared to many of the other characters played by Best in previous films (when he was billed as "Sleep 'n' Eat" instead of "Willie Best"), his portrayal is pretty responsible and avoids most of the usual "black man in a haunted house" clichés.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob, Paulette Goddard , WIllie Best &amp; George Marshall create another classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948) is generally regarded as the best horror comedy of the 1940s. "Ghost Breakers" is right behind Director George Marshall, who helmed the classic Jimmy Stewart/Marlene Dietrich Western "Destry Rides Again" and W.C Field's great comedy, "You Can't Cheat An Honest Man," (with Eddie Cline &amp; EDward Sedgewick) both in 1939, directed two of Bob Hope's three best &amp; funniest, "Monsieur Beaucaire" (1946)and this film, "Ghost Breakers" (Robert Butler's riotous 1944 Technicolor gem, "The Princess &amp; The Pirate" is the third).Bob helps perky &amp; gorgeous 30-year old Paulette Goddard (who was married at the time to the great Charlie Chaplin, who was 51) and this leads him and his valet Willie Best to a spooky old castle on a desolate tropical island in Cuba.While there, they meet ghosts, murder, a secret treasure, hidden rooms and passage ways - and one humdinger of a zombie (veteran Noble Johnson, who in 1933 played the native chief on Skull Island in "King Kong" and the Nubian slave in "The Mummy" with Boris Karloff).The blend of comedy and frights is (almost) unbeatable.This is the type of movie that parents should show their kids (at least 9 or 10) to give them an example of what great entertainment is all about. The kid's will double over with laughter, all while shivering from underneath their blanket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't be too hard on this film because I remember enjoying it so much, many, many years ago but it certainly is not the easiest watch today. Willie Best as the wide eyed black butler is hard to watch; so much of the dialogue affecting him causes one to wince with embarrassment and I can't help but feel that if the gags had been really funny and not just about colour, it would not seem so difficult today. Bob Hope's performance is fine but too many of his one liners seem too mannered and predictable. I guess we have got used to much faster and furious comedy but even so, particularly the first section, on board the boat, the comedy seems very strained. Things do improve in the haunted house when much more emphasis is upon the horror of the situation and the gags can come alongside much more effectively, the special effects being particularly impressive. Paulette Goddard comes out of this most successfully, for me, with her bold lack of costume and strong expressive looks. Probably worth seeing more for its early influence upon later horror films than as a comedy.</fullReview>

He takes his servant played by Willie Best with him. I just wish that Hollywood would have portrayed non-white actors, mainly the black ones, in a more realistic light. Bob finds an heiress who is in trouble with out knowing it. They end up at her inheritance which turns out to be an old mansion that sits on top of, wait for it, treasure!! The voodoo zombie is trite even for the time frame of this movie. While this is a funny movie it ramps up when everyone arrives at the mansion. The good (Bob,Alex, Paulette), the bad(Parada and gang), and the ugly(the zombie and mama of course).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follow-up to "The Cat and the Canary" with mixed results.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those expecting another comical spook fest from the team of Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard will have to wait until half way through the film before the chills start. Up until then, there is a lot of exposition which leads to obvious conclusions about where the film is going. It does start off out appropriately with a stormy night in New York where heiress Goddard is preparing to leave for Cuba and meets radio commentator Bob Hope (much subtler than he would be in the soon-to-start "Road" series with Bing Crosby) who stows away in her luggage after believing he has accidentally killed a man. Once in Cuba, the chills explode as Goddard and Hope encounter a zombie inside the haunted house Goddard has encountered. Willie Best adds subtlety to the stereotypical scaredy cat black servant, rising above Hope's supposedly funny racist jokes at his expense by appearing smarter than his employer. Anthony Quinn and Paul Lukas are also thrown in to the midst but really have nothing substantial to offer other than their name value. The first half is deadly slower than the second part, which adds more humor that doesn't depend on Hope's usual wisecracks or slapstick. The same story was done in a slightly more entertaining way, believe it or not from this reviewer, with "Scared Stiff", the 1953 version with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Larry Lawrence The original Curtis Sliwa !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Hope was not only Woody Allen's comedic inspiration but mine as well &amp; just hearing his spit out his rapid fire comedy come backs smacks you audibly &amp; humorously in the soul! Here he portrays Radio commentator Larry Lawrence (his parents were lacking in imagination) who has been getting the inside scoop on the mob. CURTIS SLIWA WABC's famed Guardian Angel News Broadcasting commentator is presently in the same trouble that Hope is in within this premise. As both have been spilling the preverbial beans on the mob and now they are after his skin!!! Tho Willie Best as Hope's "Family Detainer" keeps tempo with ALL of his retorts marvelously he is truly the asset to the cast &amp; tho some might be bothered by some of the verbal barbs (such as when the lights go out) Hope can't find his Nubian manservant &amp; says "You Look Like A Blackout in a Blackout!" Today's viewers have to see this type of comedy as not a put down but as a need to insert humor at any expense at every chance to keep a audience of the period's attention. And Best plays up on the slow witted characterization amiably as this was HIS art just as Hope was the smart alleck with the yellow streak down his back!! Both were playing up the character that gave them notoriety &amp; a salary! But where Curtis Sliwa ended up getting a few shots in the gut for his opening up the dirt on the radio which angered the mob--Hop at least has the sense here to race off hidden in a steamer trunk to Cuba before the shots can be fired! A GREAT FILM &amp; A TRIBUTE TO ATMOSPHERIC CINEMATOGRAPHY &amp; PINNING PERSONALITYS AGAINST ERACH OTHER FOR LAUGHS &amp; CHILLS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected. A fun horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror movies during this period didn't really have a lot of depth. They all followed a similar plot and had very similar characters. The most obviously used is the Old Dark House storyline. The Ghost Breakers appeared be another, factory run horror movie. Reusing the same old tropes. Only, this proved better. Bob Hope is in top form. Paulette Goddard is a looker. You get Ghosts, Zombies, Voodoo, and yes... an Old Dark House. But it's done so well! It's based on a play Paul Dickey. It's a fun movie that I recommend to the hardcore horror fans. It's a chore to get casual horror fans enjoy a movie as dated as this one. However, if you can appreciate the fast talking and quick wit of Bob Hope then I think you will like this one. Watch this with your grandparents. They might like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the Best of Its Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darn near perfect blend of laughs and chills, thanks mainly to old pro director George Marshall. But then, Hope is near his physical and comedic peak, along with a sprightly ravishing Paulette Goddard, and a menacing Anthony Quinn. Sure, Willie Best does the bug- eyed buffoonish bit, but at least he gets near top billing. Mix them into an old haunted house and you have arguably the best entry in this popular genre. I like the way Hope gets stuck going to Cuba, in a steamer trunk, no less, just part of the cargo. And catch him limbering up afterwards, like a pretzel trying to straighten out. Paramount popped for some really elaborate sets creating the right gloomy mood. But zombie Noble Johnson sent me under the couch; move over, Dracula, Wolfman, and the rest of the fright crew, he's a doozy. And watch out for those tin statues sporting battle axes. They may move. On the lighter side, Hope gets his usual throwaway lines? he hears a scream and advises, "It's up the stairs, to your left"!Neat solution to the mysterious goings on that I didn't see coming. Anyway, if you can get past Willie Best's stereotype, it's a really entertaining 90-minutes, among Hope's very best.</fullReview>

Willie Best plays his servant/best friend, and is very funny indeed, and nothing to be embarrassed about.Richard Carlson and Anthony Quinn round out a talented cast.The type of film that can be viewed many times over without getting tired of, it is a joy from start to finish.

		<fullReview>'Gather round children, I got a story for you all. There once was a magical land called Cuba that everyone in America saw as a high-class equivalent of Mexico where you could do all kinds of crazy stuff you couldn't in America. It was the perfect place to go when hiding out from the law, smoking fancy cigars and finding romance and intrigue. Like Vegas if it was an island. Everyone lived happily, until a big fat man introduced communism, and soon Cuba became a land of poverty and woe.But in it's heyday Cuba captured the popular imagination of American storytellers and held it in it's grip for quite a while, and a great way to recapture that nostalgic appeal is 1940's 'The Ghost Breakers'.Bob Hope plays Lawrence Lawrence Lawrence(his parents were unimaginative), a corrupt radio broadcaster who stays in cahoots with local racketeers for stories. After a chain of circumstances(which must be seen to be believed)leads to Lawrence believing that he murdered a man, Lawrence and his chauffeur Alex(Willie Best)come into contact with a beautiful young heiress named Mary(Paulette Goddard)who has inherited a reportedly haunted castle in Cuba, and they follow her.Hope isn't as funny in this film so much as charming and witty, but he does a good job and his mastery of wordplay is used expertly here. Goddard captures the perfect combination of strong-willed heroine and fainting ingénue as Mary. Good supporting performances by Paul Lukas &amp; Richard Carlson(who would also play a similar role to his role here the following year in the Abbott &amp; Costello comedy 'Hold that Ghost', before starring in many 50's sci-fi classics like 'It came from Outer Space')help round out the cast.Modern audiences may be turned off by Best's performance and role, however. Truth be told, Alex is a 'Yes massa' stereotype with little redeeming qualities, and is the butt of several truly offensive jokes which ARE race-based(there's a joke about Lawrence threatening to paint him white and even, wait for it; a fried chicken joke), so one can't dismiss his role as one that had no racial malice in it that a white actor could have filled easily. The role isn't helped by the fact that Lawrence thinks very little of him and bosses him constantly. Still, at least Alex is portrayed as no more incompetent or cowardly than Lawrence is, and Best still manages to make the role quite funny, and easily manages to hold his own with the rest of the cast. He even gets to save Lawrence &amp; Mary at the end, basically making him the hero.For a comedy, the film also has an undeniably spooky atmosphere in the scenes at the castle. There's even a legitimately suspenseful scene with a zombie, that succeeds in raising more shivers than most serious horror films at the time were doing. The scenes of horror and humor are expertly balanced, such as when Mary runs from the zombie and gets her dress stuck; it's both tense AND funny, the shock and slapstick as she tries to pull it out makes it amusing, but each unsuccessful pulling brings her closer to to death as the zombie advances. Most modern horror films could learn from this, especially 'parodies' like 'Scream'.Other highlights include a scene where Mary impersonates a look-alike ancestor, a truly eerie scene with a real ghost, and a surprising twist-ending which leads to one of the most hilariously random villain deaths of all time. It's all great fun, don't miss it.~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghost Breakers, The (1940) ** (out of 4) Disappointing horror/comedy has Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard traveling to Cuba where they investigate an eerie house, which may or may not be haunted. I was really letdown by this film after hearing so many good things about it over the years. I kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen but it never did. The opening thirty-minutes are deadly dry and appear to be a set up for the second half of the film but when we get to Cuba nothing happens either. There are a couple laughs aimed at the black servant but other than that I don't recall laughing once. Richard Carlson, Paul Lukas and Anthony Quinn fill out the supporting roles. A few of the jokes were done in later Abbott and Costello films where I felt they worked better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not a lot to this movie, and I wouldn't say it was outrageously funny, but I found it pleasant and entertaining, although I was bothered by the racial stereotyping, which is unfortunately front and center here.This is slightly unusual in terms of Hope movies I've seen in that he's not really a coward. He's a bit more on the heroic side; afraid but determined. Perhaps that's because it's fairly early in his career before his character was totally set?Anyway, if you like old 40s mystery-haunted house comedies, and you like Bob Hope, this is a good bet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bob Hope plays a radio personality - not much of a reach, admittedly - who finds himself in Cuba on the run from gangsters and ghosts in this follow-up to the hit movie The Cat and The Canary. Hope gets off a slew of his usual wisecracks - during a thunderstorm, he quips, "Basil Rathbone must be having a party." Paulette Goddard is back as his leading lady / straight man, and their chemistry is as sharp as before. Less welcome to the modern viewer is Willie Best's servant caricature who is "...terrible scared of spookses, Boss." Anyway, the production looks good, with the Burbank back lot standing in for the Caribbean but still looking effectively creepy voodoo-wise, with hanging vines, a dark and shadowy Castillo in the swamps (with no electric lights of course) and plenty of quite effective fright moments. The story moves along at a brisk pace and resolves itself satisfactorily in the end, while Hope keeps the viewer entertained with the same wisecracking coward / reluctant hero persona he introduced in The Cat and The Canary, and which was to become his on-screen trademark. Look fast for a very young Anthony Quinn in a supporting role. Great fun and family friendly, although the kids may be put off by the somewhat grainy B&amp;W DVD transfer. Extras include the original trailers and some featurettes about Hope entertaining the troops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the first half contained a good amount of jokes and set up the situation nicely. The hotel scenes in New York and the scenes aboard the ship move nicely and contain good gags and wisecracks. Unfortunately, when we reach Cuba and the haunted house, the pace slackens and the there are only four or five good jokes in the last half hour.Willie Best is the best part of the movie. His cowardly behavior allows Hope to be more heroic than usual. Best has excellent slow comic timing and plays off of the quick and nervous Hope very well. Unfortunately, too much of the time he is just rolling his eyes in a stereotypical manner. If the writers had given him a few more sharp and clever lines the picture would have worked a lot better.Paulette Godard is fine, but the role is pretty stereotypical too. She doesn't really add anything unusual and any of fifty other actresses in Hollywood could have played the role just as well.All technical credits are good. The set design does stand out, especially for a movie that was obviously not very big budget.The film is quite watchable and pleasurable, but I don't see it as the comic masterpiece some people do. I would put the Road pictures, My Favorite Blond/Brunette and Monsieur Beaucaire (1946) ahead of it.</fullReview>

However, in this film he is teamed up with a great actress, Paulette Goddard, (Mary Carter) who inherits an island off the coast of Cuba and the house is full of ghosts and strange things. Richard Carlson, (Geoff Montgomery) becomes a guide to Mary Carter and gets involved with all the strange things that are happening in this House of Horrors. Veteran actors Paul Lukas, Anthony Quinn give great supporting roles to the film. This film has a variety of situations where you will laugh and then be completely turned around with a scary haunted house with horrible organ music and secret passages. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Hope comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Hope plays a radio announcer who is unjustly accused of murder. He runs into Paulette Goddard who just inherited Black Island from a dead relative. She's going there on a dark and stormy night and Hope (and his valet Willie Best) join her. She's also been getting threats that if she goes to Black Island she'll never leave...alive.Good Hope comedy. It starts right out with some beautifully atmospheric opening credits and keeps right on going. The film is full of storms, fog, darkness and the creepy old castle on the island. None of this would scare anyone but it's a perfect counterpoint to Hope's wisecracks.Hope is in top form throwing out some hilarious one liners left and right. Some are groaners but most are very funny. Goddard is beautiful and (surprisingly) not that good. She seems overly nervous and a bit too happy go lucky. Willie Best is (sadly) stuck playing a black man who is scared of everything. It's not as racist as it could have been but still uncomfortable. But this was seen as OK in 1940.This was remade by Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in the 1950s as "Scared Stiff". That one was OK but this one is definitely better. Worth catching. Best line--"A good joke would be worth a lot just about now".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chiller Comedy Asking to be remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This writer does own a copy of this picture for many reasons outlined by the previous reviewer. Bob Hope becomes the Bob Hope we grew to love in this picture. His contemporaries, such as Jack Benny, also recognized the worth in giving the best lines to the supporting players. In this film, acting style, Atmosphere, and the engaging story come together in a couple of hours of enjoyment spent over and over again. Black actors in 1944 had few roles outside of porters, bellman, and waiters. Willie Best is Bob's best man in so many ways. One recalls the scene with the drunk and the trunk. Never was farce played better than this. Unfortunately, actors who play zombies well continued to play zombies in just about every other picture they ever made. Such was the Hollywood of Universal studios back in those days. The remake with Lewis and Martin lost the edge that the original had because of the over the top nature of Mr. Lewis. The new remake has at its disposal an incredible history of the horror genre from which to tantalize the audience of the 21st century. As the original creates suspense without overpowering, so should the remake. I think Horatio Hornblower was a master who could weave gangsters, a New York thunderstorm, a radio talk show host, a beautiful girl, a murder, zombies, a Cuban travel brochure, and a haunted castle into a masterpiece of fun. Paulette Goddard's wardrobe was created by Edith Head. She knew how to make much of a women's slip as well as a terry wrap that tears on cue. With the inevitability of the sunset years of Castro, Cuba could be the next great vacation spot in the Caribbean. Why not let life imitate art? The fantasy of this film could also play around Cuba as a fresh new post Castro vacation paradise. The beautiful girl gets a notice from the new Cuban government that her family home on the coast will be returned to the last living heiress. The world of the radio talk show host and the beautiful heiress collide in a hotel during a gang shoot out. Ghosts walk and evil lurks as their tale is told. The Bob Hope character could have been played earlier by Dan Ackroyd, but the young Stiller is top choice for today. Once again this could be another comedy foray for Halle Berry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brief Hope/Goddard vehicle which takes an hour to get to the haunted house and then is over all too quickly. For all the praise heaped on it here, this is a somewhat entertaining and atmospheric but very routine picture. Fun for the actors in it, some decent special effects and the odd good line but nothing more really to recommend it. Typical of what Paramount was putting out in the early years. All the bigger studios had the better writers under contract and it shows. Worthy of a look but diminishes after more than one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're only going to watch one Bob Hope movie in your life?it should definitely not be this one.Hope plays Lawrence Lawrence Lawrence, a gangland reporter for the radio. Well, he's actually playing Bob Hope but you know what I mean. After he says the wrong thing on the air, Lawrence is summoned to a possibly fatal encounter at a hotel room but after mistakenly thinking he murdered someone, Lawrence winds up in a trunk on his way to Cuba. The trunk belongs to Mary Carter (Paulette Goddard), who's just inherited a castle on an island off the Cuban coast. Even though people try to buy her off with money and scare her off with ghost stories, Mary is determined to see the castle for herself and Lawrence decides to tag along out of self-deprecating chivalry. They run into the twin brother of the man Lawrence thought he killed, an actual zombie, a ghost and a secret in the castle straight out of an episode of Scooby-Doo. Not one of the good ones, one of the crappy episodes with Scrappy-Doo.There's not much to say about The Ghost Breakers expect that it's a pretty poor effort at telling a story. It's fast moving, but that's because it doesn't want the audience to stop and think about what they're watching. This movie is sort of like an ancient ancestor of the early Jim Carrey movies like Ace Ventura, where the plot is nothing more than an excuse for the star to act funny. For Carrey it's physical comedy, for Hope it's a constant stream of quips. Much of Hope's humor in this film hasn't aged that well, but he was never one to play for the ages. He was only interested in playing for the back row of the theater. Paulette Goddard is okay playing her era's stereotype, the tough broad with the smart mouth who falls into the hero's arms at the end of the picture.There's only one more thing to say about The Ghost Breakers, either for good or ill. If you're going to watch this movie, you'd better be ready to overlook Lawrence's Steppin Fetchit-like butler Alex (Willie Best). It's not a malevolently racist character. It's just the average, everyday kind of bigoted depiction of a black man that was simply part of the cinema of that generation. It is a bit uncomfortable to see a legendary figure like Bob Hope and be so forcibly reminded of the ugliness of the era in which he made most of his legend.Hope was always more of a showman than an actor and there are much better examples of his classic work than The Ghost Breakers. You might want to give one of them a try.</fullReview>

Even that far back they were sequel happy; if a piece of cheese like The Cat And The Canary turned a buck why not remake it with the same two leads (Hope, Goddard)the same colander doubling as a plot and arguably the same set. This time around the film takes it time - something like forty minutes - getting to the 'old, dark, and probably host to a thousand and one horrors, from zombies to stiffs. Along for the ride are Paul Fix, Anthony Quinn, and like that. Pity Gale Sondergaard wasn't available. One or two weak gags and that's about it.</fullReview>
