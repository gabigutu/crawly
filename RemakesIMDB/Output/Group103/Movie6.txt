		<shortDescription>Simply Brilliant - and i loved the original '78 Don as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don (2006) is a thrill a minute, edge of the seat, don't blink or you'll miss something, superbly stylised action movie. It's a sort of Don(1978) meets James Bond (the Pierce Brosnan era, with all its hi-tech gadgetry etc). It is unbelievably slick and amazingly cool. Its got the finish of a top-end magazine like Vogue or GQ?glossy, beautiful, a work of art. And the action scenes are breathless, non-stop and come at you one after another.I had severe reservations about Mr Khan as Don. Especially as there are few bigger Mr Bachchan fans than me ? I idolise the man. However, I've come from the movie convinced that no one else in the current set of stars could've carried it off as well as Shahrukh. He looks and behaves like Don ? completely different to the chocolate faced 'Main Hoon Na' and 'Kal Ho Na Ho' giggling lover boy we are used to. In this movie he has a steely look about him, a nastiness that is very believable. He is slightly over the top, but only to the degree you would want him to be.Priyanka Chopra simply sizzles. When I look at her on screen now I'm ready to do all the things Jim Carrey does in the 'Mask' when he see's Cameron Diaz dance at the club ! The great thing, I remember, about watching Don (1978) as a 7 year old, was that when you came out of the movie (and for the next few days)?you felt you were Don ! You wanted to be like him, copy all mannerisms, you were mesmerised, felt the sense of power. I saw the same impact of this Don (2006) on my son (coincidentally also 7 years old). But even better, it still had the same impact on me ! Just love it ! Check out my full review at apurvbollywood at blogspot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise...Job Well Done...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first,let me tell u that I did not like the Original DON(1978) that much.It was good in parts but it was only the Aura of AB with the music that actually pulled it off.If the same story had been reused,the movie would have ended up being a disaster.But,I guess Farhan Akthar does a great job in this movie.Yes,the beginning is a bit slow but he more than makes up for it by the time the movie ends.Shah Rukh is incredible as DON and the others do their job well.The music is good(A special mention to the Background track...its incredible..).And watch out for the climax...Pros:1)Great acting by Shah Rukh2)Amazing cinematography (Everything looks classy and stylish..just notice the way Shah Rukh wears his tie!)3)A nice racy background scoreCons:1)Beginning does feel as a bit of a crawl..2)Jasjit's (Arjun Rampal) role wasn't required if u ask me..Overall,a great entertainer and worth the wait..!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don reincarnated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was stunning. You have to give full credits to Farhan Akhtar. His way of presenting the previously said story is completely unmatchable. At times, the movie was way over the top of exaggeration but in the end everything falls in place. The movie was fast tracked at many places and many sequences were skipped that were present in the previous version. Some plots were twisted to bring in the modern day touch and nothing seemed unnecessary. The sequences were copied very much to the exactness of the situation and it was a good effort to bring back the charisma that a personality like Don should have. One more special thing about this movie is its climax, which was not at all stereotype. One would not expect such a thing in bollywood movies and yet it was brilliantly done. I would say DON was an overall entertainer and is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not miss the start and do not miss the ending.This movie has been shot very well, with the locations and cinematography at its best. The start of the movie goes a bit slow and then picks up pace. I think Shahrukh has not over acted this time. The cast has been chosen perfectly to do their job.This movie is a bit different from the original Amitabh Bachchan's DON, so comparing both the new and old movie is out of the question. Each one of them is good in its own league. For the people who have seen the original DON, at first, you start to think that it might not be so good, and justice has not been made to the original. As the movie goes on, you start to change your mind.As for me, the overall the movie was really good and worth every bit of money paid to watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If SRK wanted a shot at 007, well he did a great job with DON</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat spell bound this afternoon in a theater. It was great. In my opinion a 10 for my expectations. For the first time I never wondered where the fast forward button was on the movie. My opinion of the Kareena Kapoor changed completely. You have to see it to believe it. She is sexy! It's a 3 hour film. But it holds ones attention very well. SRK is a great villain as usual. Although they hint several times in the movie what the out come will be, until you reach the end it's not fully disclosed. There's one scene that is similar to a James Bond scene. The only thing is that the bad guy isn't Jaws and he doesn't land on a circus tent. It really is fun to watch on the big screen. Don't miss it. - And for those who have seen the first DON, SRK and Big B are different artists. They do things differently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Slick James Bond Type Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don was great James Bond type entertainment. It had action, music, babes, great photography, good music and a surprise ending. What more do you want? It also bought some old memories back. I was amazed at the quality of production like special effects, camera angles, shooting locales, car chase, sky diving etc. SRK tries his best to fit the larger than life role of Don and does a good job. The women are just fillers. SRK is the movie.For all the people out there who posted negative feedback and criticized the movie....Did you guys expect this to be an art movie? Have you seen how stupid the original Don is? Compared to the original this is a great improvement.I think there is going to be a Don 2 coming soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly speaking after the performance of Srk in Kank, i thought that he would lost his possession.I am not a great fan of him but i do respect him. After watching Don, i believe that he is a true class actor. I never believed that bollywood can make a movie like Hollywood. But Don erased my doubts. This is the movie that we should accept and appreciate. According to me, this is the only bollywood movie till date that has shown bollywood has a capacity of making movie like Hollywood. Wat a scene, background, sleek, action, picturisation, and most of all the brilliance performance of Sharuk brings lump in viewers throat. The most awesome part of the movie is the climax. No one thought that climax would make in such a way and we believe that this is perfect ending. For more u have to watch urslef.Sharukh never looked like a bollywood actor in this movie. He looked more like western guy. His facial expression is perfect. PPL this is the movie that u should encourage if we want our movie to be recognize globally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i haven't seen the actual big B's don , but i watched the don in Tamil as 'Billa' with Rajinikanth in the lead. now i have seen this Don. Farhan Akhtar, a young director in Indian cinema, did only couple of movies before,but i really wondered the way he made the film with very good technical aspects and with style. the camera work is excellent, i felt like watching a Hollywood movie. i think writer changed the story little bit in the end, which is very clever and interesting. the climax is very well made. the songs and background score are done extremely well. particularly the background music when don comes, ' don... don...'.Shahrukh Khan, i have seen many movies of SRK, but this is something different after long time, in a negative role. he did really well. apart from SRK Boman Irani, Arjun Rampal,Priyanka Chopra did their part really well.i think remaking an old movie is not trend in Indian cinemas. but this will change the trend.overall VERY GOOD entertainment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don just continues to prove that Farhan Akhtar is a brilliant director, taking a big budget blockbuster and making it smart, fast-paced and fun. Shahrukh Khan does really well as the villain, something I had not expected going into the movie. Priyanka Chopra is strong as the female lead, and Arjun Rumpal is especially good in his smaller but important role. The music in the movie is one of its strongest points, every song is carried out with excitement, yet the songs don't take away from the plot of the movie at all, they enhance the scenes they are complementing. One of my favorite Bollywood films of the past couple years, up there with Rang de Basanti and Kal Ho Naa Ho.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Don" of a New Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"DON KA INTEZAR TO MUJHE GYAARA (11) MAHINON SE THA, LEKIN MAIN YEH NAHIN JAANTA THA KE DON KE TICKETS MILNA MUSHKIL NAHIN, NAMUMKIN HAI."I couldn't catch Don on the first day of release as it was all sold out, and I had been extremely busy at work the whole of last week to even think about the movie, and buying tickets in advance. Anyways, no harm done. I watched Don just tonight, on the second day. And what an experience it was.Amitabh Bachchan made Don immortal in the 1978 original. SRK re-does that now in 2006 for generations to come. And though I do not want to give too much away, Farhan Akhtar has done something to Don that the original version did not. You will have to watch the movie and find that out for yourself, though.As a director, FA takes care of everything in a frame. Extremely talented, his attention to detail is impeccable. From the moment the film starts, till the very last shot, the film is a slick, stylish thriller of blockbuster proportions.SRK does a really good job, both as Don and as Vijay. Priyanka Chopra as Roma does a fine job too, and the martial arts training paid off. Boman Irani as DeSilva and Om Puri as Malik are very good, as would be expected. Arjun Rampal as Jasjit is great, and in fact makes you feel much more for the character than Pran (in the original) did, in my opinion. Personally, I thought the actresses picked to play Kamini (Kareena Kapoor) and Anita (Isha Koppikar) could have changed roles. Kamini does nothing but jump in the "Ye Mera Dil" song, and although some dance steps from the original have been retained, she does not bring in the sexy siren factor to as much an extent as Helen did, in the original. I thought Isha Koppikar could've done that.The movie pays homage to the original, which will be to the delight of fans of the 1978 version, by keeping a lot of the dialog the same. The situations are similar, the setting has been changed. Instead of Deepu and Munni (Jasjit's son and daughter), there's only Deepu, which is good because Munni was redundant anyways. Much like that, many little changes have been made, not only to go with today's times, but also to tighten up the screenplay.The title song as well as the "Aaj Ki Raat" song have been shot really, really well. "Main Hoon Don", in particular, really looks good, with the Moulin Rouge kind of setting and slick camera work. Simply by the way it's shot, and the expressions and behavior of the people involved, the audience is treated to an inside look on the lives of Don's gang. "Aaj Ki Raat" carries a wonderful retro/disco feel, visually, and reminded me of Parveen Babi's era.Farhan Akhtar has added certain twists in the movie that weren't there in the original, and it is these that make this a Farhan Akhtar film. The twists are a shocker for both the new viewers, as well as for those who've watched the original. In fact, I think they come as a greater shock for the viewers who've watched Amitabh's Don, because they will be under the impression that they know what's coming. Brilliant.The film has been handled really well, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't see too many reasons why it wouldn't go down well with most people, except for those (my wife for one) who can't stand SRK. As for me, I'm a fan, always have been. Way to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Shah Rukh Khan's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is great to see SRH doing a negative role after a long time in previous films like Baazigar &amp; Darr, mostly people think that he is better off in romantic roles but I like him in negative. The film was a terrific action, thriller and the use of modern technology looked fantastic quite similar to the James Bond movies. I've not seen the original Don but I don't think that will turn out to be good as this one because it's an old film which I'm not really keen of. I don't mind remakes as long as their good, most of them are rubbish e.g. Devdas &amp; Umrao Jaan but Don is simply the best remake ever! Farhan Akhtar has proved to be a good director. Songs are excellent my most favourite song is "Yeh Mera Dil" because the lyrics had 2 meanings and Kareena Kapoor was looking so glamour's as usual. The scene where SRH &amp; the other guy fell from a plane while fighting for a parachute was amazing &amp; unexpected a scene like that has never been tackled before in a Bollywood movie, the other scene that was really cool is the fight just before the ending with Boman Irani. The twist in the end was the icing on the cake of the whole film and Don has proved that "Not only is it difficult to catch Don - It's impossible!!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Most Of The Right Ingredients But Still Falls Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many seem to have loved this flick but I found it to be average at best. Nothing memorable but not too bad for a remake. Farhan Akhter decorates 'Don' with high tech visuals, slick action sequences, gloss and glamour. He opts for a different (but still predictable) ending compared to the prequel. Yet, it falls short of being among the best films of the year. 'Don' had potential to be a lot better but it lacks heart. I wouldn't call it an improvement over Farhan's debut venture 'Dil Chahta Hai'. I admit that it's unfair to compare these two totally different films but the reason I mention it is because there are far more flaws in 'Don'. The chase scenes drag on and they're very repetitive. The pace is very slow at times. Some editing could have been helped.Shahrukh is quite convincing as 'Don'. This isn't his best but it's good enough. However, he doesn't seem to have a strong chemistry with any of the female leads. This was a big surprise to me because no matter how his movie or acting is in other movies, he always managed to maintain a strong chemistry with the ladies. I think this is more the actress's fault because they don't impress. Priyanka Chopra appears to be clueless (she doesn't have chemistry with any of the cast member let alone Shahrukh Khan) and in a few scenes with Vijay, she seems to be copying Juhi Chawla. Moreover, her fight scenes were laughable. Ishaa Koppikar barely has a role to speak of. Kareena Kapoor delivers a forgettable performance and her item number is disastrous while her death scene is hilarious. Arjun Rampal is equally forgettable. Boman Irani and Om Puri are adequate.The music is strictly OK, with a few exceptions: 'Yeh Mera Dil' and 'Khaike Paan' being the worst and 'Aaj ki Raat' being the best.'Don' has an okay screenplay, mediocre (to bad) performances, some interesting visuals, mostly forgettable music and very few good action scenes. I didn't like it so much and I don't think I would ever want to watch it again. Once is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER: From Don Two Don!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie worked for me because everything that happens in it is believable and this is in complete contrast to the usual case in Bollywood movies.Shah Rukh is best at only two types of acting, either as a comedian or as a villain (who can forget his violent psychopath Ram Jaane in the movie of the same name?)and it is the latter that he excels in during this movie, playing the role of gang leader.The movie is well produced and director Farhan Akhtar keeps the plot ticking along at just the right pace to keep audiences adequately interested.The songs were well composed musically and appeal to modern audiences, though some are based on songs from the original Bachchan hit.This movie will appeal to moviegoers worldwide and I fully expect it to attain some form of international recognition in terms of an award in the not too distant future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK first of all I have not seen the old don so this was a completely new experience for me. By far the best Bollywood action movie I've seen on par with Hollywood movies. It's a thriller the audience will be glued to their seats from start to finish. The execution is good. Cinematography, awesome!!!! It's a big screen movie, the visuals will leave you spellbound. Sharukh Khan yet again delivers another awesome performance. People who called him a romantic hero who cannot do the nasty stuff must watch Don. Priyanka Chopra is good, much better than what we saw in Krrish. Boman Irani is solid as usual. The music is really good typical Bollywood dance sequences. Shankar ? Eshaan ? Loy are the modern maestros of Bollywood. The only let down is Kareena's item no, she is just too fat, and doesn't really look the part of the sexy seductress. Farhan Akther does a great job once again and handles the movie well as a young director. In conclusion Don is a must see, Hollywood movie lovers who like high paced action movies will love Don, it's the best action movie Bollywood has to offer.</fullReview>

And if you think these are all same then you must be very stupid....this is a slap on the face of all SRK critics!!! Don has become a hit in its 1st week and it will continue to do well and become a super-hit!!!! Don has destroyed Jaan-E-Mann at the box office. As for the movie, Don has many positives: 1.

		<fullReview>I thought Don was a pretty good movie. Its funny how i read on some websites that Shahrukh Khan wasn't convincing at all as Vijay and had traces of Don in him, seriously who pays these guys? Shahrukh Khan ended up being Don playing Vijay who was supposed to pose as Don, so Farhan Akhtar was actually trying to give us hints about that, even prior to the Khaika Paan A Banaras Wala song when a guy offered him some paan he refused saying he didn't like Paan, the real Vijay loved Paan and was told to give it up because Don disliked it. A lot of critics said the Khaika song didn't fit, I don't know if i agree with that it seemed like a decent fit to me. I thought Shahrukh was convincing both as Don and Vijay there were a few times where he was a little irritating but for the most part he did a good job. I haven't seen the old Don but if people who have seen the old Don want to see this i advise them not to if their going to have such high expectations because your already going to be biased going into the movie so you are basically just setting yourself up for disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The production quality is very neat and one can definitely compare this Bollywood movie with western hits. It has given me shivers and fevers but finally it was worth waiting for.The Car chase which starts off from a beach and goes all the way through the village and then a bridge under construction and to the chikoo farm has a techno soundtrack playing. All this while I was thinking that there would be raw sounds of different car engines, whoosh and skids! Ruthless Don gets caught in this sequence so it should have been much more fierce. I think this is the only sequence in first half which has a great pace! I have already seen it thrice with my family &amp; friends and am willing to watch it again! The Techno-retro (Bijlee) soundtrack adds to The theme, 'Glass &amp; Steel' environments &amp; modern day characters. Mohanan's camera work is superb! The natural lighting was used very well in shots where SRK dances (Sunlight through splashing sea-water etc) in Ganpati song. The diagonal top shot of Mumbai created a great transition to Vijay's house near rail tracks. Boman and SRK(Vijay)'s first conversation was brilliantly entertaining! Loved SRK's acting in both roles. His facial expressions and body movements showed the difference of two extreme characters! SRK was brilliant in 'boat-rowing' steps of 'Khaike paan Banaraswala'. Very Energetic moves!People said wow when the white bridge was shown at the end sequence. Chopper coming out from under the bridge in Tele lens shot was also a great surprise and of course the altered end part was special! Loved the shots with double SRKs. Great VFX! Farhan's love for the 1978 movie truly reflects. Storywise, DON 2 would certainly require an equally complex plot. Hats off and best wishes to Excel ent &amp; Red chillies for future creations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I counted 5 musical numbers in the film. All of them were seamless; they flowed in and out of the story. I am no fan of musicals, but as I was watching this film it occurred to me what I don't like about American musicals ? I don't like the "Broadway Show Tune" music. Somehow this music seemed appropriate to the film; the story is "over the top" and fits the music of this Bollywood musical. I was actually tapping my foot to the musical numbers.As far as I'm concerned this film is what a musical should be. The action scenes are great, but for me, the musical scenes were better. For those of you who may say there is no singing in an action film, go see this one to see how it's done. Singing, dancing -- and guns! Hooray for Bollywood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched Don for the first time, I thought the action movie Bollywood was searching for is finally here. After Dhoom (which I sincerely think that this is far better) we were in search of a better action movie than that. I think that search is finally over. This new Don is enough experience to last a lifetime.SRK after Main Hoon Naa returns with a far better aspect and a side of him which we saw only long ago. He changes his role from lover-boy to a master mind of crime. I think SRK gives a great competition to the big B in his original Don (might as well win it). On the contrary this film is a must see.You'll even see an unseen side of Priyanka. She had become an action woman for this film, truly a wild cat.Unlike normal Hindi action films this does not emboss the villain as an inhuman devil and you cant see those annoying parts where the cruelty of the villain is unnaturally flaunted.The action parts of this movie is great. It had not copied any Hollywood film. This film has it's own unique style which actually enthralled me. What is my advice to all action lovers and movie fans? -to watch this film and you'll never turn to a Hollywood action film again"It is not difficult to catch Don but it is impossible"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing movie with an excellent climax. I guess the highlight of the movie is the climax.The stars of the movie are of course SRK and the director Farhan Aktar. Its an intelligent movie, Farhan has done a tremendous job in presenting the story in convincing manner. The background score for the movie is pathetic but the strong narration and excellent action from SRK dominates everything.Remix version of the old songs are good else the music is satisfactory.The dances were really good in the "kaike Pan banaras.." song. Priyanka Chopra was good, Isha koppikar was OK and Kareena Kapoor was hot for the short role she has in the movie.All in all a good movie and worth watching.PS: Don't miss the CLIMAX</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie, great music and quite a thrilling action. However, I can't seem to get over the old DON image, aka Amitabh. He was amazing, and natural. Shahrukh tried his best to get closer and did a great job but, not even close to the original.If I don't compare the two movies, this one is def worth the money spend on the ticket. Good ending, reminds all of us that this is not a real life, it's just a movie.With all the gadgets and cool clothes, SK looks awesome, still AB rocked the Indian movie watchers when he appeared for the first time. All in all, go for this one!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Farhan Why(DON-My Review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the rumours started about SRK working with Farhan i was quite happy. But later when i heard he was going to remake i was shocked and surprised I never even thought that someone will make a remake of a good masala entertainer That too remake by Farhan was more surprise.Later on people started calling it classic Classic??....I can only laugh.Since when a good masala entertainer started to became classic.I was never a big fan of DON.In my book it was good entertainer. And i have not watched old DON in years.I remember the basic plot of the movie I remember old DON mainly for Khaike Paan song and BigB performance Moving further it was not a good step by Farhan cause DON is not a flick like old DEVDAS. DON keeps coming almost every month.But Farhan was bent on making this flick.He promised us that this will be a cool and stylish flick I imagined bollywood cant make MI-2 but yeah MI-1 is quite possible But after the gripping theatrical trailer nothing kewl action or stunts were shown.I was surprised So as now the film had released...whether its a good film??....i am extremely sorry but its not...Rather.......its a Brilliant film.......a kickass thriller.... Farhan had delivered what he have promised.This is as stylish as u can think of any bollywood flick on par with Hollywood standard.The look,background music everything gives u a Hollywood feelOK...as far as story is concerned.1st half is almost similar to the original DON. But contrary to many people i liked 2nd half more.Its more thrilling and gripping and with a lot of twists and turns I liked it more than the original whose second half was plain average without much twists and turns And in that part actually Farhan had made changes in the script.And many people and critics seems to be angry that farhan should have stuck with the original script.But tell me if this one had exact similar story who would have watched this Why should someone watch the same story which keeps coming very often on TV.And i am surprised to see people not liking this flick.I will list few reasons....1.U are die hard STUBBORN old DON fan 2.U are big BIGB fan who don't want SRK to play this role 3.A stylish thriller on par with Hollywood standard is not your cup of teaNow..moving onto critics...whether not the critics job is to give review only. But few critics are bent upon to break this movie.Which frankly will lead to audience lost. I have never seen so much arrogant media who is not letting any stone turned to keep the audience away from this flickCritics are saying that this flick had style but no soul.Gimme a break but i din see media commenting so much on DUS which was good flick but turned out average cause they forcefully tried to interwoov the emotional moments A thriller should be like thriller which keeps u guessing and surprises you rather than to try to have interwooven touching moments Go watch 'The Usual Suspects' and bring me any soul in the movie.But it is considered to be greatest thriller ever of Hollywood alongside The Sixth Sense. But i am not surprised cause thrillers are mostly received badly by critics in bollywoodNegative things...... Well sometime u feel like the movie is getting a bit slow But its surprising that i don't find that movie needs any editingPerformances.... Ompuri---Totally wastedIsha----Again wastedKareena Kapoor---Doesn't have quite much role.But she looks real HOT on screenArjun Rampal----He acted well.But frankly he have very short role to notice.But he was really good whatever he was offeredPriyanka Chopra---She looks fabulous.But please when you start to act which seems u have forgotten since Aitraaz.An OK performanceBoman Irani-----When i first heard about his role i was not convinced that he can put off the role. But surprisingly he is nothing less than Brilliant.He proved if he can make u smile then he can also send a chill tooSRK----Vijay----Though his role is short he is quite good Look at him in 'Khaike Paan' song.God...SRK where u have left this energy while working with Johars And he have put really a great effort in khaike songDON----I always wanted DON to be cruel,stylish,evil and intelligent.And this character does the same People should really feel that 'Don Ko Pakadna Mushkil Hi Nai Namumkin Hai'.His dialogue delivery with bit of bitterness is great to see.And i forgive him for his dismal and sleepwalk performance in KANK A surprise job well doneSpecial mention to "Mai Hoon DON" song......The way it starts...the way SRK's back is shown and the way he walks. Nothing less than spectacular."Khuli Kiski Khaatir Hai Baahen,Jami Kispe Hain Sab Nigaahen".He really makes feel like to welcome this DON of new EraActions.... Car chase sequence is stunning and its roller coaster ride... Aeroplane diving sequence is BREATHTAKING.....absolute treat to watch....Farhan---"Why Farhan Why...why why...why u have made such a good thriller like Hollywood.You don't know we are still living in old age.We are not ready for this.Damn it" But THANKS---U have really delivered what u have promised.But please next time come with new thriller so that sick minded will not be ready to compare and backfire on you.Great job Farhan.U have completed hatrick of good flicksVisually film is stunning.Background music is amazing as well. And please everyone who like thrillers must watch this especially if u like Hollywood kinda thrillersAnd this flick is really needed to work on Box office cause more and more producer/directors will come upfront to make such stylish flick of holly standards.For a 30crr budgeted flick u cant expect more stylish and kewl flick from BollywoodAgain Farhan...please make your next flick thriller as well..of such standard but with original story.....8/10Bring on DON-2....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drunk on DON!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparisons are odious - but in this case, inevitable. Mr. Akhtar has taken the campy cult classic of the seventies and dared to present it to us in a magical new garb. This has outraged many fans of Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and the old Don. I want to start out by saying that I was never a great fan of the original version - it was made as a low budget film and became a classic only by virtue of an interesting story line and Mr. B's larger than life persona in the film and at the time.What does the new Don offer that the old Don lacked? 1. It offers a slick wonderfully smooth roller-coaster ride that was absent in the circa 1978 version.2. It offers an updated suave yet menacing evil protagonist that the old one lacked. Mr. B was way better as the naive and bhaiyya Vijay, not very convincing as the evil Don. One should remember that the best of his roles that carried a menace associated with his persona were those where the menace was righteous! This was not the case in Don (1978) and so he did not present the role as well.3. It offers wonderful action and thrills a minute. The action sequences, car chases, fights, flights are unmatched in Hindi cinema and rival stuff coming out of Hollywood! 4. It offers excellent music and dance numbers - ah, recycled some say. I disagree - the "Yeh Mera Dil" number sizzles in the hands of Kareena, and "Khaike Paan Banaraswala" now has Mr. Khan's image embedded with it!! And the two original numbers "Main Hoon Don" and "Aaaj ki Raat" are inspired and brilliant.5. It offers excellent comedy that has nothing to do with slapstick or stupid.6. It offers bad guy henchmen that are real. It replaces the fake sheiks and bug eyed goons standing around, with sexy sirens and real menacing dudes! 7. Best of all it offers a couple of very smart twists that I will not describe in any detail so the spoiler warning is unnecessary. Let me just ask two questions. Is it easier for a suave sophisticate to play a dumb yokel, or for a dumb yokel to play the suave sophisticate? What motivates DCP DeSilva to send Vijay back as Don in the 1978 version? 8. It offers a very smart and sleek leading lady, who does not seem fake in the martial arts moves - the practice was well worth it Ms. Chopra! 9. It fleshes out the character of Anita more than Don 1978 did, she was a warm body there. And Ms. KOPPIKAR does justice to the role.10. It offers us Mr. Boman Irani in the role played by Iftekhar. Iftekhar was great but Mr. Irani is superb.11. I saved the best for last. Last but not least at all, it offers Mr. Shahrukh Khan the opportunity to dust off his acting chops and delight us as the evil menacing Don. The Badshah is back and he is badder than ever! Welcome back Mr. Khan - first the bad boy in KANK and now the evil dude in Don. Divali came with a great gift this year! Let us hope the future roles are even more varied and delightful.Surely it is not flawless, you ask. So what is wrong with the new Don?1. Well, I never really believed in the whole Doppelganger thing (a duplicate human being for everyone) outside of the identical twin scenario. So yes, that is pretty unbelievable, but that is a premise that has fascinated story tellers and movie makers for years - plus that baggage came with the old Don so no negative points there.2. Why was JJ carrying his kid on his shoulders - wouldn't it be easier to hold his hand and walk across? JJ in the old Don TIGHTROPE WALKED on his lame leg with two kids on his shoulders. So I am actually giving the new Don a plus point! 3. The whole CD with information thing was a bit overplayed - but it beat the toss the red notebook game played in the graveyard in the old Don! So again a point for the new version.So when I do the math, Mr. Akhtar's Don comes out way ahead in sophistication, storytelling, fun, action, thrills, drama, and acting. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will want to go back for more. I will probably go back just so I can watch the demented Khaike Paan number again. And the twist does leave room for a sequel - I sincerely hope Farhan and Shahrukh will do one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is now my favorite movie of all time. It is refreshing to watch a film that isn't cynical or smug. They throw everything in there and the kitchen sink and it is all the better for it. I have been a fan of Indian films for a while now, but this one was perfect Kitsch. It had lots of energy and was just fun to watch. It had a story but a story that didn't take itself too seriously. I have never been able to explain to people how good Indian movies are because trying to explain them never does them justice. Most people look at me like I am crazy. I took a friend who had never seen a "Bollywood" film and she couldn't believe what was going on on screen. Go see it if you have the chance. Shah Rukh's performance was excellent. It was multifaceted to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shahrukh Khan is one of the few Bollywood actors I can sit down and watch mesmerised.He sizzles on screen as the cold; cunning Don. A ruthless Drug Lord who is looking to expand his empire by taking out his boss.The plot is complicated yet, simple. This is a remake of the original and its one hell of a remake; in a sense better then some Hollywood remakes. (This is coming from an avid Hollywood fan) The fight scenes are beautifully shot and the locations are stunning; the lines are a little corny; but SRK can sell it perfectly. Priyanka Chopra was very bad, she cannot act.. I think they should have placed someone like Lara Dutta or Rani into the role...The plot is similar to the original but different, (contemporize man!), Don is an international drug lord...well in Asia...He is pursued by Interpol and is finally caught. A police officer decides to place a mole into Don's organisation and inserts Vijay, a lookalike...to bring down the crime syndicate..but things go horribly wrong.One thing kept making me angry was the boy and Arjun Rampals character, there was no real need. This Don however is more dark and thrilling then any of the last hundred films to come out of Bollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of The Best Movies of 2006</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently watched the original version of "Don" with Amitabh on TV for eighteenth time, I was a bit sceptical about Shah Rukh Khan playing this role as well as the movie, although knowing that it was based on the original by Salim - Javed. But having seen this, I can say that I was totally glued to the screen and not only just with Shah Rukh "King" Khan's performance but also with performance by Priyanka Chopra as "Roma" and Boman Irani as "DCP DeSilva" as well as OM Puri. It was also nice to see Chunky Pandey after a long time, even though it was only at the beginning. The fight sequences as well as the computer visual effects are worthwhile to watch.Sunidhi Chauhan has also done a magnificent job of the re-mix of "Yeh Mere Dil, Yaar Ke Deewana," which was originally sung by the evergreen Asha Bhonsle for Helen in the original. Farhan Akhtar has done an excellent job of this as have the musicians - Shankar Ehsan Loy.The ending of this movie is different to the original and so since, Shah "King" Khan had said that if this "Don" is successful, then and only then a sequel would be considered. So watch out for the sequel of this.Something of as a matter of interest here: Salim Khan of "Salim - Javed" is the father of actor Salman Khan, whose step mother is Helen(she's married to Salim Khan). Farhan Akhtar's father is Javed Akhtar of "Salim - Javed" - the duo who wrote the original "Don."</fullReview>

SRK doing his own stunts, no one can top that. The plane sequence was just mad HOt. This was the movie of 2006. this is the best action movie I think India came out with so far.

		<fullReview>I was scared of watching new version of Don. First of all - because the old one, '78, is classic. Amitabh Bachchan is classic. I was wrong, there's nothing to fear about! I can't avoid comparing those two movies, but...The storyline It's like the old one. Yeah? See the last 20 minutes! Excellent twist of action. What we can see is that the director changed completely the ending (or maybe - the whole movie?) by telling us that *great spoiler* Vijay is Don! */spoiler*. Most of the people just stay in shock after that. Excellent. The fact, that in the old version the good wins, and in the new Don the evil wins, makes "Don - the chase begins again" more interesting, more irritating, and something that just have "something" in it. + for 2006 Don.The acting The whole movie is on SRK's shoulders. It's his job, his main role, his talent which take us to the world of Don. The SRK's Don is different from Amitabh Bachchan's Don. Both Dons are marvelous, of course. SRK made this movie above expectations. His acting is unbelievable! Priyanka Chopra looks pretty, but nothing more - just that she isn't bad. But Kareena Kapoor made her special appearance bright! "Yeh mera dil" is just perfect. Arjun Rampal - I was expecting that JJ's role would be rather better developed. JJ is a total wastage, unfortunately. Other worth a word - Boman Irani and Chunky Pandey.The music It is known that such a superhit must have great OST. And so it is. Dancing scenes - especially Mourya re - are superb.Other Fast cars, fast action, the newest gadgets, cell phones and other technology stuff - wonderful. Suits for Don very well. It just makes the atmosphere!All I would give it 9,5/10 (because of Arjun Rampal, I like him, but this role was just wasted), but it's 10. BUT please... don't make Don 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Farhan Akhtar must have fallen hard in love with Don. His new action thriller is evident of that. His stylish Don: The Chase begins is a triumph of movie making. He took original one and rewritten it, blending old and his new to make his own extraordinary one. His supposedly remake of late seventies version of Don is one of the best movie of the year.In 1976, when original Don released with Big B in the lead, it immediately won its audiences with its entertainment values. But it was its first half hour which left mark. Amitabh portrayed Don with such style it is one of the legendary characters Bollywood ever given to the world of cinema. But after exit of first Don it was only good fate twisted drama at least for me. And now new launch is out there. Shahrukh Khan getting in the skin of the Don persona and he did a terrific job. I must confess I was not very sure if SRK can recapture the magic of the original one but I was wrong. Who else could have created the enigmatic aura way he did?Farhan Akhtar said original Don has a great screenplay and what most difficult and important job was to adapt that screenplay. Plot is successfully reincarnated old pulp setting of crooks and cops in modern day fashion. Shahrukh is Don- ace gangster in Malaysia underworld. His boss Singhania is leading from India. And their mysterious second partner, Vardhan is invisible to both their gang and police. Don is running mob in Malaysia with Narang who is little jealous but having no doubts for Don's capability. India Police is behind them and flew in to catch this racket. Om Puri is Interpol intelligence officer Malik and Boman is DCP DeSilva who can do anything to take down Don and his troop. Priyanka Chopra is revenge seeking sexy femme fatal eager to kill Don who killed her brother and his fiance(Kareena). And DeSilva does it in India but instead of arresting Don he keeps him unconscious in a hospital and he has a better scheme. He sends his look alike Vijay to infiltrate his gang.Movie runs in top gear with SRK on screen. Action scenes are highly stylized. I am not a big chase sequence fan but I particularly liked the car chase sequence. It couldn't have done better. Opening shot has the audacity to set the tone for the lead character and whole movie as well. And so the Martial arts action sequences. Again a chase sequence when SRK cruises off his Mercedes to opposite side under the moving load carrying truck. Most of the scene settings are similar as old one but with distinct touch.This is movie is all Writing, Direction and Acting. Farhan Akhtar's effective use of split screens, closed trunk, dark screen, moving dynamic camera enhances cinematic pleasure. Film's supporting cast did a fine job. All of them. Boman is veteran actor can do no wrong. Priyanka worked hard and did justice to Roma. Other actors are well in their not so long role. Movie is ranked in his technical department and I swear it will sweep all awards in this category. Stunts ? Sets- Costumes (Don's dresses and his tie) ? Photography and even Titles are of A+ class. Splendid job done by musician trio Shankar-Ehsan-Roy! Background score and theme music is atmosphere of Don. Soundtrack specially remixed Khaike Paan Banaras Vala is choreographed on Shahrukh poured such zing and energy crowd goes crazy on their feet. Aaj Ki Raat is second best.And Shahrukh is having moments in the movie. Pure style. Delivering stellar one-liners ("Don Ke Dushman Ki Sabse Badi Galati Ye Hai Ke Vo Don Ka Dushman Hai"). His menace and stylish performance is my favorite of this year till date. Killing his preys, whether in noisy explosions in the very first scene or second one when he injects Ramesh with poisonous needle and goes wavy- silent death punch. Watch him smiling while cops chasing him. His amazingly chilling sense of humor even when wounded to death ("Us Ladaki Ki Maut Ke Liye Ab Tak Naraz Ho DCP"). Having best from life- Moolah, Women, Horses, Golf or Wine. "What a hypnotic character this is!It is not exactly a remake but rather reinvented by a brilliant writer director and it never looses its vintage feel. Whenever I saw original Don I always used to take a pause and think about only one point and yearned somewhere for it. It took fall of 2006 to come true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shahrukh Khan wanted a piece of James Bond and voil?!! Has a pie instead. Right from the first scene, when he utters "Don" to the climax, he reigns supreme. The script is taut-all loose ends having been tied (for those who have watched the previous version). And with the new twists added, the script breathes fresh air. Style and savvy-ness seems tailor made for the movie, which the director claims to be "a tribute to the previous one". The breathtaking action sequences are very new to the eyes of Hindi Film Industry and adds to the heavily loaded USP's of the film. Shahrukh is well mannered (doesn't indulge much in his typical mannerisms)and shows why he is the only one fleetingly good enough to play the lead character. His looks and attitude makes the new "Don" very metro sexual, though Vijay (his double part) staggers through. Arjun Rampal is good, Boman Irani fits into the role again as a duck takes to water. Priyanka Chopra is marvelous as Roma. Glamorous and sexy, she does rev up the screen. Kareena in her cameo is "curves"-incarnate, rather than being seducive. However she does put up a good show. But the film is all about Farhan Akhtar in every frame. His vision in remaking the film, with the fresh turns does pay off really well.The locales are just fabulous. So are the clothes that the characters don in "Don". In a way it is a more "complete" film than the previous version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Don" is pure entertainment. If you have seen the original film, it is even more fun because we can see the bits which were kept by popular demand, as it were, such as Yeh Mera Dil or Kaike Paan Banaraswala. Small things were up-dated appropriately. For example, the red diary has become a computer disc. You can skip the next Bond flick and go see "Don" again. Don will give you action, gadgets, amazing stunts, fast cars, beautiful girls, suspense and plot twists galore. What does "Don" have that Bond films don't? Shahrukh Khan! Plus, Big Song and Dance Numbers. This movie has it all and will get SRK another "Best Actor" award, if he doesn't get it for KANK instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing to note: SRK is *NOT* the big B. Think of Amitabh as, well... Amitabh and Shah Rukh bhai as our own Desi Bond. That is what the new Don is - Bollywood's answer to Bond flicks. Might I add that they've done a damn fine job, too. The story is quite different than the old Don, and there are twists aplenty. However, the story has been updated well and Shah Rukh brings his own flair to the film. The music is good (electronic tunes are my favorite) but not to be compared to the old Don. You'll be looking for Shah Rukh to sing "Main hoon kaun? Main hoon Don!" and be sorely disappointed. :( The bad is that some of the twists seem tacked on as an afterthought and the story is not always 100% smoothly flowing, but the action sequences are brilliant and SRK is a class act as always. The bottom line: If you remember that Big B brought his own style to Don and that Shah Rukh brings his own, much different, style to the new Don, you will be fine. Don't expect to find a literal update (like they do for Devdas), expect lots of change. Take Don: the chase begins as its own film, separate from the Big B's Don.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shahrukh's the real DON</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>yeah it's true i've seen this movie first day first show. And it's amazing though it lacks enough on some VFX n editing part but rest of the things are fine. Though VFX are done by red chillies there's a fragrance of Illusion in the movie. Colour Grading n Cinematography is superb and yeah the costumes are ultimate. Going properly with the theme but sometimes it looks so over but the time you'll take to think about that you'll be taken on a new ride. So everything goes fine and at the end of the movie you'll yourself feel that this is the REAL DON. who looks nice saying those lines that ITS NOT DIFFICULT TO CATCH DON... ITS IMPOSSIBLE. yeah i think they could've shown a much bigger gang of DON but this is my personnel thinking.. May be farhan had something better in his mind. The way Taran Adarsh has criticized the movie shows how much mental level he has. The music is ROCKING. SEL has done a great job accept yeh mera dil... Background score is also ultimate. Great movie worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a Cracker of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My reaction after seeing the movie, &amp; while seeing it is "WOW". The movie has everything going for it. it is fast paced, high strung action with slick sets and visuals. everything about it have been wonderfully executed and it is an edge of the seat thriller. comparisons with the OLD DON is imminent. the first 30 mins, I had spent comparing with the OLD DON and i was thinking, yeah OLD Don was good.but after the first 30 mins, the pace picks up and it is the NEW DON all the way.the story is much more tight and there are lots of mind blowing twists which was never expected.In, the second half the pace picks up and never relents. I also disagree, with people who say the songs were not well placed at all. first of all, most of the songs timing are taken from the OLD DON and then they do provide some relax time so that you could think over the movie while watching the songs or just enjoy some light music. This movie compares more to JEWEL THIEF, with a lot happening in it.This movie purely belongs to FARHAN AKTHAR though. he is the mastermind behind this amazingly cool movie. This says DIL CHAHTA HAI was no fluke.The script by JAVED AKTHAR was good.Even though Comparisons between Amitabh ( the best asset of old don) and shahrukh are bound to pull SHAHRUKH down, shahrukh khan has portrayed his DON and VIJAY very well and he gets full marks for that.if shahrukh is repetitive, try seeing amitabh during the seventies. he would have 5 to 8 movies lined up each year, with the same style of acting. nostalgia set in everybody's mind has led to unfavorable comparisons. remember the scene, where pran walks the tightrope??? with 2 kids and one broken leg?? do you think that is better?? refresh your memories. OLD DON was good but the NEW DON is simply better.go watch it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first,let me tell u that I did not like the Original DON(1978) that much.It was good in parts but it was only the Aura of AB with the music that actually pulled it off.If the same story had been reused,the movie would have ended up being a disaster.But,I guess Farhan Akthar does a great job in this movie.Yes,the beginning is a bit slow but he more than makes up for it by the time the movie ends.Shah Rukh is incredible as DON and the others do their job well.The music is good(A special mention to the Background track...its incredible..).And watch out for the climax...Pros:1)Great acting by Shah Rukh2)Amazing cinematography (Everything looks classy and stylish..just notice the way Shah Rukh wears his tie!)3)A nice racy background scoreCons:1)Vijay part is quiet boring2)Jasjit's (Arjun Rampal) role wasn't required if u ask me..Overall,a great entertainer and worth the wait..!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don ki Remake was awaited by every fan, but to enjoy it is not just possible; it is inexorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don is the movie that shows Shah Rukh Khan at the top of his game. After having already played numerous memorable characters, he has taken the role of DON and made it his own, with shades of many of his previous memorable roles but given a megawatt jolt. His inexhaustible charisma lights up the biggest larger-than-life character in the history of Hindi cinema.Farhan Akhtar demonstrates again why he is one of the most promising directors in Bollywood. He has covered every aspect of the movie with brilliant poise and delivers a highly intelligent action movie. Akhtar has taken of something much revered and made a contemporary, and true, classic that preserves everything laudable about the original, and improves on its every fault. The characters are more fully drawn and their roles are better balanced to provide a more cohesive and engaging narrative.Boman Irani does a commendable job with a crucial role in the movie. Arjun Rampal hardly flinches in what could have been a breakout role but at least stands his ground. Kareena Kapoor makes an excellent turn as the new Kamini and hits every note just right. Lending a lot of substance to the role, she does it more justice than was done to it in the original.It's almost a shame then when Priyanka Chopra becomes the principal female character. She certainly looks the part, especially as it was physically demanding, but doesn't really accomplish anything outstanding with it. Much more note-worthy is Isha Koppikar in the role of Anita. The role is very light on screen time and as subtle as it is brief. Koppikar though, gives a magnificent and under-stated performance to make it shine.The female characters aren't given much focus, but they integrate well into the story and to the central character of DON and give scope for improvement in future instalments of what should become Bollywood's most favoured franchise.The fight sequences could have been improved with better choreography, while the other action sequences range from fairly well-executed to excellent, and all make up a major step forward for Bollywood. The good production value really shows through on the screen.The soundtrack is fantastic and seamlessly complements the on screen proceedings. Each song is not just entertaining, but also progresses the story.The movie has hundred per-cent replay value; it is engaging and entertaining every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is a slick action flick. Well the old don was clichd, and just good performance by Big B was the only thing that made it watchable. I hate how critics trashed this film calling old don a classic. Gimme a break. And if you watch closely, nothing is much changed, it's not coz farhan was too lazy to change the script, it's his interpretation of the clichd story. Just watch the movie once more after you saw the film, and you'll understand how well it is directed by farhan. SRK as the don is cool but the vijay role was over his head. Priyanka is good. Boman is excellent. Arjun is decent. Must watch, you won't be disappointed unless you are just watching to make wortheless comparisons between the two.a 7.5/10 from me and a very good attempt by farhan! Waiting for Don 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing a genuine Bollywood produced movie, I thought I knew what action was, and what the action-movie genre was capable of. I was wrong. Don was the single most impressive, awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping action movie I had seen in years, and is now one of my favourite movies of any genre. It is #2 on my all-time list. After the 'BUCKET LIST'.Why? First of all, the well-known poetic violence of the super-charged action scenes make for a tremendously exciting film. These combine choreographed bloodshed (there is an almost constant stream of bullets) with raw emotion that puts even the best Hollywood actioners to shame. Look at Hollywood action movies today; almost all Hollywood action is inspired (not to mention plagiarised) from the "heroic bloodshed films," the best of which, put simply, is Don.Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez are only the most obvious examples of American directors to put Don's trademark stylized violence to use, and neither handle it as well as Don.But beyond this, the characters and the story are what drive this movie and what truly set it apart. The story of the relentless cop and the vicious killer is only the latest in a long line of detective stories, starting with Arthur Conan Doyle and Edgar Allan Poe in the 19th century, and continuing in every cop show on TV today. The hero and the villain are practically the same; they are only divided by an almost arbitrary line called the law. In Don, both "Don" and "Dumbo" are unrelenting, capable, though misunderstood, professionals. Their motivations differ, but they both have the killer instinct. The classic storyline of the interaction of the two characters who eventually realize their similarities and end up working together has been seen before, but never has it been used to such effect as in Don.Don's familiar themes of brotherhood, betrayal and loyalty also reach their cinematic peak in this movie. The viewer not only wants to see the next pyrotechnic action scene, but is actually concerned with the lives of the characters, an element that is almost always lacking in typical Hollywood fare.Finally, the gun-battle scenes, when they come, are simply the most spectacular, mind-blowingly violent, yet strangely beautiful, action scenes ever imagined or filmed. And last but not least, is the unbelievably powerful screen presence of Don, as always cool incarnate. His effortless lead and the tension created make Don as close as I have yet seen to the perfect action movie. I recommend it to any hard-core action fan and also suggest the lesser films such as those Hollywood spews forth like a cancerous pimple with a bad pus problem...Rating: 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ultra-stylish remake of Don is a creative disappointment. It can't capture the energy of the original. The film begins slowly and it takes well over an hour for the pace to pick up. Shahrukh is a good actor but he fails miserably in trying to deliver Amitabh's immortal lines. Priyanka Chopra sizzles in a supporting role that should have been much bigger. Perhaps the film should have been based on her instead. The music is good and the "Khaike pan Banaras" song is sung and performed with great gusto. The climactic action scene is one big bore. Luckily, a cool twist helps ensure the film ending on a high.Overall 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it is difficult to argue that the new Don comes close to the original act of Amitabh Bachhan, it would be fair to say that Shahrukh Khan does an impressive job of taking on a challenge that many actors would rather not - step into the shoes that are almost impossible to match up to. The original Don was a cult movie, the new Don is a modern day action flick with great emphasis on form and presentation. Though brilliant in patches - such as in the climax and good in most parts Don does not live up to the expectations that people would have from a Farhan Akhtar movie.The script of Don succeeds in retrospect. At the end of the movie there is an urge to go back and see it with the insight gained in the climax. However, while watching the movie the viewers, particularly the ones who have seen the one from the 70's, feel that the movie is not up to the mark. At the end of the day, Don is acceptable partly because of Shahrukh Khan's impressive performance and partly because of the script that keeps the audience engaged if not enthralled.In the final analysis, the viewing experience would be different for the two sets of audiences - the ones who have watched the original Don and the ones that have not. The people who have seen the original Don would be broadly disappointed and sometimes intrigued. The viewers with fresh perspective would be somewhat thrilled by slick action, vaguely impressed by the script and nearly entertained by the actors' performances. Regardless of which group you come from, you nonetheless are likely to feel that this movie underachieves compared to what it sets out to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well i think in don 2 the remake, the only main factor that made this movie a hit was the twist at the end which is the reason why they pulled it off in reaching the 1978 don. Now if they make a part 2 it will be obvious that don will get caught as opposed to in don2 the chase begins, now if this happens this will mess up the 2006 released don and will undermine the whole idea of having the twist, If in the 3rd don they write a script were don is caught i can guarantee 100% that it will be a flop and a very big mistake unless, they write a script that becomes unpredictable for the public to think what will happen and contradicts what I'm thinking they will keep in the story line by getting don caught. Now i hope they don't make a 3rd don because it will spoil the buzz that everyone gets by watching this yrs don2 release. But if don 3 is made then i hope it don't have a story line which I'm thinking!!!! and if which resembles what happened in the 2006 release because if don gets away in part 3 then what will be the point of remaking a part 3? whichever they choose to do with don3 i-e letting him get away or even caching him will be a rubbish, flop decision, unless they can write a mind-blowing story that beats the 2006 don release and 1978 release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this on a school night and didn't really want to go. My aunt/uncle and my parents kept forcing me and eventually I gave in because I didn't want to a miss going to go watch a movie. When choosing a movie, I wanted to watch Jaan-E-Mann but we went to watch Don. I was very annoyed at this point. I felt as if I wouldn't enjoy the movie at all. But less than 5 minutes into the movie, it became my favorite ever. The story follows a drug mafia in Malaysia. Don is the leader and he works for a man called Singhania who used to work for Boris (the man who began it all) with a man named Vardhaan who the police has no information on. It begins with Don doing a drug deal with a TJ. This is where you see that Don is not somebody you mess with and you should always say please to him *wink* You learn that Don has a girlfriend Anita, and men working for him: Ramesh, Narang, etc. Ramesh wants to quit Don's group so he plans to leave but Don find out and pays him a visit. Ramesh dies. His fianc Kamini then goes to find Don and help the police catch him. This is where she tries to 'seduce' him during the song 'Yeh Mera Dil' my personal fave. She fails and Don kills her. Then Roma (Rameshs sister) plans to kill Don herself without the help of the police. She 'joins' Dons group and fools all of them. The movie goes on and Don arrives in India where he will do a deal with a man. Then the police chase begins. Don runs away from the police and almost dies. That is when DCP DeSilva takes him to a hospital and visits a man named Vijay who is Dons look-a-like. DCP DeSilva asks him to pretend to be Don and give them information. He agrees. Don ends up dying in the hospital. Vijay goes to the gang as Don and fools them until he is captured by the police and tells them he is Vijay. DCP DeSilva dies and is unable to help him. The police doesn't believe him and now Dons group knows he is not Don. He runs away from both in search for the Cd Don had made that will save his life. With Roma by his side. You then find out that DCP DeSilva is alive and is actually Vardhaan. He used Vijay to get revenge with Singhania. In the end good wins.. or does it? Vijay gets the CD gives it to the police and helps them put Vardhaan/DCP DeSilva behind bars. But just as the ambulance goes away... Vijay isn't Vijay and he never was Don. It was Don all along. He had switched the bodies and poor Vijay had died. I think this was an amazing twist to the basic story and it never was seen. The second time you see this movie you wonder: How could I have never seen these clues? There were so many all along! This movie is simply amazing!! I want to buy the DVD ASAP and I am completely obsessed Don fan. DON KO PAKEDNA MUSHIL HI NAHIN, NAMUMKEN HAI!!!</fullReview>

Let me tell you what a surprise it was to finally see SRK at his best. I seriously think this movie brought SRK back to where he should be. Other actors/actresses were good, I just thought that maybe Kareena Kapoor wasn't the best actress to play her role (I didn't really like the actress who played the part of Kareena in the original "Don" either). Through twists and turns, SRK getting out of his usual role as the gentle, loving, and giving character he "conned" us in the end. If you haven't see this there is a surprise waiting in the end. Overall, I'm glad I went to see this movie and probably will get it on DVD once it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've all heard it before. "Don is going to flop", "Don's such a loser", "Original Don was better, "..I can't agree with that. I'm sorry to anyone I offend but I just LOVED the new DON !The new "Don" is quite easily one of the most stylish fares to come out of Bollywood. Yes, no doubt the stunts are great, but what really shines is the storyline. There are just too many twists and turns in the movie. While watching the movie, you might not agree that the story is good, there are some plot holes etc, but when you see the last scene, you are completely overwhelmed. Everything, all loose ends are quite adequately tied up. You are blown away by the mastery of the director and scriptwriter.Some of the best scenes of DON would include : The opening scene The car chase in India The aeroplane sequence The whole pre-climax and climax.This has definitely reaffirmed my belief in both Farhan Akhthar and Shah Rukh Khan. Farhan Akhtar has shown that he is still one of the best directors in Bollywood today and quite capable of punching a big punch. And Shah Rukh Khan has yet again proved that he is the undisputed king of Bollywood. It's been some time since Shah Rukh Khan's been in an all out action thriller but he does wonderfully. I'm sorry but I don't think anyone else could have played "DON" except him !Priyanka Chopra and Ishaa Koppikar were adequate and they did what was expected. Kareena and Arjun Rampal were damn good, however. Arjun in his role shows he has taken great strides as an actor. Also, hats off to Boman Irani who plays a very complex character (DCP De Silva) very convincingly.All in all, Don is a movie which has to be seen at least two times. The first time, just allow yourself to be amazed and shocked at the events. The second time, you'll again be amazed at the foreshadowing in the scenes before the climax.Here's hoping for a DON 2...!</fullReview>

Farhaan Akhtar has tried to retain what are the most outstanding memories of the old Don, like the beetel leaf song.. and of course the big line "to catch don is not just difficult but impossible". I think Shahrukh played a darker don and played it well... Farhaan has made among the most stylish Hindi movies of the times.. well done. The attention to certain details of the plot are appreciated when you watch the movie second time around.. i.e., when you realise what the twist in the movie is.. although the beetel leaf song is grossly misplaced and out of sync with the story.. but small glitches are made by the better part of the movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, don't go into unnecessary comparison of the previous Don. This movie is based on it, but quite different in plot. Lets get the nasty part done first. Why would anyone watch this movie apart from being simply emotional because it shares the title with another movie 28 years back ?? I'll give you the answer. Farhan Akhtar. This isn't a movie of Sharukh Khan. But its Farhan Akhtar through and through. Its him who remodeled Don in his own fashion. He told Shahrukh when to stand and when to sit. Its very notable, that Shahrukh as Don, doesn't radiate the same aura that his predecessor did. But he compensates all, by walking the walk, and talk the talk. His height does hinder the character, but the enigmatic smile tells it all.Now that the dirt is out of the bag, we can move on to more pleasurable topics. What makes this movie so fun to watch. Well, I can give you a load of reasons. Farhan Akhtar's direction, Shankar-Ehsan-Loy's music, the enthralling shooting locations in Malaysia, mind boggling special effects, the dearest Pix Chops, etc etc and the list goes on and on. From start to finish, you will be at the edge of your seat. The finesse is just classy, although a bit less suave. Farhan Akhtar outdid himself. Although the harshest critics will complain that there are Hollywood touches everywhere. True you'll remember the police chase from Entrapment, the interrogation from Face-Off, the aircraft action from Con Air, the infamous stunts from XXX, bits of MI-II, but all said and done, he did pull it off. Armed with a plot that is and was mega successful for decades, he pulls all plugs.Probably the only thing that you can criticize in this movie is the casting, which is very much overly done. Actors/Actresses like Om Puri, Arjun Rampal, Isha Koppikar are supremely wasted. The movie was written with Shahrukh in mind. And its just him all throughout. Almost every frame in the movie features him. Boman Irani is fabulous, you cannot imagine any other actor pulling that role off. Priyanka Chopra and Kareena are both just gorgeous. The camera work is exquisite, will remind you of Dhoom. The songs and the background score is also fitting, matching the tone of the movie. The dialogs/screenplay, well they are kinda same, but you'll enjoy them nonetheless. The action sequenced, well lets just say, they are one of a kind, making this probably the most slick movie in Bollywood history.I wont go harping about the plot, because most of you at least have a general idea of it, watching the previous Don, but keep in mind, if you already haven't watched this one, it is a bit different with a few twists in the way, which intricate the plot, and it'll give you an ending, that maybe all of you will like. Just keep in mind one thing, when you head to the theaters. This is a Farhan Akhtar movie, and not a duel between Big B and King Khan. Give the credits where it is deserved. Both actors were marvelous in their own part. But remember it is a FARHAN AKHTAR movie !!!! A simply superb 9/10...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Farhan Akhtar has done the impossible - recreate a masterpiece! I haven't seen the original Don, but from what I've heard, the 70s film is an awesome action-packed thriller that redefined the word "style." One generation later, Farhan has successfully redelivered the film for a new era, still as bold, stylish, and sleek as ever. Of course, he does not falter in making today's international underworld lord tech-savvy with RAZRs, microscopic video cameras, and hot cars. Malayasia, especially the Petronas Towers, have been captured magnificently by the camera. One of my favorite scenes is when a truck is magnetically lifted off a highway onto another ramp. Characters have been developed excellently. Kudos to Farhan, everyone gives a fabulous performance. Remixes are for the most part very well done, except for Paan Banaraswala. Aaj Ki Raat and Yeh Mera Dil are my favorites. Although Kareena does a great job in the song, she doesn't quite match up to Helen's daring dance. The movie is technically brilliant with OUTSTANDING special effects and sound effects that can only be enjoyed in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SRK's "Don" is a real tribute to the original blockbuster.A gripping flick maintaining the story track of the original, while adding more twists and charisma of its own.A fun movie to watch..!! Shahrukh Khan is wonderful, Priyanka Chopra looks pretty. Arjun Rampal once again proves that he can really act. Only disappointing factor was Kareena Kapoor trying to enact Halen. She looks pathetic.Songs are pretty awesome too... specially "khaike paan banaras wala". Same old lyrics with modern touch made the song quite catchy. In fact, me and my buddies are planning to watch the movie again. And if we could manage to sneak-in a few "paans" this time, I'm sure the song would be double entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting tribute to a classic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well just watched the film last night.....and..........I have to say...............IT WAS AWESOME!!!!! Jeez!!! I am not going to make any comparisons with the original otherwise its going to take all day. What I can say is that Farhan's expert direction has definitely helped to flesh out many of the characters, particularly those of DCP DeSilva and Roma. SRK was good, very good. He really plays the evilness of Don's character brilliantly and he really bites into the role of the anti-hero with relish (its obvious he missed playing parts like this after being stuck in the romantic hero mould for too long). Alas, it has to be said his portrayal of Vijay is not quite up to the mark. He hams it up a bit too much when hes in the Bihaari mode and you never quite appreciate Vijay's plight when he is trying to convince everyone hes not Don. He doesn't play up the fear factor enough like Amitabh did so brilliantly in the original. But this is a minor negative in a film full of positives. Priyanka Chopra is simply rocking as Roma. She really makes you believe that this is indeed a deadly woman you do not want to mess with. Surprisingly Kareena has acted very well in her cameo role too, as have Boman Irani and Om Puri (in what little footage he has) in their roles. And the action? Fantastic. Some truly excellent set pieces. The car chase scene when the police are chasing Don has been brilliantly executed, though a tad too long, and the sky diving sequence (which is heavily influenced from the Bond film Moonraker) was very, very good too. Kudos Farhan. And then we come to one of the best features about the film............THE TWIST!!! Oh yes, there is one and it is completely and utterly unexpected and absolutely compelling. But of course, I'm not going to tell you what it is. In the words of Morpheus from the Matrix, "You have to see it for yourself". Of course some Don purists will probably not take to Farhan's version too much. Granted in many scenes that are direct lifts from the original SRK doesn't even compare to the Big B. Neither does SRK infuse the manic energy that Amitabh did into his version of Kahaike Paan. But like I said before, these issues are minor in the big picture. Who steals the film? Well acting wise both SRK and Priyanka Chopra have done very well but the film belongs to just one man. Farhan Akhtar. Enough said. GO WATCH IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish version of the classic, not bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story Don ko pakadna muskil hi nahi, na munkin hai. I think Farhan Akhtar took that line too seriously and you will know why when u watch the movie. The film has ample twist to give a different cinematic experience.To me, this version makes more sense then the original Don as it was silly in some areas. Farhan has taken the script and beaten some sense into it. But of course if the classic Don was not there, this film would not have been just muskil par na munkinPerformance: Oh man....it was like a breath of fresh air to watch SRK in a completely different role after a long time. He does well as the clever Don. He has the right body language, right style and perfect looks for a slick Don. But he fails miserably as Vijay the simpleton. He tries hard but he couldn't pull it off. Compare him to Amitabh's performance and u would put ur head down in shame. Amitabh managed to potray two different people, Don and Vijay. But SRK couldn't. He still had some shades of Don in his Vijay. Otherwise he gave a fantastic performance.Boman Irani was mind blowing and quite easily the best performance in the movie. Priyanka was good too. In fact she should do more action oriented movies as she would look good in it. Om Puri had a small role but he managed it easily. Arjun Rampal was fantastic. Very good performance.Special appearance from Kareena and Chunkey Pandey were decent. And for the first time, Kareena looked HOT!!Direction: You can say its a more slick, stylish version of Don. The direction was good. I can now trust Farhan as i trust Hirani for making good enjoyable movies.Loop holes: -This was present in the original also, when Vijay wants to prove that he is not Don why doesn't he go to Tipu, that kid?? The kid will recongnize him na! -Jasjit forgets to limp in his fight session with Vijay -Everyone knows KarateRating:8/10 A Must watch for the twist!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay... first things first, I have not seen the original Don that stars the legendary Amitabh Bachchan hence my comment is truly based on the movie, without drawing any comparisons with the original. The Don was spooky, malicious, no- conscience dark character who has captured my imagination completely.. and it certainly helps that Shahrukh Khan has given a truly stellar performance. The movies starts off brilliantly, with a very pacey initial half- hour. But the direction lacks in the next ninety minutes making it a trifle boring and stretched. But the two twists in the end actually justify the lengthy middle. Hence overall, the movie was enjoyable, the performances by Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra were satisfactory, but they were too overshadowed by a great performance by the Bollywood Badshah- Shahrukh Khan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DON- The chase begins again.I being a big SRK fan, went in with mammoth expectations like his every movie. more so ever the expectations were high this time as it carried many firsts for SRK. An out n out action Movie, Farhan n him, SRK n Priyanka, SRK n Isha, and more soever the promos were thrilling. To be honest... i sat watching the movie, and was wondering if SRK or farhan have gone wrong somewhere. IN the 1st half, i was feeling low as i thought there is nothing different in the story but though the movie was stylishly presented. But then the movie begins from the interval point. from that point onwards. Movie is a roller coaster thrill Ride. I cant reveal any thing about the story as the story n screen play is the Hero of the movie. One thing is for sure.. Technically this is India's best action movie till date. the Visal effects, cinematography, Background score, Action sequences... all deserve 10/10.. Direction is indeed gripping. Editing is top notch. Of the songs... only ye mera dil is disappointing.. rest all the songs are catchy n well choreographed.. Music is excellent... Khaike deserves distinction. Now performances.. although everyone has ably and sincerely done their job. But still the movie belongs to primarily 2 actors. SRK &amp; Boman Irani. SRK rocks... this is easily one of his best performances till date... Boman is simply superb... Priyanka does a neat job... so does Isha, Arjun, om puri n others..For movie this is the diwali bonanza... and i have already booked my tickets for Friday, Saturday n Sunday... In Short: Don ROCKS P.S. : Don't miss the end...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic entertainment, superbly produced: an absolute thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Farhan Akhtar lives up to his expectations, and comes up with what's probably the best Indian movie of the year. He has shown just why he's one of the best directors in India today, by simply blowing the viewers' minds away. What a movie! It's gripping, keeps you guessing every step of the way, and has a fantastic ending. Total entertainment, really chic, the cinematography was superb, the background score was super cool (a chic 80s techno feel to it, but the songs aren't great), and both Farhan Akhtar and Shahrukh ROCK! The dialogues were fantastic... we were simply blown away. In the 'Govinda' song he's holding the right instrument: the bulbul tarang... details are FA's strengths anyway.For me the movie kicked in only after ten minutes or so: when Don goes to Bombay. Until then it felt like crap: same old tricks, sad golf shot scene.... but boy did it pick up after that.Boman Irani was fantastic. Doing a serious role with no gimmicks: just fabulous.The women were all a let down: so was the choreography. But didn't expect much from them anyway. Isha Koppikar's dancing was especially disappointing. Kareen and Priyanka looked like they were doing aerobics rather than dancing.Shahruk has removed the KALANK of KANK and is back with a bang. It's worth seeing twice and more, of course.Don was the biggest Diwali bang!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don Rocks! SRK Rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one remakes a classic movie like DON!, one has a mammoth responsibility of being close to the original and yet offering something new and fresh. Thus, it is only fair if one leaves the original behind and judges this film on its own merits; albeit, comparisons are inevitable. And that is where the films excels and falters too! The story has freshness with its own twists and turns and it is a captivating experience to say the least. Some scenes actually leave you mesmerized. SRK as Don and Vijay is excellent. And would probably help those to realize the potential of this actor who thought he was not versatile. Let's say one thing here: SRK is the New DON! He is fabulous with pompous style and extravagance as DON and equally convincing as Vijay. His persona in the movie spells panache. And he triumphs in bringing the shades of both the characters well: humour, silliness of vijay and style of DON, naivety of vijay and arrogance of DON. All other actors do their part well too. Kareena looks stunning for her brief role and Priyanka is just improving film by film. As far as the songs go, they gel well with the movie. The choreography could have been much better. Watch out for SRK's energy in Maruya Re, killing looks in Main Hoon Don, and rawness in Khaike... But the film falters in balancing the classic with fresh inputs to the plot from Farhan. The plot and screenplay is faulty at times. It is pretty surprising to that Farhan left some loopholes in the screenplay. But to be fair they are overcome by the twists and slick and glossy feel of the movie and the climax which is superb. So all in all, it is good entertaining action packed movie with it's own share of blemishes. And thankfully made minor by film's execution, direction and SRK's stupendous performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 2006!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you go to watch a movie, you want to feel at the end of it a lot of things. 1)Your money was worth it. 2) the film keeps your attention 3)You love the acting. 4) You wouldn't mind watching it again. 5) Anxiously waiting for the DVD to come out. Well at the end of Don, you feel all those 5 things. It was absolutely the best film 2006 has to bring. if you thought king khan was losing his touch, well for his critics, he surely shut your mouths up! He proves again why he is the baadshah of bollywood. Don had a brilliant storyline, it had better action scenes than krissh (for those pathetic hrithik fans who compare him to SRK). SRK fitted the character of Don/Vijay excellently. The 'khaike paan banaraswala' song was so entertaining. The other actors portrayed their characters well. However it is only SRK who makes his presence immensely felt after the movie ended. Fahran Akhtar proves why he is one of the best directors today. Everything about the movie was original. The movie kept my eyes glued to the screen from the start to the last scene!!! the best line and those that have seen the movie will agree 'I love wild cats!!!'I read a few reviews on the net, all i have to say to those critics who said the movie was not good, your not very good at your jobs. Don was brilliant, it seems like critics are a waste of time nowadays. they always criticise good movies.I would not compare this to the original Don. They are both different. However which Don would i rather be Amitabhs Don or SRK Don. My answer is that it have to be SRK Don.I loved the music and the background score.I went with a few of my mates. i also took my Irish friend, he absolutely loved the film. he said its the best film he has ever seen. His comment at the end 'Hollywood can never make a film as good as this. This film is the best I have ever seen.' Lastly for any moviegoers, whether you prefer Hollywood to bollywood, you would love Don!!!! Go and get yourself our of your seats to watch it, its a definite blockbuster!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb. I normally wouldn't but something compelled me...I'm astonished that this movie is getting a 7/10 rating, when its disappointing at best. Let me tell you why.If this was a Govinda starer, David Dhawan directed movie, sure, this would be popular with the masses who would greatly appreciate their ROI (return on investment). But the exceptions are sky high even before the movie hits pre- screening. Why is that?Well for one, its Shahrukh Khan. I've been an admirer of his early work such as Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, Darr, Baazigar. His later works such as DDLJ, Swades, Chak De were admirable too. I own these movies.Farhan Akhtar with his legendary last name did a fabulous job with Dil Chahta Hai which was partly inspired from his own personal experiences and Lakshya, the beautiful coming of age story which was Hrithik's best.So, with the expectations set high, here we have a remake. The ground rule is that you must make the remake better than the original. Don fails here.Agreed that Chandra Barot didn't create a masterpiece with Amitabh but this movie is is not even a rehash of the original. I could entertain the plot twists of DeSilva being Vardhan as opposed to Mallik or just one kid Deepu instead of two or even the end where they reveal that Vijay is murdered in the hospital.The basic magic of taut tension in every scene was the landmark touch of Salim-Javed ji. Farhan, while adapting the screenplay seems to have been overly influenced with SRK and perhaps took in too many suggestions to make this movie a Bond flick when it's clearly a case of mistaken identity like Audrey Hepburn's Charade.To compare a few scenes, when Vijay is found by the gang for the first time, he is lying peacefully in a hut, clean shaven and well taken care of. In the original, Vijay is hurt, unshaven, dirty and thrown in the dirt which was more believable and had an element of tension to it. Another, when Jasjeet is walking the rope with his kids, there is much more tension than simply crossing a bridge between two buildings.Shahrukh Khan should really stop comparing himself to Amitabh Bachchan and believe in his own talent. There is a reason why SRK surpassed Salman, Aamir, Sanjay, Hrithik in popularity. Because he wasn't comparing himself to them. He fell short of Bachchan, because he was always comparing himself to Amitabh. Don simply lacks any tension and thus eliminating the entertainment factor for me. Farhan should stick to his original scripts which are usually great rather than making any changes suggested by SRK. Watch it once if you can for nostalgic value. I won't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic REMAKE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could never have imagined that a remake of Amitabh Bachan's 'Don' from 1978 would have been considered by any director. I regard Farhan Akhtar as a film maker who has gone beyond the boundaries of commercial movies. His knowledge and understanding of movie making and concepts is more advanced than any other director of this generation. It was evident from his debut movie 'Dil chat hair', that he is talented individual. Many youngsters who aspire to become a director can learn a lot from viewing his movies. His father too was popular for writing movie scripts back in the seventies and eighties. This remake has not only exceeded the quality that was present in the original, but has integrated original thoughts and ideas too. 'Don' is truly the best Indian remake I have seen to date. No other remake has given a spellbinding experience that can be so unforgettable. What makes this movie unique is the concept. Prior to 'Don' there had been two movies which had similar themes, 'chinatown' and 'notorious'. Back in the nighties many movies had used undercover operation themes. Farhan Akhtar's Don is very high on the style factor. There is also a fresh and slick feel to it. The movie has a high production value. Shooting in Malaysia and the action sequences had most probably contributed towards higher costs. Small elements like these have made the movie appear more superior to the original. The climax portion without giving it away has been witnessed time and time again in Hollywood. However the use of it in this movie has given it the unique touch. The plot twist in the ending actually makes the movies stand out in comparison to the original.**********************SPOILERS*********************** The main core of this movie lies on the double role scenario and how the undercover operation entwines together. Don is a international criminal who is on the wanted list. He supplies drugs on an international level and uses Malaysia as his base. Inspector Vardhan (Boman Irani) is hell bent on bringing him to justice. Vardhan is informed that Don will be in India to make a drugs deal. Vardhan appears on the scene to apprehend him but eventually admits Don in a state of unconsciousness. He is in a coma and kept in hospital. No one knows about it. This gives Vardhan an idea to approach Don's duplicate (Vijay) who is a normal guy that lives in Mumbai, to rejoin the gang undercover and hand over to him a disk. This disk contains all confidential information regarding Don's business connections with his boss Singhania.Vijay learns that Don's boss Singhania will be at a party. Vardhaan takes the opportunity to kill Singhania, but also gets killed after a gunfight ensues between Singhania's men and the police. Vijay is arrested and is taken in to custody along with Don's men. After failing to convince the authorities that he is not Don but is Vijay, he is flown to another location by plane to be put on trial. However he escapes and decides to prove his innocence by locating the disk. ****************END OF SPOILERS******************* Farhan has given the movie a very updated and modern feel. His perception of the theme is unique. I don't think any other director could have presented the movie in this style. His directing abilities were displayed at the highest standard. The quality of direction is what sets the movie apart from anything else. The cinematography is another element that gives the movie the lavish image. Many wide angle shots are breathtakingly captured. For example when Don is playing golf, the view of the ocean is seen well too. Initially I felt it was difficult to accept Shahruck in the villain role once again. He did not possess the same fear factor that was present in earlier roles in movies like 'Baazigar' or 'Anjaam'. The negative portion in his role was only evident in the first 35 minutes, so there was less scope in that part. However I was not disappointed by his effort. It was commendable. Sometimes one would feel that he tried too hard.The movies running time was kept to the same as the original. The director has surprisingly managed to achieve this. Personally I don't feel there was any need for this. Maybe a few minutes short would have given the movie a faster pace. Arjun Rampal's character was not enhanced either. This contributed to the movie's longer duration. His involvement was not required until the climax. I expected his role to contribute to the movie to a much larger extent. The climax and Prue climax portion of the movie is the surprise element. In contrast to the original it has been altered in a positive manner to suit ones tastes. In many ways it is more sensible and also seems like an improvement. The climax also encourages the viewer to re watch the movie and search the plot holes. To my amazement I could not uncover any due to the change in the climax. Unfortunately in many other scenes there were flaws which had not come to the editor's attention.All performances were to standard. Sharuck displays his different shades convincingly. He gives a good performance which is certainly better than Amitabh Bachans. Priyanka Chopra was the actress that had the closest resemblance to Zeenat Aman. She also makes a good attempt at martial arts and is very glamorous. Her role was well integrated in to the movie. Kareena Kapoor gives a 5 to 10 minute special appearance, which does not go unnoticed. Boman Irani should have lost some weight for his role but he gives a good performance as the cop. Overall if you are a fan of remakes then this is surely recommended. I will be sure to catch the sequel when it releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad remake at all ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw it a couple of hours back .. and I have mixed feelings about the movie .. Its definitely worth a watch and this movie will not disappoint most of the people. I would not like to compare it to the original simply because the movies are from a different era .. The original is a great movie without doubt. Things I did not like:a) The plot though complex and deep does stretch a little bit and leaves you thinking in the end .. b) It is very funny to see Shah Rukh (and others) fight like Jackie Chan .. c) Shah Rukh Khan's choice to play DON (I know the Shah Rukh Khan fans will not like this) .. I know it sounds silly since I did like the movie but maybe Abhisheik Bachan would have been better for this role .. Just something to think about.Things I liked:a) Soundtrack .. I am not too much a soundtrack fan and go mostly to see good acting and a great story but the songs are done well and are very appealing b) The overall direction is good .. locations well chosen and the feeling of "don" being an international criminal is well conveyed c) I liked the ending .. It is very good.Overall a satisfying movie, I gave it 7 out of 10. Farhan could have done a better job but this one was a hit even before it started screening.And I would also like to add .. Priyanka looks really good (rather HOT) in the movie :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mix Scarface+James Bond and you get "Don".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don has the bad attitude of Scarface, with the coolness of James Bond.Don does not disappoint, it might just surprise you. Like it did me. Goofy at times (some odd dancing/singing suddenly jumps in), but very well done action and filming. The editing could of been better during action scenes, at times you notice bad-guys waiting for their turn and for the final blow.The story is not groundbreaking, but sticks to your typical James Bond style setup. Drugs and power. Almost seems like directors cant think of any other way to go when making action movies anymore...but hey, it works.The thing that REALLY bugged me with this movie was the dialog. This is a "Hindi" movie, but every third sentence is said in English. Why the hell did they do that? Its almost as if they are desperately attempting to attract the American market and thinking this is the way to do it...but it does the opposite. It makes the movie incredibly annoying. Also its the main reason I did not give this movie a higher rating. They should of focused more on sticking to their own countrys style instead of blending in Americas.All in all, its a good movie despite its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There so has to be Don 2!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan and growing up with the original movie, I have to say that the new version of Don was par excellence. One should never compare the two as the new version pays homage to the 70's classic.Although, there are loop holes in the plot which I would like to mention, the biggest one being the fact that... (STOP READING THIS... SPOILER ALERT!), the real Don gets away! Other things to add: Whatever happened to Don's gang, headed by Narang? Roma never got her vengeance and was tricked all this time by the real Don. Boman Irani's character De Silva says at the end that he'll be back and Don will be waiting. And finally, Vijay can't die! Bring him back from the dead.What I'm trying to say is that there has to be a Don 2! Where good will triumph over evil. I'm hoping there will be a sequel due to the number of sequels being made at the moment, Dhoom 2, Phir Hera Pheri and Munna Bhai for examples. Please make this sequel!!! If all goes to plan, I would finally like to say a few ideas to perhaps include in the sequel: The old Roma's character had a Kung Fu master in the original and I think the new Roma should have one too. After failing her personal vendetta with Don, she goes back to her master for advanced training. To excel matters to a high ground, let's have Amitabh Bachchan play this role as a special cameo. That would be awesome! If I was remotely disappointed with any parts of the new version I would have to say it was the lack of the classic cemetery fight sequence. Vijay, Roma and Jasjit join forces for a huge showdown with all the villains. This so should be in the sequel.Talking of Vijay... BRING HIM BACK FROM THE DEAD! How, you say? Well how about the classic coma storyline, that he isn't dead at all. Government officials have him locked up in some secret lab or something along the lines. We don't really know what happened to him. Don switches places and gives him an overdose which presumably kills him or does it? My head is whizzing right now as type this.My DVD copy is perhaps coming through the post tomorrow and after watching it again since October '06, I'm going to be anxious for that sequel. So Mr. Farhan Akhtar... you know what to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don was an excellent film and a very good remake of the 1978 blockbuster. I am a fan of action thrillers and was extremely lucky to see this film on its second day of release. From the time I heard about Don being remade I was too excited because I loved the original.I was even more excited to know Farhan Akhtar, the maker of DCH and Lakshya would be directing it. His previous films were too good and I must say Farhan has done a wonderful job with a remake of a classic. Farhan shows that he is one of the best in India. His films are too entertaining and classy. Don is a class act by Farhan.I am crazy about the film's music. It is very contemporary and foot tapping except yeh mera dil. I did not like this song but on the whole Shankar Ehsaan Loy do a great job.When it comes to the performances no complaints. Shah Rukh Khan takes on the big challenge of getting into the role which was done by the shahenshah of bollywood, Amitabh Bachchan in a beautiful way. SRK gives an amazing performance. It was fun to see SRK doing something entirely different from his previous films. He is very good with action.The others in the cast do a commendable job. Priyanka was very impressive as Roma. Boman Irani, Arjun Ramphal and Kareena do a good job. Om Puri and Isha Koppikar should have been given more footage. All in all an entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the critics. Remember the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see Don, not because of SRK but mainly because Farhan Akhtar was directing it. Before I start reviewing Don- The Chase Begins Again, I want to say that I tried my level best not to compare the two movies but unfortunately ended up doing so and what I realized in the process was that although Don is a remake of the original version, they're too very different movies. They're as different as cheese and chalk. So does Don surpass the original? Well, kinda yes and kinda no. Quite frankly, I never felt that the original Don had set any high standards or so because it was funny at times. The entire sequence where Don's associates find out that it is not Don but Vijay and its because of him that they've been arrested, lol, it was funny. I understand that Don was a low budget movie but just like N2D had said, its utterly stupid for anyone to store all the contact information about the Underworld Criminals in one red dairy. A disc in this one.What Farhan has tried to do with the new Don is make it cooler, sharper and more foxy (yea that's the word). And despite the fact that a talented director like Farhan Akhtar was making this movie, Don does suffer in some departments if you start being logical but not as many if you understand why things are happening the way they're happening and even though Don could've been better, it could have also been worse. The movie starts out brilliantly. Check out the first scene of the movie featuring SRK &amp; Chunkey.The big question that everyone has been making around is that- Does Shahrukh live upto what Amitabh had done in the original? Well, I'd like to quote Shabani Azmi on this, "Its like you're comparing apple and oranges". Where Amitabh had mastered the art of being Vijay, here it is exactly vice-versa. SRK dons the role of DON with complete brilliance. Excellent is the word. I got to admit that I had my fears if SRK will be able to do justice coz I agree, the actor is one of the best in the industry but hardly does he display it on screen. Fortunately this is one of those movies where he does. SRK looks every bit of the Don that he portrays and once again proves that he is the one of the coolest villains on screen- the man you'd love to hate. I do not wanna get into the debate of how some other actor could've pulled it off better coz well, they're not. Hrithik as Don would've been BAD and I am dead sure about that. My friend said Saif could've played a better Don and I agree on that but well, too bad he's not playing it so the discussion is basically useless and after all that I've seen SRK do with this role, it'll be sad if I thought of any other actor playing the role of "Don" anymore. SRK is the king!Now that I've spoken about the lows of the movie, its time I told you how I felt after watching the movie. Well, I felt completely taken up by the charm of the movie and if you're willing to forgive Farhan Akhtar for the few mistakes that he's made, Don is a movie you would want to remember. Especially for the action and the performances. Man O Man! If I had to point out 3 main performances that I liked in the movie, it'd be tough but I'd pick SRK, Boman Irani &amp; Arjun Rampal. Of course there are those that are equally marvelous. For example, Pawan Malhotra as Narang is one performance to watch out for. For all those critics out there saying how bad the movie is... here's my opinion about Don- I LOVED THE MOVIE!!And for all those people going on about how bad Kareena was... well, I can't remember when exactly did Kareena look soooooooo hot as compared to her appearance in Don. For Priyanka Chopra, this has to be her performance after Aitraaz. She perfectly fits in. I do feel they could have got a better vamp than Isha Koppikar but I doubt if the bigger names would have done a role so small. What I really liked is what Farhan Akhtar has done with Arjun Rampal's Jasjit as compared to Pran's. I did go around saying how Arjun wouldn't be able to live upto Pran's performance but how wrong was I. Post-Moksha, out here Arjun Rampal is in full-form again and after Don, he's the second most coolest character in the movie, loved his performance. Boman Irani, too was excellent. I am glad Om Puri took up the role because if he didn't do it, somebody else would have and I wouldn't have liked it. He has a small role in the movie but an important character and with the likes of Boman, SRK and Pawan Malhotra around, you cannot afford to have bad actors around. Don is a complete adventurous ride and barring the few little plot holes, its got enough twists, turns, performances, music and action to keep you glued to the screen right from the first frame to the last. At times you do feel that the movie is getting a bit boring or is lacking the pace but otherwise, its great. I did feel Aaj Ki Raat shouldn't have shown SRK dancing with the chicks, didn't make sense but that's my opinion. Don is truly a nice remake. Much better than the so called action flicks like Krrish, Dus or the Sunny Deol films. You'll enjoy watching it.7/10 from muviegeek.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farhan Akhtar's comeback after Dil Chahta Hai.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Remember. It is not just difficult but rather impossible to catch Don".As Don (Shahrukh Khan) says his famous line to Kamini (Kareena Kapoor) it ignites memories of Mr Bachchan's 1978 portrayal of Don. Don is an international mafia boss who is fast, agile, tough and most importantly intelligent. He has been on the most wanted list of Malaysia, India and almost every other country including UK. He gets illegal drugs and similar substances from India and Pakistan and sells them in UK. He has two other main companions Singhania and Wardhan. Though Singhania and Don's profile with picture is on the records, Wardhan is still a mystery. One day cops get a tip on Don. Cop D'Silva (Boman Irani) is on a high speed chase with Don and Don gets injured. In the hospital Don dies. D'Silva remembers a guy, Vijay, who looks like Don. With an idea and a plan he manages to get new Don into the hostile territory. Will Don be able to help D'Silva? What happens next? Who is Wardhan? Well Farhan Akhtar (director) has all the answers.Though it is hard not to compare Shahrukh's Don to Mr Bachchan's I guess you can always appreciate Farhan's contribution to this remake. Farhan has kept the original script by Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. He has added a little tinge of citrus that not only adds a little flavor but also it smells different. Few sequences as the one with Kamini, were unchangeable. Farhan has written the closing scene and this is a classic example of a better character study. Very intelligent and to the exact point. No writing contribution from Farhan for Lakshya was very evident. Farhan totally went with his Father's (Javed) script on Lakshya. This time for Don he took over and his attempts are evident and are an essential part of the movie. Brilliant! Sharukh Khan has done a great job in portraying the ruthless Don and the average Joe Vijay. Shahrukh knows that he cannot escape comparison with the original Don. But he has managed to get the attitude. Good job.Besides being a remake this movie makes a lot of homages. The Fast and the Furious, Kill Bill, Mission Impossible, Entrapment and Matrix. Well those movies are supposed to be appreciated through little references. Boman Irani is believable as a tough cop after cheesy roles of Munnabhai series. Priyanka Chopra as Roma is a good fit for her beauty. She does some action as well. Arjun Rampal as Jasjeet should have been reconsidered. Shankar-Ehasaan-Loy's music is good to the ears. Their contribution to the basic tunes is appreciable. Overall this movie is quite above the average bollywood movie. Should be viewed at least once.My rating: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the corniest movie ever. First thing they need better acting and better story line. It must establish a better character study and not just dealing and things. You really got to check yo self before you wreck yo self. Get out of the theatre and get your money back. Too bad you lost time and you cant get that back. I give this movie 10/10. i recommend it to everyone out there. In many situations there have been lame scenes where they try to establish the character but it turns out to be cheesy. I as a citizen of canada was offended by this movie. Some times i wish i did not see this movie, but sometiems i want to watch it once more. This movie takes you through a roller-coaster of fun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don Thrills!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Don is a thrilling action adventure from Bollywood. Finally, SRK is given something to do besides dance and romance the ladies. He got his start as a villain in Darr and Baazigar and some 12 years later, returns to the type of role that made him into the super-star that he is today.The new Don has amazing stunts. Sure a few are ripped off of Hollywood films such as Eraser, The Matrix and Con Air, but I'll give the director credit for pulling them off with great technical finesse. The scene that occurs on an airplane, with Don jumping out to retrieve a parachute is amazingly filmed. The film is slick and fast paced with a bunch of twists and turns. I've not seen the old Don with AB so I'll reserve my comparisons until I have. But i believe both films should be viewed independently. The old flick was made in 1978 and the new one 28 years later. Many have complained that SRK would not be up to the task to play a mafioso role. But once again his larger than life persona (similar to Tom Cruise) plays well with the meglo-maniacal role that is required for the Don character. Finally, a note about the big twist at the end. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! Vijay being revealed as the Don during the final minutes of film is a brave decision by the filmmaker. At times I wondered how "Vijay" was able to learn English, martial-arts and all those cool moves with the ladies in such a short period of time. The final reveal makes all of the above make sense. I highly recommend this high-tech, high-octane action thriller. A rare gem from Bollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accept DON for what it is ....DON't Compare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Farhan Akhtar ever since his suave urbane comedy Dil Chahta Hai, and his hugely underrated Lakshya. Having got used to his hugely relate-able characters, impeccable characterization, and a tight gritty script more than not, I was more than intrigued by his attempted remake of DON. The ultimate masala and formulaic movie of the late 70s, epitomized by the cool, inimitable AB as the ultra-cool, silent Killer DON, as well as the nice simpleton Vijay, has been etched in the minds of the generations as being unremake-able. So would Akhtar, whose previous ventures are anything but formulaic and SRK, who drifted away from the menacing killer persona ever since Baazigar be able to pull it off!!! I was intrigued. After watching the movie, I have to say the movie was not all that I expected. And by that, I do not mean Farhan Akhtar failed. I do not mean SRK failed. This is not a frame by frame remake of DON. Halfway through the movie you realize that the plot deviates from the original. Halfway through the movie you realize that you can't exactly predict what the next scene is going to be. Halfway through the movie you realize that good guys and bad guys from the original are not carried on to this remake. But halfway through the movie, I couldn't sense that credibility to Vijay's character that forms the crux of the original. I expected that Farhan's take would give me a glimpse of what unlimited power would do to a simpleton. I anticipated to see a conflict, a la Frodo's conflict from the ring of power. Would Vijay be lured into the world of DON, because thats what the character is all about!! I expected that that would be an interesting twist from the original, where good remains good, and truth triumphs no matter what. But Vijay is transformed into DON, he doesn't remain what he should be throughout the movie, but ultimately does prove his innocence in the only way it makes sense. And thats the masterstroke of Akhtar, where it just makes more sense than the original. There are the trademark subtleties of Farhan Akhtar that are interspersed throughout the movie, that demand a repeat viewing and multiple viewings of DON. And of course, Main Hoon DON is so much more cooler and drips more of the DON attitude than did the original. None of the other songs either match the energy or the sensuality of the original songs. Of course, the script could have been tighter, and some scenes have literally gone over the top, and there are some holes that you might not fill until you watch the film again. And there might be some more holes then too. Some things are silly (for ex. where the DON gets his memory back) but I guess that is a tribute to similar campy situations of the 70s. But it's definitely a more cerebral film of the recent times. SRK rocks as the DON as well as the DON impersonation. Priyanka chopra gets a decent role for this movie. The other roles are adequate, but Boman could have handled his alter-ego better. Whether you like it or not, DON is definitely worth a watch, for its story and direction it takes. You watch the old one for all heaviness, for all the melodrama, but you realize that now, its much more simpler, and subtler. You might not like to say SRK is better than AB, are ek baat samajhlo? us baar, DON pakadaa gaya tha?!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farhaan Akhtar is a 21st century man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was dragged into the movie theatre by my daughter to watch this remake. My reasons for resisting were two: 1) I absolutely don't like SRK and 2)I loved AB and all his films and had really liked DON.Well, I sat enthralled by the movie through those three hours that that a Hindi movie usually takes to unfold.Shahroukh is able to portray a power hungry ruthless gangsta type with absolute believability. He is immensely believable in his role as a youthful, die-hard diabolical ambitious gangster who will do anything to retain his power. I did not experience the familiar sense of disbelief that usually accompanies one when watching a Hindi movie. Mercifully, SRK abstains from dishing out his goat like laugh or his standard expressions. He looks mean,suave, smooth,cruel,sexy,conniving, ruthless-- everything.Thunderous applause! Farhan Akhtar has done what is acutely difficult--direct a remake of a cult classic. I know there are those on this forum who are perhaps too young to have watched the older version and then there are those who like to sneer at everything from the 80s but back then when the first DON was made we ere very impressed indeed. AB was fabulous. We loved the music and accepted even the impossible sequences in the film.This film, made in 2006, when the film-goer is jaded, cynical and extremely demanding, is equally impressive.Akhtar,has the contemporary feel for cinema. He knows how to deal the cards when it comes to direction and producing a great slick, smooth, thrilling, fast moving action movie.The story moves effortlessly,the screenplay is seamless and the camera-work absolutely fabulous.The men in the movie are great (with the possible exception of poor Chunkey Pandey). Arjun Rampal looked like a "Jasjeet" and Boman Irani is growing by leaps and bounds in his repertoire. Om Puri was great as usual though a trifle wasted (and, I noticed, was looking considerably bigger than usual) The women,on the other hand,were mere molls. That was the big disappointment for me. I mean, why would Farhan not want to make use of the talented Priyanka and if she was not talented enough, then why not choose another female lead? Priyanka, Isha both were completely sidelined in the movie though the first scene of Priyanka really built up audience expectations.Kareena was sexy,buxom and beautiful.I know Farhan did not have much luck with his second movie but I remember Dil Chahta Hai and even then we were struck by his sensibility as a director--totally 21st century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don works for surprising reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don works. A slick remake of the '70s hit by the same name, its strength, surprisingly lies in its differences from the original. Unlike the original,this one does not show all its cards at once and deals the deck one twist at a time. The twists in the story work not because they are particularly well crafted but because they represent differences from the original and are therefore unexpected. The film looks gorgeous - beautiful people, clothing and locations, not to mention the attention o detail that gives it the look and feel of a top tier Hollywood action flick. And finally there is ShahRukh playing a larger than life on with snarls and smirks and over the top growls and making it work like only he can.The weakest parts of the movie are where Shahrukh plays the pan chewing simpleton, most significantly in the "...Pan Benaras wallah..." song. The song simply doesn't work, the setup, the dance moves and Shahrukh are all wrong and this can be a great disappointment for fans of the original. There is also this scene lifted from ConAir that the movie would have been better without.Net if you willing to let go of what you know and like about the original movie, you should have a good time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film. Much better than old don ...This film appeals to more of a younger audience.Don brought something new fresh and exciting. Old Don was good but it was out dated and ShahRukh Khan brought much more of a ruthlessness into the character. Plus if you watch the old Don it's not great acting really all Amitabh Bachchan does is when he becomes don he lowers his voice talks deep then when he is Vijay he raises his voice and has a higher pitch .Where as Shahrukh's actually act example when he is Vijay he changes his hair style and adds more greese and when he is Don he becomes an aragant king which we all can see when he acts Don in the film Don is ex actually what Hindi films needed just when we were going off the plot a bit... Dhoom2. Only reason why Dhoom 2 made more money was because it was released when no other decent Hindi film was released Don was released on the same day as Jaan-E-Maan and it smashed it no one went to see Jaan - E- Maan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been waiting to see this for a while and glad it's finally been released officially on DVD... almost 4 hours long, thank God for the 'pause button' &amp; 'fast forward' for annoying song &amp; dance!! I must say, I really enjoyed the production. Music is great, the contemporary styling is spot on... But, it's also quite different to the simple and perhaps more innocent story of one of the ultimate classics of Bollywood movies from 1976... (Shah Rukh versus Amitabh.... are you mad??!!)... this is certainly more violent and has been given an intense touch of darkness which I really didn't expect (and not sure I'm comfortable with)... much likeness to the style of more recent and current Hollywood thrillers and TV dramas such as '24'.All in all, this was well worth the wait... I don't watch too many typical Bollywood flicks so this comes highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly international... That's to sum up DON. Intelligent twists in the story, no superhero stuff, and no nonsense overdose of stunt scenes. India was looking for an answer to Bond's intelligence and sleekness... Here's DON!! The car chase was mind blowing (OMG!!)... Shah Rukh is the blood and soul of this movie. That cold intelligent look, that ruthless dialogue delivery - it's difficult to watch the movie just once if you like it... He etches out an entirely different portrayal of the Don and cleverly and very deftly does away with a lot of potential comparison. Guess that's why he's called the King. :) Priyanka Chopra's the smart hot babe. The only two actors out of place were perhaps Om Puri and Isha to a certain extent.Not to forget Farhan Akhtar - amazing job dude. Kudos to you for going ahead with your brave decision, giving it your best shot and finally adorning it with perfection. It was difficult to hold on to the pace of the movie, but wherever it dropped, I guess it was at par with the narration. Amazing work. Though, must admit, a little more could've been worked out on the death defying diving scene.On the whole, movie's rocking, amazingly sleek and sexy and very sharp. Should definitely be given a watch. Coz I guarantee if you like it, you will JUST LOVE IT!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Bollywood Film of 2006</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best film of 2006. SRK did a really good job portraying Don, it was flawless. It differs from the original Don. Like the person who posted the comment before this, Big B and SRK are two different actors. They like to do things their own way, with their own style. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Every actor and actress in the movie did their job without flaw, and brought back the name Don from the 1978 to 2006. Also, this film has stepped up a bit. The film is more modern. For example, everybody has cellphones, and really luxurious cars. In the movie, you see all the coolest cars, like Ferraris, and Lamborghinis. For some reason, Don likes to drive Mervedies-Benz. Like I said, this is one of the best movies that were made in 2006. All the hype that existed before this movie came out was true. All though some of the scenes, like the skydiving stunt may look fake, I looked it up, and one of my websites that I went to showed me was that the skydiving stunt SRK did was actually him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new cooler, meaner Don has arrived....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I finally watched Don - The chase begins here is my review of the movie.Before I went to see this movie, I was very enthusiastic to go see it and then the first reviews began to come in and some of them were negative. The reviewers claimed that the movie could not match the original. My enthusiasm kind of declined but I still wanted to see it. From the promos I had seen of it, I could not tell how this movie may have failed in comparison to the original.The original was quite cheesy with lots of bad editing. The good things about the original was the music, story line and of course Amitabh Bachchan who had played Don. From seeing the promos it seemed like the new movie was slick, contemporary and stylish. I could not tell why the film critics were bashing it.Now after seeing the movie, I know that the movie critics are full of sh**. They don't know what they are talking about. This movie in comparison to the original is a true gem.The director, Farhan Akhtar has done a great job transforming this movie for a new generation. Like I said, the movie is stylish, contemporary, fast paced, slick. Not only that Farhan Akhtar has spiced up the story by throwing a wonderful twist at the end of the movie. I think the twist at the end is what makes this movie a gem compared to the original.Farhan Akhtar has been able to remove the clunkiness of the original with sharp editing and has improved on the storyline to remove the plot holes. He has paid attention not to remove key elements of the storyline. You find everything in this movie that was in the original and much more.He has paid tribute to the classic by keeping many of the key scenes in the movie. He also used many of the key dialogs from the original that made it such a cult classic and has gone further by adding more memorable dialogs that will be remembered in the years to come.He has transformed Don into an iconic character like James Bond. The new Don is gadget friendly. He uses cutting edge technology in his crime and uses martial arts to fight his enemies and jumps off a plane escaping his capture. Don is truly invincible in this new film. The dialog "Don Ko pakad na mushkil hi nahin, Na mukin hai" (It is not only difficult to catch Don but impossible) is completely true. He is also ruthless. Don in the remake is a much darker Don than the original.This movie reminded me of the Mission Impossible films. This is a movie with a little complicated plot with lots of characters who have important parts to play as the story unfolds. Most of the characters are memorable in the movie.The background score adds more to this film. The music composer trio Ehsaan, Shankar and Loy have done a great job modernizing the original background score that was made by Kalyanji Anandji in the original. The background score is a character of its own in this movie. All the important songs from the original are all there and they blend in very well with the plot. The only song that does not fit into the storyline as well and probably not as good as the original is the Paan song. The two new songs that are added are probably better than the old songs. The two new songs added are Morya Re and Aaj Ki Raat. My favorite is the Aaj ki Raat song. Part of the story is executed during the song. That is probably the reason why they did not use this song for the movies publicity.The action and the chases were great in this movie. There was no cheesy action in this one unlike the original. The special effects were far superior than the original. There were no obvious blue screen effects in this one.The only thing I could knock this movie for, is that Amitabh Bachchan is missing, being such a big fan of him. But I must commend Shahrukh Khan for doing such a good job as the Don. It is very hard to fill the Big B's shoes. His Don is definitely more darker and vicious than Amitabh Bachchans. In the beginning I had a tough time seeing Shahrukh as Don. I was comparing him to Big B, but by the end, Shahrukh had become the new Don in my mind.With the new twist, the director has made room for a sequel. It would be great if a sequel was made for this film. The twist also almost compels you to watch this movie over again. Farhan Akhtar keeps giving us hints through the whole movie about the approaching climax. Rewatching the movie might reveal more that the viewer may have missed the first time.I still am not sure what the critics were complaining about. The movie has surpassed my expectations of it. The movie has good acting, good story line, good music, good songs. It is stylish, slick and memorable. It is a movie that can be watched over an over again. Farhan Akhtar has given a new life to the action thriller genre in Bollywood.Well done, Farhan Akhtar.</fullReview>

Usually you can tell it's completely fake but this one was worth the watch.Some parts of the story did not connect well, especially the end. Honestly, they should have not done a remake rather a whole new story similar to the old Don. It would have been much better not knowing what's going to happen. The story writers need to review the story before putting it into production, they missed some important points.Story is a little messed up compared to the old one... big surprise in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SRK rocks!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me make it very clear at the outset that this is my view, and not a definitive guide of what to expect from the movie. So, here we go.Comparisons are inevitable, but not for me, because the old Don was released much before I was born, and I saw it at the time when such thrillers were being routinely made. All said, the old Don was a cool movie. Come to think of it, it was surely ahead of its time, and hence could fit relatively better in today's times. Amitabh rocked in the movie!! Now lets some to the subject of this piece. Don (2006), directed by Farhan Akhtar, and starring SRK, is an intelligent movie, a well crafted thriller, that takes time to involve you, but leaves you satisfied at the conclusion. It is stylish, cool, modern, and very hip. A tad slow at times, the first half doesn't spring much surprises, with most of the story being same as the earlier Don. That said, it is still watchable, mainly because of SRK. It is refreshing to see him so controlled, and yet so cool and DON'y' (for want of the perfect word!). Not once does he overacts, and such a restrained performance makes up for a slowish first half. He is very well supported by Boman Irani, who is just remarkable! This man is a true actor. About 20 minutes or so before the interval, the film begins to grow on you, and you actually forget the earlier Don. What I mean to say is, you stop thinking whether this scene is the same, this situation is identical. By this time, the supposed remake has evolved! The second half is more than just gripping; it just changes the entire texture of the movie! There are a lot of twists and turns, and all of them unpredictable! At the end of it, you have a movie, which has the basic body of the earlier Don, but the character has changed completely. It feels like you have watched a movie which isn't a remake, but a movie with similar story as the earlier one. That said, it would have been better had this movie not been publicized as a remake, it would have aroused less expectations, and thus made more impact.SRK outshines himself this time, and manages to act out the character he portrays, be it the innocent Vijay, or the menacing Don. There is not a hint of overacting, and it only shows how much a director's actor he is. Comparisons would be unfair, lets just say this Don rocks too!! Priyanka and Isha look good, so does Kareena in a minuscule role. They don't have much to act, and they manage to support the film in the best possible manner. Arjun Rampal is a tad wooden for an aggrieved man, but his voice makes up for his expressions. Maybe some people do not really act out grief, they just speak and see! Boman Irani is excellent, and the way his character develops, only he could have played this part. He even triumphs over SRK in some scenes! This guy should win some awards. Om Puri has a small part to play, and he is as usual. Actually, he has been wasted! Cinematography is good, locales are a visual delight. The only sore point is the music. It isn't bad, but it isn't consistent. The title track, and the original track rock, while the tracks retained from the earlier Don pass muster. The picturisation of Khaike looks odd when it comes, but at the end you realize why it was like that. Background score is electric, and really complements the mood of the film. Special effects are very well executed, and do not look tacky like they usually do in Bollywood. Stunts are nice too, though nothing extraordinary.So I come to the most important question. Will this film be a huge hit? The answer would be NO. The reason is not because I liked the movie, but because it is an intelligently made movie, where you have to carefully watch and infer, and remember the clues dropped to you. To enjoy this movie, you have to forget that there was an earlier movie with a similar story. And that's where the movie will fail, because it has been publicized as a remake, and so the public will go and start making comparisons there, remembering the earlier Don. Also, the sluggish first half won't help the film, and the classy treatment of this massy plot won't find universal acceptance. Maybe some high octane stunts, though unnecessary, and some power packed dialogues, in the typical Bollywood style, would have helped the film. But then again, this is not what the movie intended to be, and what Farhan wanted to make, he has made well. This movie has everything it needs, and nothing extra. Even SRK is not the usual hyperactive that he is, and that for me was my money's worth! Don ko dekhke bhool paana mushkil hi nahi, namumkin hai.! P.S.: 7 of us went for the movie, with 3 being perennial SRK haters. Even they appreciated him, and liked the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Don" is slick and quite entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Don yesterday and I have to say that I was quite impressed with the film. While still being a bit on the lengthy side, I felt that especially after just seeing the original for the first time (which is a deserved classic), that the filmmakers made a very good attempt at updating the plotting for modern audiences. Good scenery, well-filmed sequences (the skydiving and some of the fights were nicely done), and Shahrukh was quite convincing as a villain (this is probably the closest we'll ever see him attempt something like Pacino in "Scarface.") The musical score and numbers were well put together (love the trance/techno updating with the highlight being the betel nut dance number). The twist finale is also very satisfying and just solidifies my thoughts about the film (and how Shahrukh's dual roles play into it). Solid and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to and I will comment only on ONE aspect. Please people forget the OLD, so called "Classical DON", before u watch this awesome movie with breathtaking slick moves. I have to say "WOW" and "WOW" again, for FARHAN had handled the movie so well with such subtlety, especially the great ending. I felt that (along with my room-mate)the ending gave this version more foundation for all the things that happened earlier in the movie. I must say Shahrukh had the perfect attitude of a stylish DON; the looks, the mannerisms, the style and finally the cool goggles. Farhan made us discuss the movie at least for two straight days. Thats an achievement!! Finally bollywood is producing movies with variety. I might not have brought the true essence of this DON, but really its worth to watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking a yesteryear hit can be an arduous task. Especially if it happens to be the Amitabh Bachchan starer DON. One film people remember vividly for various reasons, right from Big B's towering performance to the popular tracks to its gripping story and sharp execution... The advantages first? Perhaps, the new generation might not have watched the classic starring Bachchan. That makes the 2006 adaptation a novel cinematic experience. The present version also arouses tremendous interest since SRK steps into Bachchan's shoes...DON was made in the 1970s and a new version, with appropriate updates, is always welcome...Most importantly, every director has his/her style of interpreting a story. Chandra Barot had his way of narrating a story, Farhan Akhtar has his own unique style...The sole disadvantage? Since the Bachchan starer remains etched in the memory of a section of moviegoers, the SRK starer carries a massive responsibility on its shoulders. The comparisons, therefore, are inevitable. Every character, song and the impact of several vital portions will be viewed minutely...Any area where the new version works? Of course, it's far more glossy, far more stylish and far more visually appealing. Let's just say, the new DON is body beautiful, minus soul</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I was extremely skeptical at first. Most Indian action movies are Hollywood wannabes, in my opinion. However, I was glad I saw the movie. I was excited to see an Indian action film for once. The stunts and fighting was practical and legit. The story was actually good and acting brilliantly plaid. SRK did such a good job at his roles that I didn't even see the end coming. He was so much better than Johnny Depp in the Tourist. I have so much respect for SRK now that I saw this movie. It lived up to the name of an action movie. I sincerely hope Bollywood continues to collaborate and creates quality and legit action movies like this one. Well done India. Well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don directed by Farhan Akhtar is boring,tiresome film.It would be shameful to tell that the movie was a remake to the 70's classic Don starring Amitabh Bachchan.The new Don is not even half-entertaining as the old Don.Story:-In 2006, the drug trade is booming; trafficking between Asian and Europe is at an all time high. It is at this time that the Malaysian intelligence and Anti-Narcotic department are called upon for assistance by their Indian counterparts. There are rumors that the gang recently moved their operational headquarters. The cartel is headed by the dreaded Singhania, but what many people do not know is that the business is truly managed by his lieutenant, Don(Shahrukh Khan). A man who lives life on the edge, Don is constantly expanding the size of his empire while evading arrest or death at the hands of his enemies, both within and outside the law. He is unstoppable in his pursuit of absolute power. His chief pursuer is an Indian police officer, Desilva(Boman Irani). He is a man who has sworn to put an end to this nexus of evil and knows that in capturing Don lies the key to unlock this puzzle. And one day he succeeds. Don is captured and Desilva puts his plan into action. Unknown to even his own department, Desilva has recruited and trained a man who is a spitting image of Don. His name is Vijay(Shahrukh Khan). Vijay infiltrates the cartel and manages to give Desilva all the information he needs to bring it down. But in a bizarre twist of fate, Desilva is killed during a raid and the secret that Don is in fact Vijay, a police informer, is buried within him. The only people who realize that he is in fact an impost are the members of Don's cartel, and they want their revenge. Vijay manages to escape and is now on the lookout for the one last piece of evidence that can get him out of this mess. Helping him on the quest are two people. The first is a Roma(Priyanka Chopra), a young woman who was working in the gang, but only to avenge her brother's death. He had been mercilessly killed by Don when he had decided join the gang. The other is Jasjit(Arjun Rampal), the real father of Vijay's adopted son, Deepu. He owes Vijay for having looked after the boy while he was in prison. Wanted by the police, hunted day and night, forever on the run. The chase has begun. ( Om Puri's character Malik and Isha Koppikar's character Anita are not even worth of writing in the story because they hardly do much in the film) Don is good only for two reasons: i)Stylish cinematography,Good stunts and electrifying background score. ii)Excellent performance by Boman IraniThe direction is bad.The music is average.The performances except delivered by Boman Irani,the rest all are dull.All in all,Don is bad watch.Disappointing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the classiest film even made in Bollywood, Don is a must-see. With spot-on performances, thrilling action sequences and a jaw dropping finale, this movie takes the Indian film industry to another level. Being a remake of the original Amitabh Bachchan starer Don back in the 1970s, the story is pretty much the same. What sets this film apart though are its twists. If you've seen the original Don, the interval will keep you hooked but it's the ending that will knock you out! ... courtesy Farhan Akhtar. All the actors deliver credible performances with a special mention to Boman Irani and of course Shah Rukh Khan. Unlike the other recent action movies, the action sequences in this film are very believable and very real. All in all, one of the smartest, slickest Hindi movies you'll see... Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was initially sceptical about Don being remade because the original Don is one of my favourite Amitabh movies and was even more sceptical when I found out that son of Javed Akthar, Farhan Akthar was going to direct it. I was however pleasantly surprised, though not quite as good as the original but considering that most remakes are terrible it was decent entertainment. There are however some quite serious flaws. One of Farhan Akthar direction, his movies are known to be slow and stately paced, for instance Dil Chata Hai. Unfortunately Farhan Akthar brought that same slow stately pace to Don, which considering Don is meant to be a fast paced action thriller can be a huge flaw. Another flaw is that the original Don had an element of surprise and since this is a remake the element of surprise disappears because I already know that the policeman(In the original played by Om Shivpuri, in the remake played by Boman Irani)will be the head of the criminals. Thankfully it is not a complete disaster, Shah Rukh Khan almost saves the movie singlehandedly. His rendition of Khaike Pan Banaraswala could have fallen flat on its face but instead is a success. Another saving grace is the twist ending, which was not in the original that had me reeling from the shock days later. As far as remakes come, you could do a whole lot worse than Don.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started watching Bollywood movies about a year ago and i must say that i find a great improvement in latest releases (compared to, lets say, movies that are 5 years old or more). Better acting, great camera angles, nice musical acts, interesting plots, and the scripts are waaaay better than before. Just to say that my husband LOVED this movie and also Om Shanti Om. Thats a lot to say because he is usually hypercritical and doesn't like Bollywood movies at all. Shahrukh is a better actor everyday. This performance was absolutely convincing, even if he has a double role as Vijay/Don, which are quite different characters. And nice fighting scenes. I didn't think i would see kung-fu fighting in a Bollywood movie. I sincerely hope we have more Bollywood releases in Argentina. They release only a few titles that go directly to DVD and are hard to find. Last movie to show in movie theaters was Lagaan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The much awaited movie of the year 2006 is Don.I must admit it is an enhancement to the older version of DON that features Amitabh Bachan."DON ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin na mumkin hai".Farhan Akthar highlighted this particular statement in this film where it was not given much importance in the older version.DON is worth watching for Farhan Akthar's direction style.He got pure excellence to the film.He amalgamated latest technologies to this old story.SRK performed well in the tittle role.Action scenes were conceived well.In fact the best in the recent time.Photography is exceptional.Chasing scenes are the best in the film.Priyanka is stunningly gorgeous in the film.Isha did well in her role.Boman Irani excelled in the film.DON's story is that to Indian Cinema like God Father film's story to Hollywood.Thatwhy it was remade in that many languages such as Telugu,Tamil,Malayalam etc.First half is predictable if u remember the old DON.But it was second half that chokes you.Petronas scene of Arjun Rampal,DON kidnapping scene,DON entrance scene,Climax all are exceptionally shot.Music especially Background score by Shankar,Ehsaan and Loy is terrific.The full credit must be given to the Director.It is Farhan's excellent adaption to one of the most popular film stories in Indian Film History.A must if you are fond of action flicks.The song featuring Priyanka and Isha is the best song of the year 2006 and it will stimulate you pleasurably.All in all,A worth watching film with amazing stunts and exotic locales.</fullReview>

Good story, with good special effects, good actors (they play really in a good way and the most important they are convincing).Just few critics about it: When we think in a deeper way we can see that there is some inconsistency in the story (some things that they say happened that it would be impossible to happen in reality).

		<fullReview>The Movie is definitely successful. The backbone script has strong depth in the characters and the plot. The locations are carefully picked. The cinematography is unique, as it leads in the cool "Matrix" feel, with the light green tone. The background music is energizing and fits the story. The casting is perfect and the performances are strong. The story is told in a very progressive manner. This is a unique blend of Western and Eastern tastes. If anything that was flawed were the few unnecessary songs, that may have slowed the movie down. But the makers may have included them due to the fact being that this is a remake. The action and dance choreography is pure outstanding. These go to show how much talent is emerging from th young Farhan Akhtar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just an average fare..one time watch..no way near original version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all,I have never liked remakes and feel they should never be made but when this movie's promo came..i thought that this would be interesting to watch,but some days prior to release i watched the original don and was absolutely mesmerized by Amitabh's performance in the movie which gave him the Filmfare best actor award.Of course,the best thing about original version was it's unpredictability as we never knew what is going to happen, that's why i think that a suspense movie like don should not be remade. in the new version we know everything that will unfold except a couple of twists with one in the climax, which makes the movie boring, to be honest.After 2 good movies Dil Chahta Hai and Lakshya, Don is the weakest attempt of Farhan Akhtar,the music and background score by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is good though just like the original version.Now for performances, Shahrukh is OK as don but sucks as Vijay, maybe he just can't relate to Vijay's character which probably Amitabh easily did being a Chora Ganga Kinaare Waala himself(pun intended) as he's from Allahabad, even in don's role Shahrukh blatantly overacts in some scenes to be honest, to be straightforward he's incomparable to Amitabh in the original..no offence for Shahrukh fans but he was way better in movies like Chak De India,Swades,Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi,My Name Is Khan, DDLJ, Baazigar, Darr.. Priyanka is good though, Arjun is OK,Boman is OK but overacts in the climax,Om Puri is wasted as he has no role!!, Isha Koppikar's got nothing to do..While the original don unfolded at a feverish pace with excellent acting and dialogues by Amitabh, it was a taut thriller hence keeping everyone glued to their seats throughout, this one is slow and boring most of the time, and the copied dialogues from original don is a bad idea. But the new movie does have a different style, the action scenes are OK.At box office this movie was a moderate success not like the original don which was a Superhit,this movie was a moderate success also due to Sharukh's popularity overseas while this movie was a below average fare in India but a Superhit overseas..making it a moderate success overall, and also the factor that many people watched it to see how Shahrukh's steps into Amitabh's shoes.Watch it if you are a die hard Shahrukh fan or like style over substance, but if you've seen original don you can clearly feel how much better the original was..</fullReview>

Even the songs are different, though it sounds like the same tune. SRK is one thing and Amit-ji another: Shah Rukh is the Baadshah and Big B a legend.The makers completely changed the crappy old story of 1978 Don into a new action movie, and not a bad 'clich' one like Krrish. THis movie beats MI/MI2/MI3 by far! Because it's got both good action and good actors, that make it look credible.SRK is THE best and it shows, Priyanka rocks, Boman Irani is good and so is Om Puri. There are good entertaining songs like 'Yeh Mera Dil' (way better than the original), 'Khaike Paan Banaraswala' (same), 'Morya Re',... Even the theme is nice! Can't wait for Don 2!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first Bollywood Review...not a bad one either!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen a Bollywood flick in a very long time and as I was in the mood to see something different I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to see Don which is a modern spin on a Bollywood classic starring none other than the Big B him-self. What I can say that Indian cinema has come forward a huge way since I saw a Bollywood flick last but however it still retain the traditional Bollywood elements from all those years on. Although this time Don has been almost given the Hollywood style make over with its glitz and glamour and they also got a another Bollywood Megastar to play the leading role. The film was beautifully shot and it did have an almost uber-cool feel to it although I got the weirdest feeling throughout that it seemed like Bollywood glitzy version of The Matrix. The film however loses marks on a lot of things and one of them being that it takes a long time for things to get set up and underway and thusly because of that the second half almost becomes a predictable but still likable lark , another thing that bothers me is the level of songs which were just played out and that caused things to drag on and cause the movie to run longer than it should do. And also another complaint of mine is that whenever things need spicing up just add an action sequence which looks like a rip off The Matrix/Con Air and various other action Hollywood flicks. However on the other hand the film was beautifully shot with locations and acting and babes almost made it feel like a James Bond movie and Shahruk Khan really gave a good spin with his take of Don although I really did not like his cheesy one liners and it was way to easy for him to get away a trouble some situation from time to time. To conclude my recent viewing of Don shows that India has come forward a lot in the film making industry with its glitzy glamorous shooting sequences , cars and subject material but still several problems hamper this onecould of been better but still good.... I find it hard to believe that it was a super hit in India however having said it is certainly no Infernal Affairs but still worth a look at.DON : 6.8 OUT OF 10THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woo! It's Shahrukh Khan! And he kicks ass!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Amitabh Bachchan original of 1978 undeniably has that 70s cool: the cars, the clothes, the music and the Big B sporting the biggest eff-off pair of sunnies until Posh Spice got in on the act. Farhan Akhtar's remake, then, was always going to be awaited with nail-biting apprehension, but Akhtar has proved himself more than capable of handling the rejig of a film many are quick to call a classic, essentially because he appears to be a massive fan of the original himself; delivering it here in its polished, up-to-date avatar. He's no fool either, keeping in the two most memorable songs (albeit reworked) from the Bachchan version was an unquestionably smart move, as well as adding a handful of incredibly catchy new ones. The plot is smartened up and tighter too: the Jasjeet subplot serves as an essential part of the story here, not something that seems to be clumsily shoe-horned in; and hearing some of the original, snappy dialogue in this new, snappy film brings a smile to the old boat-race. It's a slick movie that is visually impressive and clearly cost millions; the production is at Hollywood level, but don't come to it expecting Hollywood-style story-telling, or the sight of your main man singing about how dangerous and cunning he is will seem like the kind of one-hundred-and-eighty-degrees spin to be found on The Simpsons. The cast doesn't disappoint either: Priyanka Chopra smoulders as Roma, the consistently brilliant Boman Irani excels as De Silva, Isha Koppikar's Anita is beautiful but icy and even Arjun Rampal, usually so wooden and monotonous, does a half-decent job as Jasjeet. Kareena Kapoor's cameo is well-handled, the actress herself looking better than ever and verging on the iconic in that tight gold dress. Ultimately, however, the film belongs to the King Khan, Shahrukh's Don/Vijay obviously have nuances of Bachchan's performances but the eminently watchable Shahrukh imbues them with a quality and charm that is all his own: his Don exudes the kind of seductive arrogance that makes him the sexiest bastard in South East Asia (at least) whereas his Vijay is sweet, unaffected and cheery. Whether it surpasses the original is a point that can be argued until the cows come home (Bachchan or Khan? 1970s or 2000s? Gritty, cultish original or super-stylised, sensation-provoking remake?) and purists will no doubt argue that Akhtar has changed too much by opening up the story to the possibility of a sequel (and usually where there is a sequel, there is a three-quel), but if it's nostalgia you want, you won't come away disappointed. A pointless remake, then? That remains to be seen, but when they're as entertaining and fun as this, where's the harm?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with remaking a classic film is that chances are you're going to make it worse, and be judged more harshly than you would if you made a new film. The remake of DON would be mediocre even if it wasn't being compared to one of the most entertaining films of all time. We already more or less know the story, and the new twists that are added to keep it fresh make little or no sense. SRK pales next to Amitabh's multifaceted performance, and the sheer cheesy fun of the original is mostly absent. The sub-par music is the final nail in the coffin. Only the action is better done here (though Malaysia makes a beautiful setting).Next time try remaking a really bad film, then you might at least get credit for improving it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don , a gr8 movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie truly achieved my expectations ... excellent cinematography , great acting by all stars( Shahrukh, priyanka and kareena),exotic locations and terrific dialogues make this film a must watch .Good story line with a lot of twists and turns makes this one a superb action-thriller. Nowdays people think that SRK is getting old , but personally I think, he still puts a lot of energy and charisma on the screen than any other actor does. This movie was indeed a hit with respect to Dhoom 2 which failed and was just a time pass. Shahrukh should win the best actor award for this one. For all his fans, there is a good news because a sequel to Don has been announced .Well I hope the next part is going to be as eye catching as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thrilled that SRK was going to me the star in this classic remake. Although I am a fan of the original, the Director did a wonderful job reworking the original to fit better in a modern action movie. The songs were great, the scenery was beautiful and the thrills were great. I hope they make a sequel now that Hindi movies are following that trend now! I agree with people who say you can't compare the two movies or the two actors. They are both great in their own way. The Khaike number just makes you smile and want to dance! It is great that this movie was made also so the younger generation would become familiar with this story if they haven't seen the original Don. If they were to go back and watch the original too, they may find it kind of boring!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SRK has proved he is worthy of being DON</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don was probably the best film of the year. Shah Rukh proved his critics wrong by becoming a truly villainous and stylish don. His performance should win him all the awards.After watching don, i've started liking Priyanka Chopra. She was also fantastic.Kareena Kapoor's role wasn't hugely important, but she was alright.Arjun Rampal isn't really a good actor, but he was quite good in this film.Boman Irani was unbelievable. He definitely did his best performance in this film. His control of emotions and patience was excellent.Om Puri didn't have too much to do, but he was still decent. Back to King Khan...He definitely showed that he could do any role by doing DON. Everyone thought Shah Rukh Khan was good at just romantic and heroic roles, but he's proved he can do any role. The music of the film was brilliant. Main Hoon Don proves how stylish and suave Don really is. Kaike Paan and Yeh Mera Dil are decent remakes for classic songs. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy create more musical success after Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. The Salaam-E-Ishq music sounds promising as well. The background music of don is mind-blowing.Farhan Akhtar finally gets a worldwide blockbuster...DIL CHAHTA HAI wasn't a huge success at the box office. The team behind Don have done a mesmerising job.Also you must remember not to compare the 2 dons because one is from the past, where there were actors and some low budget sets, and the new don is made in many sets across different countries and there's a lot of high-tech equipment and gadgets to add to the style of the modern don.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well,I waited for this movie since the promos were on air and now on the opening day I couldn't restrain myself on viewing and when I have viewed it I was eager to give a first hand comment on it.Although I'm not much of a Shahrukh fan but still It was known from the beginning that no one can portray the role of the original Don as good as the king Khan(Shahrukh),he added a mean and psychic strain to the role.The second thing that pulled me to see this flick to the theatre was the fact that it was a Farhan Akhtar movie,he is a class within himself and surely has a long way to go.Now only a team like this could have done judgment to the movie which was supposed to be a remake.And I was'nt surprised,coz I was right.It was a remake nonetheless and the storyline was no matter the same but with some changes and a good crux too.The movie was very stylized keeping in mind the young breed of viewers and the action sequences were exhilarating,none of this kind I have seen in any bollywood movie before,they seem to be real martial art sequences,the movements were sleek and stylish.Shahrukh was tremendous as Don and looked good too.Priyanka was both seductive,sultry and gave a catty touch to her character along with an innocent part.Arjun Rampal was good, if not bad and gave a masculine touch to the character J.J.Boman Irani is unquestionable as always and was good as the mastermind villain.As for the music the scores were pretty and matched with the movie sequence though familiar but good to listen.The movie was a complete entertainer and had some familiar dialogues including "Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin namumkin hain".It had some comic points too but the final blow is at the end of the movie,a point which no viewers will expect considering it a remake.That part you should watch definitely with awe.Old wine in a new bottle with a dash of a different taste.Go ahead watch it and you won't get disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was very promising and full of hype. To be fair, I watched the movie for Farhan Akthar. Very slick and stylish was the tone of the whole movie and so were the technical aspects. Things that have worked in favor of the movie 1. Great Star cast who have all performed well (Boman Irani and Shah Rukh were very good). They have wasted Om Puri though. 2. Music that is excellent and the wonderful cinematographyThings that don't work 1. Length of the movie (3+ hours????) The movie really needs better editing 2. Age old story... please I haven't watched the original still, the movie smelt 1970ish... A tighter script without some very obvious flaws would have been great.My assessment, you can watch it once. Remember this is not a classic.</fullReview>

Its more like Hollywood movies. Fine half a people dint like KANK while half liked and blamed to Mr king Khan.For those who had a doubt on Srks abilities, he is back with bang. See Don and predict why Srk is called the biggest actor in the world. The climax has made the movie more glorious. The screens and scenes are too good. I feel no one would make comparison between old don and new don but they are definitely going to enjoy the movie.As a whole this movie is sweet and cute without any boring scene, no controversial.There will be Don 2 coming(if this don works but for me it worked more than i have expected)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK comparisons are inevitable but the movie isn't that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first things first. Shah Rukh Khan is no Big B but then he is much better in this film than he is in his sugar-coated tearjerkers produced exclusively by Messrs. Johar and Chopra. Comparisons with the original DON are inevitable but some new twists redeem the film and give it some air of freshness if not more. It will be fair as well as unfair to compare the old Don with the new one. Fair because the film is a remake of the old Don and it is nothing but natural tendency to compare it with the older film. Unfair because we should not expect everything to be better or same as the things in the previous Don as it is not possible. The music of the new film is passable (don't compare it with Kalyanji Anandji's music) and seems to be in sync with the mood of the film. Expectations from this film are very high to state the truth. However if one just discounts the fact that he/she will get to see and experience the Amitabh Bachchan starrer Don then there is more scope to enjoy the film.Shah Rukh Khan tries hard to match upto Amitabh Bachchan's style and the effort is palpable especially in the first half. But of course he doesn't measure upto to the tall Big B, quite literally actually. Although he must be commended for his full commitment and honesty to the role. May be it was Shah Rukh Khan's own interpretation of Don which he presents on screen but most of the people who've seen Bachchan as Don still associate Big B as Don. Shah Rukh as the Don of this era is sleek, dabbling with the latest gizmos and gadgets, lethal without appearing as much and undoubtedly the heart and soul of the film. And yet despite all this it is somewhat implausible to accept him as Don (here we go again with the comparisons). For those who have not seen Amitabh Bachchan's rendition of the same role 28 years back, they may like Shah Rukh Khan's portrayal of the same character in this film.Priyanka Chopra is neither very bad nor remarkable in the role of Roma. Needless to say that she lacks the flair and poise of Zeenat Aman. And her performance is nothing to write home about actually. Arjun Rampal is Jasjit, the character played by Pran in the old film. To be fair to Arjun Rampal, he just about manages not to mess up with his role. Also his role in this new version is quite limited when compared with Pran's role in the original. (inadvertantly another comparison). Isha Koppikar is fine in her role as Anita and does what is required of her character that is to add to the glamour quotient in the film. Kareena Kapoor's brief special appearance in the beginning as Kamini (the role that Helen had played in the original) is very good and one wishes that she had been granted more screen time. Pavan Malhotra is seen after along time in this film as Narang. He plays the role of Narang very well and is at par with Kamal Kapoor's performance as Narang in the original. One just wonders why he isn't seen more often in the films these days. Om Puri is virtually wasted. A fine actor such as Om Puri surely deserves more lengthier roles than just a few scenes here and there. Last but not the least Boman Irani is superb as DCP De Silva. In the old Don this role was played brilliantly by the suave Iftekhar. Boman Irani as DCP Des Silva doesn't disappoint and on the contrary excels in this role. Not only does he do complete justification to his character he seems at ease doing it. He is surely one of the actors to watch out for not only in the film but also in the future.Farhan Akhtar's direction is good but at certain times it is found wanting such as in controlling the pace of this thriller. It could have been better. But overall, it appears that director Farhan Akhtar created a film the way he wanted to create. It is something like 'If I want to remake a superhit film from the 1970s today and set it completely in today's milieu then this is how I will do it' and he succeeds to a fair extent. Many have felt that the length could have been edited. May be. But it could have been only marginally. Also what Akhtar could have done is to create completely contrasting characters of Don and Vijay (even though Shah Rukh doesn't know good Awadhi) by lending the character of Vijay a different background instead of the UP background. But then 'Khaike paan Banaras wala' wouldn't have been possible in this film I guess. The dialogues have punch and the cinematography is very good. All in all certainly worth a dekko. If not anything else but for comparisons and curiosity. Comparisons, yes thats where we started from and I had mentioned at the start that comparing Farhan Akhtar's Don with the older one will be unfair and limit the scope to enjoy this film. But that (comparison) is what happened unintentionally in the review above. Well, thats one risk that always exists when one attempts a remake of an earlier superhit. Are J P Dutta and Ram Gopal Varma listening?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don - the chase begins is an OK movie with a GREAT climax. I mean its one of those things that hit u on the head when u come out of the theatre. If you go to see Don hoping that its climax be something like the original : be warned for a real shock.First things first The story is more or less the same as the original , with a couple of twists and turns here n there.Shahrukh Khan is don , the mafia drug dealer in Malaysia .He is also vijay ,the pa an chewing Ganny ka chorra. The old don dies in an accident and vijay his hamshakal(lookalike) is sent to dupe the original and leak secrets . Things take a bad turn for vijay when the cop Desilva ( boman irani)who got him to do the drama dies and he gets into a fix. How he get s out n proves his innocence(!!) is the rest of the movie .Priyanka chopra is Roma and Arjun rampal is Jasjit and they r right out of the previous movie.The new don is very gadget friendly and all throughout the movie has a slick feel to it with all the shiny cars , cellphones and gadgets. Screenplay is racy almost throughout.Farhan Akhtar and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy were the only reasons why I went on to see Don on the first day itself.Otherwise I thought remaking a Bachchan movie with Shahrukh Khan was a bad idea. But King Khan fits in quite easily , does some amazing action sequences and goes on to give a fine performance. However somehow you feel that an Abhishek or Akshay would have made a bit more of impact.Overall : A really great climax+fine performance from SRK&amp;irani+great songs+racy screenplay = 8/10 that don gets ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am shocked to see this movie being rated so high.. And in fact led me to suspect it is the same guy posting several versions of 'good' reviews, in an attempt to create a 'feel good' factor. Nevertheless, the movie is disappointing. Agreed that Farhan did an outstanding job with Dil Chahta Hai and a reasonably good job with Lakshya - but Don is clearly his first complete failure as a director. So you spend a few million, buy loads of cool cars, and some gadgets and get some shiny costumes and expect that the viewers will sit there awestruck!! Thats a NEGATIVE officer! A lot of people believe that Shahrukh is energetic (which he is) and picks his films with care or may be think that if he picks a film it is guaranteed to make the producer rich. I don't deny the second version. He seemed to have picked this movie because he thought he was going to make history by remaking a movie that already did sometime ago. Again 'NEGATIVE' officer.. It does not work like that. The only successful part of this movie is probably the theme music to an extent. The rest is just awful - the story telling, the editing, the actors and their sick performances. Shahrukh - it is always better to retire when you are still a favorite than to retire of age - unless you are confident that you can make a comeback like Amitabh Bachhan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most horrible movies ever made. It manages to turn the story of a classic (the original Don (1978)) into the stupidest excuse of a movie. The action scenes are horribly directed despite impressive looking explosions. The whole twist in the end is so stupid, I just can't believe that people actually like it. In the end, we discover that Vijay who is playing the role of Don is actually the real Don! How stupid is that? How much stupider can it get? If he really was Don, he would just escape. Why carry on the charade being the villain? And Boman Irani actually being a cop who also is the mastermind of a drug cartel? I just can't believe no one stood up and threw eggs at the screen. The only thing good about this movie is the production design. But production design does not a good movie make. The original Don worked because of the central question innate in the premise of the movie. How can a simpleton convince others that he is in fact a ruthless Don and manage to stay alive when he is discovered? The new Don forgets that story and does away with the chase. The single thing that made the original Don so compelling. By the way, Farhan, please don't direct action scenes. You are completely hopeless at it. Lakshya, anyone? Stick to mushy love stories and funny one liners, dude. You are not at all a good director. Most of my countrymen who like it are just done in by the look I guess. Anyway none of the Hindi speaking audience wants a good story. All they want is stupidity and more stupidity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don..the Chase begins is not a bad movie and for a Bollywood production, i would say that it compares favourably to anything Hollywood brings out these days in terms of its presentation and slick look. But the movie is a thriller and unfortunately for me, the movie never had the pace to feel like a thriller. Even the original Don seemed to move quickly.Minor SPOILER.....New Don has lots of twists and unfortunately for me I knew how the movie would end as the incessant promos and trailers on TV spoiled it for me way before the end of the movie.I did see the original Don a long time ago on video, while the King Khan has done his best to make the film his own, the Big B is still the King. As the Don, he is still only shahrukh being cool rather than being Don. As Vijay, shahrukh actually looked like he was acting but we didn't see much of that character. It is never more apparent than in the 'Khaike Paan Bana Raswallah' song, Bachan made it into an iconic song while in the new Don, i felt the song was not even needed in the narrative. Supporting cast were OK... no real standouts except for Kareena Kapoor in a great little sexy cameo. Boman Irani, Priyanka, Arjun Rampal are OK. Rampal looks great on screen, love that voice but he is a bit wooden.Songs were not required and if you had to have them then just Kareena's song and the title track would have been more than enough.Farhan has come up with a great project and although there were a few inspired scenes from Con Air, Face Off, I think he would do well in Hollywood if given the chance. Farhan Akhtar is a director who has come up with some good movies in the past and while Don was not as good as I expected, i'm still a fan and wait anxiously for his next movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above average action thriller with a really good story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don is probably one of the best offerings from Bollywood;which makes the most pointless,dreadful and recycled movies in the world of Cinema.Don breathes new life only in the Indian cinema and their action-thriller genre but it's only average when compared to other much slicker and well made international thrillers.Don has a good premise,quite an interesting story with satisfying twists and a stylish execution.But throughout,the film lacks punch or lacks any reason for the viewer to give it a second look.It's worth a look for its concept,which if given to Hollywood filmmakers,they would've made a great film out of it.It's that premise that works and a few other things.But in the end,it's a cool International thriller wanna-be trying hard to be slick and smart when it only manages to pull off a few surprises and remain above-average in the end.But I guess that's a very good thing for Bollywood and those people who somehow like their movies.As this film proves that if they use their heads,they can churn up good,entertaining films.But sorry,to me this isn't a great film,it's only fair.But if compared to any Bollywood action thriller in recent years,this has got to be the best.Don is ruthless mafia drug-lord wanted by 11 nations is being chased by a cop,De Silva.In a pursuit,Don is captured and goes into coma.His look-alike,Vijay,is brought in to replace him and give some information about his organization to De Silva.Don somehow dies in the hospital,leaving Vijay on his own.Now both the cops and the mafia want Vijay for different reasons.The film's biggest weakness is that it drags the story too much.Instead of letting the audience guess,it spills too much out and gives too many hints for anyone to spot the final twist coming.I already guessed what the twist was long before the end,but it kept things blurry so you can't make a final guess.But I was right in the end.The film also gets preachy in the second hour.It loses its excitement.The drama then lacks energy and then all that was built up for the final twist has left the film uneven.It's another of the could've-been-good films from Bollywood,who is trying to opt for some original films.Then there is Khan,who is only half convincing as both characters.His evil,sinister portrayal of Don makes the character Don look like your average thug,who thinks of himself a big genius.And some may even forget about the film after they leave the theaters.But,I'm not sure if I could forget Don,whom I have come to like.It's a cool,cunning,anti-villain character/role that Khan underplays.And the whole time I've been wondering what this film could've been if it were made by Hollywood filmmakers.This film is all glamor and style but little substance in between.I really wanted it to be a great film,solely for its story.It keeps you entertained for its twists and surprises.Chopra is gorgeous as always and as always she is minimized to playing secondary character.Her much hyped martial arts training and scenes were a let down as I didn't remember seeing her perform any action.Maybe they were just plain forgettable.But she did looked good when she got into action in a scene or two.But the real standout is Booman Irani as De Silva.He's got more surprises than Don or Vijay combined.His character is more cunning and fit and is well played by Irani.Another surprise was Rampal's character Jasjit.This is a cool character.Even being a secondary character,he's more interesting to watch than anyone else in the film.While the rest of the cast is just fine.This film is a cut above for Bollywood action films.It could be considered as a breakthrough,only in Bollywood.There were some decent chase scenes that actually make sense,unlike most god-awful bollywood action films.At least this film had some logic and made sense.Bollywood's take on action genre is probably the worst thing in the world.If you want to have big laughs ,watch Bollywood action films.E.g.,Dhoom 2 recently,which has got to be the most over-hyped trash in India I've ever seen.It captures Malaysia well on screen but it makes everything else that is well known look cheap.Like the scene that features the Petronas Twin Towers,there are far better movies that execute better action scenes on the towers.Movies that make more sense and capture the towers breathtakingly.This film just makes you wonder,why isn't anyone stopping them?Can that really happen?But then again it's Bollywood,and I guess the limited budget must've caused the problems.But it was a good try.As any Bollywood film,the worst part of the film are the use of songs.It's just silly to think of musical numbers in a thriller like this.Especially when it has a premise that requires breakneck speed and fast pace.Instead,it's nearly three hours long,it drags.It also lacks any kind of suspense as it reveals too much.It tries hard to be as good as the other better Hollywood international thrillers.It's got the look of a Hollywood film but inside it,it's just an above average film. The twists holds the viewer's attention for as long as it could.But in the end,the length just tests their patience.It gets lame sometimes and the opening credits look like as if they're promoting some kind of video game.It really could've done without all that.It also borrows some scenes from other more successful spy thrillers,while one scene is a direct lift off from Ong Bak.Which makes it harder for this film to be convincing.It's trying to tell a story about a mafia crime-lord.So,why would this crime lord have James Bond gadgets,with James Bond looks and moves and a spy movie feel.It is flawed and has plot holes.It just tries to hard to be a Hollywood flick.Well,anyways,it was a noble effort and it's a fairly average film.It deserves a look or two.However,Don deserves more distinction and should've been a bigger success than Dhoom 2.Yes,it's entertaining but you really wish it could've been a lot more than a decent action thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phew...!! They didn't spoil the name of DON.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like any other Amitabh and DON (orignal) fan, I was skeptical about this one. I feared that they will spoil the DON's name earned and savored for so long by Bachchan Senior. But take a relieved breath... they might not be able to shine the name further, but rest assured they have not spoiled it. In one of the better performances of his career, Shahrukh Khan gives his heart and soul to the role. But still somehow he is not convincing in "Matrix like" action sequences. Also in the role of Vijay, he sometimes is below expectations, one reason may be that the expectations were sky high. Technically the film is almost flawless, with slick direction, fast paced narration, great action, splendid camera work, racy background score and good and new twists in the script. Every time, just when you are about to get the feeling of "ah! already seen than in older version", comes a surprising and interesting twist in the tale that keeps you hooked up all through. Music is a let down, so are the roles (not acting) of Aruj Rampal and Om Puri. In the end you come out happy, only wondering, that though good, but was Shaharukh the best choice for the role...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Akthar takes advantage of your expectations...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I went into this movie as a HUGE fan of the original and knowing every detail of it inside-and-out. Secondly, by the time I went to see the remake, I had already come to terms and gotten over with the fact that Shahrukh couldn't hold a candle to Amitabh and it was a disgrace that he was given the opportunity to reprise one of Amitabh's best roles ever.Likewise, I had heard the new soundtrack enough to come to terms with the fact that I liked the original versions of "Yeh Mera Dil" and "Khaike Paan Banaras Wala" better than the remakes.With those three things said, and BECAUSE of those things specifically, I thoroughly ENJOYED the new movie! What a great ride! Because my expectations of Shahrukh were low to begin with, I wasn't set up for disappointment -- even though admittedly, every dialogue that he copied from the original warranted a comparison to Amitabh and he fell short. But because I expected that, it didn't undermine my movie watching experience.But secondly, and more importantly, BECAUSE I knew the original so well, the few plot twists and changed elements in the story made MUCH more of an impact on me because whenever I thought I knew what would happen, I was totally thrown for a loop -- and THAT's what made this movie great.Farhan Akthar definitely went for this specific niche of the audience and achieved this brilliantly. If you're not as familiar with the original, you'll probably still find this movie good (if you like the genre, of course) but if possible, go see the remake AFTER familiarizing yourself with all the nuances of the original.It'll make the ride of this movie all the more great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately Satisfying!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just saw it today. But unfortunately I just saw the old Don on TV recently and the damn Star news channel spoiled the suspense for me. But when I saw the film I was satisfied enough. The movie was technically very sound, but a bit slow at times, mostly in the first half. The first half was too similar to the old movie which is not really a bad thing but it does gives you that deja vu feeling.The action was probably the best yet seen in Bollywood and this movie can easily be compared to good Hollywood movies. It has probably the most complex thriller story to grace an Indian movie which restricts its mass appeal. As for the performances SRK, gave probably the best performance till date. He almost never went over the top as Don(which I feared he would) All the others were adequet but except Boman Irani no one got much scope. Arjun Rampal's character was boring, and the film could have done without his character.Overall , this movie is better than most movies churned out by India in recent times. And probably its better than the old one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...calling this movie a remake is so very wrong. If it was a remake, then the makers of the new don would have stuck to the plot and improvised on the screenplay. But that was not the case. The movie was disjointed along the story line. There were turning points in the plot that defied all logics. And then you had Shahrukh Khan play ... ER .. well, Shahrukh Khan.Yet I would say that it was a 'ok' movie to watch. reason? well ... one goes with a impression that he/she will watch a remake and ends up being surprised ... sucker! songs are good ... cinematography is international ... and of course, as i said, the twist in the plot surprises you. I think that calls for an 'OK' response.Once again, mainstream bollywood churns out a unoriginal (since its a remake) cinematic time-pass. Good plot....bad story telling. I bet, these directors cant even put their kids to sleep with a sweet simple bed time story. Kid might end up watching Pogo to get over the bad storyteller experience hangover.But do watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the movie begins pretty much like the old one, and is quite interesting till the intermission. Though some plot alterations are made. After the interval the plot is totally different and to be frank not as good as the old one. But the suspense in the end that the real Don is still alive is killer and i give an 8 on 10. It is worth a watch. kareena Kapoor is really seductive. Boman Irani has quite and important role, in fact he is the main villain, which is quite a twist. Isha Kopikar and Arjun Rampal's roles are quite small. Yes and they have cut the scene of Shah Rukh smoking. But the highlight of the movie is Kareena's seductiveness and the suspense in the end. Priyanka has been fooled in the end, by Don. Don ko maarna mushkil hi nahi naa mumkin hai.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by admitting that I only watch an Indian movie after it has been highly recommended. This happened in the case of Don--it was my 9th Indian movie this year, so you can imagine how selective I tend to be! That said, I found the movie interesting and very refreshing, coming from an industry that has to churn out literally dozens of movies every year.I found acting by the core stars well above average and the ending was, at least for me, quite satisfying. One thing, however, is there -- a trait among Indian movies that even this movie shares: To enjoy it, you have to enter a state of suspended disbelief. While many non-Indian movies also require us to accept SOME impossibilities, Indian movies in general require a nearly-complete suspension of disbelief. And in this, Don was no exception.And for those silly, ridiculous, and sometimes bordering on stupid, scenes, the movie loses 5 points in my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the original Don with Amitabh when I was a little boy. That was a great movie... then! The don played by Sharukh was not original, rather annoying. Sharukh laughs to much and very clumsily. That does not suit a Don.The Don is a man who is the master of all the criminals in the underworld. He kills everyone who is in his way. When he kills a man, his wife (Kareena Kapoor) wants to take revenge. She dances in front of him. Like she wants to dance him to death. Then the police knocks on the door and Don knows who she is. He leaves her with the elevator doors banging on her head.She didn't succeed. Now the worst actress of Bollywood Priyanka Chopra wants to take revenge on Don for killing her brother and sister in law. She does that by becoming a crook herself. Someone who always has been honest, knows how to be a crook in just a second. Yeah right! Don gets caught by the police and the police wants to replace Don by an ordinary man who looks exactly as Don. They don't tell you why. The replacement goes to the underworld with a fake memory loss. Then he goes in a Mercedes sport, makes a fast to furious move and then sudden Priyanka Chopra knows he is the don. Like she has knows this guy all her life. Don's memory comes back! Whow whee! Then the movie goes on and on. And on and on. So boring. Sharukh tries to imitate Amitabh Bachchan too much! Only Amitabh didn't giggle like a girl in the original movie.Only the ending was great. It makes you realize that if Priyanka would have been a white woman, she would probably have been blonde. I would like to tell you the ending, because the rest of the movie is crap... but then again I would not want to spoil anything.Was that it? No, it wasn't. Arjun Rampal is also in this movie. His wife got killed by Don. He wants to take revenge on Don too. He begins a fight against Don and gives him a hard time. Don can fight with anyone, but he gets a hard time from a crippled man! Oh good movie makers in Bollywood, where are you? And please hear my silent prayer like you were a God, stop making movie with beautiful women who cannot act and bring back Juhi Chawla and Kajol. These women can really act! Any movie with Priyanka Chopra in it is a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Comparisons please.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a tug of war between what Bollywood saw 28 years ago and what it anticipated in the fall of 2006, we calmly return from the theatre with the feeling that yes, there are no comparisons and one should not try and make comparisons between Amitabh Bachchan as Don and Shahrukh Khan as the new Don.The new Don has few reasons to be good, however in my personal opinion, despite of the technology and audience-compliance, the old Don grabbed me more than the new one. Luckily, I hadn't watched the old Don before and surprisingly ended up watching both the movies the same day. It gave me a reason to compare the two, but as the story unfolds, something in me said that stop comparing and watch the fantastic and exotic technology that makes the new Don worthwhile. The locales are superb, the little red diary has turned into a mini-disk, Pran has evolved into muscular and heroic Arjun Rampal and what a beauty is Priyanka Chopra! I take back my words for how I criticised her in Krrish. The chase sequence is crafted as good as Michael Bay would do it, and Shahrukh Khan is the man who makes the show happening. Just check out those cool sleek cars; that massive use of steel and green texture in the production design and experience the hi-tech sophisticated world the Don lives in.What makes Don so good? Is it the director's heavy inspiration from Hollywood action movies, is it the suspense, is it the thrill or is it the original screenplay of Salim-Javed? Or is it the heavy publicity that compels the audience the go and see a movie that almost everyone is talking about? Almost every scene is perfect, every dialouge is taken care of and characters, including minor characters Pawan Malhotra and Kareena Kapoor are worth watching.But every matter has the other side. Let me make a few things I would want to comment about. The basic rule of writing a screenplay - "close all loose ends and characters towards the end of the third act." Farhaan Akthar has forgotten to tell us what happened to Arjun Rampal in the end and where did Don's friends go after Don jumped off the plane? The end is sleek and I know the story has been left in such a stage that the sequel is confirmed. I know its sequel; however will be bigger and better. Isn't it? We like such techno, futuristic sophisticated movies. That's what time demands for. Such films should come up. Though I am absolutely confused with characters of Iftikar and Om Shivpuri in the old Don and Boman Irani and Om Puri in the new one, I still thoroughly enjoyed my time. I liked the songs, the grandness in everything and yes, I liked the cinematography. A good effort indeed and the creative new additions are commendable. But, come on Farhaan a bit more destruction, cars and buildings blowing up and more intense action, (like you know, action as in Hollywood flicks like The Transporter and Cradle to the Grave) would have definitely added up more spice to the movie.Good work though!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lifeless and SRK's clearly miscast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched it on DVD last night and was completely taken aback by how horrendous SRK is as DON. It's almost like he walked straight into the movie off KANK's set and forgot that he was playing a DIFFERENT character. These are the characteristics of Srk's DON: VERY irritative, angry, rude and oh yeah, sarcastic!(Does this remind you of somebody?? ). Add in SRK's decade long mannerisms that are very much present throughout the reel and this EASILY becomes the most disappointing performance from a MAJOR star in the last few years. Because of him the 1st hour of the movie is unbearably BAD. Every scene is there to present us DON's power/smarts/ruthlessness/coolness(nonexistent) etc. Yet these scenes are as pedestrian as it gets. Srk BY NO MEANS has the look nor the attitude to pull off this character. So what does he do? Gives his KANK character some psychotic tendencies(think Darr/Anjaam) and BOOM, that's your DON while he's fighting/escaping/murdering/charming. Every scene that's supposed to define THE DON falls flat. Some are embarrassingly bad. Like the ones w/ Kareena when he's mouthing off Big B's timeless dialogs. I don't know WTF Farhan was thinking while OK-ing the shots here. One can only imagine Big B's reaction while watching the movie. I'm assuming he came close to dying w/ laughter because SRK comes off so darn incompetent at playing this legendary character. And since everything revolves around him at the beginning, the movie looks quite hopeless too! Not until the story gets a little more complex(happens when Vijay returns as DON) did I finally begin to get interested and we're already like 90 minutes into the movie! SRK becomes more tolerable as VIJAY because he's no longer playing Dev Saran....err....I mean DON but more of what he usually does. Although DON's characteristics peek into VIJAY's persona every now and then, which made the Usual Suspectsesque ending very obvious for ME to predict. At first I thought this was simply BAD acting on SRK's part(not the 1st or last time he'd been doing in in this movie), but soon realized even he isn't this bad. The USesque twist is something I could foresee because we're NEVER shown Vijay preparing to be like DON. So when the fake Vijay is getting all fancy while fighting(when did he learn??) and so effortlessly pinning down DON's mannerisms when we're shown at the beginning how 'different' Vijay is....i knew it. And I knew it for CERTAIN after SRK's reaction to finding out that Boman Irani's character is still alive. That was a dead giveaway! Problems w/ DON aside from SRK? Well, like Farhan's Lakshya this one too suffers from not being able to involve you emotionally. I sat for 3 hours(btw, movie is 30-45 mins. too long) w/o giving a sh*t abt anyone. Character development(Rampal, female characters, OM Puri etc) is nonexistent. Guys go in and out of the movie w/ little to no background. The movie's got no heart. Farhan obviously spent way too much time on the look of the movie instead of the script. It also wouldn't have hurt if the SUN made an appearance every now and then. So much of the movie's shot outdoors and it's always overcast/glum. Made the already dull/soulless movie appear even duller.Boman Irani probably gave the best performance of the lot. Although even he isn't that good and his character sketch is fuzzy at best. Everybody else ranges from average to bad. A below average movie overall. I can see Y critics completely rejected it. Best part is the middle when the story gets interesting and SRK is neither DON or Vijay but himself. Tells you all you need to know abt his limited range as an actor.</fullReview>

It was kind of FUN.No one could have done it better than this as a remake for sure. Shahrukh looks pretty suave and cool as DON, he has always been good whenever he tries something different but we don't really appreciate it much. We just want to see him as a lover boy doing romance I guess. Kareena &amp; Om Puri would still be considered as wasted but Priyanka and Boman were not bad. The new take on climax was really interesting too. Waiting for DON-II and hope this one really rocks!!!********************Old Review********************Farhaan tried to make a different movie by giving some crucial twists to the whole story. However it seems that he was too engrossed with his twists &amp; cinematography that he forgot to give due attention to the actual story and plot. Movie gets too lousy at a lots of points and story moves in such a way that keeps the audience wondering what is actually going on.Shahrukh is a good actor &amp; has tried well to live up to the expectation of the role. Cinematography &amp; camera work is also fare. However why Kareena Kapoor &amp; Om Puri were wasted in the movie. Boman Irani also didn't impress much with his performance (Om Puri could have been better). Arjun Rampal did a fare job but could have done with a better actor as well (remember Pran).Even if we don't compare it with the original DON, still a lots of things have been missing &amp; been put in the movie. Hope DON-II will be a better deal....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don vs. Don. And the Winner is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AMITABH BACHCHAN. The new age Don is equipped with sleek laptops, swanky Mercedes and Bond like watches. The canvas has switched to Malaysia. Clearly Farhan Akhtar's Don is laced with the right ingredients to mousetrap all three- AB, SRK and Kareena Kapoor generations. The cheese looks inviting enough but unlike wine that only gets better and more intoxicating with time, the Farhan Akhtar brand of Don Cheese only leaves you with a bland taste in your mouth. It was indeed very daring of the filmmaker to attempt a remake of the film, revered to date for its slickness ahead of its time, plot that took speedy turns without making you giddy and most remarkably, it created the characters, whether that of Roma, Kamini, Vardhan, Desilva and of course Don that immortalized themselves even when layers of time shrouded them. This is one of the inherent reasons why the daredevil in Akhtar in-spite of his earnest intentions failed to even pierce, forget breaking the mold of those immortal ones. Does the new Roma redefine the feline like distinction that the older Roma stealthily leapt with? Is the seduction dance of new Kamini as spine shivering as was the old Kamini's, or did the new Kamini not simply sway away on a lifeless singing of Sunidhi Chauhan's version of 'Yeh Mera Dil'? The original Don was the cult film. Even if nobody admits it but desired to make a bigger film than that or slyly wanted a free joyride hanging onto its coattails, the convenience or the effort doesn't pay off. Why? Because you can either make a film inspired by the original or let your version be an absolute tribute paid to it. You cannot have your cake and eat it too! The new Don reprints the characters, lyrics, dialogues, theme, etc. but forgets to revive them with the real 'Don' soul! Even with the noblest of intentions, it was blasphemous on the filmmaker's part to switch characters, render a visually weak song like the ever-popular 'Khaike Paan Banaras Wala' and most unapologetically distort the story and the plot. No one can forget Dev Anand's classic 'Jewel Thief' and no one would want to remember its gross sequel 'Return of the Jewel Thief'! Ring a bell? The movie in the second half stumbles and fumbles when the director tries to do an 'abracadabra' and throws pigeons and rabbits one after another at the audience for the assumed results. When Amitabh essayed the role of Don, he almost wore 'the mask' of Don, like Jim Carrey physically and innately wore, imbibing the mask's own meanness and personality in the film. Unfortunately, SRK despite his most arduous efforts, failed to capture the depravity that was the apotheosis of the real Don. The film will have the decent run at the box-office for its obvious star value and hype. But this is a lesson for all of those filmmakers who think they have the hit formula up their sleeves. Weather its Dutta brand of Umrao Jaan or Ramu ke Sholay, remember that when ambition exceeds ability, the likelihood of success is limited.-Nidhi Kathuria</fullReview>

Even if not compared with the original,it does not stand out. At best, its an average film. As usual SRK's high on hype and budget and low on substance.

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie ? I've seen the comments on this ?.So let's talk more about the movie and especially about the character DON.DON: I believe this character is as solid and powerful as JAMES BOND (even though I don't like BOND movies) but the over all texture, personality, and style is some what inspired by James Bond with the only difference that DON is a negative role. The hype of this role was created in 1978 when Chandara Barot created this character for the first time and since then we all take DON as the most superior one in the world of criminals, smugglers, BAD BOYS etc., someone like GOD FATHER and this hype was created by Indian cinema and the fans of DON. So now I say that the characteristics of DON are well defined which are; the most powerful man, intelligent, vigilant, lady killer, most wanted case for the police of 11 countries and the most controversial statement of all (its not difficult to capture DON, its impossible) ? these traits are somewhat related with the character.Now what is happening in the movie ? I am going to comment on both original and the remake because here I am just focusing on DON. In the original movie, DON was captured by local police (okay with the help of Interpole) and he died in the first hour (Do keep in mind the controversial statement which I quoted above) so we wont be able to know the power of DON in the first feature because it was Vijay who do the rest or who did it all including a great performance in KHAIKAY PAN BANARS WALA. In 2006 it was DON all the way instead of Vijay who did every thing from start till end ? but the question remains the same DON "the most powerful" is working under someone, looking after some SINGHANAIYA's business so I believe that if police of 11 countries is after DON so 15 may be looking for SINGHANIYA and this is not acceptable ?. At least to me. So In my point of view that is a major flaw in the story of both films as compared to the character as strong as DON, it would be more convenient if the name of this movie should be the "Beginning of DON "or "THE DON BEGINS".DON do things in style, he don't believe in violence, he don't fight with every one, he always try to remain calm and look serious, that is what BIG B did and did very well in the first movie but for SRK, he did every thing expect remain cool and calm. Talking about SRK, his performance lies in expressing himself all the time. You gave him an expressionless role ?. And he won't be able to act properly, because he is use to act while expressing all the time and that is what is not required for DON, so if some of you saying or hearing this statement around you that SRK was no competition as compare to BIG B that is the reason behind it. It would be great if SRK wears suits instead of leather jackets, Boman Irani role should revealed in a different way DON can go anywhere in this world so KHAIKEE PAN song should be scripted and shot in India. In the re-make there was so much dependency on that DISK that sometimes it seems like the whole movie is revolving around the disk and this was no good for a story line (solo dependency).Priynaka chopra was as usual a drag .... Arjun rampal was impressive but as my friend says ? no match for paran in the original one. Om puri is good in his acting but he should be good at choosing roles too. Kareena's role is not even a debatable one but she looks hot in that song.I like Farhan Akhtar since "DIL CAHTA HAI" then he disappointed me in"LAKSHYA" but for that I give him full support because he wasn't and still not ready for "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN" and "WE WERE SOLDIERS" type movies. As a director he did an average job and made his mark in the mind of audience after showing the climax of this picture which was least expected.For me it's an average entertaining feature ....</fullReview>

He was horrible &amp; absolutely unbelievable as DON. I've seen the earlier DON by Amitabh &amp; really loved it... and when i went in to see farhan's DON i tried my best not to make comparisons... But I couldn't help feeling that SRK greatly lacked the convincing power &amp; charisma to pull off this role. When Amitabh said " Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin, namumkin hai" you believed him... But when SRK says the same thing it made me feel sick &amp; laugh at the same time. Ideally a young Amitabh as the new DON would have been a 100 on 10 for me, but thats just wishful thinking. And while i'm at that... i wish that farhan had taken Sunjay Dutt for this role. I think Sunjay Dutt would have really taken this film to greater heights and would have been really 'Excel'lent as the new DON. Hope Farhan reads this if he's planning a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes seem to be an unfazing fad in Bollywood. We aren't simply talking transatlantic translations here, more so updating Indian classics, and DON "was" a classic!!Shah Rukh Khan plays (believe it or not) an underworld don, in pursuit of whom is a Senior Officer . But things go wrong and he's murdered... The police now have to maintain his cover, so they find an identical street bloke Vijay (Shah Rukh again) and recruit him into the force. The Senior Officer trains him in all aspects of the law, and he soon finds himself undercover in the same gang as his predecessor. His job is to bring down the gang and arrest or kill all its members. This plan is put in jeopardy, when his only child is kidnapped by a rival gang, and his senior officer is killed. When his own cover is compromised, life gets slightly complicated...Kareena Kapoor Dance number is as good as Helen's but again Priyanka is no match for Zeenat Aman.A lot of twists and turns (which are predictable)A complete waste of time, SRK is no match for Big B this remake is nowhere near the class of the earlier "DON" in spite of the modern techniques of film making !! Watch this if you have nothing else to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows beyond doubt that no one can play a bad-ass like Amitabh. Just watch the song Kaike Paan...Have to give the production company props on remaking the songs. They still contain the original flavor with additional beats to highlight the original score.Cast was set and was actually pretty good. Even though the script was not the same as the original there were some some intriguing possibilities that should have been developed or explored more.Can't really complain about the acting. All the roles were portrayed as intended, but I expected more from the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant deny the fact that in this case no matter how apprehensive I was about watching this movie the hype surrounding this movie was too much and I knew I had to watch this movie within the first week of its release.I mean this movie is a remake of a legendary movie AND BESIDES THE NORMAL PROBLEMS WITH REMAKES THIS MOVIE HAD ONE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW.....In 1978 when the original DON was made Amitabh Bachan was paid 2.5 lakhs and Pran was paid 5 lakhs. When Amitabh came on screen it wasn't Amitabh Bachan but Don on screen (albiet with his distinct style).No one can deny the fact that when SHARUKH KHAN COMES ON SCREEN THERE IS ONLY ONE MAN HE IS PLAYING ........HIMSELF. In this case the actor is bigger than the character a flaw that is so dangerous that THE MAKERS OF JAMES BOND HAVE REPLACED 2 BONDS FOR THIS VERY REASON.But......Surprisingly Sharukh overcame this flaw by bringing a fresh breath of energy to the character and even though Don was pretty much Sharukh Khan there were no complaints on this department. He acted brilliantly and his presence lit up the screen. 2 marks out the six go to him. (Let me also tell you that I don't like Sharukh and rarely watch any of his movies because of this I haven't even watched KKHH).IM GONNA BE DIFFERENT AND TRY TO TREAT THIS MOVIE AS A FRESH MOVIE WHICH IS WHAT THE Filmmakers WANT, ALTHOUGH ITS F$%%ING STUPID BECAUSE WHY WOULD YOU WANT MAKE MOVIE WITH THE SAME NAME CALL IT A REMAKE AND THEN ASK THE PEOPLE TO TREAT IT LIKE A FRESH MOVIE.Still the original Don was a long time ago and Ill forget the goosebumps when I saw my favourite star be the Bad Guy.The movies plot is half baked, the script is terribly written and badly edited.Every plot, subplot and character passes you by in a hurry and still this movie is 3 hrs long. Except Sharukh Khan not a single character is developed properly despite the THE FACT THAT THE NEW SCRIPT HAD TREMENDOUS POTETENTIAL.FOR GET THE ORIGINAL THE SONGS CANNOT EVEN MEASURE TO THE LACKLUSTRE SOUNDTRACK OF JAAN-E-MAN. Trust me they were better of using remixes of the original songs. The only decent track is don revisited by the Medieval Punditz that has been very well used in the background score.Technically this movie is Top Class which justifies the huge budget of the movie. The computer graphics, the background score camera-work etc are in different league and I would like to go on limb and say one of the best I have ever seen.BUT who cares its comparable to any ordinary Hollywood movie and not the reason I went to the theater.The movie failed to capture my imagination, besides sharukh and maybe Boman to a certain extent no one could capture my imagination. If I wanted to see a globalised Foreign Don I would have re-watched Godfather.On a positive note this movie got it right as far as product placement and promotional tie-ups are concerned subtly displaying the Compaq Laptops, Tag Heur and Malaysias beauty without mentioning it in the dialogues (think Krishh).The script, songs, plot characters, actors (priyanka was pathetic and couldn't hold a candle to the original and neither could do justice to the present role, she looked completely out of place) etc give the movie only 2 points.I've ALWAYS FELT IF YOU MAKE A REMAKE IT SHOULD ONLY BE BECAUSE YOU WANT YOU WANT TO POTRAY YOUR MODERN INTERPRETATION (WITH CHANGES) OF THE ORIGINAL OR THERE ARE SOME MODERN INSTRUMENTS THAT WILL HELP YOU TELL THE ORIGINAL STORY BETTER.Now stunts were never really the forte of Don, the main points were Don himself (Amitabh) and the interesting plot.We all know shahrukh can never do justice to the original which leaves the INTERPRETATION AND TRUST ME FARHAN AKHTARS COMPLETELY HALF BAKED BADLY WRITTEN SCRIPT AND PLOT WHICH HAS A DOZEN PLOT HOLES HAS DONE JUSTICE TO THE REMAKE.Without mentioning details I promise you that he has justified his reason for making this remake.For this very reason he gets another 2 points.Which brings us to the question...If A Restaurant had and extensive menu but only 2 Great Items Would you call it Great? The answer is no.But if a person really wanted to go there,would you tell him to still go and try the all the items just so that they can also try these 2 items.Yes.Sharukh Khan (i still don't like him), FARHANS Inspired MODERN INTERPRETION AND CHANGE AND THE HYPE make this movie worth it.The hype is too great, and this movie is just not bad enough for me to tell people not to watch this movie.So my advice is lower your expectations, give in to the hype and watch this movie!!!! -s Sharukh Khan as Globalised Don, half baked plot and script, bad supporting cast.(don't include the super talented Om(who was wasted) and Boman), Bad songs, long despite the hurried plot.+/-s Sharukh Khan as don, uninspiring villain, promotional tie ups not distracting.+s Sharukh Khan as don, A FEW UMENTIONABLE ELEMENTS ABOUT THE MOVIE, superb technically.total 6/10 (factoring in lowered expectations but not counting the fact that it is a remake)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insult to the original - May do well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Original Don had it's flaws. Most of the flaws were typical of the movie-making business of those times - technical, hero be shown as someone capable of bashing 20 goons at a time (with each goon taking turns) and so on - it's a long list.Where original Don scored and got it's cult-status was in characterisation of a ruthless and awe-striking despicable Don, and his timeless "Don Ko Pakadna Mushkil Hee Nahin Naamumkim Bhi Hai". His murders were gut-wrenching and his death in keeping with his dialogue "Don Ko Pakadna Mushkil Hee Nahin Naamumkim Bhi Hai". And then, the timeless songs - either be it "Ye Mera Dil Yaar Kaa Deewana" or "Khaike Pan Banaraswala" or "Ee Hai Bambai Nagariya Tu Dekh Babua" or the title song "Are Deewanon .. Main Hoon Don".The new Don's first biggest letdown is Don is not only caught but is also held captive at a mercy of an inspector-cum-thug for quite-sometime before he plots his escape. That director plots a ridiculous escape drama not withstanding, it kills the adage "Don Ko Pakadna Mushkil Hee Nahin, Naamumkim bhi hai". The new Don should instead say " "Don Ko Pakadna Mushkil To Hai, Naamumkim Nahin". It is also quite distasteful to see the affable character of original Don, Vijay, being killed abruptly and the original Don trying to be Vijay for sometime. Shahrukh's acting oscillates from good to best to mediocre. Action flicks only exaggerate the gaping loopholes - an attempted MI type movie-director doesn't understand that it's a child's job for a doctor to recognise which patient was ina vegetative state and which patient just got a laser surgery for "scarring". The song remixes are good to hear and play in a local dance club - quite out of place in the movie unlike the original where they were a part of the situation. Khaike Pan Banaraswala, a good EDM mix but seems thrusted and shoved down the throat. Kareena's dance on "Ye Mera Dil" looks out of time, out of place and out of sync. Opening fight scene with TJ may make you roll on your chair laughing or applaud depending upon what is your exposure to good action movies. And equally true for the end fight where police-chopper's job is probably to circle the two while a big villain tries to kill our hero. Don throwing the suitcase at Jairaj is a pale shade of the original and Vijay's character is totally underdeveloped.The end twist is completely predictable for anyone with an average IQ. That doesn't change the fact that the end-twist looks totally illogical in the context of the what transpires leading into it.Sharukh - 6/10 (8/10 for Don and 4/10 for Vijay) Boman Irani - 7/10 Priyanka Chopra - 5/10Rest all are immensely forgettable.The movie will do a good business though given the curiosity of those who have watched the original Don, and Shahrukh Khan's fan-base in India and (mostly) overseas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is rubbish you start with a legend and then you end up in a flop show. And this hurts when one of your favorite Director does this to you. I liked Lakhsya, Dil Chahta Hai from Farhan but this one is shame. This movie could be better without SRK the other choice of actor who has done justice to this role would be Abhishek Bachan or Amir Khan and not SRK. Time is coming when SRK is gradually showing his capability that he is good for nothing...in the past he has made those movies hit which are superb in direction,script and dialog. I thought a man like Farhan could make him act but he too failed, he looked similar through out the film. Amitabh in the original DON (1978) seems to be two different personality Don and Vijay as if it is played by two person, but in this Movie what you can expect. The locations were good and great camera work dialogs are also up to the mark because mostly from the original movie. The story is bit twisted in the end and it was painful that Farhan did that. I can say Arjun Rampal was good in Pran's shoes his role was not much as Pran has in Original Don but he has done the justice the frustration was visible in his face. Boman Irani is a good actor but either he can be good guy or bad but not both, and he certainly can't act better as a bad guy because his face doesn't says shows even in his cooked wicked scenes.Overall great locations but not so interesting movie...direction is also haphazard can't compare with the original one.......In short Fully Faltooo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don ko remake karna mushkil nahin... namomkin hai!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking a classic is no joke, but people try it again and again, and fail again and again.One would maybe truly enjoy this movie if he had not seen the original DON (1978) which starred Amitabh Bachchan. And this movie was a big hit as everyone was curious to see how SRK would hold up against the big B.As it turned out, people were left disappointed with this one, and the new don hardly holds up to the original, and with all the extravagant pointless use of technology, it fails to thrill and leave an impression on the viewer.It is however sad to see essentially the same story retold and re-mashed(badly) and still do so well. This movie has taken some critique, but it is unfortunate. IF it was called BON or something... and if it was not such a blatant remake, there would not be as much pressure on SRK or on the script. There is unnecessary comparison throughout imply because the original is so fresh in everyone's minds, even though its almost 30 years old.Sadly, this one will not be remembered beyond 2008, while the original will live on for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't compare this movie with the original DON. Nobody can touch the performance given by legendary, one and only Amitabh. I would say the old DON, the plot and thought was ahead of its time, but in that era "bollywood" was not ready to shoot movies abroad. Now "bollywood" is capable of shooting a movie across the globe so we see fantastic coverage of Malesia, tall buildings, lights and roads with high speed vehicle. And camera angle, sound effects are really good in this movie. But that we can see in every 5th movie now a days. So whats special in this movie? Surely acting by Boman, SRK, Priyanka and Arjun Rampal. What else, frankly speaking and in my opinion - it would have been better. Story has been twisted, and so why the hell original DON after having Roma and D'Silva in trust will go and sing "Khaike-pan-banaras-wala". In old DON it was real Vijay who couldn't stop himself when he saw "PAAN" after so long, but this intelligent DON will do that instead of running from Malesian police, doesn't appears OK in this hi-tech world. Also plot killed a good man who was helping others so this movie shows evil wins over good - a wrong message. SRK looks dull in many scenes. But looking as a new era movie, when compared with others, it is good and entertaining. So how it would have been better as I commented earlier - if we have got all new songs, and few more minor changes in the story. But go watch this movie because that will be a tribute to the old DON and Amitabh and remember...."Don" "ka" "intejar" "to...."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of why NOT to remake classics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, Don (2006) does a terrible job as a remake. The acting by the entire cast, including Irani (although he wasn't given much to go on) was abysmal. The cinematography was poor to the point where it looked like a cheap knock-off of good Hollywood action flicks.The 'electronic' background score stuck out like a sore thumb. It sounded like Moby would after being forced-fed a traditional Christmas roast.But what made this movie truly pathetic was the lack of any character development. It was hard to relate or appreciate any character. All there was on display was an "attempt" to be slick, a hallmark of B-grade action films.And finally to end this tirade, the only redeeming factor in this film was the plot twist at the end (which is different from the old Don). To be honest, even that falls flat as this film is a "remake" and after 2 1/2 hrs of watching a terrible movie, its difficult to get excited about the plot twist. A twist like that in a different and original plot line (with better acting etc. etc.) 'might' go down well, but not here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw DON and i was disappointed! There is no magic in the film whatsoever, maybe its because i have seen the original many times over and a big fan of the classic DONFor people that compare Shahrukh to Amitabh, watch the original and then watch this trash and you will realise that Shahrukh is not a patch on the Big B. Shahrukh acting the "vijay" role shows he is not a great actor and it shows. I think shahrukh should stick to his loverboy roles as he always fails when he tries something different.Overall the film is a big letdown, Faran Aktar was supposed to be a great director he has totally destroyed a classic story and produced this. What a sad state of affairs.Anyone that wants to watch this, Watch the original first and then comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all those who have seen this new telling (I have got to be careful not to call it a remake so as not to annoy the Joneses) of classic Amitabh Bachchan starer (Don "The Original"), I think we all can agree that DON:2006 is what happens when EGO gets the better of a superstar and to make matters worse, he is indulged by his director.Farhan Akhtar, the genius behind Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and Lakshya (2004) ruins his streak by directing this over-hyped, over-wrought, over-zealous and ultimately over-done dark action-dramatic piece starring who else? Bollywood's King of Over-Doing-IT: Shah Rukh Khan. Some loser on the Indian Cinema Board actually had the guts to insult me by poking fun at the fact that I'm just getting around to see the flick more than six months after it's theatrical release. As if I'm under some kind of obligation to rush into the cinemas every weekend to see the latest hype or lack there of to come out of Bollywood every week. I don't even do that for Hollywood films! Sue me for not seeing DON the weekend it came out.Anyway, back to the film. Mr. King Khan plays who else, the self professed king of all that is wicked, DON. A Master crook and member of an elite smuggling group that has eluded all of law enforcement for as long as anyone can remember. At the start of the film, SRK in character(or was he?) reminds us that it's not difficult to catch The DON, it's impossible. That line is repeated by him at least five or six times throughout the course of the film (as if we didn't hear him the first time). But anyway, the meat of the story occurs when DON travels to India (he's based in Malaysia by the way) to close a deal that goes awry and results in one of the worst high-speed police chases perhaps to ever be captured on celluloid. During the m?le, DON gets wounded and is apprehended when he tries to escape. Suddenly, while we're still trying to figure out what the heck is going on, we are introduced to DON's alter-ego Vijay (over-played by SRK of course, while trying to show us the distinction between the two characters he is playing) a villager who unfortunately for him bears a spot-on resemblance to DON. Before you know it, the DCP successfully gets Vijay to agree to impersonate the real DON (who is now lying comatose in an undisclosed facility) in order to take down the rest of the smuggling clan. If you're wondering why our DCP knows so much about the smuggler clan and why he's so passionate about the case, well there's an spoiler plot twist there which I'll let you find out when you see the film.Priyanka Chopra's stunningly vibrant Roma comes in when you blink and miss her in an unaffectionate hug with Kareena Kapoor's character (you just know they're not friends off set). Soon we learn that Kapoor's character is dating Roma's brother who happens to work for DON. Roma's brother wants out and dares to cross The DON with catastrophic results. His silly fiance (Kapoor) gets in over her head thinking that she can bring down the DON with her sexy curves but soon goes to join her fianc where the DON has sent him. This leaves only Roma to seek justice for her best-friend and brother. When Akhtar introduces Chopra's Roma in a No-Dialogue-Scene-Gym-Martial-Arts-Sequence, you instantly understand why Miss Chopra looks the way she does throughout the film --fierce!!! As under-written as the heroine she plays soon turns out to be as the film progresses, Chopra manages to throw fuel to the role with such a ravenous appetite that makes you just want to cheer her on. Kapoor comes and goes but her item number is not as memorable as she would have you believe. Though her chemistry with SRK has improved since Asoka. Isha Koppikar, playing DON's main squeeze is a bore at best. She manages to allow Chopra to steal her thunder by appearing so dis-interested with whatever they were having her do in the film. And don't even get me started on her dowdy wardrobe. MEMO TO ISHA: Just say no! Especially not while they're making Priyanka look like she is about to win Miss World all over again! Seriously, on the women front, the film clearly belong to Miss Chopra who seems to be carving out quite a niche for herself in Bollywood.The action sequences were far-fetched and unnecessarily gory. There's a limit to how far the audience can suspend their disbelief and let me tell you Mr. Akhtar tested that limit with this film. His over-indulgences were probably just as bad as SRK's over-acting or shall I say over-reacting. I want to say more, but I think I've already said enough. DON earns a D for Disaster in Progress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, BUT the original was BETTER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Original DON was way better. I can see that Farhan Akthar had fun making his movie - anybody would, it is like he gets to play with his childhood toy on his own terms. I think, there were too many characters that were given importance that were insignificant in the original. Also, I think that the changes he made hurt him a little too. In incorporating his changes, he lagged on defining those new or changed characters. The one thing that was handled extremely bad were the intimate scene or the delivery of the dialogues in those scenes, especially the "I LOVE YOU" lines in the movie. Also, Shah Rukh Kahn completely butchered most of the original dialogues, all the famous lines from the original DON, his timing and body language were way off. Of course, Amitabh Bachchans timing &amp; delivery was flawless in its effect, SRK can never match or even come close to that. Overall the new DON was fun to watch with little hitches. Compare to Farhan Akhtar's last 2 movies, "Lakshya" &amp; "Dil Chatha Hai", in which he did a fantastic job on characterization - compare to those movies, he really suffered in "Don".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SRK has done it again, with the tie inside his shirt this time. This guys is lost in a world where the only person he knows is himself. He did horrible in this movie. Given that Amitabh is getting to a point now where he's old and he doesn't give a crap what kinda movies he makes or what characters he plays, he's still Amitabh, and SRK will never be Amitabh. When I was watching the new Don, I compared a few SRK scenes with the old Amitabh Don scenes, and the difference was clear. SRK has no personality, he is as good as Johnny Lever to me. The movie sucks, the actors suck, all of them, none of them is falling in the character. Priyanka is not a good actress anyway, Kareena should've been in her place, but Kareena is not as hot as Priyanka so I guess Priyanka was a better pick for the role. Indian movies haven't been about acting for a long time anyway, all you gotta do is know the director/producer and look good. This movie was a flop in every single scene, SRK was the worst thing to the movie, as soon as he came on the screen the movie started stinking. Boman Irani dude was not suitable for the character I agree, neither was Arjun Rampal, who never has an idea what he's doing. Kareena did do a very sloppy job of Helen. I can't believe this Director Farhan Akhtar made Dil Chahta Hai, which was a good movie. I don't know what is up with all these Indian movies being made outside India now, but it makes people wonder what is wrong with India, what is it lacking?? ***************** Spoiler: The real Don never dies, he actually kills the good SRK in the hospital and no one notices. I mean no one sees a wanted criminal killing someone in the hospital and then acting like him. What I didn't understand is how the real Don knew how to act like the good SRK, beats me. But wait till you watch the movie, you'll find more flaws along the same line. In the end SRK actually says: "I am the King" in the movie, what an as s tasting looser.</fullReview>

I couldn't bare this movie full so I left after 1hr. Music is too loud and intrusive sometimes.

This movie is an Absolute Insult to the original Don made in 1976 starring AB. Without any exaggeration this movie is Awful !Awful , Awful and Awful !!!! Where exactly should i start the criticism ?.......OK first the cast : Or more correctly the lead cast : which is SRK.........I saw many comments in this board praising this movie and especially the lead actor SRK. I fail to understand for what reasons ! But even deep down they know that SRK absolutely sucks in movies or more precisely Action movies. He does wonderfully well in Movies made by directors such as Karan Johar who are good in making movies which have plenty of Romance and lots of "Rona Dhona".Why did the director Frhan ever make a mockery of the original Don is hard to understand . The songs especially the "Khaike Paan Banaras Waala " has completely ridiculed the original AB song. Sorry SRK you don't even come CLOSE TO 1 % in trying to imitate the original song. Absolute mockery made to AB and the song which is a legend ....And about the movie .....It is dumb from the beginning to the End. I mean there are so many scenes in which the actual plot itself sucks. The ending was the icing in the cake for the entire movie......Amazing in the way SRK swapped beds with his look alike ......In short if I was given a chance I would give - 10 to this movie or more if possible ... .SRK if possible do apologize to AB .If anyone else wants to see this movie .....My advice to you is save yourself a few pennies by avoiding this movie !!!! please the movie is bad !!!!!</fullReview>

Shahrukh Khan fails to do justice to the character, or rather, characters. The uncanny cool ruthlessness of DON that Amitabh brought to life in such a fantastic manner was totally missing. There were so many impressive scenes and twists in the original DON that didn't even register in the memory in this version. Some twists in the climax appear to be afterthoughts intended to do some damage control. The plot keeps losing grip all the time. The confusion between keeping the original theme and making it a bit different keep surfacing all the time.Overall quite disappointing, considering the director and star cast involved.</fullReview>

She showing the extra pounds in them tight dress she does not justify, neither does she have the dance grace. Even Boman Irani does not match the Inspector King - Iftekhar!! I think the team just a poor job on casting and adapting. I did not see a point to the movie, where the director and screenplay writer did not think to adapt the movie and actor casting. Well I was stuck in hall in between people so I stay put else would have moved out faster.. well I had to come back and watch the original DON!! As I said there is only one DON!! This is a lame excuse to waste time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad remake with style and no substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don is a sad attempt to remake a classic. SRK's acting or overacting is no match for amitabh's. All the people who think SRK's acting is better, watch the original .Amitabh's role as a gangster in the the original is so sophisticated without all the silly gadgetry nonsense in the remake. One theory is remakes shouldn't be compared and i agree to some extent but when the dialogues ,80 % scenes,songs have been copied word to word with just an added twist then the comparison has to be made !! Like the rope crossing scene in the original by pran balancing his two kinds (which i admit was goofy in the original itself :)) has been mimicked again in this just for no reason !! The casting itself is flawed irrespective of SRK. Characters like Mac,NArang,Shetty have been replaced by clean cut guys who look like models instead of gangsters ans perhaps the biggest miscast is PRAN. The movie just drags along to show all the locales in Malaysia and adds numerous plot holes. This is a not an easy movie to remake and all farhan has done is add matrix like style and a Hollywood kinda twist .sometimes its best to either leave the original alone or change the whole story and rewrite instead of copying most scenes from the original.An example of a good remake i have seen in recent years is chaalbaaz-remake of seeta aur geeta</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farhan Akhtar is a hen, he keeps cackling, and finally lays an egg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment. To me there was no magic in the film at all. And I am not comparing this with the earlier Don, since I think it is best to see each movie independently and watch it on its own merit.Slick production, clothes, etc. but where are the dialogs - the only fun dialogs are from the previous one - 'Don ko pakadna mushkil nahin...namumkin', 'Don paan nahin khaata tha; bahut bura'......Blatantly picking up scenes from Face Off, Untouchables..... and lifting action scenes from The Matrix, The One....Full of holes from start to finish. When Om Puri alludes to something is wrong you know he won't be the villain (like the Interpol officer in the previous version) and when Boman dies in the blast you are certain he will be the old gangster who no one has seen. Arjun Rampal is a computer whiz....what is he doing climbing sky-scrapers etc. And how he and his kid escape the high rise....and how Shahrukh finds them leave me speechless - just have to ignore and say 'don't look for details in a Bollywood movie'.There is not much of the usual tom foolery of SRK - but characterization goofs on and off whenever he feels like.And why do you need the 'Khaike Paan Banaraswalla' song when it is the original Don singing it - what is the significance. If it isn't Vijay's yearning for the 'paan' then why have the song??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sole reason for waiting so anxiously for this movie was the original Don. I did not go to this movie witha lot of expectation so really did not bore myself to death. That said, the movie is a cheap imposter to the original.When looked at it by detaching it from the original, it actually looks mediocre.The original movie was a few years ahead of it's time. This movie is shot in the today's tech-world but still seems a few years behind the original movie in many aspects.No one seems to have told the director that gene technology can be used to easily identify whether a dead man is the prince of kwatulu or the local clown.Kareena's dance step on "Ye Mera Dil" is totally out of sync with the flow of the song and Shahrukh, though a good trier, is a far cry from the epic and original "Khaike Pan Banaraswala". And before i forget, i thank god they didn't try to mix another epic track - "Ee Hai Bambai Nagariya". Thanks almighty for small mercies.I saw the movie in an IMAX and the booming sound with it's techno-flavor (groovy synth on the title song) is very tempting to not play on a Saturday night house party. And that may be the only redeeming factor for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is below par by any unbiased view. It is irrespective of the fact if you have watched Amitabh Bachchan in and as Don. It is very difficult to comprehend why great artistes like Zaved Akhtar saa'b, Farhan Akhtar or Shah Rukh Khan make a combination to create something which is definitely not worth to watch.The sound track is good. But, people has got many options to hear music today. Kareena Kapoor may be an attraction for her sizzling dance. The only thing I can say is that it's not your take if you like to enjoy and remember a movie. Please, give it a second thought before watching the so called King Khan in and as Don! ~ Shamik</fullReview>

		<fullReview>very very very bad The ending turns out to be the only high point of the movie. Even that was messed up as the original Don is severely injured and then shown carrying a man in his arms and walking. How stupid can one get? Not only that, but in comparison with the original Don, all the sequences that are carried over make no sense. The character of Jasjit that is portrayed by Pran is of a circus performer and it makes sense that he is shown walking on a tight rope to get across building from building carrying his son on his back. But in this Don, Arjun Rampal is shown carrying his son on his back and walking across a 3 metre wide bridge connecting the Twin Towers of Malaysia with great difficulty. What is Farhan Akhtar thinking?? Then the action was horrible. In the ending sequences, the Don climbs onto the villain's shoulders and elbows him on his head. What in the blue hell is going on?? He even tries to sweep him off his legs in a pathetic action sequence 3 times!! The action was crappy throughout the movie. And why does everyone just point there guns at the Don? Shoot him and get it over with!!! And whats with the crane on the highway pulling an ambulance up to the road above? Where does that crane come from? And in the middle of the highway?? About the acting, SRK just imitates Amitabh Bachchan from the original Don. Where is his style? So whats even the point of him portraying a role that made the Big B a style icon of that era? Horrible movie and not convincing at all!! 2 Thumbs way DOWN!!! For everyone that watched this and found it good, watch the original classic Don. And watch Jaan-e-mann as well and notice all the expressions that Salman Khan provides in all scenes that even if you watch without sound you can tell whats going on in his mind. Worst actor of the year SRK. Best Actor Salman Khan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don doesn't work at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie doesn't at all,the old Don was far more better than this one. Wastage of money and nothing else. Priyanka Chopra looks a fool and SRK tries to get some attention. My vote 1/10. Awful songs.. Only the song with Kareena is is okay. Nothing new in the movie. I had a lot of expectations with Don this Friday... But just a wastage of time. 2 songs have been selected from the original Don out of which one is okay and the other just doesn't work. The screenplay of the movie is fine like in all action movies. Dialogues are no big deal. Only for SRK die hard fans who can bear him in this movie. Nothing good in the movie. SRK seen kicking women which seems odd. Don't watch it... Instead go for Jaan-e-Mann.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very very very bad movie.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally never bother to write reviews for movies but this movie was so bad that i felt i just had to warn everyone on exactly how bad it was....For the love of god...PLEASE Don't WATCH IT!!!! The only positive aspect of this movie was watching Priyanka Chopra occasionally gyrate on the screen...As for the action part of the movie they are mid numbingly copied from other movies such as "The Matrix" and "The One"....They even copied the poster format of the matrix for crying out loud!!!! Only watch this movie if u are absolutely bored to death of life or at least have a katana handy in theater hall to finish things off nobly... ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a spoil of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nice old movie "beautifully" ruined here. Re-made Don is nothing but highly glamorized yet spoiled version of the old movie.Story goes here, and there. Old Don songs re-mixed, and are no good. Acting is not so great either. They have even made fool of veteran Om Puri, who just keeps coming whenever the scene is going to end, and do the lastly arriving Indian Police scene. Boman Irani did not even look like a good fit as a shrewd villain. Sharukh can't help but make the characters Sharukh like, and not try fit in them. I kept wondering through out the movie who could have been a better fit for all the characters. Yes, you are right, the original ones.Many of the scenes, like how the kid and his father escape the high rise building, are left just for your bewilderment. You have to ignore many such scenes saying "those are just details".If you have not seen the original, and do not like this one, you may form a bad opinion about the original movie. So beware!! I sincerely feel originals should be left alone, or be touched with very great care.Frankly not a good time, and money spent!!</fullReview>
