		<shortDescription>Billa survives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is fast-paced and entertaining. I was surprised that this action movie was clean, sharp and really worth watching. Most of the time the Tamil fighting scenes are very long and irritating. On a positive note, Ajith Kumar's performance is outstanding and I'm glad he tried something different. But, he did not really seem to enjoy playing this character as much as Shahrukh Khan did in Don. I wish Ajith gave the character just a little bit more personality but other than that he was excellent. Nayantara was not bad. This is the first time I have seen her in an action movie and I think she did a pretty good job although she did not get a lot of screen time. All the other supporting actors and actresses really held this movie together and I think they did a really nice job.The story line is only problem. The script is very similar to the Hindi version at the beginning of the movie and lost the sparkle. However in the end, the movie was nicely tied up and surprising. The songs are okay. There were nicely spaced out through out the movie. The theme song played throughout the movie is catchy and so is "My name is Billa." Overall, I was expecting a bit more originality even though it is remake of Don and Billa. There should have been just a few more unexpected twists to really hold on the viewer's interest.I rate this movie 7/10.</fullReview>

(Amitabh, Rajini, Sharukh, Ajith, Prabhas) Yuvan has just rocked in the BGM.And, Vishnuvardhan's best......On the flip side, Songs are just average.Totality is missing in the film......Climax could have been better with any other twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ajith's Billa: A Milestone in Thala as well as Tamil Cinema's history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I've got to say Ajith Kumar's acting was top-notch. Frankly, among other's from Amitabh, Rajni, SRK, Prabhas, Ajith has given the best version of Don.The cool, suave, yet menacing as well as electrifying personality which was carried practically by Ajith throughout the film.His definition of style made Sharukh looks like a joke. Ajith's good looks, style, restrained acting, easily makes SRK pale in comparison.Most peoples that bad-mouth the film are SRK fans that simply felt threatened over Ajith's astounding acting performance.Yeah, truly. What does Bollywood guys do? They attempt to act, called it as acting, trash.Here, in Kollywood, pure talents are ruling the roost. Ajith Kumar is one. A gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thanks to the director's gut to remake a movie of the great "rajnikanth".Such a movie will always create huge expectations among the viewers.Well the expectations are indeed satisfied.To begin with,the locations of the scenes are really adoring.The view of Malaysia as depicted in the movie is good to watch,especially the scene on the bridge between two hills.The director has tried many newer things in this movie,one such thing is the first dialog spoken by AJITH,"CHECKMATE",this he says at the 12th minute after the commencement of the movie,the first scene being the introduction of ajith.Every person who has managed to get involved in even single frame in the movie is provided with high class branded apparels and gadgets.This isn't primarily a JamesBond movie,yet the extravagance expenditure makes clear the intentions of the director.The are some deviations from the original movie released in the year 1980.One such deviation,which is notable is the absence of the role of a handicapped,whose child remains with the "VELU" character.The most admirable scenes are the ones with the don "BILLA" ajith.He maintains a matured performance and his looks and actions are of high quality and he does this with so easy nerves that shows him that only he can fit good to the role.The movie is not void of minuses.Everyone in the movie though wearing highly costing cloths and branded gadgets,the scenes are more with there stylish walking and actions,closely resembling models.The fact that this is a remake has minuses in itself,the story is same as the original billa,and this creates some uneasiness as the movie progresses to the climax.Everyone who has scene the original billa,know the climax.For viewers who venture this movie first,this is a treat to watch.To summarize,this movie has set a trend,as great movies always do.The pluses in the movie outnumbers the minuses by a good number,which makes this movie special,a must see movie,and most people will find this worth to have in their DVD collection</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has too many flaws and just too much style for style's sake. The director focus on presentation aspects seems to have had its effect on the story and plot.Ajith looks good but thats hardly enough for a good action movie. Nayanthara attempts a macho look which does suit her at times but Namitha is an embarrassment. There are a few positives though, a few daring stunts were well done and the costumes have been carefully chosen. But the movie fails to build on its solid base. This could have been a modern version of a compelling classic but for Billa's fans this was a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to the expectation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First comes first, I had a huge expectation for this movies as this is vishnuvardhan movie and my expectation went to peak after watching the trailer and I even watched the trailer for many times.So I watched the movie with lots of expectation so well how is the movie Ajith kumar's acting was awesome as don I don't think anyone could have done like this.After watching godfather(k s ravikumar's) and billa together I realised how much Ajith can pull as an actor yes he lived like a threatening don in the movie So if you are a ajith fan or if u want to a stylish movie in tamil billa is a must see.What about movie I'm so much disappointed to say this, the movie has nothing other Ajith and it was unbelievable that this is vishnuvardhan movie.The film is some what OK but not up to the expectation honestly sarvam was better than this.I gave this 6/10 only for ajith.But I can see lots of people showing bad mouth abut this movie,all are fans of khan.Believe me I watched both the remake don and billa, Billa was better compared to don and Ajith Kumar proved that any one who wants to do stylish movie whether in Hindi or tamil they should go tution to him.SRK looks like a cat before a cheetah.So all khan fans pls tell lies that are believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film and what an acting????. Each and every scene in the film exemplifies that it's completely in a trend setting mannerism. From top to bottom of the film ajith's acting should be praised along with prabhu and other co stars. The main highlight able thing in this film is that all scenes have been tried in a specific stylish way which you mustn't have experienced before in kollywood cinema.Plus points : Style and overall performances.enjoyable songs.Good action choreography.Good screenplay.Good climax.Minus point : Movie could have been lengthier.In conclusion i would like to claim this movie as stylish entertainer which shouldn't be missed for any reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is perhaps a fast paced remake of the Hindi Don, but it's not that good. They have borrowed ideas from both films- the Amitabh Bachchan and Shahrukh flicks. But still after a while it takes a unique turn and proceeds differently.Story is basically similar to the Hindi flicks - an innocent conman is appointed by the police to impersonate an international criminal (who has been killed by police)because he is a look-alike, in order to infiltrate the gang and reach the top leader.Ajith's and Prabhu's acting is cool, music is good, some stunts are good but nothing like the Hindi flicks.The songs are all dumb really,the females are just dancing around. Not much of logic in the film.Watch it for fun only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish movie only for people who have not seen any other international movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>God u have actor like Ajith and yet this what you come up with. Apart from him all the other actor were terrible. Acting was so wooden they look like clowns and make you laugh. Everyone just walk it is like watching a zombie movie where dead bodies just walk but don't have any emotions. what Vishnu thought wearing black suits and galls will give stylish look no wrong even in hong Kong gangster movies they used to wear these dress. That is not stylish. Take a look at remake don that was stylish. Everything Khan did was stylish. You are making fool out people who has not seen any international movies may like this. climax was ripped from recruit. Again the director does not have any activity. Its better he makes movies like Arindum Ariyamalum. well Pattiyal is actually copied from Korean move Bangkok Dangerous Namitha and Nayanatara please all they do is stare they give only one expression. Original was so good that these characters here are compete joke. Prabhu OMG after Balaji's version this version sucks. clearly low budget movie were just got cast from Indian people roaming in Malaysia. Rahman is too loud and was horrible. Sunderajan ordinal was role was great and his dialogue delivery was magic. Balaji had some creativity like making JJ's role in different way to don 1979 . why Vishnu cut JJ's role (budget problem).Opening scene - please a don comes drinks cola can and throws in sky where all the other don just looks up and Billa uses it as a distraction and shoots them LOL. we were laughing at that scene. so lame, we don't mind all those crap in masala movie cause they don't make sense. Malaysia police is searching for flu and all he does is wear some awesome dress and walk like he is in some fashion show. Everything was so so good in Khan's version from don getting caught here same old scene where bill sit in back and talks no Creativity.scene where they shift from police station same old in Khan's version you had awesome scene. here the did not even show how bill escaped from the van. Van just enters a tunnel and bill is running out of tunnel because the director doesn't know what to do. No original ideas. Dialogues-history thought us one thing you can anyone from Godfather 2 and trust human just don't animal inside them from Italian job. What a terrible movie. Don 1979 was classic and Billa 1980 was equally good. Khan's version was perfect remake. i hope they should have remade it from it.May if they don't like the changes made in story doesn't matter. just take scenes used. Song were bad. need not talk about Rajini as everyone know how great his acting was. it was even better that bachan's as he was able to play both villain and innocent character so well. Made it to Cannes not because it was selected from there it was chosen by local people for doing well in box office. every country must send some movies it is not like selecting for Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billa of 2007, a movie to talk...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for Vishnu Vardan without any expectations. And, I honestly couldn't believe it saying myself. It's a good movie, though could have made better. I am still trying to figure out if it is really Ajith's movie. Usually, his movies sucks. This movie is by far his best works. The director had tried to make this movie in Hollywood style, I guess. This movie has no romance and no comedy. A complete action packed thriller, it is. I feel there are three unnecessary songs. They could have been avoided though. Then it might have been better.For others who couldn't accept this movie, don't compare it with the old Billa. I haven't seen the old one and honestly, I don't plan to as Rajini Kanth is the worst actor. He's all about style. You guys accept whatever Rajini Kanth does, but you can't this remake ? Honestly, if you can accept Rajini Kanth to come back alive from his death then, this movie is 10 times far better.The costume of Nayantara is the costume of Tom Rider. Some of the stunts are copied from here and there. The theme song is really good. The director succeeded in keeping the suspense till the end. The movie was gripping but not up to Hollywood standard.Maybe in the future good movies might come. I still couldn't believe that this is really Ajith's movie.My vote, 6.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billa 2007 - Spoiler Warning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt the movie watered down a bit mainly cos the storyline involving the father of the son that Ajith cares for deleted plus it follows exactly the original Billa storyline with no twist whatsoever , plus I didn't feel it believable when the criminals realize Ajith is not Billa nor did they carry out the suspense as well as old Billa but then again they did not have Superstar Rajnikanth !! The women are gorgeous , if one had to pick the most , one would be spoilt for choice and what a difficult choice it would be , Nalyantara , Namitha and even the actress whose lover Billa kills is breathtaking , come to think of it she kind of steals the show from that song sequence alone just a pity she is only around for that short time.Ajith is stylish as Billa , though as the look-a-like Velu I felt him a bit awkward , maybe I'm not used to seeing him playing the bumbling "village" character.The movie is stylish yes but all the while I felt it lacking something , like I said a bit watered down.The action is good but not brilliant , sometimes simple , the chase for the mistaken Billa with the cops and villains are not very suspenseful as the original , Prabhu plays a good supporting role , I would have like him to have played the role of the father of the son that Ajith cares for but sadly that role was omitted.I think Superstar Rajnikanth could have still played this role and that shows how amazing an actor he is cos which other actor do you know of that can star in a remake of his much earlier movie and still pull it off , perhaps play it even better !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billa - an Awful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billa - Very Stylishly made Awful movie. This is an yester year classic by the DON - SuperStar. But they have not done any justice to this remake. Ajith, the Stylish (So-called) Young Man escapes all the way from local to international police.He is called the DON , but there are no scenes which prove that he is (was) a don. Everyone in this movie "walks" and due to this i got leg pain!!! Prabhu - even a 70mm screen cannot get hold of his full image. Rahman - no comments on his acting in the climax. Even a kid can answer the Plot. Songs - I think raja would have blasted his Kid for his awful music. Nayan was sleek , but her role was very meaty.hm....if u have time and money, u can watch this beautifully made stupid movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgraceful attempt to remake the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the original movie starring Rajini... Rajini's charisma and style worked two decades ago. But in this remake While trying to be stylish, the actors look like clowns and make you laugh. The movie gives us an idea of how good the original was and how bad the present commercial movies have become. I don't know how long will the directors make movies like this that are an absolute waste of time and money. They gotta understand that dressing in black suits and wearing sunglasses does not say 'cool' anymore. There is hardly a scene that is somewhat believable. Ajith, who is hugely talented, should look for roles that brings out his talent rather than the heroic image that he is trying to portray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well lets see..first of all its a ajith starring movie..secondly its a remake of the 1980 blockbuster film starring Rajnikanth..these things made huge impact on the expectations of tamil fans..the disappointing news is this film goes down the hole where all the trash remakes lies..lets go down by the order..the first one to be blamed is ajith..i was sorely disappointed with his acting..he doesn't even delivers a good dialogue in this movie..his dancing was horrible as usual..i think he has to get some basic acting and dancing skills..the only good thing in this movie was its music, which was blemished by the very presence of ajith in the screen.the second one to be blamed was Nayanthara..i gotto tell you, she is totally unfit to perform what priyanka chopra done in don(2006)..i thought nayanthara was doing a spoof of the original movie..the third culprit to make this one as a horror show was the director himself VishnuVardhan..what is he trying to make, a comedy show?..this is a remake film, he can copy everything from the original movies..then what is the problem in making this a better one?..after all the whole point in remaking a film is to make it better..but in this case the 1980 movie starring rajnikanth was a gem of a movie compared to this terrible remake..nothing in this movie was nice except the music..the action sequences was so damn interesting that i was asleep the whole time..summing up all the things, this movie is a total waste of time and money..i give this a 5 on 10..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the punch SRK's Don had.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Big B's Don, then Rajnikanth's Billa in Tamil, then SRK-Farhan Akthar (of Rock On! fame) rocked Diwali 2006 with a remastered and slicker Don, and now....Vishnuvardhan's Billa. Vishnu's previous work, Pattiyal was excellent and I was looking forward to seeing how he would handle it.Too bad it sucked to the core. As much as I loved Ajith (After Kireedom, he proved he could act among other crappies like Rajnikanth and Vijay) he was not bad but definitely could be much better. SRK had feeling to it, here I was expecting a "bam" performance from Thala, but he passed muster from frame one till the end.Prabhu looked tired and uncomfortable as he's overweight and he well could give competition to Namitha, another overweight actress who still thinks she can shill the Tamil audience with her "rice balls". Nayantara lacked any skill of acting and carries off the film with one single expression, frowns. Hell with her bikini crap, she is one of the major reasons why this film wasn't up to Farhan Akthar's version. Dear god, why did Raju Sundaram pair up these two for Aegan (A supposed remake of SRK's Main Hoon Naa)? Rahman is too loud while the rest of the actors are adequate. The main problem from frame one of this movie is that Vishnu tried really hard to mock and imitate SRK's Don. You can thank the Localization that is Malaysia for doing that. Another problem is that since the film lacks the brilliant climax execution that SRK's Don had was not here. And also, Arjun Rampal's role, JJ was cut from this version being nothing but a Pen Drive (Thumb Drive.) Music is also another sore point. Barring the My Name is Billa remix, the rest of the songs lack any sense of repetition. Also, the songs were seemingly forced for the formulaic Tamil audience's sake.So overall, 5/10. 5 for Ajith's performance. Not his best but not his worst. Also, I highly recommend SRK's Don.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been awhile since I've gone to a movie and gotten such a terrible headache.Since Faran Akthar remade Don with success, Vishnu Vardhan thought that he could remake Billa and have just as much success. Wrong! Even without comparing the 2 movies, (Billa and Billa 07) I still say Billa 07 was terrible. It was terrible not only as a remake, but a movie.Vishnu Vardhan was confused on how to direct this movie. The scenes were choppy, and sometimes it felt like it didn't fit together. What was supposed to remain a secret for suspense was told in the beginning, and what needed to be told to help with the audience's understanding wasn't.Ajith Kumar didn't act. He was just there. You couldn't tell the difference between him as Velu and him as Don. He also looked like a skeleton in this movie.None of the ladies could act (though none had a role big enough to show great acting ability in) and honestly, they all looked fat. The costume designer was terrible! I didn't like the songs. They had too much of that nauseous drumbeat.Overall, it's a movie to skip. Everything about the movie just yells "terrible." Don't waste your money.</fullReview>
