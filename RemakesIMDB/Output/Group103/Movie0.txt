		<fullReview>Don is a very bad boy. In an international syndicate of smugglers, Don is the meanest of them all. Mess with Don and you're dead. It's not just difficult to catch the Don... it's impossible!Amitabh Bachchan plays Don like every cool dude rolled into one - Shaft, Dirty Harry, and err... other cool dudes! That is until he takes a bullet 30 minutes into the movie and dies. "Wait a minute - this movie is 3 hours long, and they've killed the title character already!" is bound to be your first thought at this. But it's alright, because the only man to see him die, the police 'DSP', happens to know of a man who is Don's exact double... and he has a plan. He trains up the amiable betel-nut chewing street performer in the ways of the Don, and sends him undercover to root out evidence against the rest of the gang. Here Amitabh gets to show his range - from badass cool dude to goofball to goofball pretending to be a badass cool dude, he fits the role (and those flared trousers) to a tee.Don has clearly been made from concentrated 1970's extract... and it's cheesier than a McDonald's Cheeseburger where they forgot to give you everything but the cheese - and when you go up to the counter to complain, they just give you more cheese . But even though you know it's probably going to make you fat and give you spots, you can't help going back for more. The movie manages to straddle that fine line between inspiration and idiocy where you find the rarest of substances - pure entertainment. This is not a movie to be taken seriously, and it could hardly be called a movie of great technical virtue. But Amitabh Bachchan takes the role(s) and gives them such a lot of character and life you can't help but love watching him. The crew of flared and paisleyed crooks and goons and the kung fu fighting revenge babe, the crippled tight rope walker and the well meaning but mostly simple police officers all make the Don's world an interesting environment to watch Amitabh at work and play too.And then there's the zoom lenses, the toe tapping funk tunes, the chase scenes that seem to leap miles between each cut, the fight scenes that are acted out in courteous slow motion (when they're not being bounced around on trampolines)... the song and dance routine opining on the virtues of mixing opiates and stimulants... With Tears Of The Black Tiger and Don all in one weekend I feel guilty, like I've just eaten a whole triple chocolate cake in one sitting... life just shouldn't be this much fun!If you've got 3 hours going spare, let the Don into your life too and he'll make you a happy chappy - I guarantee it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do(w)n memory lane -- the golden era of Hindi cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the earliest blockbusters of the 1970s that firmly launched Amitabh Bachchan in the superstar orbit.In an oft-repeated cop-robber plot, director Chandra Barot makes a film about a gangster don (no particular reference to any Mumbai underworld figure nor any sneaky take on a Hollywood film) who has eluded cops for a long time. "Don ko pakadna itna aasan nahin", says DCP D'Silva in an ominous tone that still resonates among the current duels between crime bosses and superstar cops like Daya Nayak.The essence of Don's charisma goes beyond the methodical framing of its central characters in what is a rather straightforward plot. Cleverly written dialogs that inspired an entire generation of moviegoers, shots and scenes that (at the time) defied the boundaries of all conventional wisdom, fabulous acting by the main and supporting cast, and a musical score by Kalyanji Anandji that is evergreen to this day -- those are of course what made Don such a memorable movie in the minds of many.Best thing is to go see it even if its your first or fifth time. Great movies such as this are way beyond Bollywood now, and it is doubtful if the current crap -- oops sorry, crop! of directors can ever concoct a compelling story such as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don is a COOL movie ;-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not much to explain about the story of "Don", which probably EVERYONE knows about by now, right? It may not be a GREAT story...but none the less the movie is just totally entertaining ~ you watch Amitabh perform from a totally COOL-evil bad guy to a goofy paan-eating guy and trust me, it's impossible not to adore the man. He's just so COOL! His stunts rock too.Though I usually can't stand Zeenat Aman, in this movie she got such awesome clothing, and an awesome hairstyle topped with a really COOL role. Pran is also the regular COOL guy, about just as COOL as Amitabh, which is why it rocks to see them together on screen as usual.Pretty much everyone else in the movie played their roles well.And I have to mention Kalyanji-Anandji who were behind all of the totally COOL music throughout the movie. The background music and songs are made to match the COOLNESS of the movie :-D. Lata, Kishore, and Asha at their ultimate COOL.So watch this COOL movie so I can stop using the word COOL so much hehe.

		<fullReview>Don is a great film its different to other most indian films. Right from the start the first thing that thrills you about this film is the dynamic title music. Its so inspiring and puts you in a good mood for rest of the film. Amitabh's acting is good as allways and his acting from serious to comedy to serious is super. Zeenat Aman is a tough cat in this. I reccomend young people to watch AB movies they are entertaining just as they were when they was first released. Good supporting cast from Pran. Strong role of Iftikar and that sexy Helen doing best for what she's good at.The fight scene at the end is well performed and executed. The same music returns and blends well with the action. I give this film 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AB is the best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another classic movie by Bachchan. The range of acting that he shows in this movie is amazing. I have seen no other actor do that without changing the look extensively. Basically he portrays three different characters in the movie. One is stylish and loathsome Don, second is endearing beatle-chewing street singer, and third of the goofy impostor of Don. AB proves he is the best actor ever. The music rocks. And Zeenat looked the coolest ever. The whole plot is interesting and entertaining. Every character has an important part. Don is the cult movie today just because of Amitabh and its music. The opening scene with Amitabh wearing yellow shades is too cool and the casting music outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for superstar Big B</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't the greatest to ever hit bollywood, nor it is a path breaking film for the industry. Don is a genuine entertainer with an interesting storyline for the 70s era. They could have spent half the film showing the notorious don but instead the character dies soon, and later is replaced by a look-a-like. Which is where we get plenty of laughter and light moments. Towards the end when he is discovered by the police to be a fake Don, he is in a big soup. It is interesting how he manages to prove himself innocent, and how he find the father of the kids he was taking care of. Easily said, Hindi films are generally made up of lots of coincidences and this film is no exception. This is one movie where the female lead is not just used to provide sexual and love interest but Zeenat Aman gets plenty of footage with her martial arts and action scenes. The remake of Don by Farhan Akhtar in 2006 is bound to collect some brickbats, but I believe his movie will be a high-tech thriller compared to the old retro version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don - One of the best thrillers of the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has to be one of the best thrillers of the 70's and it still packs a punch today. The reason is simple, you think you know the whole story then suddenly the plot twists leaving you all shaken up. The script by Salim Javed was absolutely superb. Amitabh excelled in a role he was born to play. Zeenat Aman provided good support as his love interest. Even Pran lent fantastic support.The action scenes were very well executed. The songs were simply mind blowing. My favourites were Khaike paan banaraswala and Mein hoon don. I saw the remake recently and to my surprise I was not disappointed. This movie ranks amongst the best thrillers Bollywood has ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Don" is a film about a mobster called the Don (Amitabh Bachchan). He's a cold and dangerous man and specializes in blowing up his enemies. And, the guy is also very slippery and the police keep missing him. However, eventually, DSP D'Silva manages to kill the Don--but he has the guy buried in secret. Neither the police nor the criminals realize the Don is dead because D'Silva knows someone who looks exactly like the Don* and plans on substituting him. So, he creates a plausible story--that the Don was hurt so badly that his memory is temporarily impaired. However, Vijay doesn't realize that his impersonating the Don has two major problems--a woman in the mob is planning on killing the Don and what would happen if D'Silva was killed and they couldn't prove that Vijay WASN'T the Don! Tune in to see what's next.The story is interesting and worth seeing up until the end. Unfortunately, the end is terrible--and almost slapstick. Seeing the disabled guy fighting so ably was silly as was the use of slide-whistles whenever folks did flips--and they did MORE flips than you'd see in the Summer Olympics! Badly choreographed and silly--it makes the film slip from a 9 to a 7.</fullReview>

Next month we will see a new DON,starring King Khan &amp; directed by Farhan ji.I know its going to be fabulous.The music of by Shankar,Ehsaan &amp; Loy is already creating waves on top of the charts.The first promos are super.Iam a great fan of SRK &amp; Farhanji,but I request people NOT to compare the two DON's.See the new DON in a new perspective.Amitji &amp; SRK are great actors in different ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Don - Smart ! Cunning ! Dangerous !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seventies were the decade of crime-thrillers in Bollywood when a plethora of such movies were presented to the audience. Among them Don (1978) is a milestone movie which demonstrated what a quality crime-thriller is all about. It enhanced the popularity of already very popular Angry Young Man of India - Amitabh Bachchan.The word Don (perhaps) traces its origin to Don Vito Corleone of the classic work of Mario Puzo - The Godfather. However it's the Hindi movie Don which coined this term in the world of Indian fiction (both movies and books), rendering its meaning as a gangster.The hero of this movie is an international criminal Don (Amitabh Bachchan) who leads a smugglers' gang but himself works for another gangster Vardhaan. It's Don who remains in limelight and being chased by the police whereas very little is known about Vardhaan. Don is a very smart, cunning, dangerous and ruthless criminal who is very difficult to be got better of.However one day, this high profile and domineering gangster gets killed in a police encounter. However except the encountering police officer Mr. D' Silva (Iftekhaar), nobody knows that Don has died. Mr. D' Silva decides to take advantage of this situation as he knows a look-alike of Don whose name is Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan in another role). He ensures Vijay's entry to the gang of smugglers as their boss, i.e., Don so that the complete network of the smuggling activity can be caught by the law. In the gang, Vijay presents himself as Don to the members of the gang and stealthily keeps on searching significant information about the activities and links of the gang.Vijay has to remain wary of a girl Roma (Zeenat Aman) who is an expert in judo and karate and Jasjeet (Pran) who is a handicapped person because both of them are hell-bent upon settling their respective scores with Don. He comes to know of the existence of some Vardhaan whom Don and his gang works for but nothing is known about him. He wants to provide all the relevant information to Mr. D' Silva so that a huge police action could be carried out against the gang. However the sudden demise of Mr. D' Silva puts Vijay in deep trouble as now he is not able to prove before the law and the society that he's not Don because Mr. D' Silva was the only person knowing his real identity. The action-packed climax paves the way for Vijay's redemption once Vardhaan is unmasked.This highly entertaining and very well made movie inspired many movies to be made later viz. Daav-Pech (1989) starring Jeetendra in lead role and Madam X (1994) starring Rekha in lead role. Farhaan Akhtar straightaway made its remake in 2006 starring Shah Rukh Khan in lead role. Many other movies which did not lift the whole story of Don, also used certain ingredients of it. Meri Aawaaz Suno (1981) is also one such movie in which Jeetendra has played the lead role. But very few people know that the writers of Don - Salim-Jaaved themselves had written it by seeking inspiration from Shakti Saamanta's China Town (1962) in which Shammi Kapoor has played the lead role.Don is a fast-paced thriller with ample doses of comedy through the character of Vijay who impersonates Don. Right from the opening scene which establishes the title character as a bold, cunning, sharp-minded and authoritarian individual before the audience to the climax, the whole movie proves to be completely engrossing for any viewer. There is no moment of boredom in the movie and both the script and the direction (by Chandra Barot) have done complete justice to the original story idea. Salim-Jaaved used to write dialogs also and they have written impressive dialogs in sync with their script.Kalyanji Anandji have composed very good music for this movie containing the chartbuster as well as still very popular songs like Khai Ke Paan Banaraswaala, Arre Deewano Mujhe Pehchaano, Jiska Mujhe Tha Intezaar, Ye Mera Dil Pyar Ka Deewaana and Ee Hai Bambai Nagariya Tu Dekh Babua. These songs are counted among the all time popular songs of Kishore Kumar, Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar.Technically, this movie is up to the mark with all the action and thrills being very good according to the norms of that period, good cinematography and art direction, effective background score and razor-sharp editing.All the principal characters have done justice to their roles and left their mark may it be very smart Zeenat Aman or the seasoned actor Pran or the villains or the actors like Iftekhaar and Helen whose roles have their own significance in the story. Who can forget Helen's performance on Ye Mera Dil Pyar Ka Deewaana ? And finally, Don is a memorable movie mainly because of Amitabh Bachchan. Nobody could do this role better than AB. His tall personality with the God-given extra-ordinary voice make him the ideal choice for the domineering role of Don. He looks like a real don who is chased by the police of many countries. The remakes of Don could not be as impressive as the original version because no other actor doing this role possessed such an extra-ordinary personality. Big B has delivered an unforgettable performance in the roles of sturdy Don and jolly Vijay.This movie is so impressive and carries such a high entertainment value that its being a blockbuster is not at all surprising. It has been re-released many times and it is capable of rocking the box office if released in theatres once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb entertainer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amitabh by late 70s had become a reigning force overtaking everyone else, In 1978 he gave back to back 4 big hits like Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Trishul and Kasme Vaade, This may not be as dramatic as the earlier ones yet it's a great entertainer and works well as a thriller. The basic premise is similar to Shakti Samantha's China Town(1962) and Shatrughan Sinha starrer Kalicharan(1976)but yet it's a good film The film took a long time to complete and the producer Nariman's untimely death caused it quite some losses, finally it was released and to everyone's surprise it not only became a big hit but is also remembered till today. Strangely, Amitabh played a dual role in Kasme Vaade too. The film starts off superbly, Don's scenes are superb especially the famous dialogue Don Ko Pakadna which is recalled even today. Don's sudden death does come as a surprise and then Vijay's entry is superb and the going-ons get enjoyable when Vijay enters the gang as Don. There are several brilliant chases, action scenes though which may belong to the 70s but yet work well. The drama towards the second half when Vijay finds himself in a mess are superb. Though the film does tend to drag in the second half, also there are some stupid scenes like Pran walking on the rope and the entire climax which looks too funny, Yet in all fairness, the film keeps you entertained. The film was different compared to films made in 70s, It didn't have maa beta, no high pitched dramatic scenes. Direction by Chandra Barot who didn't do a film after this, is superb Music is a superhit and most of the songs are still remembered today Kalyanji Anandji score yet again, Kishore Kumar and Amitabh Jodi is superb here too, be it the title song, Jiska Mujhe Tha(with Asha), Khaike Paan and Yeh Hai Bambai, Asha also does a superb job in Yeh Mera Dil Camera-work is good, Dialogues are superbAmitabh Bachchan proves his versatility by portraying both the roles superbly, he is superb as DON while as Vijay too he excels, Something Srk couldn't succeed in the remake, Being from Allahabad himself, his bhojpuri accent works well. Zeenat Aman is superb in her part, while Pran is good in his role Kamal Kapoor, Macmohan, Om Shivpuri, Satyen Kapoo are all fantastic Helen is okay in a brief role, Arpana Chowdary as Anita is okay Shetty also leaves a mark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted, and well directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By Indian Bollywood standards, a very great movie. I saw it when I was a kid, and have been enamored ever since.Amitabh plays the role of his life, no doubt. The direction by Chandra Barot is stellar, and his knowledge and use of camera angles is extraordinary.If someone had told me that Salim Javed believed it to be a "breakfast script," I would not have believed it. However, on closer look, one can see why.There are many bloopers in the movie that go unnoticed because of the fast pace of the movie...you don't think when you are watching it.Here are some:1. The car that Amitabh arrives in before he is accosted by the police is not the one he drives away in. And there is no way the "Herbie" like car can be a police car that he tries to escape in.2. The police inspector Iftikhar says the diary reveals that the leader is Vardhan, but it does not contain info on the address. However, Pran has no issues finding the address to Vardhan's place later in the movie. In fact Pran's dialog goes, "doosra bekaar sawaal."3. The police never bother to check on Amitabh the fake Don's claim about the children in St. Teresa Bandra...if they had done so, the fake Don would not be a fugitive during the latter half of the movie.4. When the prisoners are being transfered from one prison to another, they are not in handcuffs. Why they don't break the door and just run away is anybody's guess, but the fight between Amitabh and Shetty inside the van is well done...kudos to Chandra Barot on the camera work.However, the above apart, a great, great movie experience. I am not sure why it called a cult movie, because it is universally liked.The things well done: 1. Amitabh escapes in one dress from the police van and is always wearing that dress...it shows he's a fugitive.2. The way the real "mole" is hidden is done very well and heightens the suspense.All I can say is, enjoy the movie, not once but again, and again.Paddy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie as a freshman in college and fell in love with this action thriller. It has every ingredient to keep the audience enthralled. It is fast paced with an amazing background score that you want to hear again and again. I still cannot get enough of the beginning of the film and its opening credits. It is just mind blowing.Amitabh Bachchan, what can I say about this great actor. I love every aspect of him be it his hairstyle, intense manner of speaking or his dignified appearance in so many films such as K3G, Baghban and Deewaar (1975). In the case of Don Amitji gives a lot of life to the character he plays. He is larger than life in so many films and Don is a classic example. He has amazing screen presence and his dialogue delivery is the best in the business. To sum it Amitji is a great actor who has enthralled billions of fans around the world and I am one of them. I admire him immensely.Other cast members do a very fine job. Zeenat Aman is sheer movie magic. Hats off to the cast and crew of the entire film which was very ahead of its times in the 70s. Music is wonderful especially yeh mera dil and kaike paan.This classic cannot be beaten by any remake such as the 2006 version starring King Khan. His version was good but Amitji's Don is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don is the movie, that I am in love with after 'Sholay', so much so that I still remember most of the dialogs, characters, scenes and good performance by many contributors in this movie apart from legendary, one and only, Amitabh Bachhan.Almost all of the main characters in this movie, though they are doing a typical "bollywood" act, are too good and have given a life to the role, like Pran, Jinat Aman, Om Shivpuri, Iftekhar, Kamal Kapoor, Helen and Shetty.Every scene keeps you thinking what is next; the suspense, the thrill - it's very exciting, very well played. Add to it, few good songs like "Khaike-Pan-Banaras-Wala", "E-he-Bambai-Nagaraia", and "Mai-hoon-Don" are too good and evergreen. Even the background music is one thing that I love and remember, the one that is there when DON (duplicate) is running to save himself from the police. Dialogues were too good and are still popular all these years - "Don-ka-intezar-to-gyarah-mulkon-ki-police-kar-rahi-hai", "magar-Don-ko-pakadna-mushkil-hi-nahi-namumkin-hai".No wonder ? the re-make version is under production this year (2006) where Shahrukh Khan is playing the DON, and it will be a hit, because the name of the movie itself is famous enough to blow up the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This much loved thriller is rated very highly by most people. I enjoyed it a great deal too, but more as a campy entertainer with fun songs. Amitabh Bachchan is very good in both his roles. The film is hurt by its modest budget but rises above it by focusing on histrionics. Pran has a great role as a circus performer. Zeenat Aman provides the glamor element. The soundtrack is still very popular and was partially copied in the Shahrukh remake. While the remake is admittedly stylish and with better production values, Amitabh's 'Don' remains more entertaining to watch.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boooooo!!! The flaw...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indian filmmakers have long been wrought with the fear that the audience wont understand the plot. So much so that they think that we are downright stupid. That explains why the bad guys spare a few minutes to explain their ploy at the end of the movie, even if they are hanging from a twenty-floor building. And that also explains why even flawed movies are hailed to be the best.I think DON is an exemplary movie glorifying the idiotic nature of the filmmakers who never let the audience grow. And its also a good example of how all the overdose of drama and fanfare can catapult even an average actor like Bacchhan to the status that he enjoys today.Now for the flaw...think of the scene just before the title song where this lady is locked up in the room, a bathroom i guess. To make her escape impossible, we are shown that her hands and legs are tied up. But that is not enough, since the audience hasn't been taken for a ride yet. To make things really really difficult for the lady, the door is locked up from inside!!! Now you don't need to watch 200 episodes of CSI to realize that when you lock someone up, it might just be a little difficult to bolt the door from inside ?(the lady is shown un-bolting the door with her mouth during the title song, and she is un-bolting it from the inside!!!!) I love the new Shahrukh starrer DON for all the reasons i hate the earlier one for. One can find flaws in the new one too, but it does make an honest attempt to make the viewer think. And that to me, is a fact that Farhan Akhtar doesn't think of us as lowly dumbasses.Watch the new one if you can, but after you have seen the 1978 one. The new one is better in every department of movie making, perhaps the 'audience' too.</fullReview>
