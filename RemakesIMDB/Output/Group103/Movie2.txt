		<fullReview>I saw this movie recently and was really surprised. Because when i had seen this movie the last time(when i was a kid of 3 yrs old, i loved this movie so much that i was singing its songs for about 2 yrs after that. But when i saw it recently i couldnt understand how it could have become a cult favorite that it was about 23 yrs ago. But whatever, it was definitely a very entertaining movie by Rajini's standards. Would recommend this for Rajini fans to watch once only. I guess this was one of the earlier movies which took Rajini from a regular movie star to "superstar" dom. The song "My name is Billa" is my favorite. This was the song on my lips for 2 yrs when i was kid. Even now i remember the words though i heard the song the last time i watched the movie and had not heard the song in 20 yrs.</fullReview>
