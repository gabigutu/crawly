		<shortDescription>Intriguing remake of classic 40s obsession-murder thriller undeservedly obscure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite showing the makings of a superior ? potentially classic ? film noir, Vicki falls just short of that goal. For the second time in the noir cycle, it tells the story of Vicki (or Vicky) Lynn, whose swift rise from hash-slinger to model to toast of the town ends in murder ? a crime of passion. It first reached the screen in 1942 under the title I Wake Up Screaming, based on a serialized novel by Steve Fisher. Eleven years later, 20th Century Fox decided on a close remake, which obviously did not go back to the novel but simply freshened up the original script a little ? some of the lines remain the same, as do occasional pieces of blocking and shooting.We first catch site of Vicki staring out languidly from a panorama of posters and billboards that display her face to push luxury items. But almost immediately the glamour turns to ashes as we watch her carried out of her brownstone apartment on a stretcher. Her central role ? the haunting linchpin of the drama ? is told in flashback (and substantially expanded from that of the previous film version). The role falls to Jean Peters, whose screen career was cut short by her marriage to Howard Hughes; but here, she fails to generate half the magnetism she did in Pickup on South Street, of the same year.The expansion of Vicki's part is only one of the subtle shifts among the dynamics of the characters. Jeanne Crain, in the early twilight of her stardom, portrays the sensible-shoes sister who cautions Vicki against the false lures of the big town but helps track down her killer. As the publicist who first dangled those lures, making Vicki a shooting star, Elliott Reid can't work up much sympathy as the prime suspect (he's too weak and generic an actor). So the movie's impact rests principally on the homicide cop who carries a secret, smoldering torch for the dead girl ? in this version, Richard Boone. Again expanded from the first filming, the performance may be one of the hard-to-cast Boone's best. Not yet victim to the character-actor ugliness that was to befall him, he shoulders his obsession heavily, almost sadly (though he plays much nastier than Laird Cregar did in 1942). And in the small but pivotal role of the desk clerk in the sisters' digs, the earlier Elisha Cook, Jr. is supplanted by Aaron Spelling; Spelling, who would become one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in Hollywood, can't dispel the spell Cook works on us (and excuse those irresistible puns).The emphasis in Vicki ultimately falls differently from the way it did in I Wake Up Screaming. In 1942, it was offered as a stylish mystery, a Manhattan whodunit. By the early fifties, it had become a story of obsession ? a psychological thriller a la Laura, with the same skittishness about the fleeting nature of fame. Whether this change of tone was intentional remains moot, since the script underwent no major renovation. It seems largely the result of the change in cast, with the various roles filled by performers with different strengths ? and possibly of directorial nuance. It's a shame this movie stays in obscurity, overshadowed by its forerunner; while neither version achieves the status of Laura, Vicki is by a small margin the more interesting of the two recensions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they remake the forties classic "I Wake Up Screaming"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of "I Wake Up Screaming" follows the original film fairly closely, but the leads aren't as interesting (in fact, for the most part they are miscast) and the 1940's charm of the original is noticeably missing. Jeanne Crain is adequate in her role, but is nowhere near as believable or as enchanting as Betty Grable was in the first version. Jean Peters definitely isn't the glamor girl type that Carole Landis was and Elliott Reed is certainly no Victor Mature! Aaron Spelling isn't as memorable as Elisha Cook, Jr. was as the desk clerk (although, he is definitely weird and creepy in this film). Richard Boone is okay in the character played by Laird Cregar in the original. The painting of Peters seen during the opening credits of "Vicki" instantly reminds one of the painting of Gene Tierney used during the opening credits of "Laura". Also, the dialog of the film being shown in the all night cinema sequence seems to be from "Laura" (we can hear the films dialog, although we don't see the films images). In conclusion, this version of "I Wake Up Screaming" isn't terrible, but the first version is much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ill-advised project with some excellent touches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Wake Up Screaming" is a weird, gaudy, creepy movie. One might call it one of a kind. But it is, in fact, not: "Vicki" is a remake. There are some differences in the storyline but it's different primarily because of casting: It's creative and bizarre in the original and pretty generic in the remake.Carole Landis and Betty Grable have an authentically pulp look in "Wake." Jeanne Crain and Jean Peters look like sisters. They're both pretty but bland looking. Richard Boone is in the Laird Creger role. He's odd looking, to be sure. He refers to the man who brought the murdered girl from waitress to glamorous star as "pretty boy." He's prettier than Boone (who was a fine actor) but he's nothing special. His lack of color is at the heart of "Vicki's" failure.Alexander D'Arcy looks great as the actor who also had a thing for Vicki. It's amazing that well over ten years earlier he'd played Irene vocal coach in the sublime "The Awful Truth."Aaron Spelling (yes, THE Aaron Spelling) is effective and noirish as the whacked-out desk clerk at Vicki's apartment building. But when it comes to whacked-out, no one can top Elisha Cook, Jr., who played this role in the original.The main problem is that anyone who's seen "I Wake Up Screaming" will know exactly what is going to happen in "Vicki." If anyone reading this happens to want to watch "Vicki" but hasn't yet seen "wake" -- please, watch the first one first.Both have marvelously tawdry opening credits. "I Wake Up Screaming" has the better ones but "Vicki" is right in there. It's beautifully photographed by Milton Krasner.I can't even say it's disappointing. What it does it does well enough. Surpassing the original would have taken a miracle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair remake of "I Wake Up Screaming" marred by bad casting in the lead...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, ELLIOT REID is the last actor I'd expect to replace VICTOR MATURE as the leading man of VICKI--a remake of the Fox film that starred Betty Grable, Victor Mature and Laird Cregar.Reid's casting is a fatal blow on the believability of the screenplay that has JEANNE CRAIN and Reid as the romantic interest. On the other hand RICHARD BOONE does a marvelous tough guy job as the police detective in love with "Vicki." VICKI is played in rather tough fashion by JEAN PETERS.The result: JEANNE CRAIN manages to give the most credible performance in this remake--while RICHARD BOONE is properly menacing as the two-fisted detective, but he's really no match for Laird Cregar.There's a good film noir quality to some stretches of the film, but the low-key lighting usually so effective in this sort of thing is disregarded with brightly lit scenes most of the time--perhaps the fault of director Harry Horner.As remakes go, it's fair enough--but most fans will prefer the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feisty low budget rises above its material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before it collapses under the weight of cliché and wooden performances Vicki is a suspenseful whodunit that keeps you second guessing most of the way. In a triumph of form over content this Laura lookalike is textbook economical story telling in its first half hour as tight editing and revealing composition give the film a well ordered pace and a handful of plausible suspects.Overnight, cafeteria waitress Vicki (Jean Peters) becomes an instant celebrity when she catches the eye of an actor and a theatre critic who promote her. Confident and ambitious she sets her sights on Hollywood but is brutally murdered. An obsessive detective (Richard Boone) demands to be put on the case and his judgment and intent is soon called into question.Vicki is filled with Freudian and fetish inferences. Suspect intent is ambiguous and the police are brutal in their methodology. All of the characters are petty and unremarkable which levels the playing field most of the way and allows the mystery to flourish. The imagery runs from striking to banal and some of the turns at the end defy logic but for the most part it does what a good mystery does-keep you in the dark for as long as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soap opera plot with grittier, noir-ish elements struggling to break through...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billboard and print model is found dead in her apartment; the New York City police get busy interviewing suspects, though the lieutenant on the case has personal reasons for wanting to find the killer. Steve Fisher's novel "I Wake Up Screaming" (its original title uncredited here, perhaps because it was already filmed as such in 1941 with Betty Grable), gets a strictly minor-league treatment this time, with nearly every actor on-board over-compensating for the uncertain script with pushy performances. Jean Peters, who looks like Jessica Walter and talks tough like Susan Hayward, is an odd choice to play the doomed, would-be starlet; Peters isn't the wide-eyed innocent/hash-slinging waitress the plot suggests, instead coming on with both barrels loaded. As her sister, Jeanne Crain has more of the Cinderella quality Peters should be projecting, and hers is the only substantial acting job in the picture. Playing the gruff, snarling lieutenant, Richard Boone is way over-the-top, as is Aaron Spelling in an hysterical role as a wormy desk clerk. Just silly enough to be watchable, though it is never explained why glamorous Vicki is living in that dumpy apartment--nor how her photograph pre-death has managed to land on the cover of every single magazine at the newsstand. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was TCF Running Out of Ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cheaply produced remake of TCF's I Wake Up Screaming (1941). That's surprising since Fox was a big-budget, glamor studio, at a time too when production was turning to elaborate color films because of TV. Nonetheless, the b&amp;w sets are uniformly drab, even when supposedly upscale. The visuals could really use more noir to spice up the drab. So who did kill heartlessly successful model Vicki (Peters). Seems like a lot of people had reasons, including cop Boone and sister Crain.Film suffers from bland leading man Reid who unsurprisingly went from here to TV, and from Boone who's much better at being mean than being love sick?catch that last scene, one I expect the actor would just as soon forget. Future TV mogul Spelling also gets a big histrionic opportunity. At least he doesn't look like Hollywood. My guess is that director Horner is not at his best when coaching actors.It's a complex plot with a lot of cross-currents, erratically worked out. Maybe the most interesting is Boone's anger at Reid for promoting hash house waitress Peters into the fashionable world of high-class modeling. Now she's literally out of Boone's class and Reid is to blame. So now cop Boone doesn't care who killed Peters, just as long as he gets even with "pretty boy" Reid. I don't think they taught that at the Police Academy.Too bad the overlong screenplay wasn't pared down to eliminate the many dead spots, or that an A-list director wasn't put in charge. And too bad the production values don't measure up. But perhaps most unfortunate, it looks like a demotion for the under-rated Jeanne Crain after a number of A-films. But, it's 1953 and studios are cutting high-priced contract players, so I guess it's not surprising that the lovely Crain, who's the one bright spot in this film, left TCF after finishing here. Anyway, the movie itself amounts to an inferior re-make, unless you enjoy occasional camp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** On his first vacation in years New York cop Let. Ed Cornell, Richard Boone, sees the local newspapers headline story of the brutal murder of top fashion model Vicki Lynn, Jean Peters. It's then without as much as a second thought Let. Cornell drops everything and shoots back to the Big Apple in trying to solve Vicki's murder.With Vicki's publicist Steve Christopher, Elliott Reid, found at Vicki's murder scene, her hotel room, it becomes very obvious to Let. Cornell that he's the murderer and doesn't bother looking for anyone else. Even though Christopher emphatically denies killing Vicki saying that he just happened to come upon the scene after Vicki's killer left the room. Despite being brutalized by a brutish Let. Cornell, who in some scenes looks and behaves like the famed movie Creeper Rando Hatton, Christopher sticks to his story; As him being the wrong man in the wrong place at the right time, for Let. Cornell, when Vicki was murdered!It's later when Christopher checks out Vicki's murder for himself that he runs into her big sister Jill, Jeanne Crain, whom she shared her hotel room with. It's Jill that informs Christopher about this creepy looking guy who was aways watching her little sister when she was a waitress at the Webster Cafeteria in midtown Manhattan. Even though the very outwardly and sociable Vicki took it all in stride Jill was very concerned about him and what he had in mind for her kid sister! It later turned out that this weirdo was non other then Let. Ed Cornell! The man who insisted to be placed in charge of the Vicki Lynn murder case!Re-make of the 1941 film noir classic "I Wake up Screaming" the movie Vicki is pretty good on its own merits.

In fact it was Vicki's haunting and smoldering, as well as all-American girl, good looks that in the end lead to her brutal murder! Let. Cornell had it in for Steve Christopher even before Vicki's murder in him being jealous of Christopher being Vicki's lover, which in fact he wasn't, while he, an admitted Peeping Tom, was left out in the cold, with his raincoat, or the outside looking in.****SPOILERS**** As we and Christopher later learn it was Let. Cornell who was at the Vicki Lynn murder scene doing his usual Peeping Tom act by staying hidden in her closet. And it was Let. Cornell, in not wanting to expose himself, who let her killer go free. Not wanting to be exposed as some kind of pervert, why was he hiding in Vicki's hotel room in the first place, Let.Cornell instead turned his sights on the innocent Steve Christopher who dropped in to see Vicki after her killer checked out! Not because Christopher murdered Vicki but because it was him, not Let. Ed Cornell, whom she was in love with!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of 1941's "I Wake Up Screaming"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most remakes, this one is a poor imitation of the original, primarily due to some unfortunate casting, especially in the choice of Elliot Reid in the role of Steve Christopher (originally Frankie Christopher, played by Victor Mature). Richard Conte might have been a better choice. There is virtually NO chemistry between Crain (who plays Jill, Vicki's sister) and Reid, which makes her desperation to prove Christopher innocent of Vicki's murder fall rather flat.Although Boone makes a credible attempt at the 'obsessive creepiness' of Ed Cornell, it is certainly short of the outstanding performance of veteran 'creepy character' actor, Laird Cregar in the original.The same can be said of the choice of Aaron Spelling (makes you see why he went into producing and gave up acting) as Harry Williams, played by Elisha Cook, Jr. in "I Wake Up Screaming".All in all, not worth the time to watch this pale by comparison retread unless, like myself, you just want to make your own judgments on the differences between the two films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect, and not as impressive as its influences, but beautiful and quite decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vicki (1953)This film gets a bad rap. It's not brilliant, and it is a weaker version of the bold and gritty "I Wake Up Screaming," but it's beautifully filmed, tightly edited, and it has decent acting throughout.The one acting exception might be the oddly cast main detective, who as a complex and critical role here, and who is miles from the original performer, Laird Cregar, in 1941. But on the same token I didn't think Betty Grable was convincing in the original, and the role here is filled with an appealing coolness, and a more crystalline beauty, by Jeanne Crain. And it's hard to ignore the astonishing Elisha Cook Jr. in the first version, compared to the awkward and overacted night clerk here.Comparisons are hard to ignore because the plot is quite identical in both. It's a weird scenario overall, and it demands some forgiveness because of the trick played on the viewer by the detective. "Vicki" is told through a series of flashbacks, many of them, making for a highly constructed and rather choppy experience, which is intentional. The lead male besides the detective is a likable guy, a fairly ordinary fellow despite his position as a bigwig talent promoter in New York. When he is accused of killing the title character (the movie opens with a scene of her corpse being hauled away), it becomes a little Hitchcockian. But psychology isn't a factor here, and neither is suspense. In fact, there isn't much to grip the viewer besides waiting to see how the plot will unfold, almost as a jigsaw puzzle where the picture in the puzzle doesn't matter so much as the shape of the pieces. Which is too bad. The elements are here for an amazing movie--and an amazing remake, even with today's style of filmmaking. It isn't a disaster, but it lacks a little on every front--except Haller's truly exceptional cinematography--and so we get a decent movie. But if you like this at all, do see the more impressive (and also flawed) 1941 "I Wake Up Screaming," with a beefy and very different leading man in Victor Mature. And there is an undeniable influence from the slick and far better and more famous 1944 "Laura," complete with its title as a woman's name and a song being written for the movie. If you have seen either predecessor and are simply curious, you won't be ruined or angry if you watch this late noir from 1953, "Vicki." It's pretty good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VICKI is I WAKE UP SCREAMING Lite - Hold Out for the Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>VICKI (guess they thought changing "Vicky" to "Vicki" would look more modern or something) plays like a watered-down version of the original I WAKE UP SCREAMING (IWUS), though it tries real hard to remind you of another classic 20th Century-Fox thriller, 1944's LAURA. A LAURA-like painting of title character Vicki Lynn can be seen behind the opening credits. Listen carefully to the background dialogue during the scene where our protagonists hide in a movie theater (we don't see the film-within-the-film, we just hear it): the dialogue is from LAURA! To be fair, VICKI is watchable, but despite the filmmakers' best efforts to evoke superior Fox mysteries, it's ultimately pedestrian and forgettable, lacking the pizazz of its predecessors. Director Harry Horner, who was also the Oscar-winning art director and production designer of THE HUSTLER and THE HEIRESS (THE HUSTLER AND THE HEIRESS -- now that sounds like a fun picture! :-)), worked from Dwight Taylor's earlier IWUS script, this time given a little uncredited tweaking by Leo Townsend. Perhaps Townsend's the one responsible for the nice touch of having Vicki's face plastered all over almost every frame of the film, on posters, magazine covers, etc., even after her death, until the film's wry final shot.However, while the actors are capable and easy on the eyes, the principals just don't have the edge, charisma, and screen presence of the original 1941 leads. In the title role, unlike IWUS's luminous Carole Landis, Howard Hughes protégée Jean Peters is just another pretty girl, albeit with ambition and a hard edge. Indeed, as Vicki's nice, sensible sister Jill, Jeanne Crain is more classically beautiful than Peters. If I were a promoter, Jill's the sister I would've been trying to groom for stardom! :-) But maybe that was the point: our promoter hero is trying to manufacture a star out of the raw material that is Vicki, like so many promoters and stars then and now. Film noir historian Foster Hirsch suggests this, too, in the DVD's interesting commentary track.Speaking of our hero, instead of Victor Mature's beleaguered promoter hero Frankie Christopher, formerly Botticelli, VICKI gives us Elliott Reid as Steve Christopher (a tip of the hat to source author Steve Fisher?). Reid was a light leading man best known for comedy. That didn't necessarily have to be a liability, considering the story has comic moments, but alas, I'm afraid it is. I wanted to root for Reid, but he comes across as a lightweight in every way, pleasant without being memorable. Heck, I'm trying to picture him in my mind right now and I'm having a hard time, that's how little impression he made on me.The sexual tension of IWUS is virtually nonexistent here. I've enjoyed the attractive Peters in more down-to-earth roles such as the 1953 thriller NIAGARA, but here I didn't find her irresistible in either physical or emotional allure. While you can't help but pick up on IWUS's Frankie, Larry, and Robin being drawn to Vicky, in VICKI, the lure somehow isn't as strong between Vicki and benefactors Steve; Robin, played here by suave Egyptian actor Alex D'Arcy; and Larry, played likably by one of our household's fave character actors, Casey Adams. Fun Facts: Under his real name, Max Showalter, Adams co-wrote VICKI's instrumental theme, and he'd also appeared with Peters in NIAGARA, in which Marilyn Monroe commanded the screen in an atypical bad-girl role. Crain and Reid come across like a nice-enough couple, but they simply don't have the sizzle and sparkle that Victor Mature and Betty Grable had between them in the original. At least Carl Betz of THE DONNA REED SHOW is a likable presence as Steve's cop pal.Frankly, the antagonists are far more memorable than the protagonists. Richard Boone stands out most as obsessed cop Ed Cornell. True, Boone is no Laird Cregar; he's nowhere near as physically imposing or silver-tongued as Cregar was. Still, Boone's rough, harsh quality gives VICKI much-needed energy as he snarlingly invades people's space with wild abandon. Seeing vicious Boone zero in on bland Reid is like watching a feral dog attack a pampered puppy; it's not a fair fight, whereas IWUS's Mature and Cregar are more exciting to watch, being more evenly matched physically and temperamentally as well as in the charisma and screen presence departments. (Even Hirsch agrees in his commentary. Sharp guy, that Hirsch! :-)) Aaron Spelling's no slouch, either, as he takes over Elisha Cook Jr.'s role. Yes, you read that right: before he became one of the most successful TV producers of all time, Aaron Spelling was a quirky young actor, and he makes a great weirdo here. Occasionally, Spelling chews the scenery, but at least he's not insipid like most of the rest of the cast.Even the film's lighting and staging is flat and bland, except for the expressionistic lighting of the interrogation and the night scenes. There aren't even any little fun quirks, like the use of "Over the Rainbow" in the original. My verdict: I WAKE UP SCREAMING is the clear winner here, with VICKI worth a look primarily for completists.</fullReview>

After a few weeks, her image is plastered everywhere, for cigarettes, perfume, etc. The Cinderella story ends abruptly with her murder. The film mixes the mystery of who did it, because all the men who knew her fell for her, with the obsessive desire of the homicide detective (Richard Boone) who, it turns out, was watching her nightly through the same window, but never went inside to ask her out or even to introduce himself, thus scaring the poor girl, who thought he was some kind of weirdo.

		<fullReview>Imagine if Dana Andrews, the detective in "Laura", had been homely. Suppose he'd had a pock-marked face, a long pulpy nose, a raspy voice, and was utterly lacking in charm. And he fell in love with the supernally gorgeous-beyond-redemption Gene Tierney. Would she have paid him the least attention? Right.I understand this is a remake of "I Wake Up Screaming" but it tries very hard to resemble "Laura." Behind the opening credits, for instance, we see a large portrait of Jean Peters in the same pose that Tierney adopted for her portrait in "Laura." Like Tierney, Peters has a menial job. Then she runs into a man of some influences who takes a shine to her and squires her about town so she can meet patricians. She becomes a famous model and receives an invitation to go to Hollywood and, with any luck, some day leave in a cement square the imprint of her spaghetti shoes. Before she can do it, she's murdered.Richard Boone, in his menacing mode, insists on handling the case. Several men are immediately suspected. There is Elliott Reid as the promoter who discovers her behind the counter, in the Clifton Webb part, except that he's heterosexual. There is the drama critic, Max Showalter, who is obviously attracted to her. There is the flighty famous actor, Alexander D'Arcy in the Vincent Price part, who secretes a pen knife she once gave him. And there is Aaron Spelling as the loopy switchboard operator and factotum at Peters' hotel. He has a great face, with pronounced exopthalmia, but he can act only about as well as his daughter, Tori. You and I have as much in the way of acting skills, but we don't have their portfolio.That's about as much as "Vicki" owes to "Laura." The rest sets out on its own without going very far. Elliott Reid is a fine comic actor but really doesn't belong in dramatic roles. Even when crushed, he looks about to smile. Showalter and D'Arcy have small roles, and the former's is confusing. He's supposed to be a good friend of Reid's, yet when Reid is on the run from the police, Showalter pulls a gun on him with the remark that he just wanted to be the first to take Reid in.Jeanne Craine is the star. She's Peters' nice sister. Her job seems to consist of being browbeaten by the men around her, especially the nasty and brutish Richard Boone. She was positively magnetic as Gene Tierney's younger sister in "Leave Her to Heaven" but by the 1950s she seems to have lost interest in her career. She doesn't make a false move throughout the movie, nor an original one. The same, alas, can be said of Jean Peters' performance. She's supposed to be a striking beauty -- and she IS beautiful -- but she's unpleasant in some ways too, ambitious and self indulgent. Maybe that's okay though. People adore media images, whereas they must tangle mano a mano with real individuals.I saw it years ago and enjoyed it far more than I did this time around. It would have been an improvement if it had been shot on location in New York instead of on sound stages but this wasn't yet a common practice. It's a competent murder mystery with one genuinely pathetic figure -- Boone's -- but it's also pretty routine stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fairly close remake of the 1942 proto-noir "I Wake Up Screaming," "Vicki" was filmed and released 11 years later. During the picture's opening credits, however, with its elegant music and close-up portrait painting of a beautiful murder victim, "Vicki" may instead bring to mind another Fox noir, 1944's "Laura"; I'd swear that the typeface of the titles of the two films is even the same! "Vicki" features a cast of "lesser names" than did "IWUS," but follows the same basic plot path. Here, Jean Peters plays the title role, originally portrayed by Carole Landis, of Vicki Lynn, a pretty NYC model who is murdered while on the verge of her big Hollywood break. Jeanne Crain fills in for Betty Grable, playing her sister (a huge upgrade in terms of looks and acting ability, I feel), and Elliott Reid (I know...who?) takes over for Victor Mature, as the publicity man who gets Vicki's career started. Richard Boone here plays Ed Cornell, the maniac cop on the case (a debatable improvement on Laird Cregar's hulking presence), while future TV mogul Aaron Spelling (!) plays a wacky hotel clerk, taking the part once essayed by the great Elisha Cook, Jr. So yes, lesser names, perhaps, but the presence of Jeanne Crain, one of the greatest of screen beauties, always helps carry a picture...for this viewer, anyway. "Vicki" is a fairly compact film with little flab. It is well played by all and features a moody score by Leigh Harline. Director Harry Horner, a man better known in Hollywood for his contributions as an art director and production designer, acquits himself quite well here, lavishing great attention on his use of light and shadow. Watching the film, I was also reminded, by Carl Betz' presence as a sympathetic cop, of another Fox noir that I had recently seen, "Dangerous Crossing" (a superior film to this one), which also stars Betz and Crain. In all, "Vicki" is a lesser noir, but still great fun. Oh...at the film's tail end, one of the characters is revealed as being a nutjob for having constructed a shrine to Vicki in his living room; perhaps I should consider scrapping the Jeanne Crain shrine that I was going to build in mine....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Victor Mature film, "I Wake Up Screaming", has one of the best film noir titles in film history. It also was a pretty dandy movie. Twelve years later, Twentieth-Century Fox remade the movie as "Vickie". This remake isn't bad at all...but why mess with an already classic film?!"Vickie" is about a top model (Jean Peters) who has been murdered. The cop investigating the case (Richard Boone) is clearly a very disturbed man--obsessed with pinning the killing on a publicity agent (Elliot Reid) responsible for Vickie's meteoric rise to fame. If that means manufacturing evidence or beating a confession out of the poor guy, then Boone is more than willing to do this. Vickie's sister (Jeanne Crain) is certain Reid is not responsible for the killing and is willing to do what she can to help him prove his innocence...as if Boone really cared! The film is very noir in the way it portrays the police. While Boone is clearly an evil nut-job in the countless ways he violates civil liberties, the 'good cops' aren't exactly angels--trying to force confessions out of people through very dubious means. Civil rights attorneys must have had apoplexies watching this film, that's for sure! Even my 1940s and 50s movie standards, these cops were playing fast and loose with the law.As for the acting, it's all very good--as is the story. The only really exceptional element, however, is the chance to see Aaron Spelling (yes, the very famous producer) doing some acting! He plays a nutty guy in a very entertaining fashion--kind of over the top but entertaining nonetheless.Overall, this is a very entertaining film with an interesting plot that is reminiscent of noir films such as "The Killers" and "Sunset Boulevard" because the film starts with a killing and then backtracks to show the events leading up to it. Not a great noir film, but very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Boone steals the show here as a completely demented cop. He screams at everyone while harboring a deep secret of resentment.The picture starts with a picture of the murdered Vicki on the wall. I immediately thought of 1944's "Laura," but it was not meant to be.The picture offered Eliot Reid, a usual second-hand jerk in films, the opportunity of a life-time in playing a Broadway promoter, hounded by Boone as the major suspect in Vicki's murder.Boone is a cross between Inspector Javers and the Columbo characters. He screams and is vicious in his ways of trying to obtain the truth. Truth is he knew the real story here and covered it up to get revenge on the man he thought took Vicki away from him. This is where the picture falls apart- the completely off-the-wall cop is hard to swallow yet alone fathom.Jeanne Crain stars as Vicki's sister, but the plot does her in as well as the picture. Interesting to see Max Showalter in a small role as a newspaper writer. He co-starred with Peters in "Niagara" and was memorable in "With A Song in My Heart," as well as a one-scene stealer as the deaf mute whose hearing is restored in "Elmer Gantry."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one that shouldn't have been remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This morning I watched VICKI, Fox's reworking of I WAKE UP SCREAMING. It is one remake that does not come close to the original, in my humble opinion. It's a shame, too, because a good cast is assembled-- Jeanne Crain, Jean Peters, Richard Boone, etc.The greatest problem: they all over-act, even Crain who usually is much more restrained in her other pictures. She can't even pick up the phone and say 'yes' or 'I'll be right down' without heavily breathing every word, and over enunciating every syllable. And we have countless interrogation scenes that wind up with the characters screaming, sometimes screeching, just because they're told they did something they obviously did not do. We get hysterical rants from more than one person on the hot seat shouting 'THAT'S NOT TRUE! I DID NOT DO IT!' I can only imagine how many words in the script were typed in all capital letters and underlined, followed with goodness knows how many exclamation marks.As if the characters throwing hissy fits was not enough drama for the viewer, we are also treated to plenty of door slamming. It's one moment after another of over-gesticulated posturing. Though, strangely, the death scene, where Crain discovers Peters' body is underplayed. That is when you would expect a girl to get hysterical upon learning her sister has been murdered in cold blood. Instead, she quickly turns away and the scene that plays out is about the other guy in the room trying to convince her of his innocence. Forget the lifeless body on the floor, that part of the plot is over.But these issues aside, the biggest stretch in this story is the way the detective (played by Boone) oversteps his authority. In one scene he is watching the innocent suspect sleep in bed. Never mind the fact that he is breaking and entering, or is there without a warrant. He wants to listen to whether or not the other guy will mumble a confession in his sleep. Plus there are many other scenes where the detective ruthlessly hounds Crain and anyone else he wants to cast suspicion over. I would think that such harassment would be against the law.Then we get to a scene late in the picture where the switchboard operator admits he was in the room when Peters was killed. Not too astonishingly, he was in the closet. And he gets all worked up when he thinks Vicki is still alive. His eyes bug out to the point they are like golf balls glued on to his face. He then sobs pathetically on the counter before they haul him out.Of course, as anyone who has seen the original film knows, the switchboard operator is not the true culprit. We cut to a concluding sequence in Boone's apartment where our trusty detective is found to have built a shrine to the late ingenue. And once again, where we would expect dramatic fireworks, we instead get a very underplayed bit of business with him mourning softly while holding flowers and admitting his heinous deeds.What's truly heinous is that Fox attempted to remake a film that was perfectly fine in the first place and needed no updating. And that a cast of great performers is reduced to pitiful contrived camp. The fact that this remake was produced at all and turned out as poorly as it did is the real crime.</fullReview>
