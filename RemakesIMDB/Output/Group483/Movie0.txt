		<shortDescription>"Why Should I Go On Slinging Hash, When I Can Sling Other Things?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty waitress is given a shot at the big time by a handsome sports impresario. She grabs her chance with alacrity, but Fate has plotted a different course for her ...Bruce Humberstone directs this attractive early noir with a strong sense of visual style. His Director of Photography, Edward Cronjager, works wonders with elongated shadows and labyrinths of lattice.Victor Mature looks good as Frankie Christopher, the romantic lead. Always a fairly limited actor, he never the less captures his character's ambivalence sufficiently well for the viewer to be kept wondering about him until the final reel. But for all Mature's efforts, Frankie remains a lightweight. He spends more time onscreen than anyone else, but remains in the viewer's memory less successfully than the other three leads.After almost a decade in films, Betty Grable was 25 years old in 1941 and already an established star when she took on the role of Jill Lynne. Her character has psychological depth, and Grable does justice to the part. Jill is the slightly staid older sister of Vicky the glamour girl. While Vicky gives free rein to her every whim, Jill suppresses her id, but her yearnings are simmering just below the surface.Of course, those legendary Grable legs have to be put on display, and we get three glimpses of Hollywood's most-insured thighs - first when the two sisters flounce around in robes, discussing the letter, then when Jill accompanies Frankie to the Lido Plunge, and finally when she is tottering up firescapes and over rooftops in her high heels.Inspector Ed Cornell is a figure of stature, apparently a good guy, but one who fills the viewer with a sense of uneasy foreboding. Laird Cregar captures brilliantly the bleakness and creepiness of Cornell, the cop who starts the movie as a silent shadow, but who grows inexorably to dominate the proceedings. The moment when Jill meets Cornell for the first time is a very dramatic one, just as Vicky's first encounter with the eerie detective was disturbing. Robin Ray (Alan Mowbray) breaks down under interrogation, and Cornell's stillness as the suspect sobs is rather unsettling. "You're not a cop looking for a murderer," Cornell is told, and we become increasingly aware that this repressed man is conducting some kind of unhealthy personal crusade. It is only at the very end of the film that Cornell displays any emotion, and then the floodgates open.Carole Landis, the ill-starred actress who plays Vicky Lynne, deserves a special mention. Like her character, whose fictional tragedy she paralleled in her own life, Landis was a victim of her own beauty. A tough but brittle radiance, total self-absorption and an impatience with the trappings of success ("I've got about as much privacy as a lingerie mannequin!") are Vicky's salient attributes, but could be said to apply to Landis herself. She gives a confident performance and sings beautifully. Like Vicky, she shot to instant fame but never found love, and died in her 20's. Thus does Life imitate Art.The film contains some errors and improbabilities, but these do not seriously detract from the viewer's enjoyment. Cornell gathers evidence (such as discarded cigarette butts) with blatant disregard for preservation and continuity. That Harry should pack Jill's things, ready for her to move out, is just plain weird. The Assistant DA (played by Morris Ankrum) rides Cornell far too hard, given the detective's peerless reputation - and would the lawyer have direct operational command over a detective anyway? Frankie is allowed to compound felonies, and threaten cops, with impunity. Unbelievably, the police grant him the freedom to crack the case, even though he is the main suspect.Music is used effectively throughout. "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" (the hit from the recent 'Wizard Of Oz') is Frankie and Jill's love theme. Vicky's signature tune is a wonderfully decadent jazz melody, brassily scored. Plot points are nicely underlined by discords in the incidental music, and during Cornell's final speech, Vicky's theme is reprised with great poignance and beauty on a muted trumpet.We do not normally associate film noir with humour, but this one uses jokes well, both to punctuate the plot and to add a little light to the shade. Watch for gentle little gags involving latch keys, a Tootsie Roll, the girl at the Lido Plunge and a fold-away bed."You've got a heart made out of rock candy," Vicky is told, and in life the hard young woman is an unsympathetic character. Death transforms her, and she haunts the remainder of the film like a sort of ghost, her photograph adorning walls and bedside tables, more appealing in reverie than she ever was in the flesh. There is no help for it, Vicky is gone for ever. The question is whether those who loved her can continue to live without hope. "It can be done," intones the nihilistic Cornell.Just for the record, though two characters are startled out of sleep by bedroom intruders, nobody in "I Wake Up Screaming" wakes up screaming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing, Ambiguous Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evocatively directed by Bruce Humberstone, this absorbing early film noir contains a surface sheen, polished elegance, and haunting ambiguity that anticipate similar noirs by Otto Preminger. Its cast of unusual actors and all-time greats is uniformly excellent. Betty Grable is quite revealing and capable of expressing a genuine human emotion in the rare dramatic role of Jill Lynn, the sister of the slain victim Vicky (Carole Landis). Victor Mature looks suitable for his part. Laird Cregar (who would later play the Devil in Lubitsch's "Heaven Can Wait") may be the most memorable character in the film; he is truly scary as the corrupt detective investigating the murder case. Director Humberstone's way of handling the two disjointed flashback structures in the beginning, narrated by Mature &amp; Grable in their two separate rooms is quite intriguing and masterful. The film has a way of surprising us with its captivating twists and revelations, never failing to arouse the viewer's imagination. One of the most enjoyable noirs of the 40s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to like about this Film Noir: excellent use of shadows (some spectacular patterns), Victor Mature's best acting role, Carole Landis' (who's both a better actress &amp; prettier than Betty Grable) juicy part, Laird Cregar in one of the best scary roles of his too short career, &amp; a strong plot. For cheesecake fans: yes, you do get to see Betty's great legs in a swimming pool scene that seems to have been incorporated into this film for just that purpose. For beefcake fans: yes, you do get to see Victor's chest in the same swimming pool scene. So everyone should have something to be happy about. There's lots of suspects here (five solid ones) to choose from, &amp; I got it wrong, so the film gets an extra point for that. I rate it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this many times over the years and never tire of it. The plot is a little bit predictable. But the details are what count.It's like an Edward Hopper painting with dialogue, motion, and fabulously garish musical effects. Everything about it is seamy. Yes, the creepy plot but what a cast! Victor Mature and Betty Grable: These two were a couple to identify with? Not on a bet. They are as weird as Elisha Cook, always a pleasure to find in a movie, and the similarly excellent and mondo bizarro Laird Craiger. Carole Landis, a very likable performer who met a sad end in real life, was not exactly a wholesome beauty either. A beauty for sure but no sweet little thing.The rest of the cast is great too. Alan Mowbry is icky in an understated way that is also as glaring as the theatrical lights blaring out the title at its opening.And -- to be circumspect and give noting away: the shrine. The shrine will wake you up in days and years to come. Screams of horror; screams of laughter; screams of astonished appreciation for this one-of-a-kind cubic zirconium of a rare and unique gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerhouse Cast Makes Fox's First Film Noir Sizzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Mature, Betty Grable, and Carole Landis had all been in movies together (mostly musicals) in various combinations, but I WAKE UP SCREAMING (IWUS) was the first film noir all three of them starred in. Maybe that's why IWUS still feels so fresh; everyone in it and everything about it brims with verve and brio, as if all concerned were eager to start filming. Though the movie begins in a NYC police interrogation room (an effective change from the novel's Hollywood setting), IWUS's plot starts more like PYGMALION/MY FAIR LADY than pulse-pounding crime fiction like the Steve Fisher novel the movie's based on. Flashbacks show how promoter Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), newspaper columnist Larry Evans (Allyn Joslyn), and veteran actor Robin Ray (Alan Mowbray) grab a bite at a Times Square eatery and end up betting they can turn their tart-tongued but beautiful waitress, Vicky Lynn (the incandescent Carole Landis), from a hash slinger to a headliner by getting her name in the papers and her face plastered all over town. It works *too* well: dazzled by her own success, Vicky snares a Hollywood screen test and contract right under her shocked benefactors' noses, only to be murdered on the eve of her Tinseltown departure. Jill finds Frankie standing over Vicky's body, swearing he found her that way. Hotshot Police Inspector Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) insists Frankie's lying. 15-year veteran Cornell has never been wrong, and he's obsessed with making an example out of hapless Frankie. But does justice alone explain Cornell's zeal, or does he have a hidden agenda? The cat and mouse game is afoot between Frankie, determined to prove his innocence, and Cornell, a smoothly sinister behemoth of a man, ready, willing, and able to go to any lengths to railroad Frankie. Undeterred by the lack of a search warrant, Cornell even sneaks into Frankie's bedroom to watch him while he sleeps ("Someday you're gonna talk in your sleep, and when that day comes, I wanna be around."), doing his damndest to wear Frankie down with smilingly delivered threats and manipulation. With wily Cornell's festering resentment of Frankie, you can't tell what he'll pull next. A formidable, menacing presence, Cregar rocks in the role. His silky voice and charming smile somehow make him even scarier; no wonder IWUS put him on the map. Victor Mature's Frankie is a great match for Cregar's Cornell, with his outer charm and inner toughness. Always an appealing presence, Mature was a better actor than he got credit for, making it look easy. He was hot, too; no wonder Cornell sneeringly calls Frankie "Handsome Harry!" :-) Elisha Cook Jr. is fine as Harry Williams, the oddball switchboard operator and original suspect. (Fun Fact on film historian Eddie Muller's commentary track: Cook filmed his role as THE MALTESE FALCON's Wilmer at the same time he filmed IWUS.) Things heat up as Jill and Frankie acknowledge what sharp Vicky had already realized: they're in love and eager to protect each other. It's cute and typical of the era to see Jill get starry-eyed when Frankie wants to marry her. It's even cuter when Frankie reveals his original surname as Jill dreamily sighs, "Mrs. Botticelli." Vicky's whirlwind trajectory from waitress to glamour girl to corpse plunges Jill into a world of murder, terror, and obsession, propelling her to flee with the man she loves, dogged by Cornell at every turn. When the plucky Grable's wholesome sexiness meets Mature's playful yet virile allure, it's Chemistry City! Dwight Taylor's screenplay tightens Fisher's sprawling novel almost to the point of claustrophobia (in a good way), with sharp, witty dialogue and comic relief balancing the nerve-racking tension. Taylor's dialogue is snappy, suspenseful, and poignant in all the right places. Loved that "key" exchange early on! Edward Cronjager's lush, expressionistic black-and-white photography is a thing of shadowy beauty, used especially well in Cregar's early scenes as combinations of heavy shadows and bright interrogation lights hide him from view.Even with studio sets, IWUS evokes early 1940s NYC, even the rooftops. When Frankie shows Jill his old East Side neighborhood, it's fun as both a getting-to-know-you scene and a mini-travelogue of the non-touristy places where native New Yorkers go. This continues when the lovers become fugitives and Frankie shows Jill where to hide in the big city, including the library and a 24-hour grindhouse. Even the swimming pool scene has that spirit; sure, it's there primarily to show off sex symbols Mature and Grable in their swimsuits, but it reminded me of the city's neighborhood pools at their best. One ironic-in-retrospect bit, considering IWUS came out before the U.S. entered World War 2: incensed upon spotting Frankie and Jill dancing so soon after Vicky's murder, Larry calls in a blind item about them, snapping, "Scrap the stuff about the Japanese spy with the Kodak and run this!" Apparent nods to Fisher's pulp roots: 1.) Frankie takes Jill to The Pegasus Club, possibly a shout-out to the novel's narrator/writer hero, nicknamed "Pegasus," a.k.a. "Peg." 2.) During a Cornell/Frankie confrontation, a newsstand features Black Mask Magazine. (This scene gets my vote for cleverest use of a Tootsie Roll.) Finally, according to Muller's commentary, Cornell was named after Fisher's pal and fellow pulpster Cornell Woolrich.Nice, quirky use of music, too, particularly "Over the Rainbow." Fans of vintage movie music will notice that the opening credits music is the same theme, Alfred Newman's "Manhattan Street Scene," also used in THE DARK CORNER. When Jill brings Frankie home to show him an incriminating letter, listen carefully: in the background, "Over the Rainbow" and "Manhattan Street Scene" cross-pollinate into a sinister new theme, courtesy of music arranger Cyril Mockridge. Ironically, although Mature and Joslyn each have scenes where they awaken with a start, nobody in I WAKE UP SCREAMING ever actually wakes up screaming! How could you wake up to find a huge cop staring at you and *not* scream? :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite Victor Mature's claim that he never 'acted' in any of his films, he does well enough here. Full of shadows, sly humour and a storyline which keeps you guessing, plus that wonderful soundtrack (including snatches of Over The Rainbow), this stands as a monument to film noir - Betty Grable could clearly handle a non-musical role, Elisha Cook Jnr displays his twitchy vulnerability as he would in so many 40s thrillers. The real-life early deaths of Landis (playing Vicki here in a manner which reminded me of Vivien Leigh's Blanche Dubois, all flirty giggles) and Cregar (superb here as the corrupt detective gliding and purring in that unusual voice like a huge cat) do affect viewings of this film and give the proceedings a hint of sadness. This aside, there is much to enjoy, particularly in the supporting characters of Mature's actor and columnist friends. One niggle though, given the plot dependence on various people letting themselves into other people's apartments, how come Vicki got herself locked out?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Wake Up Screaming is an odd and oddly satisfying film. It is in the noir mold but it's a little earlier than most. The studio that made it was not noted for making thrillers, and the stars,--Victor Mature, Betty Grable and Carole Landis--were not the types one would expect to find in this sort of dark movie. Yet it is fun from the start to finish, and at times creepy, thanks mostly to the presence of Laird Cregar as a cop determined to nail Mature for the murder of a heartless showgirl that he, Cregar, was himself infatuated with. The studio New York of the film is much less intimidating than one might expect in a mystery, and overall the tone is bright and bouncy,--call it noir light. But it's Mr. Cregar who makes the film work. He dominates the picture as soon as he enters it with an authority and sense of himself that most actors would kill for. Cregar was, in short, a genius. The supporting cast, which includes Allyn Joslyn and Alan Mowbray, make the best of their lines, which are often quite witty, and the script is, overall, far better than average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of obsession, murder key movie in developing noir cycle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WWII pin-up gal Betty Grable took her first dramatic part as the sister of a murdered model in Bruce Humberstone's I Wake Up Screaming, based on a serialized novel by Steve Fisher. It sounds like second billing, but the victim's role ? as coffee-shop hostess turned toast of Manhattan Vicky Lynn ? remains curiously understated (and played by Carole Landis). Landis is discovered by publicist Victor Mature and falls under his benevolent spell, which launches her onto magazine covers and ultimately to a Hollywood contract. She proves ungrateful and winds up strangled. Mature, among other suspects, comes under the scrutiny of the police, particularly of a dogged detective whose interest in the case borders on the obsessive. Portrayed by the immense but oddly vulnerable Laird Cregar, the detective becomes Mature's nemesis (in one scene, Mature wakes up to find Cregar watching him, hoping he'll incriminate himself by talking in his sleep). Cregar's ominous bulk makes for a number of looming shadows skulking through nighttime New York.I Wake Up Screaming, which appeared very early in the noir cycle, certainly displays the dark look and fragmented structure of its successors, but its tone remains ambiguous. Basically, it's a high-style, `sophisticated' murder mystery, a precursor to the more famous and accomplished Laura. But, unlike Laura, it found many of the implications of the story perhaps too grim for wartime audiences ? the theme of obsession gets played down, for instance. But it's a key work in the developing noir cycle, released the same year as Johnny Eager, The Glass Key and This Gun For Hire.Eleven years later, the releasing studio, 20th Century Fox, remade the film as Vicki. Though changes for the most part were minimal, the title role was enlarged (and taken by Jean Peters) while Mature's part was weakened by routine casting. The most interesting change was engaging the young Richard Boone for the Cregar part, who delivers a more brutal portrayal and thus underscores the theme of sexual obsession. It could be argued that the remake, despite lapses in casting and direction, remains the more intriguing version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Model Vicky Lynn is found murdered in her apartment and the police question the logical suspect, promoter (and slight love interest) Frankie Christopher who was the primary force who got Vicky her status. Vicky was a waitress in a diner who was noticed by Frankie (and two of his buddies- columnist Larry Evans and ham actor Robin Ray) and given the right contacts in the modeling and ad industry and was set to leave for Hollywood (and dump Frankie in the process) right before she was killed. Jill, Vicky's sister, is also questioned and while she seems to be protecting Frankie for some reason, she claims a large foreboding man was stalking her only to find out it's Ed Cornell, the police inspector, who becomes obsessed with the case and getting Frankie in the electric chair for some strange reason. Jill eventually begins to fall for Frankie and gives him a letter he wrote to Vicky in a fit of anger which Cornell swipes from him, but Jill helps Frankie escape. Frankie now tries to hide himself in New York from the police (especially Cornell) while trying with Jill to uncover Vicky's murderer. Great movie highlighted by the show stealing performance by Cregar (in probably his best role) as the sadistic and crazed Cornell. Mature, Grable, and Landis all give standout performances for their careers in this film as well. Humberstone's directing is the best it ever was with plenty of odd camera angles and surprises which the screenwriters gave plenty of. I still wonder why pieces of Over the Rainbow were used in the score. Great twist ending. Rating, 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the model Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) is found murdered in her apartment in New York, the promoter of sports Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature) becomes the prime suspect of Inspector Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) and is brought to the precinct for interrogatory. Christopher discloses how he promoted the career of Vicky when she was a waitress after making a bet with his friends Robin Ray (Alan Mowbray) and Larry Evans (Allyn Joslyn). After reaching the stardom, Vicky tells Christopher that she would leave him to go to Hollywood and on the next day, she was killed. Ed Cornell insists that Christopher is the killer and frames him, and Christopher can only have the support of Vicky's sister, Jill Lynn (Betty Grable), who has fallen in love with him. Who Killed Vicki? "I Wake Up Screaming" is a film-noir with a story of unrequited love and obsession and "Over the Rainbow" as the music theme (after "The Wizard of Oz" of two years before). Laird Cregar is scary in the role of Inspector Ed Cornell and the final twist surprises and is well resolved. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Quem Matou Vicki?" ("Who Killed Vicki")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tough policemen do not spend all their time slapping the villains around? Sometimes they are ruthless and crooked too in more subtle ways? Such a cop is the character in "I Wake Up Screaming." The story is that of a detective who conceives a hopeless passion for a waitress ? hopeless because she, not even knowing he is a policeman, is terrified of him from the beginning? He murders her, then uses his police force influence to shift the blame on to the hero? Laird Cregar played the detective ? a magnificently sinister performance, though how the New York police department allowed a detective as overweight as Cregar to remain on the strength, passes belief? The film was remade, in 1953, as "Vicki," and the detective was more believable because he was played by Richard Boone, that awkward, fleshy-nosed heavy who did not become an actor until after leaving the U. S. Navy at the end of World War II, but who has developed into one of the best menaces in the business?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the Earliest "Gritty" Noirs, A Film That Paved The Way For Later, Better Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As it originally emerged, Film Noir was as glossy as it was tough, a genre photographed in a remarkable visual style of light and shadow and offering cynical and often witty tales of slick anti-heroes and dangerous dames--and films like THE MALTESE FALCON, THIS GUN FOR HIRE, MILDRED PIERCE, THE BLUE DAHLIA, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY remain great classics of their kind. At the same time, however, 20th Century Fox was releasing a stream of "pulp" crime dramas. Often overlooked or flatly dismissed by critics, they would pave the way for the shift in Noir style that came in 1948 with the "true crime," gritty style of NAKED CITY.The first of these 20th Century Fox films, based on a novel by Steve Fisher, was I WAKE UP SCREAMING. Jill and Vicky Lynn (Betty Grable and Carole Landis) are two sisters living in New York; Vicky is working as a waitress when she is noticed by promoter Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), who is soon convinced he can turn her into a star. But Vicky proves perfidious: once success is within her grasp she drops Frankie to pursue a career in Hollywood. Her career never comes to pass: she is found dead in her apartment, Frankie standing over her. And police inspector Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) makes it clear that he intends to nail Frankie for Vicky's murder.Although the dialogue is clunky, the film structure is intriguing, often telling the story through flashbacks in a way upon the 1944 LAURA would improve. But the real power of the film is the sharp edge with which director H. Bruce Humberstone endows the film--and the truly memorable photography by Edward Cronjager, a truly gifted cinematographer who would receive no fewer than seven Oscar nominations during his long career. And then there are two powerhouse performances that drive the film: Carole Landis and Laird Cregar.Originally from Wisconsin, Carole Landis began her career playing bit parts in such films as A DAY AT THE RACES--but in 1940 she had a major breakthrough in the film ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. In hindsight, it is obvious that Landis was a competent if slightly limited actress; at the time, however, she was generally dismissed by critics as just another pretty girl without significant talents. In a very real sense, I WAKE UP SCREAMING would be the high-water mark of her career; she was thereafter generally overlooked by the studio and often miscast. By 1948 her career was over, and she took her own life.Laird Cregar, however, was a different matter, immediately recognized for his gifts. But Cregar was an extremely large man, weighing in at 300 pounds. It was a fact that limited his career, and although he appeared to tremendous effect in such films as THIS GUN FOR HIRE, HEAVEN CAN WAIT, and the exceptional THE LODGER, leading man status eluded him. Determined to cross the line, Cregar went on a crash diet and dropped over 100 pounds. It got him the lead in HANGOVER SQUARE, which many regard as his best film--but it also strained his health to the breaking point, and he died of heart failure in 1945.In spite of its innovations, the fiery performances of Landis and Cregar, and an unexpected plot twist that can still drop jaws today, I WAKE UP SCREAMING is a slightly awkward film, largely due to the flippant nature of its dialogue and the "goody goody" quality of the role assigned to Betty Grable, who reads here as somewhat saccharine. Nonetheless, this is a film that fans of Film Noir cannot afford to miss, for it points the way to the new style. The quality of the picture is a bit hit and miss, but the DVD has a surprising number of bonuses--including a memorable audio commentary by film historian Eddie Muller. In comparison to such contemporary films as THE MALTESE FALCON and the slightly later LAURA, it is pretty mild stuff--but the film has a historical importance in terms of the Noir movement, and fans of the genre will find it indispensable.

		<fullReview>BETTY GRABLE and VICTOR MATURE were not the likeliest contenders back in the early '40s to be appearing in a creepy film noir sort of tale dished out by Fox. Usually, they could be counted on for much lighter stuff--particularly Grable, who usually starred in Fox's gaudy Technicolor musicals. Mature only came into noir by '47 with KISS OF DEATH.But no matter. It's really LAIRD CREGAR who gets the spotlight here as a detective relentlessly pursuing Victor Mature as the killer--hoping to snag him in his net--if he can convince anyone that Mature is the real killer. Mature's only relationship to the dead girl (CAROLE LANDIS) is that he's the one who was closest to her at time of death, being that he was her agent trying to get her a Hollywood career rather than letting her remain in obscurity.So, it becomes a game of cat-and-mouse and full of plot twists and the kind of deception that easily turns up in any film noir or mystery of this kind. And the deception appears to be obvious, at first. But--well, you have to see the film to see how the worm turns.It's nothing really special but it does provide a few shivers along the way. Some of the Grable/Mature romantic moments go on a little too long (especially at the swimming pool) and once in awhile the plot drags. But by the time it winds up, it's been a pretty smooth ride into noir territory, thanks largely to LAIRD CREGAR and the dark shadow he casts over the whole story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Wake Up Screaming" is, without a doubt, one of the finest film mysteries of its decade. A murder mystery with tough-as-nails police tactics, the grittiness and glamor of 1940's New York and the charm of its Hollywood stars make it a must see little film noir gem! Betty Grable and Carole Landis are splendid as two sisters who are living in New York and whose lives go in two totally different directions. Victor Mature is well cast as the love interest who is suspected of murder. Also, there are good performances by Laird Cregar and Elisha Cook, Jr. One really gets a great feeling of 1940's New York from this film (ditto, "The Dark Corner") and as an added attraction we get to hear "Over The Rainbow" played instrumentally as background music throughout the lighter moments of the film.

		<shortDescription>Nothing To Do With The Title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I did, too, after my hemorrhoid operation. That was brutal, but has nothing to do with the title of this movie. Come to think of it, the title of this movie has nothing to do with the story of it, either.There is no screaming in here, and almost no suspense. However, Laird Cregar, Elisha Cook Jr. and a couple of pretty ladies from the '40s (Betty Grable and Carole Landis) still make this interesting to view.Cregar is creepy, thanks to his voice and some good film-noir camera angles. This is billed as film noir, but it's really a "whodunnit" melodrama and it drags in spots, hence the "fair" rating.Overall "decent" but it doesn't live up to its wild title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A confused, gorgeous looking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An odd comedy of a serious crime drama? it was difficult to decide what they were trying to DO with the film? a score made of bits and pieces of popular music from the last couple of years, used repeatedly like cut pieces of fabric in a quilt? a script that kept slipping into witty and funny although nothing of the plot asked for it? Betty Grable, Victor Mature, and Carol Landis starred along with lots of character actors you'll probably recognize.. This film did eventually offer up a solution, but kept its oddball character. The one GREAT thing about this film was the photography ? highly intelligent compositions with some of the best Noir lighting and angles of all time. I was in a near-constant state of admiration for the "look" of this film (which once again did NOT support the idea of ANY comedic moments!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premature noir that seems to have been blended with a 1930's MGM musical. There's the classic noir lighting and composition, but there's swanky bejeweled affairs filmed in opulent, soundstage-filling sets. There's polite, wealthy gentlemen with faux British accents, a convention from the '30s, really more at home in something like 'My Man Godfrey.' And there's a feeble love story between Grable and Mature, two of the stranger pieces of noir casting. The resolution of the plot is a bizarre and weak cop-out, and raises more questions than it answers. The ending makes this seem like a Laura rip-off before the fact. The incidental music (it cannot really be termed a score) is two songs: "Street Scene" and "Somewhere over the Rainbow" (!? MGM again) two years after the Wizard of Oz, applied arbitrarily, and repeated ad nauseum until you have a headache. This music director does not understand the difference between developing a motif and annoying an audience. Carole Landis has a strange bony face that is not flattered by the photography.It feels like lazy, B-grade noir. The theme 'Street Symphony' was also used in "The Dark Corner" and the hardware store here, where Grable saws the handcuffs off Mature, is the gun store set from the opening seconds of Gun Crazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laird Cregar's performances in motion pictures were small in number (a bit over twenty films), but large in ability to hold audience attention and in sheer artistry. Whether Jack The Ripper, George Bone, Clive Oxford, Willard Gates, Sir Henry Morgan, or whoever, Cregar dominates his films, and usually each performance is unique in itself. He is usually considered a movie villain. It's true that violence plays a heavy part in his films, but his "Lodger" is driven mad by sorrow at the loss of his talented brother due to a prostitute; his Gates is in over his head, due to the demands of his evil boss (Tully Marshall) and the target of his actions (a deadly Alan Ladd); his Bone is suffering from a mental disease, but trying to compose the concerto that will give him immortality. In short, most of his villains have something in their background that makes them pitiful if frightening. Occasionally he plays a run-of-the-mill lowlife. In BLOOD AND SAND, his bullfighting critic "Curo" (which means a Bull's rectum) is a self-important parasite on bullfighters like J. Carroll Naish and Tyrone Power, whom he builds up, lives off of, and then throws aside when they no longer make large salaries.But in his catalog of roles, possibly his most frightening one is his New York City master police inspector Ed Cornell. Not in fancy clothes or make-up, Cornell is mostly fierce attention and an ever-parked fedora hat on his head. He is the perfect realization of ability, brains, and retribution. For Ed Cornell misuses his badge to destroy promoter Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature). In playing the ultimately dangerous cop, Cregar actually played the scariest villain in his career (even more frightening in his way than "the Lodger" or Bone).Vicki Lynn (Carole Landis) was a promising model whose career was being pushed by Christopher. Mature plays Christopher realistically - a friendly but pushy type who is a wire puller through his contacts, like actor Robin Ray (Alan Mowbray) and Larry Evans (Allyn Joslyn). Christopher hoped to get Lynn into acting and a fancier career. But she is found murdered. Circumstances are not settled in any direction, but when Cornell enters the case, and starts examining Christopher, he starts making veiled insinuations about the latter's actions and motives and activities on the night of the murder - insinuations that suggest a remarkably subtle detective intelligence - but also an inexplicable hostility. It soon becomes evident that Cornell is not simply trying to solve a murder. He is trying to definitely prove Christopher is guilty - or is he trying to frame Christopher?Ed Cornell is Cregar's model (unwittingly and unintentionally) for Orson Welles' later Hank Quinlan. Both men are incredibly adept at their work, but both become incredibly corrupt at it. Quinlan's corruption carries on too long and too far. Cornell's, as we learn, is concentrated on this case - but it goes far enough to establish his own evil as memorable. Being Cregar he varies his menace towards Mature with some lighter moments. Please note the intellectual story about the rare butterflies that he mentions when talking to his superior about laying a trap. He does show a human side eventually as well. But it is the evil that he does that dominates in this film, making it one of the first great film noir of the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Brooding Film Noir with a Great Performance by Laird Cregar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Beautiful Model Found Murdered" screams the headline in the New York Daily Call. Prominent sports promoter Frankie Christopher (nee Botticelli, Victor Mature) is grilled by detectives who suspect him for the murder of model Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) at 76th Street in the city. In flashback Frankie explains how he discovered Vicky ? a waitress at the time ? and their subsequent business connection. Because of a lack of physical evidence, Frankie is not arrested although menacing detective Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) insists that he is the killer. In fact Cornell becomes overly obsessed with pinning the crime on Frankie even to the point of overlooking several obvious suspects, like strange switchboard operator Harry Williams and callous gossip columnist Larry Evans. What is Cornell's agenda? In any case, Vicky's sister Jill (Betty Grable), who initially disliked Frankie, gives her perspective in flashback to the police of the time of her sister's business split with Frankie. Vicky had told Frankie that ? despite his advancement of her career ? she was leaving (for Hollywood) as she has just signed a long-term acting contract after passing a screen test. The next day Jill found Vicky's prostrate body with Frankie hovering above it in the sisters' shared apartment. Cornell trails Frankie around town in a disconcerting manner. From his sleep in his bedroom Frankie awakens to find the sinister detective staring at him. The investigator had hoped that he would talk in his sleep! Another time, after Frankie gave him a ride, Cornell taunts the promoter with a miniature hangman's noose. Still another time Cornell sneakily works his way into Jill's apartment. When Cornell plants brass knuckles in Frankie's apartment to implicate him in Vicky's murder, Frankie goes on the lam. But Frankie will use a Tootsie Roll to good advantage!Meanwhile Frankie and Jill begin to date and eventually fall in love. He tells her that his real last name is Botticelli. "Mrs. Botticelli?" utters Jill. The couple has to play sleuths to get down to the bottom of the mystery. There is a nice scene where Jill sneaks outside her building via the fire escape, never slipping despite prowling around in her high heels. We see even more of her famous legs at the Lido plunge. Anyway, the two learn that someone has been sending flowers on Vicky's grave every day. Then Frankie discovers that detective Cornell has set up a shrine to Vicky in his apartment. So who killed her?Victor Mature, Betty Grable, and Carole Landis act wonderfully and are good-looking, but this has to be Laird Cregar's movie. See his shadow early on when, like the creep he is, he stalks the dining room where Landis works. Cregar, porcine at six feet three inches and 300 pounds, is one terrifying crooked cop. An interesting contrast is with beefy Orson Welles in "Touch of Evil" (1958). Catch Cregar in "The Lodger" (1944) and "Hangover Square" (1945). The former movie is about Jack the Ripper while in the latter Cregar is a classic composer who plays his piano while a building goes down in flames all around him. Three years after "I Wake up Screaming" he was dead at age 31. Lovely Carole Landis never made it to age 30, although, as she had some success in real life, she fared better than her screen persona Vicky who does not make it to Tinseltown. At the end Landis was four times married and her career bottomed out. Of course Betty Grable would become a famous World War II pinup gal. She had already acted in "Million Dollar Legs" (1939) and "Down Argentine Way" (1940). Mature had already starred in "One Million BC" (with Landis) in 1940; he would also act in "My Darling Clementine" (1946), the underrated "Cry of the City" (1948), and many others. He had better range than he himself realized, for he played several important and diverse historical figures: Samson, Crazy Horse, Doc Holliday, and Hannibal. By the way, despite the title, no one wakes up screaming!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is film noir at its' best, from screenplay to directorship to photography to acting. I'm sure the 'best boy' was great too (did they have one back in 1941?).We don't talk much about actresses butts, but Carole Landis had one of the best, even with a girdle. What a beautiful girl.... suicide at 29. Betty Grable was THE pin-up girl at the time, on the lockers of many GI's, but it was her acting that stood out in this film. I wish she had done more drama and fewer light-hearted romance/music films. Victor mature was very believable as was Laird Cregar as the vulgar detective.I haven't written much, if any, about the content of the film and I never do in my layperson's reviews because I don't want to divulge the scenario. Since they are loaded with repetition (I think I have a larger library of old movies), FXM Retro or TCM will air the film again soon, just like they do with 'Key largo.' No, Virginia, there is no 'Hotel Central' in Milwaukee and never was, according to my dad, who has lived there since 'One Million B.C.' (a film starring both Victor Mature and Carole Landis....the early version, not the one with Raquel Welsh).</fullReview>

Each character in the movie was a bit watered down in comparison, but I suppose that is to be expected considering the blandness of many Hollywood films. If you are a fan of gritty noirish films and novels, "I Wake Up Screaming" will be moderately entertaining. I suggest reading the novel instead...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Early Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering its recognised status as one of the very earliest film noirs, it's remarkable how many characteristics of the classic style are featured in "I Wake Up Screaming" (aka "Hot Spot"). Themes including sexual obsession, betrayal and entrapment are very prominent and its big city setting, numerous flashbacks and witty dialogue are all used to great effect. A portrait of a beautiful woman is a standard noir motif which was due to become more frequently used in later years and the expressionistic cinematography in this movie is both aesthetically pleasing and incredibly effective in establishing the mood of the piece.Well known New York City sports promoter Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature) is at a restaurant one night with actor Robin Ray (Alan Mowbray) and gossip columnist Larry Evans (Allyn Joslyn) who are both very impressed with good-looking waitress, Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis). Much to the amusement of his friends, Frankie claims that he could successfully promote Vicky and make her a star and soon starts to introduce her to some influential people. Vicky subsequently achieves some success as a model and one day announces to a surprised Frankie that she's had a screen test and is leaving for Hollywood without him. Shortly after this act of betrayal, Vicky is found dead and Frankie becomes the prime suspect.Frankie is subjected to some aggressive questioning by a group of detectives in an interrogation room and one of them, Detective Inspector Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar), is especially menacing. He has a reputation for never losing a case and openly threatens Frankie with the electric chair (aka the hot spot). Due to a lack of hard evidence, Frankie is eventually released but although Vicky's sister Jill (Betty Grable), Frankie's friends (Ray and Evans) and a switchboard operator at Vicky's apartment house, Harry Williams (Elisha Cook Jr.) are all considered as suspects at various points in the investigation, Cornell continues to pursue Frankie relentlessly.Jill and Frankie fall in love and soon realise that the only way they'll be able to have any future together will be if they can find the real killer. When the culprit is caught, however, further interesting revelations follow.This movie is a visual treat with a whole series of clever compositions of light and shadow being used to enhance the atmosphere and two sequences are particularly impressive. Initially, the interrogation room which is bathed in darkness with the intense spotlight being pointed directly in Frankie's face emphasises how trapped this innocent man is and later, on the staircase in Vicky's apartment building, when he stands covered in a huge grid of shadow, it reinforces his status as a person who's been framed.Ed Cornell is the character that makes the strongest impression in this movie as not only is he physically imposing but also, with his soft voice and creepy behaviour, everything he does seems so calculated and sinister. His habit of turning up in people's rooms unexpectedly is particularly disconcerting and he also puts psychological pressure on certain suspects by trying to get into their heads. Laird Cregar is ideally cast as Cornell and provides the film's standout performance. Victor Mature and Betty Grable also excel in their roles."I Wake Up Screaming" with its terrific pace, great one-liners and some neat twists, is extremely entertaining and a superb example of early noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this was a really excellent film noir movie released in the early Forties - "I Wake Up Screaming" or "Hot Spot" as it was called in some countries held the interest all the way through, and the surprising performance in my book, came from Betty Grable - not that she had to do a hard acting job, but having been very much a musical comedy-type this was a most off-beat role for her. The real stars were Laird Cregar and the Music -both were brilliant adding so much to the suspense and drama. There were the usual support actors like Allyn Joslin, Elisha Cook Jnr. and William Gargan who all added to the enjoyment of a fine who-dunnit. A good movie to revisit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gateway Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest problem of some critics and chroniclers of Noir with the film I Wake Up Screaming is that they don't know how to categorize it. It doesn't fit the carefully crafted "German Expressionism" influence scenario that they have worked out as the origin of Noir. It's Director H. Bruce Humberstone, never made another Noir, it's brilliant cinematographer, Edward Cronjager, never filmed another Noir so conceptually and visually it's a one off, one of a kind, sui generis.I'm calling it a seminal "Gateway Noir" because the film serves the same purpose as a gateway drug, it functions as a sort of gateway to Noir for those unfamiliar, at that point in time, with what eventually came to be known stylistically, and hard boiled narratively, as Films Noir.Look at the film in chronological context, only Stranger On The Third Floor (1940) approaches it in Noir visual stylistics, while The Maltese Falcon (1941) released only twenty eight days ahead of it on October 3, has the hard boiled story by Dashiell Hammett, but barely any of the signature visual stylistics. I Wake up Screaming not only was based on the hard boiled novel by Steve Fisher and also has the brilliant Noir stylistics in abundance but it has much much more. You can say that the film has dissociative identity, multiple genres if you will. It's also a bit of a Screwball Comedy, a Romantic Drama, and almost a Musical. This seamless genre bending provides the "gateway" for Comedy, Romance, and Musical audiences at that time into the films that eventually will be pigeonholed into the future Noir cycle.My assertion is that if you've screened I Wake Up Screaming after the various other Noirs it will seem a strange hybrid indeed, because of the conceptions you've already amassed. But, experiencing it as audiences did in 1941 it would probably seem fresh and innovative.The credits flash against a Noir New York Skyline the titles are written in marquee lights and we hear a the musical equivalent of a shrill klaxon horn blasting out a danger warning. It segues into Street Scene one of the signature New York City themes. Street Scene was used by 20th Century Fox for the films Street Scene, Cry of the City, Kiss of Death, Where the Sidewalk Ends, The Dark Corner, and as the overture to How to Marry a Millionaire. The story even actually starts with a street scene a newsboy hawking the murder of a model. We then cut to a dark police interrogation room bright spot lights are sweating a suspect, classic Noir. Professional promoter Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature) is being grilled, surrounded by shadowy figures barking questions.Frankie then begins to relate the story, and in a flashback we are transported to a Times Square restaurant and we are brightly lit again and into screwball comedy mode. Frankie and his two pals, over the hill actor Robin Ray (Alan Mowbray) and gossip columnist Larry Evans (Allyn Joslyn) flirt with hash slinger Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis). In a nod to Pygmalion Frankie makes a bet that he can transform Vicky into a celebrity inside of six weeks. Cut again to a classy nightclub where Frankie introduces Vicky, now dressed in evening gown and sable, to caf-society. Throughout the film the sequences that feature Vicky or are in some way connected to her also have the Street Scene theme in various arrangements jazz, muted trumpet, etc., it becomes her leitmotif, and suggests the Musical genre. In a later sequence in a police projection room we see Vicky singing on her screen test.We cut back to the police station, back to the present, and back into Noirsville. We now see Jill Lynn (Betty Grable) being questioned in the dimly lit squad room. As Jill tells her story we again go into flashback. She tells us how Vicky came home that first night and told Jill that she was through slinging hash and that from now on she had other things to sling. She had offers for modeling, commercials etc., etc. Jill tells her it's just easy money "your picture is on a magazine one day and in the ash can the next." Vicky is unfazed she snaps back that she knows what she wants and how to get it..The weeks pass and Jill finds herself falling in love with Frankie. Every time Jill and Frankie are together Over the Rainbow plays in one form or another as their "love" leitmotif another nod to musicals. Street Scene is not only Vicky's leitmotif but also it represents the New York, anything goes, sophisticate. The juxtaposition between it and Over The Rainbow which also brings to mind innocence is interesting for this Noir.During another session with the cops Jill remembers a stranger she saw staring at Vicky through the window of the restaurant one night. It turns out to be Lt. Cornell (the name a nod to Cornell Woolrich) who is unhealthily obsessed with Vicky Lynn. Cornell also has a moody, sinister leitmotif.Cornell is trying hard to pin the murder on Frankie, going as far as withholding and planting evidence. Elisha Cook Jr. is Harry Williams the nervous Nellie desk clerk at the residence hotel where Vicky and Jill have their apartment.We get another Screwball Comedy sequence when Vicky tells her three "creators" that she's signed a long term contract for Hollywood and that she's leaving for the West Coast. We see Frankie, Robin, and Larry are seated on bar stools drowning their sorrows and taking pop shots at one another.The cat and mouse game between Frankie and Cornell plays out to the end with some nice interesting twists. The screen-caps are from the Fox Film Noir DVD. The film is like an early flyover of Noirsville 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sports promoter Victor Mature (Frankie) is in police custody being questioned over the murder of aspiring actress/model Carole Landis (Vicky). Landis lived with her sister Betty Grable (Jill) and she is also in custody being questioned. Through a mixture of flashbacks and real-time action, we learn the story of how events came to pass and whether or not the police can get the real killer. Things don't look good for Mature? The cast are all good in this film. Carole Landis plays a ghastly wannabe plucked from nowhere and launched into a life of celebrity. If only her fate was part of the deal for those celebrities of today ? think of Jordan, and all those other pointless people that invade our television sets. Betty Grable gives a solid performance ? no singing or dancing ? and is way better at it than that other musical star Doris Day who tried a straight role in "Midnight Lace" (1960) and fell flat on her face with it. But, it is Laird Cregar (Cornell) who excels as a creepy Police Chief Investigator.The whole film is easy to watch with interesting scenes that drive you through the experience. One memorable sequence has creepy Cregar call in actor Alan Mowbray (Robin) and Mature as suspects, and force them to watch a film sized screen of Landis singing. It's a good song, and someone cracks? There is also some funny dialogue to keep you amused. One example that stands out to me is when Mature says to Grable: "Who goes to a library at 9:00am?" Yep, I agree. Even when I was a University student, that never happened! It's an interesting story that you can try to second guess but you won't get it right, especially the end twist. It is a shame that two of the main players ? Laird Cregar and Carole Landis - didn't live much longer after this. Both were dead by the end of 1948. However, what on earth is the title about? There is no screaming in this film.....thank God.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misleading title for a solid noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Mature plays Frankie Christopher, a somewhat smarmy but likable enough sports promoter. He lays eyes on gorgeous waitress Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis), and determines that he can make her a popular glamour girl. Well, he does, but just when things are looking brightest for her, she gets murdered. Now, Frankie, who'd discovered her dead body, is believed by the police to be the killer. The lead inspector, Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar), is more convinced than anybody, and swears that he will prove Frankie guilty no matter how much time it takes. Meanwhile, Frankie and Vicky's sister Jill (Betty Grable) fall in love and set out to try and prove his innocence."I Wake Up Screaming" is a thoroughly absorbing murder mystery made by a veteran director of the genre, H. Bruce Humberstone. All of the characters are engaging and maintain ones' interest. Mature is especially good in the lead, with a top notch supporting performance by the sadly short lived Cregar. Cregar had a presence that extended beyond being just physically big. The incredibly beautiful ladies Landis and Grable are compulsively watchable, and naturally there are a few opportunities to admire Grables' gorgeous gams. William Gargan, Alan Mowbray, Allyn Joslyn, Elisha Cook Jr., Morris Ankrum, and Charles Lane are all great.This film looks just as fine as anything else made in the genre, with the expected contrasts between light and shadow. The best thing about it is that, even if the viewer believes that they've solved the mystery early on, it still tells a good story in capable fashion, focusing on a theme of obsession.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feelings changed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My feelings about this film changed when I watched it last night on TCM during Betty Grable's Summer Under the Stars tribute. It is not as good as I remembered. It suffers from quite a few plot contrivances, and the main stars look a little uncomfortable in their roles (except for Laird Cregar and Carole Landis), and for the most part it sort of registers like a glorified B crime film. I think Grable was right when she told studio boss Darryl Zanuck that she was not cut out for straight dramatic parts and stuck to musicals henceforth. In a musical you can get by with mediocre acting if your dancing and singing is spectacular. But in a film of this nature, with nothing else to fall back on, you have to be very convincing-- and in some spots she is a bit too self-conscious and not at all convincing. Costar Victor Mature does not exactly have a handle on his character either (but as his career at Fox continued, he would become a dependable dramatic lead). VICKI, the remake that hit screens twelve years with Jeanne Crain and Jean Peters, is better in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>holds your interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film noir is one of the most difficult genres to do, because it is very tough to hold a normal person's interest with nothing more than tough talk.And that's why good noir has more than just tough talk.This one is about a pair of sisters, one of whom is killed before she can do a screen test to become a star.The suspects number a half dozen principle players, but three of them are obviously red herrings (the sister, the older actor, and the newspaper man). Of the other three, we know that usually in noir movies, it is typically the little timid guy played by Cook, but it becomes evident that this is a long shot, and would be a contrived ending when we see the conflict between the two chief suspects.This is because the hero awakens to find the creepy detective in his room, the same detective who was known to stalk the murdered girl. And later the detective and a cop produce the alleged murder weapon from the hero's room, which the hero says was planted.This happens about half way through the film, and it obviously infers that either the hero is guilty or the detective is insane. If the detective is insane, and not guilty of the murder, that would be a little too Hollywood in "contrived and coincidental" outcomes.So not to spoil the ending, I won't say how it does end. I will say the film holds your interest, because there is a good mixture of charm, wit, action, and drama. It is smartly directed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some nice puppy love, but film noir sure takes a back seat in this dated, pseudo-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'I Wake Up Screaming' came out around the time 'The Maltese Falcon', which is considered the first true film noir. 'Screaming' has some noirish elements including some dark lighting, a femme fatale of sorts and a man falsely accused of murder but it can't make up its mind whether its appeal is slanted toward the lover of a good mystery or romance. Indeed, the occasionally insufferable soundtrack features one too many tidbits of 'Over the Rainbow', occasionally ruining the dark atmosphere of menace that a true film noir should engender.'I Wake Up Screaming' disappoints on many levels. First there's the murder victim herself, Vicky Lynn (played by Carole Landis, who tragically took her own life approximately seven years after this film's first release). Vicky is a waitress turned would-be actress, after being discovered by sports promoter, Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature). One wonders why these high society types (who are friends of Christopher), fall head over heels for the unconnected Vicky, who has nothing to offer except maybe her looks. The way they fawn over this unproven neophyte is truly embarrassing. Not all actresses at that time got ahead simply because of their looks?there was something also called 'personality' but unfortunately the films' scenarists here chose to present the requisite go-getter as a generic bimbo. Maybe this is the reason why Vicky's sister, Jill (Betty Grable), along with Christopher, fail to emote when they learn of Vicky's murder. Yes, this bothered me but then again, when you intentionally create such generic characters, it stands to follow that real emotions will invariably not end up on display. I also found Victor Mature to be hopelessly miscast as Christopher, who should be a more hardened, streetwise character. Mature is simply too much of a 'nice guy' to play a tough guy sports promoter. Betty Grable is more fitting as the goody two shoes sister but too much time is taken up with Grable and Mature canoodling, and taking us away from the aforementioned atmosphere of dread (it should be noted that the DVD extras feature a song that Grable sings that was cut from the final print; that only goes to show the mindset of the films' producers before they decided to turn 'I Wake Up Screaming' into something a tad bit more grittier).The 'Screaming' plot is really nothing to write home about. Yes there's a nice little twist when Jill recognizes creepy Detective Ed Cornell (menacingly and finely played by Laird Cregar who also met a sad demise at an early age), as the guy who had stalked Vicky earlier, while she was working as a waitress. Cornell is the bad cop who breaks into Christopher's apartment, misappropriates evidence without a warrant and ultimately still attempts to arrest Christopher, even though he has already obtained a confession from the real killer. We get the idea early on that Cornell is both a bad guy and pushy to boot but things really fall apart at the climax when it's revealed he's a pathetic sad sack stalker, who has pictures of Vicky plastered all over his apartment. Instead of killing Christopher (which of course would not have worked well for a 1941 audience but would have been a better ending today?I'm thinking of John Houston in 'Chinatown', the real bad guy pedophile who gets away with it), Cornell, sheepishly and pathetically, takes his own life.The real killer turns out to be a big let down: Harry Williams, the bellhop, whose obsession with Vicky was even worse than Cornell's (Elisha Cook Jr. provides the proper histrionics, as the noted 'B' actor was always good at playing neurotics and petty criminals).Oh yes, there are two other characters, an over the hill actor and cynical Broadway columnist, who are the 'red herrings' designed to distract you from figuring out who the real killer is. Again, when we do find out that Harry Williams did Vicky in, he just seems so tangential to the main story, as if it were an aside in a play (also, please clue me in how the police can call Harry a "suspect", simply because he went missing for a day or two?later they discover the was visiting relatives in Brooklyn, and have to let him go). The 'I Wake Up Screaming' denouement is wholly appropriate, as we find the two lovebirds, Jill and Christopher, once again canoodling in the 'ritzy' night club which both sisters found so exciting. The lightweight ending might be good for the family friendly aficionados who dig the happy endings and the silly romance, but film noir has clearly taken a back seat, in this puppy love, pseudo-thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere Over the Rainbow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never heard of director H. Bruce Humberstone before- he's not an immediately recognizable director of thrillers and particularly in the mood of film-noirs like Fritz Lang or Robert Siodmak or Otto Preminger to a degree- but after I Wake Up Screaming I'll try my best to remember it. He's directed an exemplary film, a B-movie that crackles non-stop with terrific, sometimes explosive dialog, and the actors- all cast against their usual genres at the time (and Victor Mature, a musical performer, who knew)- and retains its classic status as a more-than-whodunit.Actually, the 'who-dunnit' part is both the least exciting and the most potent of the picture (yeah, contradiction in terms). Vicki Lynn has just been murdered, and Inspector Cornell (Laird Cregar) is out to bust the guy who did it - and that guy, right from the start, is sports promoter/slickster Frankie Christopher (Mature). At first it's cut and dry it seems, but then... ah, personality seems to go a long way in these stories, and this is where some directors might play for safety in the treatment of the plot and characters, but Humberstone follows along with it, makes the mystery exciting and curious for the audience. I've seen many of the quintessentially darkly-lit movies of the 40s, and this one still caught me up in the grip of suspense, the thick of not always so much who did it but what clue would slip up who, and at just what turn.The dialog is one indicator of how continuously watchable I Wake Up Screaming is; the lines just between Christopher and Cornell, slinging barbs at each other and going in their molds of Christopher the wisecracker but tough (and claiming innocent) guy and Cornell the smug, slimy Inspector who, by proxy of a very underrated performance by character actor Cregar, becomes all deliciously more obvious as the picture goes on. And yet the writers know well: it's good to be witty, even sarcastic and with touches of grim humor or catchy one liners like, "Here, have a tootsie roll!" But it's also the acting all around, on top of the perfectly moody cinematography (the smoke in one room could be cut with a scalpel, and the contrasts of light and reflecting of lines of shade is remarkable), that makes this stand out, with Grable, Landis and especially Mature giving all they got.Watch it in the dark, have no distractions, and get sucked into I Wake Up Screaming, a tale of a woman being sucked into the fantasy of showbiz, the possibility of two folks finding love together, and the lines of who's good or bad getting blurred all along the way. Pretty simple themes, but expressed wonderfully and with a tough sense of style, plus with an oft-repeated "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" rendition fitting in (sometimes) ironically in scenes. Basically, any self respecting fan of film noirs, or just brilliant B-movies, should see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Noir, Outstanding Performance by Cregar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wonderful thrill it is to discover a film I had never heard of and find it to be so enjoyable and fascinating. I found this one while browsing the DVDs at the library and checked it out based on the fact that it was a film noir and had a picture of Betty Garble and her famous legs on the DVD cover. "I Wake Up Screaming" has a crazy title which has little to do with the film's plot, but it's one of the most beautifully shot film noirs I've ever seen, and according to the interesting commentary track by noir expert Eddie Muller it's one of the earliest examples of that genre.The story is sort of silly, but Victor Mature is well cast as a New York promoter and he has plenty of chemistry with his love interest, the lovely Miss Grable. Personally I found Carole Landis, who plays Grable's tough-talking sister, more attractive. She is stunning as the waitress-turned-starlet who manipulates all the men in the film. I was very sad to learn of her tragically short life. There's a real fire to her performance here in a relatively brief role.But the real star of "I Wake Up Screaming" is Laird Cregar as the creepy, soft-spoken Inspector Cornell. As the lead detective on the a murder case Cornell is bent on convicting Mature's character, so much so that he follows him around like a vulture and even sneaks into his bedroom while he's sleeping. Cregar with his dark presence and huge body reminds me of a younger version of Orson Welles's crooked detective Hank Quinlin in "A Touch of Evil". He taunts Mature with a miniature hangman's noose and bullys Grable into admitting her love for Mature. It's a totally unexpected performance. Most actors would have played Cornell tough and hard, but Cregar uses his soft voice and intelligence as a counterpoint to his intimidating size. By the end of the film we care less about the murder mystery than we do about Cornell's fate. It's a fascinating performance and Cregar certainly belongs on any list of actors unfairly ignored by Oscar.If you enjoy Film Noir and want a pleasant surprise, rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Laura Like Fixation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Wake Up Screaming opens with both Victor Mature and Betty Grable being questioned by the police in the death of Grable's sister Carole Landis. Plausible cases could be made against them both, but the police let them go for lack of evidence.One detective though is determined to see Mature get that fabled hot seat in Sing Sing for the crime. Laird Cregar is a cop with a reputation of never giving up, he'll get his man come hell or high water. In fact Cregar has a devotion to the dead woman that amounts to a Laura like fixation that Dana Andrews had in that film. Although it looks like he wants to solve the case from almost the beginning of the film it's clear he has agenda all his own.Other suspects in this film are Alan Mowbray, Elisha Cook, and Allyn Joslyn. Landis was quite the user of men and discarded when no longer needed. Any one of these and others could have had reason and maybe opportunity to do the job.Grable and Landis would play sisters once again in Moon Over Miami, a much different kind of film than I Wake Up Screaming. Although in that one both are a pair of gold-diggers out for a rich husband.The film really belongs to Laird Cregar who in his short life and career racked up an astonishing variety of roles. His detective Cornell is about as different as the epicene Curo from Blood and Sand as different as the luckless Willard Gates in This Gun For Hire and still different from the rapscallion prospector in Hello Frisco Hello.One thing that I did not understand though it's a nice touch in the film. The background music is something Darryl Zanuck would have to have paid for. The two themes used are from other films not from 20th Century Fox. The theme from Elmer Rice's Street Scene which was from Samuel Goldwyn/United Artists is used as is Over The Rainbow from MGM's Wizard of Oz. Zanuck must have paid Goldwyn and Louis B. Mayer some big bucks for the rights. I Wake Up Screaming did give Betty Grable a chance to shine in a non- musical part which she does. The rest of the cast does well and Laird Cregar just shines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elements of Noir, with Pulled Punches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Wake Up Screaming (1941)Elements of Noir, with Pulled PunchesThis looks like a film noir, with Edward Cronjager behind the camera (a seasoned Fox cinematographer). The plot reads like one, with a good woman, a so-called bad woman, and a good man caught between. The nighttime New York setting is pure noir, nightclubs and all. And it has perfect actors for the job--Victor Mature as a fight promoter, Laird Cregar as an ominous cop, and Elisha Cook Jr. as creepy and afraid as ever. As a true film noir, it's about as early as they come, a prototype, really, before WWII has hit the U.S. directly and the final elements of the approach take form.Though completely enjoyable, and an important film in the evolution of the genre, I Wake Up Screaming is not as intense or moody as it could have been. Director H. Bruce Humberstone, a veteran of Charlie Chan movies and later some weak Tarzan flicks, pulls a lot punches here. Dark moods lurk, but layered with lightheartedness. One reason is the lead actress, Betty Grable, a sweet, girl-next-door type, utterly likable but somehow oversimplified. And very blonde--that is, he works with stereotypes and doesn't dig beyond them (partly the screen writing at fault, though the actual dialog is good). (Grable is famous as the war's number one pinup girl, and Humberstone did a musical starring Grable three years later called Pin Up Girl.) And there is a steady stream of improbable or even absurd details (or mistakes) to mar our getting absorbed--the most jarring might be when the cop disappears into the swinging bed and the camera watches long enough so we laugh, just when we are meant to be tense and afraid. Slapstick? As well, a couple of bit-part actors take on clichd roles in comic relief, which makes the film a bit undecided.In a way, the movie has fun with the caricatures it's been dealt. It refuses to get serious and disturbing because it's so purely out to entertain. That might be a fault, but it might also be a matter of taste. At the time, the strategy may have paid off in ticket sales. Even so, people must have wondered really why the murderer wanted to kill the girl, or why the sister wasn't more upset about it, or why the fight promoter could so cheerfully run around as both crime-solver and main suspect.The country was swept with "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" fever a year before this was filmed, and the song infects this movie to a fault--it is used so often for the Grable character's signature music, and yet it's so linked to the Wizard of Oz in our heads, it strikes you as false. And the last thing a moody crime film needs is a superficial falseness. But Humberstone also packs some wallop in many of the scenes, often with the help of hard light and slicing shadows, or with characters sneaking into people's apartments with alarming ease. And there is the steady sympathy aroused by the underrated Mature, who helps hold it all together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New York mystery with an attractive cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carole Landis is the glamorous younger sister of the more earthbound Betty Grable in "I Wake Up Screaming" a Fox film noir from 1941. This is a serious role for Grable, and she does a nice job. Victor Mature is well cast as Frankie Christopher, an agent/publicist who discovers Landis while she's waitressing and thinks she's got what it takes to be a star. Unfortunately, when she's murdered, Mature becomes the chief suspect and is dogged by a frightening detective, beautifully played by Laird Cregar. Initially Grable worked in a music store, but it was changed to a secretary because it confused audiences - there was Betty Grable singing - so they thought they were going to see a musical.The original title of this film was "Hot Spot," a term referring to the electric chair and mentioned right at the beginning of the movie when Mature is being grilled by the cops.Carole Landis was a beautiful young woman, graceful, with a great figure, large, expressive eyes, and a lovely smile. She never rose to the ranks of big stardom and committed suicide in 1948, at the age of 29, with four failed marriages, one on the rocks, a failed affair with Rex Harrison (thus the phrase "sexy Rexy) and a canceled contract from Fox. A real shame.The film has a great atmosphere and some nice external shots of New York City. One would have thought that the song "Over the Rainbow" would have been inextricably linked with "The Wizard of Oz" released just two years earlier, yet violins play it throughout the movie. It's distracting. Other than that, a very good movie. Remade in 1953 as a B movie, "Vicky," starring Jean Peters, Jeanne Crain, Richard Boone and Aaron Spelling - yes, Aaron Spelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good little mystery thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young rising actress Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) is found murdered. Immediately under suspicion is her former press agent Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature) who she dumped cruelly. Vicky's sister Jill (Betty Grable) is positive he didn't do it while Police Inspector Cornell (Laird Cregar) is positive he did do it. Jill and Frankie try to find the real murderer while Cornell tries to trap them...Exciting, well-made, low-budget thriller. It moves quickly, has good acting (especially by Cregar and Grable) and is never dull. It has its debits though--the score is repetitious and heard again and again and AGAIN during the movie and there's an unnecessary romance between Mature and Grable worked in (although it DOES show them off in their bathing suits at one point). Still these are minor quibbles. Also a chance to see Landis and Cregar--two fine actors who died well before their time. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I taped this off UK Channel 4 on 11th April 1987 and it still plays perfectly - just how long are video tapes meant to last?! After a gap of nearly half a decade unwatched I find IWUS still fresh, hackneyed in places especially when Victor Mature's large eyebrows beetle, but very effective in the depiction of the loony by looming Laird Cregar. Also refreshing was a straight, although maybe played too serious role by ultra-demure Betty Grable who after being in so many lightweight musicals exuded just the right amount of ordinary helplessness when faced with a possible stalking pervert who may also be a murderer. My daughter pointed out that maybe the stalker was supposed to be slightly bi as well because he kept dogging Mature around obsessively.Nowadays of course the sleaze angle would amplified to the point of plot exclusion with graphic sexual violence cheerfully applauded to the skies as Art. But that's Progress for you. Back then they trod a fine line with the Production Code, and even if it was very silly at times for the makers and the watchers it was discipline that's sadly lacking now. To me, this movie is another link in the chain of good and great '40's film noirs, with some twee moments as in the all-night swimming hall and the incessant Over the Rainbow muzak, but overall making up for it with flashy camera work with lovely smoky moody nitrate visuals, plenty of flashbacks, fine terse performances and a seedy storyline expertly handled.I hope my video outlasts me, for back in '87 they showed a great print that can't be bettered on DVD now and I love going back to it even if at the rate of twice a decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho cop and crazed hotel clerk...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes "I Wake Up Screaming" a compelling thriller are the supporting performances, starting with Laird Cregar as an obsessed homicide detective and Elisha Cook, Jr. as a weedy hotel clerk. Investigating the murder of a hash slinger-turned-sex bomb, Cregar's soft-spoken, unemotional persona hints at a dangerously disturbed mind. He's as frighteningly effective here as he was in "The Lodger" and it only makes it more tragic that he would die soon after the film's release at the age of 31, the victim of a disastrous attempt to lose weight. Cook, on the other hand, would live into his 90s, having a field days playing gunsels, whiners and slimy con artists. Allan Joslyn and Alan Mowbray also contribute as a hack newspaper columnist and an over-the-hill actor respectively and...what the heck...even Victor Mature manages to come off well. Bruce Humberstone's slick direction -- and the film's multiple flashbacks -- are reminiscent of another 20th Century Fox noir thriller, "Laura." And that's meant as a compliment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Mystery is a Pleasing Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the dynamic title that drove me to this oddity. Then there was also the cast, Betty Grable in a noir drama? She's very pleasing in her early strait role (was that magnificent blond hair truly real?) Victor Mature demonstrates his increasingly nervous discomfort throughout the progress of this story via his iconic facial expressions, belying his characters over-confident exterior. The cause of this discomfort comes in the form of a creepy Laid Cregar, a strange detective who is determined to nail Mature for a serious crime. An interesting scene has him wake to the sense of an ominous presence in his apartment that would have had me screaming too - I can't too readily recall another actor that could signal fear, with just one instant facial expression.Carole Landis, who tragically took her own life at only 29, following a scandalous affair with married philanderer Rex Harrison, is OK in the part of Grable's sister. With so many others in the support cast also being noteworthy, this just had to be seen.The Director; Bruce Humberstone, whom I had associated more with comedies, musicals, and outdoor actioners (Tazan and westerns) seems to be in his element with this fast moving crime story by prolific writer; Steve Fisher ("Lady in the Lake" '46) Good one liners come rapidly and often.It gets off to a cracking opening with striking sets by multi award winning Thomas Little; "Grapes of Wrath" '40 ~ "Razors Edge" '46 ~ Viva Zapata" '52. With Art Direction by two up and coming directors, Richard Day, and Nathan Juran. Another veteran, Director of Photography; Edward Cronjager, "Roberta" '35 ~ "House by the River" '50 ~ "Relentless" '48 ~ "Beneath the 12 mile Reef" '53, all combine to assure this film a stylish look and feel.It may not always work as well as you might like, but it keeps you watching and guessing to the end. The biggest draw back for me was the musical direction by English born Cyril J. Mockridge. He must have been given only a few days to prepare a score and I don't think he wrote a note of original music. Instead, he uses music tracks from the library of popular standards. The best of these is Alfred Newman's "Street Scene" put to good use under the opening credits. Another is Harold Arlen's immortal "Somewhere Over the Rainbow". Both these melodies keep popping up at the most unnecessary moments during the story, so much so, that by the time the end title arrives you may well wake up screaming too...Not great, but still good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This soft who-dun-it melodrama works effectively with a perfectly matched cast. The dialog isn't very clever at times (lines like "You're the Mona Lisa type ? I can spot 'em a mile away), but is entertaining just the same. It's nice to see Grable in a setting besides the predictable musicals she would soon be typecast in for the rest of the decade. Betty wasn't much of an actress, but she was so easy on the eyes that it didn't matter. In fact, the cast has its share of "lookers" ? from the dapper Victor Mature to the voluptuous and stacked Carole Landis (a tragic figure who took her own life just 7 years later). There are moments in this flick that even seem comical, such as the character actors in the final scene. (It also has Grable and Mature as the new Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bottachelli - that surname alone is something you can't take too seriously!)There's more music in this type of movie that would be expected. Landis (with someone ghosting her voice) croons "The Things I Love" ? a pretty new melody written for this 1941 caper. The hit "Over the Rainbow" does appear briefly at times, but it's Lionel Newman's superb, haunting 1931 theme "Street Scene" that pops up repeatedly in the excellent film soundtrack. A quick orchestral variation of "What'll I Do" is also heard if you listen close enough.On the print I saw of "I Wake Up Screaming," the closing credits included a plug to buy war bonds. It must have been quickly added to subsequent prints, since this movie was released three weeks prior to Pearl Harbor when we entered the war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Wake Up Screaming is one of the early entries in the film noir cycle that lays down noirish detective conventions. It's kicker is similar to that of Stranger On The Third Floor (1940), that of the chief suspect turning detective to try and prove innocence. Directed by Fox contract director H. Bruce Humberstone, the screenplay is by Dwight Taylor who adapts from Steve Fisher's novel of the same name. It stars Betty Grable (excellent in a rare dramatic role), Victor Mature, Carole Landis, Laird Cregar, William Gargan &amp; Elisha Cook Jr. Picture is filmed as if in New York City, but although it's actually listed as the real location on other sources, it's more than likely just expert set construction. Edward Cronjager (Canyon Passage/Desert Fury) takes up cinematography duties.The plot centres around cocky promoter Frankie "Botticelli" Christopher (Mature) who is accused of the murder of Vicky Lynn (Landis), a young actress he "discovered" as a waitress while out with his friends. Teaming up with Vicky's level headed sister Jill (Grable), Frankie finds the heat is on and it's getting hotter as the police, led by brooding heavy Ed Cornell (Cregar), are determined to put him in the electric chair, or "Hot Spot" (the film's original working title and a title held for the UK release of the film). Told in alternating flashbacks, nothing is ever quite what it seems, so with dark motives looming and deep suspicion enveloping our protagonists, the question is, just who will wake up screaming? It starts out rather briskly, jaunty music opens the piece up and one gets the feeling that this is very much going to be a standard Betty Grable picture. In fact when you consider that snatches of "Over The Rainbow" are used at frequent points in the movie, the makers have to be applauded for ultimately achieving the murky end product that I Wake Up Screaming becomes. There's very little "light" in the piece, what bright scenes there are serve as snippets of hope for our intrepid detectives, but outside of that it's deep shadows &amp; dark interiors, perfectly given the high contrast treatment by the talented Cronjager.This is very much Cregar's movie. A fine character actor before his sad and premature death, he had a hulking presence that dominated film's if given the material to work with. Here he gets a role to really unnerve the audience with. For although the character is watered down from the source novel, his Ed Cornell (apparently based on pulp novelist Cornell Woolrich) is creepy yet oddly garners sympathy too. Most of the best scenes involve the big man, I mean not many actors could dwarf Mature the way that Cregar does here, but the film is all the better for it as the characters persona's are unfolded in front of the audience. It helps of course that Humberstone &amp; Cronjager get the best out of Cregar's shiftiness, semi-cloaking his face with window blind shadows or using his body shadow to act as another character bearing down on the latest person to be on the receiving end of his penetrative questions. While one sequence as Frankie sweatily wakes from a feverish nightmare will linger in the conscious as much as Cregar effectively lingers in the movie.With devilish twists and turns and a genuinely hard to figure out "who done it" structure, I Wake Up Screaming is very much an essential movie for the Noir/Crime movie fan. And of course for those wishing to see just why Laird Cregar was so highly regarded. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great noir film showcasing the talents of Grable and Mature....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those looking for a sleeper film, this is it. Fans of film noir genre will be pleasantly surprised by this outing. I believe it was later remade several times, but this one featuring the gorgeous gams of pinup girl Betty Grable, and the macho-ism of Victor Mature, really is one of the quintessential noir films of all time. There are also some great performances by two actors who in real life met tragically short careers. Both of whom were wreaked with depression over not landing meatier roles, and in both instances because of their physical appearance. In the first case, Carol Landis is an incredible beauty, but because of this couldn't find the kind of vampish roles that would later become popular with actors like Lauren Bacall. Landis had a sexy desirable quality, that at the time didn't play well, audiences or Hollywood at the time preferred the wholesomeness of actors like Grable. In the later instance, Laird Cregar was a deeply devoted actor that self trained in the desperate hopes of becoming a leading man. However his enormous weight, and looming frame of 6 feet three inches made this unlikely. His performance in this film highlights what could have been, had the studios been more forward thinking. Only a few years later, an actor in similar stature sky rocketed to the top; Orson Welles. Proving that it's the performance and not the look that's important. Tragically both these stars died too young, but in this film we are given a glimpse of what could have been. I find it amazing that Landis was only 21 or 22 when this picture was produced. She looks like a very mature woman. Va va va voom. There's a murder of a young starlet, the lead detective is sweating out his prime suspect, who goes on the lamb with the sister of the deceased. It all wraps up a little too conveniently, but then again, there are no perfect films. The performances more than make up for this narrow flaw.</fullReview>

There's a number of sub-plots involving Vicky's murder that all center around Frankie being framed with this big gorilla of a cop, 6 foot 3 inches 300 pound, inspector Ed Cornell, Laird Cregar, doing the framing.You notice right away that Cornell in't working with a full deck with his almost trance-like demeanor and obsession in getting Frankie strapped into the electric chair. Even at the cost of his career as a top notch cop with a chest-full of medals and citations from the department! Given all the leeway to catch the fugitive Frankie Christopher by his boss the Asst. District Attorney, Morris Ankrum, Cornell does everything to plant evidence on Frankie in Vicky's murder. This in effect has real killer given a free pass by non-other then himself, Cornell, who was in charge of murder case.It later becomes obvious that the love-sick gorilla had a crush on Vicky and was infuriated at Frankie for taking her away from him by making Vicky famous and had it in for Frankie ever since. You would have first thought that Cornell was Vicky's killer but it later comes out that he wasn't but was in some ways even worse! By not only doing everything to let her murderer get away Scot-free but pining the murder on an innocent man. Who if convicted, which Cornell is more then willing to make happen, will send him straight to the Sing Sing prison death house.There's the handsome hunk Victor Mature in the movie for the girls and the knock out and drop dead gorgeous Betty Grable, every WWII GI's dream girl, for the guys in the movie "I Wake Up Screaming". But the person who with out a doubt steals the film is the monstrously large creepy and soft spoken Laird Cregar as the crazed and love-sick cop Cornell. Who just by his very presence, he never as much as raises his hand or voice in the movie, brings icy chills down your back. Making the most lasting, and chilling, impression on those watching the film then anyone else in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of film noir, I had to see a movie with this name. But the title, which calls to mind classics like "Sorry, Wrong Number", is misleading. There's no screaming here, unless you consider the browbeating the police gave their suspects. Victor Mature plays Frankie Christopher, a smarmy Manhattan sports promoter who decides to make a waitress he meets, Vicky Lynn, played by Carole Landis, into a star. He wines and dines her and gets her seen in all the right places with all the right people. But when she turns up murdered soon after telling him she's leaving him to go to Hollywood, he's naturally the number one suspect in her death.Mature's performance is O.K. but pedestrian. I had never seen Carole Landis before. She was a lovely lady, and apparently she did her own singing in the movie. She gave a decent performance and had a nice voice. Sadly, her own life ended tragically just a few years after this movie was released. But the real stars of the movie were Laird Cregar as ominous police inspector Ed Cornell who was investigating the case, and Betty Grable in a rare dramatic role as Carole Landis' roommate/sister, Jill Lynn. Cregar's character was reminiscent of Orson Welles' Hank Quinlan. His performance certainly helped make this lightweight movie a little more interesting than it might have otherwise been.It's clear that Grable had the chops to play dramatic roles, and I wish she had been cast in more of them. But once she became famous, the studio probably had her typecast in musical comedies and didn't want to take a chance on alienating movie-goers by casting her out-of-type. She certainly gave a more-than-creditable performance.Wonderful direction by Bruce Humberstone and great film-noir lighting, including the obligatory light-through-the-blinds-casting-shadows shots. I particularly liked the shot of Mature's character's eyes as pools of light in the sea of his darkened face. Quintessential film noir.If you're a film noir fan, this one's worth a look. Just don't expect Double Indemnity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut little noir but could have been darker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When singing sensation Jill Lilly is murdered, police suspicion falls heavily onto the agent who brought her quickly up from being a waitress - Frankie Christopher. Police Inspector Cornell in particular goes after him for the murder. As they sweat him in the cell he recounts how he met and raised up Jill to be 'somebody'. Meanwhile his girlfriend's sister begins to reveal more of her true feelings for Frankie.I had never heard of this film before I watched it but the cast itself is enough of a draw to justify watching. The plot starts with the murder and builds the back-story through interviews and flashbacks, it is dark from the start but it gets progressively darker as the film goes on. The corrupt Inspector becomes more imposing as the story goes, while Vicky hurts herself by falling for the man who is suspected of her sister's murder. Meanwhile Frankie blames himself for Jill's death and suffers guilt as a result. This all works well woven into the story even if it isn't as harsh as the source material (which greatly increased the reasons for Cornell's bitterness) it still is dark for the period.The cast are all good. Grable is a great lead and was well cast here. Mature is always a rock and he plays his collapse into guilt very well. Landis is good but it is Cregar who steals the film - his character veers from deadly to sinister to pathetic; and each is as convincing as the last.It is the director that makes the film. The use of shadow is fantastic and sets the atmosphere perfectly. The quality of the film stock must have deteriorated over the years as the copy I saw was almost yellow rather than black and white - but that may be deliberate, I found it to add a sickly hue to everything that improved the atmosphere a touch. Overall this is a great little bit of noir with a great cast and a strong story that is darker the more you think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good piece of Film-Noir. A pretty waitress, Vicky Lynn(Carole Landis)is noticed by a well-known sports promoter Frankie Christopher(Victor Mature), betting his buddies he can transform her into a celebrated socialite. Vicky becomes a successful model and gets a ticket to Hollywood. The night before heading to more fame, she is found dead in her apartment by her sister Jill(Betty Grable). The suspect front and foremost is Frankie. He is grilled and leaned on hard by Police Inspector Ed Cornell(Laird Cregar). Frankie swears his innocence, but the hulking detective doesn't believe him. Jill now does what she can do to help Frankie find the real killer. Three other people has access to the crime scene. There is a surprising ending; but not exactly unpredictable. Other players: William Gargan, Alan Mowbray, Elisha Cook Jr. and Allyn Joslyn.</fullReview>

I didn't think that much of I WAKE UP SCREAMING, though... it was better than average and I thought Cregar was good, but the story seemed like a clichd cookie cutter affair, even the characters. I enjoyed watching Victor Mature in something other than biblical films for a change and felt he fit nicely into the role of Frankie. Unfortunately, Betty Grable failed to impress me here in what I think might be the first movie I know I've seen her in. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention -- the over-reliance on the "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" tune every time Mature and Grable were on screen was really silly. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps this relentlessly straight-faced murder mystery looked like a tough noir once upon a time, but today it seems a shopworn, clichd piece of formula goods, melodramatic camp. Betty Grable is interrogated by the police after her sister turns up dead; Victor Mature snarls and pouts as Betty's love-interest. There's a terrific closing scene, some colorful dialogue, but the plot is just a gimmick, with flashbacks used to pad the running time. Cheesy background score includes the refrain to "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" played ad nauseum. Movie magazine pulp looks pretty good in shadowy black-and-white, but peddles its sordid themes too softly. Remade as "Vicki" in 1953. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proto-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Betty Grable as the heroine has that cream-fed complexion and chirrupy optimism of the American Midwest. She doesn't really belong in what purports to be a film noir. Well, it isn't a film noir anyway, exactly. It's a murder mystery set in the kind of uptrodden Manhattan milieu in which people like Alan Mowbray as an aging ham hang out, drinking champagne, smoking endless cigarettes, and making urbane wisecracks.The non-noir elements, the film blanc elements, so to speak, create the kind of environment that suits Betty Grable well. The women are in cocktail dresses and the men in tuxedos adorned with carnations, like a Fred Astaire movie, or like the one she made with Astaire years earlier, "The Gay Divorce." The angles are sometimes crooked and tilted, though, and the lighting does at times cast strange shadows from oddly placed lights -- chicken-wire cages, venetian blinds. But the characters, for the most part, belong to an old, familiar genre. Victor Mature is breezy in double-breasted suits and triple-breasted grins. The police who are hunting the killer of Betty Grable's sister are nasty but not rough. Mature, being grilled as a suspect in the murder, insults them and gets away with it, without his head being turned to squash.The only truly noir figure in the film is Laird Cregar, almost always shot from below, the lighting emphasizing his porcine features. He's sinister in a way no one else in the film is. And that voice! Insinuating, soft but rapacious. Towards the end of the film, you're convinced he's going to be the murderer, but no -- the solution to the mystery is shrugged off in a few seconds and lands instead on the shoulders of poor Elisha Cook, Jr., a creepy mouse. Not that the bulky and threatening Cregar is let off the hook entirely. He turns out to be what we would now call a fetishist. I won't describe the details but he puts an end to his self loathing in a way that turns him very neatly from uncovered villain to pathetic nobody.Summing it up, a kind of upscale murder drama shot with the noir techniques that were to become so common in films over the next fifteen years or so. This was 1941. The unquiet lighting and camera angles are there but they hadn't found the right property yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film noir but why Over the Rainbow?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title is way off, but I agree with those who say this is great film noir. I like it for its light touches of sophisticated humor. It is a treat to see Laird Cregar in the same frame with Betty Grable. The soundtrack is interesting and impressive, too, and I very much enjoyed hearing "These Are the Things I Love," which was a pretty popular big band tune of the time. Like others, I wondered why "Over the Rainbow" was chosen as the love theme between Victor Mature and Betty Grable. It is so familiar to us now that all we can think about is "The Wizard of Oz." The only answer is that it must not have been that familiar in 1941. As I understand it, "Oz" was not a huge success on its first release. Could it be that "Over the Rainbow" was not yet ingrained into everyone's memory bank? At any rate, I enjoyed hearing it in its various arrangements in the background of this fine period piece.</fullReview>

The production design, costumes, and sets are all additional factors that add to this movie's "film noir." Among the actors: Mature is believable as the wrongly accused murderer, Landis shines as the glamor girl w/ unrealized ambitious dreams, Grable is effective as Landis' concerned "garden variety" sister, Cregar is the epitome of evil authority run amok, Gargan and Mowbray offer credible support as two of Landis' many suitors, and finally Elisha Cook, Jr. in a small, but pivotal role really that gives the murder story that 40's pedigree to make it a classic.

It leads one to believe this may be a psychological mystery, but it is actually a pretty run-of-the-mill mystery with Betty Grable woefully miscast. She was good at dancing, not so good at acting. Victor Mature turns in a decent performance, and Laird Cregar chews the scenery as usual. The ending is supposed to be kind of a twist but it doesn't really work and seems rather contrived as most mysteries are. This may be classified as a noir film due to the camera work and obsessiveness of Cregar's character, but it is a very minor film and lacks any real substance. But in 1941, this kind of mindless fluff passed as entertainment and at least the actors were good-looking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many millions did Fox pay MGM to use Over the Rainbow throughout this film without being sued??? It used way too much and overkills it. And it doesn't even fit with the movie anyway. Also overused is the Street Scene music--it seemed to play everywhere--the apartment scenes, nightclubs,on the streets. And neither Harold Arlen nor Alfred Newman (the composers of each) are even mentioned in the opening credits. I guess back then studios didn't have to legally give credit for using music from other sources? The other thing I didn't get about this is the title (later to be simply Vicki). Who wakes up screaming in this?? A better title might have been "A View to A Frame Up" or "How to Marry A Fight Promoter". ;-) I like both the leads in this, although Mature does grimace too much, which he seemed to do in all his roles. And Grable gets to wear a nice swimming costume, however briefly. I loved the seedy scenes where the two leads hide out in the 24 hour porn cinema watching something called "Flames of Passion"!! And the cop who yells to Grable, to put her shoes back on. At least that was all she had taken off in that place! Fox Noirs always have a slick polished look to them, and loved the lighting in this one. For an early noir, it has all the elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Studio thick ear doesn't come any slicker than this. It's TCF's second unit hitting on all eight cylinders, from casting to directing to story telling, all expertly done. And that's despite the dismal comic book title.So who killed fun-loving Vicki (Landis). Could it be the blonde lovely's visual opposite, the dark featured Frankie (Mature). Probably not since he's the male lead. More likely, it's scrawny fall-guy Elisha Cook as the hotel deskman. After all, Cook's taken more movie dives than a washed up boxer. But don't forget the snobbish gossip columnist (Joslyn) or the hammy actor (Mowbray). Frankie sure better figure it out because gruesome cop Cornell (Cregar) has him slated for the kind of seat you don't get up from.The photography's early noir all the way. Catch the many interesting shadowy angles, especially with the thick featured Cregar. Too bad he died so young (crash diet) because there's been no one since who could project such hulking decadence. Speaking of unfortunate early deaths, Landis sparkles in her lively role. Too bad she too left us early, apparently from a broken heart. Here, she and Grable really do look like sisters.Anyhow, the whole thing is really smoothly done, in a way that keeps you riveted to the screen, including the lighter moments with a well calibrated Joslyn and Mowbray. All in all, it's Hollywood slicksters at their professional best.</fullReview>

If you have a keen eye for these mysteries, you should be able to figure out who the real culprit is.There is an unusual performance by an off-the-wall cop who loved and followed Landis. He never forgave Mature for supposedly taking Landis away from him and while he knew of Christopher's innocence, he kept the idea well alive that the latter was the killer.Basically routine fanfare with a girl who let notoriety go to her head and wound up a murder victim.

The twists and turns and cat and mouse game between Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar), and Frankie Botticelli (Victor Mature) is outstanding. A lot has been discussed about Cregar's menacing performance, and it was certainly Oscar worthy, but what I liked was the face off between Cornell and Botticelli where all Botticelli had was his wits (And some assistance from Jill Lynn (Betty Grable)), against an enemy who had every advantage over him (Including the ability to essentially haunt him, and arrest him whenever he wanted (He was such a powerful cop, he had a licence to essentially get away with crimes or framing innocent people). I have seen films like "Westworld" (Richard Benjamin's will to live against Yul Brynner's "Gunslinger"), or "Night Of The Running Man" that had the same theme (With cabbie Andrew McCarthy vs mob hit-man Scott Glenn). With rare exceptions like the butterfly speech, you saw how Cornell was essentially the Brynner "Gunslinger" character, soft spoken, creepy and foreboding (Until of course, you discovered his motivation for going after Botticelli). This is an incredible film, and an easy 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Wake Up Screaming may not be the best film noir ever made; but it certainly has a lot going for it. The film feels different from most in its class right from the off. It's obvious that the filmmakers didn't have a very big budget to work from with this film, but that is made up for with a damn fine script and a plot that works from its main characters motivations rather than through plot points; just like a film noir should. The tone of the film is what sets it apart from most film noir, as the atmosphere is lighter than the usual dark and brooding one, and on the whole, the film is more 'fun'. The pacing of the film is a little odd, and it's a good half hour before the plot really gets going. We follow promoter Frankie Christopher, as he comes under suspicion for murdering the girl whom he helped to make a star. However, her sister is in love with him; and there's something a little sinister about the way ace-copper Ed Cornell has his heart set on nailing our hero for a murder that there is little evidence of him committing...Considering that the cast is made up of B-movie actors performing under the direction of a man who never made it to critical acclaim, the acting in this film is very good. Laird Cregar is not the lead actor, but he is the star of the show in his role as the sinister copper at the heart of the movie. In stark contrast to his physical form, Laird's performance works through his understated mannerisms. Victor Mature takes the lead role, and provides a nice portrayal as the likable film noir hero. Betty Grable tops off the lesser-known central trio nicely, and like her lead male co-star; does what you'd expect of her character. The characters are all very well written, and it's easy to plug into any member of the cast's plight, which makes the movie more credible on the whole. The ending is a little weak in its build-up, and it's rather easy to see coming; but it respects what has gone before it, and ends up ensuring that the audience is rewarded aptly. On the whole, this isn't a film noir that I would say is a must see film; but it's a very good one, and fans of the style will no doubt enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title to this Noir film is wonderful--it catches your attention and gets you ready to watch an excellent murder mystery. The only problem is that it really has nothing to do with the film! But no matter, the film is still a very good example of early 40s Film Noir--before the genre turned much darker in the late 40s and into the 50s. While the film has some excellent snappy dialog and mood, it still seems a bit more upbeat than later examples--in particular, its using the song "Over The Rainbow" as its theme! Victor Mature, a natural for Noir due to his ugly mug, was great as a tough leading man. The leading ladies, Carole Landis and Betty Grable have never been lovelier and are supposed to be sisters--and they do actually look somewhat alike. When Landis is murdered, the suspicion falls on Mature but Grable is sure of his innocence. This is the only weak point of the film, as it seemed a bit formulaic to have her believe in him despite all the evidence pointing to Mature's guilt--a classic clich if you've ever seen one! However, this is a minor problem and the rest of the film is just great--so good that it definitely was instrumental in forging the Noir style that was so popular after the war.Excellent throughout--an inspired and exciting crime drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie provides a fascinating insight into the way movies 'borrow' from one another and how subtly they avoid charges of both incest and plagiarism. This one kicks off with a title that is pure Cornell Woolllrich/William Irish and negates it immediately by bearing no trace of anyone doing any such thing - although it does tip its had by having a major character named Cornell. The main coincidence is having the detective (Laird Cregar) leading the hunt for the murdered of Vicki Lynn (Carol Landis) being in love with her and ultimately revealed to have an apartment full of photos and mementos of her. Three years later detective Dana Andrews fell in love with a dead girl, Laura, whilst assigned to find her killer but having checked the similarities let's look at the differences. Andrews had never heard of Laura (Gene Tierney) until he was assigned to the case whereas Cornell not only knew Vicki in life but turned out to be the killer plus we met Vicki some time before she was killed whereas Laura is dead (so we think) for about the first five or six reels before turning up alive. On the other hand both films were produced by Fox who, for good measure, remade IWUS in the fifties as Vicki. All that to one side this is a stylish noir with Victor Mature equalling the performances he gave in Cry Of The City and Kiss of Death and Betty Grable showing she could handle a straight acting role (wisely they cut the scene where she sings Bobby Troup's 'Daddy' but the good news is it's available as an 'extra' on the DVD.</fullReview>

Cregar steals every scene he is in. And pinup queen Grable ain't half-bad as the conflicted sister.

Also, the performances of Betty Grable and Carole Landis as sisters was incredible. First, they looked like sisters and second, they acted like sisters. Of course, it helps an actress's career if she's attractive, but she still has to be able to act and both of these ladies could act. Laird Cregar's performance was uncanny. He was the epitome of obsession. His performance carried the movie. Victor Mature was wonderful. He could act and in this movie displays an wide range of emotions.

		<shortDescription>I,d scream too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice Betty Grable and her slightly younger trashy sister Carol Landis share an apartment in NYC. While Betty is a home typist, Carol is a waitress in a joint downtown. Vis-a-vis police interrogation flash backs we find that One night three pals (a fight promoter, a has- been actor &amp; a gossip columnist) make a bet how they can turn Carol from a two-bit hash slinger into a society page talk of the town. They succeed altho sister Betty is skeptical. Overnight Carol does become a sensation and next thing you know Hollywood beckons so she blows off her 3 benefactors to head for tinsel town. Next day Betty finds the fight promoter, Victot Mature bending over sister Carol's fresh corpse. Naturally he claims he didn't do it.Enter spooky homicide cop Lard Kruger. He has a notorious track record within NYPD for solving murder cases. His conviction rate is something like twenty thousand in favor, no failures. He says Victor Mature is guilty and that's that. He looses this one tho and in the end proves just how creepy he really is.Well, after an hour or so of more suspects, red herrings, plot twists, endless shots of Betty Grables famous legs and one unnecessary public swimming pool scene (more Gable gam &amp; meaty Victor Mature in spandex), the real killer is revealed and Betty &amp;Vic find true love. The end. Since this movie had a murder in it, by todays criteria, it is called noir. I call it a pretty good murder mystery. Sure, it's contrived but it's very well produced/ directed so worth a view. I can't recall any scene where someone wakes up screaming or anyone remarking the had, so I guess the title was a marketing ploy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Noir, Goofy Title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Wake Up Screaming" is a prototype noir, produced in 1941. Hollywood refined the genre over the next several years, adding layers of menace and edginess and coming up with gems like "Out Of The Past" and "Raw Deal". This film was a good start, but was laden down with lightweight acting talent like Betty Grable, Carole Landis and Victor Mature. But they got the supporting cast right with frightened-little-man nonpareil Elisha Cooke, Jr. and creepy Laird Cregar.The picture is further hobbled by the second-worst Hollywood movie title ever, right after "Kiss The Blood Off My Hands"(1948), since no one wakes up screaming and makes the picture sound like a cheap horror movie. In fact, it is a good, tight, well-written murder mystery with several suspects to choose from and a riveting performance by the aforementioned Cregar. I felt Betty Grable lacked gravitas for noir roles and that Victor Mature was just passable, although this was one of his earliest roles. He is reunited with non-actress Carole Landis, his co-star in "One Million BC" (1940).Get past the title and watch it if you get the chance, and ponder what might have been with a better cast and some atmospheric, noir-type music ("Over The Rainbow"???). Everything else you could ask for is there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When will New Yorkers fit deadlocks to their apartments?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no comments on the plot as they are adequately covered above.However I rated this film only 5/10 and cannot endorse the critical acclaim others seem to bestow on it.I found it so-so just average with a second division cast.A common farcical device (which still persists today) is a scene in a film when an unbidden character suddenly appears in the middle of someone else's apartment as if they could walk through walls and doors.There were several instances of this irritating device in this film.I like social realism in film noirs, New York must have been one of the most unsafe cities if this is the level of protection inhabitants enjoyed in 1941.Proper door security on doors should include a good quality deadlock &amp; sliding bolt &amp; chain (not just the retractable latch key type lock which can sometimes be overridden by a credit card).Characters in this film seemed to be entering each others apartments at will!! Also why did the accused not call legal counsel as the police would not have dared to use such rough interrogation techniques.Of course anyone with commonsense knew who the real culprit was long before the denouement.Today officers of the law would find themselves on a charge of legal harassment if they pursued &amp; questioned suspects in the rough manner portrayed.One character I could not take my eyes off was Alan Mowbray who played the "ham" actor.I can only see &amp; remember him as "Sir William Hamilton" British ambassador to the kingdom of Naples in Napoleonic times in "That Hamilton Woman" also 1941, which starred Vivien Leigh/Laurence Olivier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I had the least bit of positivity I could throw in this movie's direction...but...alas, I do not. This is what I call a "heartbreaking noir," because that's what it does - it breaks your noir-loving heart, and into tiny pieces at that.In a nutshell, I'd put it this way: first of all, this is no film noir. This is the category known as gangster (where you'll find White Heat and Public Enemy and The Roaring Twenties, for example), so shame on Fox for utterly mislabeling this. (And a single noir-redolent shot, thrown in as if somebody said, "Hey, this'll be cool!" sure doesn't count.) Second, the story is idiot hokum of the lowest order, shamelessly imbecilic and easy/pointless to figure out (and if I'm saying that, a person who rarely figures out that X is the murderer before the final frame, then we're talking radical hokum for sure...I figured out X was the murderer before 20 minutes was up). It just doesn't hold your interest, no matter how high your disbelief is suspended. Third, the title is miles beyond misnomer, it's just plain unhinged, it's as if some studio suit absolutely insisted I Wake Up Screaming be the title, or it was originally a monster movie and every last monster scene was cut out. (Which may be true, given a Frankenstein line Carole Landis utters.) Fourth...oh forget fourth. It's just bad, bad, bad, all day long, and understand, I'm a film-noir fanatic. But I guess that's the thing - I take these films damn seriously; they have to at least be minutely engaging, you know?Sometimes you luck out, you score a noir that's not super-great as a movie but it doesn't matter, the joys far outweigh the sorrows. This is not one of those films. In fact, I'd call this contemptuous on every level, crap from 1941 that's no different from crap in 2006, except for the heartbreak. This ain't no Somewhere in the Night, an imperfect film that's thoroughly joyful nonetheless, saturated as it is with exquisite film-noirisms. I'd say stay away from this unless you're a hardcore Victor Mature/Betty Grable fan or old movies, no matter their quality, are narcotics for you.Hope I wasn't too hard on it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>giving it a 1 cause the rating's too high! and besides...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and besides it IS pretty much "awful" as 1 is supposed to indicate maybe it might get another star for the fact that they put Victor at the swimming' hole at what midnight or something... which is quite a stretch at least they realized that as groucho said, the man's breasts were bigger than the lady's. anyway his hotness'es hotness is about all in the in this venture, along with the always welcome Laird Cregar, always welcome LC! Watching this also I could only think how could Carole Landis give up the ghost fo Rex darned Harrison?? Life is strange isn't it? There's no justice, is there?</fullReview>
