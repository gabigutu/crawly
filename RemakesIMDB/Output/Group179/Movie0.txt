		<fullReview>John Linden ( Marc MacDermott ) deserts his wife and daughter and goes west accompanied by another woman, Jessie Walton ( Regina Connelly ), whom he leaves after the birth of their daughter. He goes to South Africa and there finds wealth. Meanwhile, both mothers die, leaving the daughters, Nancy and Jessie ( Gladys Hulette ), who closely resemble each other, to fend separately for themselves. Nancy grows up and marries a fisherman; Jessie becomes a streetwalker. Linden tries to send money to Nancy, but it is intercepted by his lawyer, Mark Lezzard ( Frank Campeau ). Linden returns to America and is reunited with his daughters after a heroic rescue of Jessie from a sinking boat by Nancy's husband.This 1923 melodrama was based on the play Hoodman Blind by Henry Arthur Jones and Wilson Barrett, produced by the Fox Film Corporation, directed by John Ford and starred Gladys Hulette. Tragically, Hoodman Blind remains a lost silent film.</fullReview>
