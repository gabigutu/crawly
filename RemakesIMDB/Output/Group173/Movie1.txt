		<shortDescription>Heart-stirring performance reveals Mae Clarke to have been an exceptional actress!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sensational 1931 pre-code classic is the first of three films based on the play by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Robert E. Sherwood, who felt the film had improved on his play. Carl Laemmle, Jr. (charge of production since 1929), son of Carl Laemmle (founder of Universal Pictures), bought the rights to Waterloo Bridge in early 1931 and initially felt none of the director's under contract with Universal could pull off a film adaptation of the play. However, he had seen the little-known film based on a play (by playwright R.C. Sheriff) entitled, Journey's End (1930), which featured a volatile setting and theme of World War I. It was the first film directed by the then relatively unknown James Whale, who had directed the play in New York and London as well. He was hired by Laemmle to direct Waterloo Bridge, however, Whale found himself uncertain about the original screenplay, which he demanded for a new screenwriter. Benn W. Levy and Tom Reed wrote a new screenplay, bringing the story back to a drama film (instead of a war movie). With Universal having serious difficulties financially, Laemmle reportedly gave Whale an insignificant budget of $250,000 and only 26-day's to shoot the film.Rose Hobart (a Universal contract player) had been originally given the part of Myra Deauville (a chorus girl), but when she discovered that the studio was not renewing her contract, she regrettably refused to do the film. Whale chose then Columbia contract player Mae Clarke to replace Hobart. (Laemmle agreed to cast Clarke from her recent popularity in The Public Enemy.) Her co-star would be Douglass Montgomery (appearing as Kent Douglass) as the roll of Roy Cronin (an American soldier under Royal Canadian Forces). Even though they were filming on a tight schedule, with Montgomery being heavily inexperienced, Whale would take three days out of production just to work with him. The film also features a 23-year old Bette Davis in a small roll as Cronin's sister Janet. It would be Davis' third and final film with Universal before signing a seven-year deal with Warner Bros.Waterloo Bridge opens with a fantastic shot of a stage show and the individual shots of the chorines are brilliant, with each looking smutty and profane. Afterwards, Myra backstage (singers and dancers making lots of noise in their underwear) saids goodbye to her gig as a chorus girl. (Myra becomes stranded in England after her show closes at the beginning of World War I.) A couple of years past, Myra is on the streets selling her body to the soldiers who spill out from the Waterloo Station. During an air raid in London, Roy meets Myra, and falls in love with her, unaware she is a prostitute. Montgomery's Roy is a handsome blonde but in many ways is clueless. He's certainly a likable heartfelt young man who is much too dull to identify a prostitute when he sees one. Clarke plays Myra as a intelligent woman, but frightened, secretly unhappy, and susceptible to outbursts. Really, Clarke amazingly complies Myra's conflicted emotions and impulses in a courageous portrayal of a woman horribly suffering. She believes herself to be nothing but trash and she's wrong - just as Roy's mother Mrs. Mary Cronin Wetherby (Enid Bennett) believes herself to be a fine woman.Whale's direction was truly incredible, as he added a delicate mixture of realism and impressionism, but what makes Waterloo Bridge is Clarke's astonishing performance and the very real chemistry between her and co-star Montgomery (Whale stages the dialogue with great sophistication and slyness). Clarke will always be remembered as the wife (Elizabeth) of Dr. Henry Frankenstein in the 1931 Frankenstein (also directed by Whale) and for the girl that received half a grapefruit in the face by James Cagney in The Public Enemy (1931). However, in Waterloo Bridge, she proves to be more than just that, as she gives a striking performance that even two-time Academy Award winner Vivien Leigh herself couldn't come close to matching in the restrained 1940 remake. Of course, she was never a staple name like Leigh, however, she is simply a pleasure to watch as the main character - without question the finest performance of her unfortunate career. James Whale's 1931 Waterloo Bridge is vastly superior to the 1940 remake, as well as, the 1956 remake Gaby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This version is better than each of its two remakes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always wanted to see this film and was delighted to find that it was "found" in the 1970's after it was considered to be lost. It took a few more decades for me to actually see it, though (TCM shows it). What a great version of "Waterloo Bridge" this is! I grew up on the Leigh-Taylor version and have recently seen the later Caron-Kerr remake "Gaby". Both are okay, but not as good as the original, which remains the most faithful to the play upon which it based. The additions of the hero's family and their country estate and Myra's death (in the play her fate is left uncertain) were added by the screenplay writer. I can see why Universal Pictures needed to expand the play which has only two sets (a section of Waterloo Bridge and Myra's shabby furnished room). Mae Clarke and Kent Douglass are well cast in the leads and of course, this version gives us the opportunity to see the great Bette Davis in one of her early screen roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mae Clarke took my breath away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Mae Clarke being carried away by Frankenstein and getting a grapefruit in the face by James Cagney, I had a clear image of her but not of her talent.I agree with the other reviewers that this is one knock-out performance. At a time when many actors in early talkies were still being very stagey (with stilted manners and playing to the back row), Mae Clarke built a performance that was modern and genuine.The whole production is good (especially Arthur Edeson's cinematography and James Whale's direction), but Clarke's acting is what I'll always remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mae Clarke Steals the Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really excellent pre-code film, set in wartime London where an ex-chorus girl/current street walker (played by Mae Clarke) heads over to Waterloo Bridge to try and find herself a soldier on leave, and she meets wealthy, baby-faced, nineteen-year-old raw/green Roy and invites him up to her flat. He immediately falls in love and thinks she's a "good girl", unaware of her real walk of life. She falls for him too, but keeps putting him off, racked with guilt over her secret "career". Meanwhile he keeps pressing on, sneaking in her window, tricking her into meeting his family for a weekend of tennis, tea, and cocktails, asking her to marry him, etc. - he's completely smitten!Top-notch acting and a good deal of chemistry between the two leads helps make this a really interesting, absorbing film. Their conversations together come across as quite realistic, and the performance given here by Mae Clarke is amazing - extremely well-done and memorable. I also enjoyed seeing a very young Bette Davis who appears here in a very small role as Roy's sister. Only one thing that bothered me about this film is, why oh why, as I have often seen done in period films made during this time, do they have the actresses appearing in modern, early 30s dresses, rather than period costume? Oh well, still a really first-rate film, well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mae Clarke gives a ferocious performance as a prostitute .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mae Clarke is a revelation as a prostitute in the original "Waterloo Bridge". The film was eclipsed by the 1940 remake starring Vivian Leigh and until recently this earlier version was unavailable. This pre-code version holds up beautifully and is better in many ways because of its frankness and because of Mae Clarke's ferocious performance. Kent Douglas plays the 19 year old soldier who falls in love with the prostitute, not realizing her true profession.The movie seems more realistic than the remake because, Douglas looks and acts like a callow 19 year old,and Clarke is very believable as the prostitute who tries to protect her soldier lover from the truth about herself. Neither Clarke nor Douglas became major stars and you can see that they lack the larger than life glamour of Vivian Leigh and Robert Taylor who starred in the remake.However, Clarke and Douglas add a touch of realism which was a hallmark of many of the pre-code movies and which wouldn't be found in American movies in abundance until the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mae Clarke is superb in James Whale's wonderful production of Sherwood's acclaimed play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought I would enjoy this production of "Waterloo Bridge" more than the 1940 remake with Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh. For one thing, this version is a straight narrative which is more suspenseful than the flashback construction of the remake. Secondly, Kent Douglass has that boyish quality which makes his naiveté much more believable than Robert Taylor's. And finally, the pacing and casting of the supporting actors by James Whale couldn't be beat. Ethel Griffies, as the heartless landlady, Enid Bennett, as Douglass' sympathetic but forceful mother, and Doris Lloyd, Clarke's practical but unfeeling prostitute friend, were all standouts. I had never seen Mae Clarke in such a strong dramatic role, which she handles more beautifully than I ever thought she could, conveying her anguish at loving a man but being ashamed of having become a prostitute. And, of course, there is Bette Davis in a small inconsequential role very early in her career; she was still a pleasure to watch. By all means, see this film! You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real acting, real characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often one sees a film of this era with as much straightforward, realistic acting and characterization. It's not perfect in that regard, of course, and there's still a bit of the silent era heavy makeup and staging, but the honest and unstylized delivery of actor after actor is astonishing.Although Mae Clarke's performance as Myra is justifiably lauded, Kent Douglass's (his screen name here) clean, fluid, unexaggerated portray is a delight to watch (in spite of the aforementioned eye makeup). Both Frederick Kerr and Enid Bennett as Roy's step-father and mother are priceless. The scenes between Mary, Roy's mother, and Mae are especially satisfying for their unassuming honesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hidden by a glitzier classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turner Classic Film network was showing several "before the Hays Code" films from the 1930s last night, and I was able to watch this 1931 version of the Robert Sherwood play WATERLOO BRIDGE. Actually this version is closer to the original, written with the background of World War I in mind, than the classic 1940 Robert Taylor - Vivian Leigh version. But the latter has gotten exactly that status - it is a "classic" film, because Leigh was the star of the horizon at that moment in 1940. She just won the Oscar for Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND, and this gave the studio the impetus to pull out the stops. Top notch cast and director, as well as better film productions assets. Ironically, looking at the cast for the 1931 film, it suffers. Yes it is by James Whale...but his best recalled films are FRANKENSTEIN, THE INVISIBLE MAN, and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN - hardly love stories. He did do the 1936 SHOWBOAT, but that seems an accident to his career. Such is the damage a good reputation can sometimes do to fully appreciate everything that the person did to earn his or her reputation.The stars of this are Douglas Montgomery (here named Kent Douglas) and Mae Clarke. Mae is immortal for one moment on film. In the middle of an argument over breakfast with her bored boyfriend Jimmy Cagney (in PUBLIC ENEMY) he pushes a grapefruit into her face! She was a fine actress, but hardly of star quality. As for Montgomery, he was an above capable performer too, but his smooth, blond, bland features did not go very far. I suppose his best known part was in Katherine Hepburn's LITTLE WOMEN as "Laurie" the boy in the house next door who falls for Jo. I feel his best performance is in the 1935 MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD. He also played Stephen Foster (whom he resembled a little) in the forgotten early biography MELODY LANE.Two other performers in the cast are worth noting. One is old Frederick Kerr, here playing Montgomery's step-father, a doctor and major in the British Army, who spends most of the film in the countryside, enjoying his fine old port and going through one of those "What...what" characters, which were supposed to represent the kindly old, eccentric British upper classes. He played a similar role (albeit as a German) as Baron Frankenstein (Colin Clive's father) in FRANKENSTEIN, so I take it Whale liked his screen personae. The other, ironically, is Bette Davis. She is Montgomery's sister, and (aside from shouting into her deaf step-father's ear to repeat what he claims he did not hear) she has little to do. It was her third film. Davis later said (in her partial autobiography MOTHER GODDAMN) that she would have loved to play Myra. She did - more memorably - as Mildred, the waitress turned prostitute in OF HUMAN BONDAGE.Actually Clarke is very appealing as Myra. At the start of the film she is shown on the closing night of a West End Musical (she was in the chorus), and Whale is clever enough to show her yawning at one point (it does add to the realism of that moment). In the remake, Leigh was a promising ballerina whose romance with young Taylor causes her teacher (Maria Ouspenskaya) to throw her out of the troupe. The idea of chorus girls apparently was not classy enough for Leigh's screen personae in 1940. Myra can't find another show to get into (it's wartime, and there have been cut-backs in productions). Ironically, she tells her friend Kitty (Doris Lloyd) she could have been in the chorus of CHIN CHIN CHOW but chose the other show. It's like having the chance to do HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS, but opting for MR. PRESIDENT. CHIN CHIN CHOW set a West End record in the late teens and early 1920s.Because she can't get back into a show Myra - facing financial necessity - turns to prostitution. She is at Waterloo Bridge when she meets Montgomery during a zeppelin air raid (Waterloo Bridge is a favorite spot to pick up "Johns"). The two of them end up going to her apartment by taxicab (shades of Eliza Doolittle there). And they fall into love over a dinner of fish and chips. But Myra can't bring herself to confess what she does for a living - Montgomery is a naive American whose mother married an English country doctor. He does not have any idea about whores. Myra is somewhat older, and she too is American (her parents were two alcoholics in East St. Louis, which is also the area Barbara Stanwyck comes from in the next film BABY FACE). She's more aware of the uglier side of life.Myra's moment of realization that she can't marry Montgomery is when she visits his mother, step-father, and sister in the country. His mother (Enid Bennett) gently explains that she would not be fit for Montgomery. Bennett does not push Clarke away (and she does apparently sympathize with her), but she brings Clarke back to that reality that she tried to avoid. Clarke flees back to London, but Montgomery follows. Myra can't bring telling him. Instead it is her landlady (Ethel Griffes) in a moment of self-interest who reveals the truth - and gets Montgomery's best moment of reaction in the film in her face as a result.There is an element of melancholy in this that Whale succeeded in maintaining to the end and then some. I won't ruin the end of the film, but suffice it to say the love is as doomed as a flowering plant that is transplanted to a desert. It is a worthy film - not up to the later film's production and star quality - but well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waterloo Bridge- The Original-Gritty and Forceful ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mae Clarke does a remarkable job in the same year that James Cagney put a grapefruit in her face in "Public Enemy." Miss Clarke is quite effective as the heroine of "Waterloo Bridge."As a prostitute working the streets of London during World War 1, Clarke gives a tour de force as a woman who can be loving one moment and difficult to handle in the next.The story deals also with class warfare when during an air-raid, Clarke meets a wealthy Canadian serving in the British army. He falls for her and she loves him but she knows that their differences would prevent them from true happiness. Brought to his country estate, his kindly mother, played by a charming Enid Bennett, warns against such a liaison. Fred Kerr, as his step-father, provides comic relief as a deaf elderly British officer.One weak link in this film is Kent Douglass, who portrays the young man. Naive and kind, the chemistry is really not there between himself and Miss Clarke. He is only effective briefly in a scene with veteran actress Ethel Griffies, who portrays a greedy, conniving landlady.The film has worn well through the many years and is worth seeing due to Miss Clarke's excellent performance. Am sure that Vivien Leigh and Leslie Caron, who both starred in the remakes, learned a lot from Miss Clarke. Look for Bette Davis as Douglass's sister. This was her first film and it is interesting to see how she evolved into the great talent that she was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to apologize for my bad English, but I hope the text can be understood nevertheless.I think that this is a great movie. It appears astonishingly modern. What I appreciated most is, that the story is not about a conflict between bad and good characters. Rather it's about the inner conflict of Myra, who hates herself, so she can't accept the love of another man. The mirror scene, when she puts on her make up before she walks the streets, is amazing in that respect. In the mirror we see her on one hand through the look of the others, of her 'clients' (as well of us, the spectators), who see in her (only) the prostitute. On the other hand it is also her own look at that part of herself, which she hates. So one could say, that she sees herself through the others. (I like this 'lacanian' logic though it may seem presumptuous).As well the final scene, where they kiss while in the background London is bombarded by a zeppelin, is great. There seems to be a relation between the war and the strange love affair, which is only possible in a world which is out of control.The second thing I noticed was, that there are many long shots and just a few close ups. So it has an incredibly realistic look. It reminded me somehow of the films by Ingmar Bergmann, who (as far as I remember) also tried to explore the torn subject.The ending is erratic. Why is she killed? Is it a punishment from god? For me it seems a bit like it, because we see in the last scene the fur again, which Myra had received from a 'client' in the first scene. So it could be read as a symbol for her greed or her morally wrong decision (leaving the theater), that led her astray. But her death could be also read as a 'carpe diem' motif, which points again at the war, that confronts the human being with the possibility of a sudden, unexpected, unjustified death by accident.It is exactly this (moral) ambiguity, which makes this a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The version of 'Waterloo Bridge' from 1940, with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, has always been a favourite, so I welcomed the chance to finally see the earlier take with Mae Clarke and Kent Douglass.Similar in some ways to the remake, the 1931 version is a lot grittier and more direct. It is clear what Myra's job is right from the start, and Clarke looks the part. You never could really imagine Vivien Leigh street-walking.As Roy the Canadian soldier home on leave, Kent Douglass is a little stiff and reserved, but he puts across well the desperation of a man in love, no matter what. It's an old story, but done well here.Despite a few histrionics and a relatively short running time, this film is entertaining (an old woman loses potatoes in an air raid and won't move off the bridge without them), and poignant (Myra feels at home at last with Roy's country folks, but we know it won't last).It can be found on the DVD set 'Forbidden Hollywood, volume 1'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Waterloo Bridge (1931)An amazing movie. Set in London during World War I, directed by the man who directed the original (and also amazing) Frankenstein, and with photography by the less known but first rate Arthur Edeson (Frankenstein, yes, but also Casablanca, no less). And throw in an astonishing actress, Mae Clarke, and you can see why it doesn't falter. She plays a struggling chorus girl and prostitute with snappy, lively believability. The lead male, Douglass Montgomery, playing a sweet hearted American soldier, is also a surprise face, totally charming, a perfect complement to Clarke. As characters, the young soldier's bright optimism brings out the best in the struggling but good hearted street girl.The story is fast, and not completely predictable, and has a blow-out of an ending, really nice. Though set in the teens it feels modern (maybe too modern, historically). I never knew that London had a kind of Blitz experience in WWI, just as they would a decade after this film was released, and looking it up I found the Germans used zeppelins over London in the first war much the same was as they did (with planes) in WWII--to demoralize the civilian population. It adds tense excitement to the film throughout, and to the last scenes in particular, even if it isn't completely realistic (for some reason people don't scramble for cover even as the bombs are being dropped, maybe to portray that stiff upper lip thing). Is this just a silly romance? No, no way, not when the two actors in it are so fresh and convincing, giving sparkling, nuanced performances miles away from the stiffness we associate with early sound films (or with many silent movies). This is a first rate and fast movie and honest, only 79 minutes long, with fully formed soundtrack and solid supporting cast (including a young Betty Davis, who is already confident and familiar as the sister of the leading man). The LeRoy remake of 1940 is a testimony to the strength of the story (and it is also really good). But if you want to see an early gem on its own terms, here it is. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WATERLOO BRIDGE (James Whale, 1931) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There&#x2019;s nothing particularly Pre-Code about this essentially dated &#x201c;woman&#x2019;s picture&#x201d; &#x2013; apart from the fact that the heroine is a prostitute (ironically, given the narrative&#x2019;s London setting, it did get censored on its U.K. release!). Unfortunately, the audio on Warners&#x2019; DVD (the second title I&#x2019;ve watched from their FORBIDDEN Hollywood COLLECTION VOL. 1) is rather low &#x2013; with dialogue that&#x2019;s even harder to make out through the thick British accents! Reportedly, Tom Reed&#x2019;s original draft had rendered Robert E. Sherwood&#x2019;s play virtually unrecognizable &#x2013; before trusted Whale scribe Benn W. Levy was roped in for a rewrite and chose to stick close to the source material. His one major addition is the central couple&#x2019;s visit to the young soldier&#x2019;s family estate, which provided some of the film&#x2019;s best moments; however, his original intention of utilizing the poster of the long-running musical &#x201c;Chu Chin Chow&#x201d; (eventually filmed in England in 1934 and recently issued in an intriguing &#x201c;Special Edition&#x201d; 3-Disc Set through VCI!) to delineate the progress in the heroine&#x2019;s fall from grace wasn&#x2019;t followed through. Given the film&#x2019;s theatrical origins and primitive technical quality (such as the obvious use of back-projection for the London backgrounds), it generally lacks the trademark Whale stylistics &#x2013; evident only in his inventive manipulation of studio sets and especially the tragic finale (filmed in an inspired overhead shot); actually, he was under pressure to bring in the picture quickly and cheaply, because Universal was virtually broke at the time.Though it goes without saying that I disagree with Michael Elliott&#x2019;s **** rating and his assertion that WATERLOO BRIDGE is superior to FRANKENSTEIN (1931), there&#x2019;s still a lot to admire here &#x2013; to begin with, a surprisingly excellent performance from leading lady Mae Clarke (a role for which Rose Hobart was originally slated). Clarke would be fairly stilted in Whale&#x2019;s next film, FRANKENSTEIN &#x2013; but, that same year, also saw her famously on the receiving end of James Cagney&#x2019;s grapefruit in THE PUBLIC ENEMY (1931)! A very young but believable Douglass Montgomery (billed as Kent Douglass) is effective, both as the love-struck soldier and when he rages in front of Clarke&#x2019;s tactless landlady for daring to insult her. However, his inexperience put further strain on Whale&#x2019;s tight shooting schedule and the actor had to be extensively rehearsed.The supporting cast is equally good: Doris Lloyd as Clarke&#x2019;s lively companion, Ethel Griffies as the nagging landlady (a role she recreated for the 1940 MGM version!), Enid Bennett as Douglas&#x2019; surprisingly understanding mother (the actress had been Maid Marian to Douglas Fairbanks&#x2019; ROBIN HOOD [1922] in the Silent spectacular), Frederick Kerr as his endearingly doddering stepfather (he would virtually reprise his role wholesale for FRANKENSTEIN!) &#x2013; plus a nice early role for Bette Davis as Douglass&#x2019; sister, who cheekily dotes on the slightly-deaf Kerr. The crew is practically identical to the one that would soon after work on FRANKENSTEIN &#x2013; and which seems to me to have been shot on some of the very same sets! I&#x2019;ve watched the glossy remake several years back but don&#x2019;t recall it enough to compare &#x2013; except that I know it was considerably bowdlerized: if I&#x2019;m not mistaken, in the later version, the heroine is a ballerina who only turns to prostitution when the soldier goes back to war and his family subsequently shun her! By the way, this is the sixth non-horror Whale film that I&#x2019;ve watched &#x2013; which brings me to a total of ten; therefore, I&#x2019;m still half-way through his filmography...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Change will do you good"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The coming of sound to Hollywood was such a mighty upheaval as far as the mechanics of filmmaking went, that those years from 1928 to 1931 were in many ways a testing ground for new approaches, and a trial for directors. Of those that succeeded, there were old pros like Michael Curtiz, Raoul Walsh, Ernst Lubitsch and John Ford who were able to make incredibly smooth transitions simply by weaving sound in as another layer in their existing technique. And then there were the newcomers from theatre backgrounds, people like George Cukor, Rouben Mamoulian and of course James Whale who were accustomed to directing dialogue but completely unused to the world of movies. Cukor and Mamoulian got off to shaky starts, and their earliest films are rather poor. Whale however seems to have had taken instantly to the talkie medium, picking up film grammar with ease and yet with the unique approach of the outsider.In Waterloo Bridge, Whale's second picture, we open with a sweeping tracking shot, reminiscent of those with which the afore-mentioned Mr Curtiz often opened his pictures both before and after the sound barrier. Whale isn't yet savvy enough to use this to key us into the setting and introduce ideas as Curtiz would, but his complex and vibrant arrangements show his understanding of the movement and unlimited scope of cinematic space, with a shot ironically inside a theatre! In dialogue scenes Whale has a distinct way of framing actors, often from the knees up with their heads very close to the top of the shot, which seems emphasise the height of the frame as being equal to the width. The camera is constantly moving round, often giving us 360-degree coverage of a location. It's as if Whale, freed from the limited proportions of the stage, is now striving to give us a sense of the "real world" spaces that motion pictures can take place in.Another great thing about Whale is that he makes very abrupt and effective changes in focus. Take the moment when Mae Clarke and Kent Douglass both realise that the other is American. Up until that point the whole scene had been in long mid-shots, with a lot of movement in the frame, but then we suddenly cut in to these bold close-ups with no intermediary ground, and the moment is given great weight as the point at which the couple "clicked". There's an even better example in the scene when Clarke and Montgomery get to know each other in her apartment. Again this is mostly in mid-shot, with the occasional head and shoulders shot. However, once Douglas has left and Clarke slips into character for her "night job", there is again this very jarring cut to a close-up, this time of Clarke in her dressing-table mirror. It's a sudden and very deliberate stepping from the carefree world of the courting couple to the very private space of Clarke and it makes the shift in tone at this point all the more palpable.The leading couple, Clarke and Douglass (later credited as Douglass Montgomery in pictures such as Little Women) were two of the many stars who were fairly noticeable in the early sound era, but would soon fade into obscurity for one reason or another. I have seen them both in a number of other roles, but never has either of them been as good. Clarke has a really natural feel for the dialogue, and shows great understatement with her near-deadpan facial expressions. Douglass too is very restrained, managing to give a believable portrait of Roy's naiveté, his one break into powerful emotions very credible. "Restraint" and "understatement" are not words that could be applied to the rest of the cast, who by and large are a delightful rogues gallery of hammy oddballs. We have some sharp-tongued cockneys like the potato woman and the landlady, played by Rita Carlisle and Ethel Griffies respectively, both of whom would roughly reprise their roles for the 1940 remake. Best of all however is Frederick Kerr in one of his unfortunately small number of film appearances, doing his typical blustering aristocrat act. Many of his curmudgeonly mutterings were no doubt written specifically for, if not by, Kerr himself. Players like these add spice to the production and give contrast to the subtlety and seriousness of the leads.Waterloo Bridge is one of those pictures that have been revived today by the magic wand of the "pre-code era" label. This tends to be a bit of a double-edged sword, because while on the one hand it allows for DVD releases of pictures that would otherwise be nigh-on impossible to see, it means they also tend to get remembered and analysed for their sauce and sass more than for anything else. But aside from the somewhat frank handling of prostitution that marks it as a product of its time, Waterloo Bridge is a fine, stirring drama, which thanks to the efforts of its cast and director has a sense of realism, immediacy and intimacy rarely seen in pictures of that age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mae Clarke is Unforgettable!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mae Clarke is right up at the top of the list of most under rated actresses. No matter how small the role or how over shadowed - her role in "Three Wise Girls" was put in the shade by Jean Harlow's bigger and flashier part, but Mae definitely gave the best, most poignant performance in the film. Did she ever give a bad performance??? Compared to the glossy, shallow 1940 remake, this 1931 version of "Waterloo Bridge" has an elegant simplicity. In the 1940 version, Vivien Leigh is a brilliant ballerina who only takes to prostitution when she thinks her Officer sweetheart has been killed, but in this earlier version Mae Clarke (except for a fleeting opening scene) is already a hardened prostitute, who tries to discourage soldier Roy from a relationship she knows will only end in disaster.Unfortunately, chorus girl Myra decides to try out for "The Bing Boys" instead of "Chu Chin Chow" and two years later "Chu Chin Chow" is still running and Myra is working as a prostitute. Walking along Waterloo Bridge, her usual haunt, she meets Roy (Kent Douglass) an impressionable soldier who helps her pick up an old woman's vegetables. He falls instantly in love with her and wants her to meet his parents but she is not so sure. They are very welcoming - Frederick Kerr is just so right as Roy's almost deaf step father and Bette Davis, in a very small role as Janet, is charming and effective. That evening Myra confesses her past to Roy's mother (Enid Bennett) and while she is sympathetic and admiring of Myra's honesty, agrees that she cannot marry Roy. Myra flees to London and by the time she and Roy are re-united , he knows about her past but doesn't care. She sends him back to the front with a promise of marriage, happy and secure, knowing she loves him, then as the camera pans away she walks right into an exploding bomb.James Whale more than confirmed his importance as a new major director. There are some wonderful scenes of powerful emotion and the outdoor scenes of the bridge in an air-raid with the search lights and hurrying people are pictorially beautiful. Mae Clarke has so many moments, a touching scene, where she picks up an Officer (Billy Bevan) then in a moment of conscience rejects him. Moments later, realising she has been rude to him and also that she needs the money - "I'm sorry Mister, I didn't mean it" but it is too late. Another scene - trying to discourage Roy, she laughs hysterically at him, all the while hiding her face in her arms. She was so outstanding that it makes you wonder why she wasn't given better parts. Almost matching her was Kent Douglass (soon to be Douglass Montgomery) - he was just heartbreaking as the innocent soldier who loves Myra, whatever her past. the scene where Mrs Hobley (Ethel Griffies) tells him the truth about Myra's occupation is extremely emotional but Douglass carries it off and makes you really believe in him.A word about "The Bing Boys" - it wasn't quite the dud the film made out. "The Bing Boys Are Here" were a series of revues that opened in 1916 with George Robey and Violet Lorraine. It introduced the song "If You Were the Only Girl in the World" and the production lasted 378 performances. There were two other revues - "The Bing Boys Are There" and "The Bing Boys on Broadway" - all in all the three revues clocked up over 1,000 performances. "The Bing Boys" and "Chu Chin Chow" were the two biggest musical hits of World War 1.Highly, Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful tragedy ***SPOILER***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, like other sound films of the time, is very stagy, with a slightly exaggerated acting style. But don't hold that against this great movie. The pacing is slow, but very natural.To the folks that keep wistfully comparing it to the 1940's version I have to say, these are really two different films. One is realistic tragedy, the other a tragic romance. There is so much awkward conflict in this film. Myra knows on every level that the relationship could never work in any situation. The scene with Myra and Roy's mother where she keeps saying "I -could- marry him, if I wanted to" is heartbreaking.I see the people who prefer the 1940's version as naive as Roy in their view of life. To them I say, "dance on a cloud".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stab at happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't prepared for how radically different this first film version of Waterloo Bridge was from the MGM version in 1940 that starred Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor. For one thing this was before the Code was in place and we could be a lot more frank.This version was a lot less romantic. Mae Clarke was an unapologetic street walker. She started out as an American chorus girl stranded in London during World War I when a lot of the theater closed. Now she's got to do what a girl's got to do to pay the rent. She picks up a most innocent Douglass Montgomery on Waterloo Bridge and it's his innocence that gets to her.Without going into detail she takes a stab at happiness, but after meeting his family she sees that she can never fit in. And if you've seen the more popular Leigh/Taylor version as Paul Harvey used to say you know the rest of the story.Waterloo Bridge was originally on Broadway in 1930 and ran for 64 performances, closed no doubt due to the Depression as many shows were. It starred Glenn Hunter and June Walker and I daresay this is probably close to the original stage version that Robert Sherwood wrote if not an exact transfer.Bette Davis had a small supporting role as Montgomery's sister in this film. Certainly Davis would have been outstanding in the lead, but I have no complaints with what Mae Clarke did with the role. Also outstanding is Ethel Griffies as Clarke's mercenary and realistic landlady who has no qualms about gentleman callers.If you like the classic MGM version, this original screen version from Universal is worth a look to contrast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine surprise in the talent of Mae Clarke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the story is so well known by some of the very good reviewers here, I am merely adding my surprise at the discovery of the talent of Mae Clarke. I had no idea she had done this original version and according to the collected IMDb data, Ms. Clarke was just 20 years old when she worked on this excellent adaptation of the play. There is no need to compare her performance to Vivien Leigh's later remake, because that film had no real grit and Clarke's performance was one of the best I have ever seen from a performer despite her youth. The film was shot soon after talkies began and her screen presence and non theatrical emoting was astonishingly on target. The director, Whale, must have had a good rapport because her scenes with all of the players came off honest and not a bit dated. I can see that Davis would have liked to play the part as someone mentioned, but she could not have done a better job. I just discovered it on the Turner channel and became so engrossed in Clarke's performance, I called people to get a copy and watch this actress' work. Quite remarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waterloo Bridge (1931, James Whale)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm pretty certain James Whale is one of my favorite directors. Potential pulp trash like "Frankenstein", "Bride of Frankenstein", and "The Old Dark House" were elevated to near-masterpieces (and in the case of the latter, a true masterpiece in my humble estimation) thanks to brilliant screenplays and Whale's wonderful, tasteful direction and sensibilities. "The Invisible Man" is still one of the best science fiction films ever made, and quite possibly the best Wells adaptation around, with the possible exception of "Island of Lost Souls". "Remember Last Night?" is a daring, hilarious, fascinating slice of unexpected social satire in the guise of a mystery-comedy, and remains woefully under-seen."Waterloo Bridge" is yet another immensely satisfying Whale film, and while (this being his second film) his technique is not at the same level as some of his later films, the film is still directed tastefully and often creatively, and is very well-shot as well. This was a pre-code film and hence I imagine is less sanitized than the 1940 Vivien Leigh/Robert Taylor version of the story. Mae Clarke is absolutely incredible here as a chorus girl-turned-prostitute who meets a naive 19 year old Canadian in wartime London. The writing is fantastic and the film, while melodramatic, is also subtle and tasteful in many regards. The humor (which is present in nearly all Whale films) is a lot of fun, and doesn't clash with the otherwise serious tone of the film."Waterloo Bridge" avoids the pitfalls of many melodramas by remaining a very human story about love at its core. The ending is really over-the-top, perhaps even a bit laughable, but it doesn't ruin what came before: a really great pre-code melodrama, and another exceptional film directed by James Whale. It's a good production (although the Waterloo Bridge set is not very convincing now, of course) with excellent direction, good cinematography, great writing, and a wonderful cast, especially the two leads Mae Clarke and Douglass Montgomery, but also the wonderful character actor Frederick Kerr in a smaller, more humorous role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Pre-Code Melodrama with a Gritty Mae Clarke Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is fairly typical of the pre-code genre and has only a fleeting similarity to the glamorous 1940 MGM version with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor. Directed by James Whale before he peaked with "Frankenstein" and "Showboat", this film is set in WWI London and stars the long-forgotten Mae Clarke, an actress best known for being the recipient of James Cagney's grapefruit attack in "The Public Enemy". She plays Myra, an American chorus girl who turns to prostitution when her show closes. Unlike Leigh's ethereal ballerina in the later film, Clarke's Myra is all bitterness with a shaft of hope in the form of an American soldier named Roy, whom she accidentally meets during an air raid. He comes from a wealthy family who find out about her profession, which leads to the inevitable consequences.Clarke is solid as Myra, though she does go overboard in her breakdown scene. Kent Douglass is rather wooden as Roy, though he certainly captures the soldier's callow nature. Done on the cheap by Universal and at only 81 minutes, it's an interesting and sometimes poignant curio thanks mostly to Whale's dexterity with melodrama. A freshly scrubbed, 23-year old Bette Davis shows up in the inconsequential role of Roy's sister.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early triumph for Whale, Clarke and Bette Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it's rather obscure (largely due to its remake), the original WATERLOO BRIDGE is worth seeking out as an early success for James Whale, Mae Clarke (perhaps her career high) and for a small but delightful bit part for Bette Davis. No doubt, the film betrays its stage origins, but Whale, working with two writers with whom he'd work again (Levy and Sherwood) opens the film up enough to bring the tragic WWI story to the screen. Whale was one who didn't let the bulky early sound equipment lock his camera down like so many others of the time. But, it's the acting which makes the film worth reviving. Clarke, in particular, is called upon to express a range of emotions that would be daunting for any actress and she pulls it off in her relationship with a young soldier (Douglass Montgomery). Davis and Enid Bennett (as a compassionate mother) are fine, but Frederick Kerr steals the show amongst the supporting cast. Kerr, foreshadowing his Herr Frankenstein role in Whale's FRANKENSTEIN, is amusing as the young soldier's doddering Major father. The film's tragic ending is not so much out of left field, as it seems to be rushed. Too bad, because the tearful last exchange between Clarke and Montgomery is staged with remarkable truth and feeling. Hopefully, Universal will be persuaded to put the film out on DVD (perhaps on a double disc with its remake), so that it can be more widely seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two Americans fall in love in WWI London in this first film adaptation of the play by Robert Sherwood. Mae Clarke plays a chorus girl who turns to prostitution when she's unable to find work. During an air raid, she meets soldier Douglass Montgomery and the two take a liking to each other. She agonizes over whether or not to pursue the relationship with the innocent young man who has no idea what she does for a living.A wonderful Pre-Code tearjerker with Mae Clarke giving her finest performance (from any movie of hers I've seen, at least). Wonderful direction from James Whale, as well. He certainly made good use of the limited budget Universal gave him. Love the sets, especially the apartment building rooftop and the bridge. Whale and Clarke would reunite that same year on a little movie you might've heard of called Frankenstein. The actor who played Baron Frankenstein in that picture, Frederick Kerr, also appears in this one. Leading man Douglass Montgomery (billed here as Kent Douglass) is largely forgotten today but does a fantastic job in a role he reportedly struggled with so much Whale had to shut down production for three days. You wouldn't know it from watching, though, as his acting is so natural and believable. The biggest name in the cast, Bette Davis, appears in a small role as Montgomery's sister. This was just her third movie.This was remade a couple of times, most notably at MGM in 1940 with Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh. That version is more famous than this one and I enjoy it a lot. Both are great films for very different reasons. The remake is a glossy tragic romance and this one's more gritty and character driven. The romance in this one is, in some ways, more believable than in the later film. I also enjoy the ending to this one more. Both movies end sadly but this one isn't quite as contrived. This is a real winner with some wonderful acting and directing. If you've seen the Taylor/Leigh film, you should give this one a look. It's very interesting to see the same story told in two different but effective ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mae Clarke Walks the Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In London, American chorus girl Mae Clarke (as Myra Deauville) enjoys a short career on stage. The Great War (aka World War I) arrives and times get tough for Ms. Clarke. Unemployed but attractive, she drifts into prostitution. After becoming a regular streetwalker, Clarke goes out to score a trick on "Waterloo Bridge" and meets naive 19-year-old Royal Canadian soldier Douglass Montgomery (as Roy Cronin). He and Clarke help and old woman pick up her scattered vegetables, during an air raid. Thinking Clarke is a proper young woman, Mr. Montgomery walks her home. Clarke and Montgomery are mutually attracted, but she worries about her sordid occupation..."Waterloo Bridge" featured a very familiar theme, for the time. Again, the "fallen women" suffers through a doomed romance. This character type was played by most of the era's big-name actresses, and Mae Clarke does an excellent, herein...Prostitutes, historical figures and alcoholics were the parts to play if you wanted to be an actress of note. Of course, the sexually active unmarried woman must be punished in the end. Unlike several of her street-walking contemporaries, Clarke did not reach super-stardom. Montgomery asserts himself well. As was common during the transition to sound, he is made to wear too much eye make-up. Of the other players, landlady Ethel Griffies gets the third best part. She and Rita Carlyle (the old woman with potatoes) were still around for the next "Waterloo Bridge" (1940). Although it wasn't so at the time, the biggest name in the cast is Bette Davis (as Janet), playing Montgomery's socialite sister.******* Waterloo Bridge (9/4/31) James Whale ~ Mae Clarke, Douglass Montgomery, Ethel Griffies, Bette Davis</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This takes place during WW1. Soldier Roy (Kent Douglass) meets and falls in love with Myra (Mae Clarke). She tells him she's a chorus girl but she's actually a prostitute. She falls in love with him too but is racked with guilt over lying to him. It all leads to a predictable (but moving) tragic ending.Excellent drama based on a play. It was remade in 1940 but that version was toned down to appease the Production Code. This version is uncut and (for its time) pretty raw. It was made with top production values and beautifully directed by James Whale. Douglass is very good as Roy (if a little overly naive) but Clarke is excellent as Myra. Her pain and agony comes through in every scene. More surprising is that some members of Roy's family figures out what she does--and could care less. The ending is somewhat predictable but damned if it didn't have me crying. Also is has a young Bette Davis in a supporting role! Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overlooked and Covered Up by an Anemic 1940 Remake, this is a Great Early Sound Film from Director James Whale from a Play by the Popular Robert Sherwood. There are Things Found in this Movie that are Atypical of Early Sound. The Dialog is Never Hesitant and Flows with a Natural Cadence and is Totally Believable.That can be Attributed to Whale's Expertise with Dialog and His Stage Experience. Secondly, the Look of the Movie has a Gloss and Sharpness that Many Early Thirties Hollywood Projects Lacked. Germany was much better at that and Hollywood Benefited Greatly as the Filmmakers from that Country Immigrated because of the Rise of Hitler.Mae Clarke is Mesmerizing in the Role and Unforgettable. Her Co-Star the Handsome, Young and Blonde Douglas Montgomery Cannot to be Ignored Either. He was a Perfect Counterpoint as a Complete Opposite of the Woman He Loves. He is Rich and Naive, She is Poor and Wordly. She is Noble, Trying at First to Deflect His Advances and Her's is the Tragedy that is Witnessed. His is Off Screen.There are Numerous Poignant and Dramatic Scenes and there is Pre-Code Skin and Mae Clark is "Employed" in the Oldest Profession that is more than just Hinted at. Her Scenes with the Mother are so Real and Revealing as to be Heartbreaking. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say first that I did not like the ending of this film. It is a product of its time that, by today's standards, is unnecessary.In World War I, during an air raid, a young couple meet by accident on Waterloo Bridge. Myra used to be a chorus girl, but now survives by the attentions of men. Her plight seems a reasonable representation of the unfortunate circumstances that befall some single women during wartime. Roy is an idealistic and na?ve soldier who, without understanding her station in life, falls rather quickly for her. Myra tries to protect Roy from his own feelings, believing she is not worthy of his love. He is persistent until it becomes impossible for Myra to avoid his intentions.Myra is played by Mae Clarke in a consistently good acting job. Her performance feels more modern than the rest of the cast's. I felt her hairdo was also modern for its time, perhaps contributing to the overall effect.Bette Davis plays a very minor role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a shadow over this bridge, and it is the spirit of its future remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the early days of talkies, abridged version of classic novels and plays made it to the screen at an alarming rate, from classics like "Jane Eyre", "The Scarlet Letter" and "Oliver Twist" to this, the film version of Robert Sherwood's play. Many of them are dismissed because of their cheap production values (made at poverty row studios) and because of their more elaborate remakes. In the cast of the original "Waterloo Bridge", the original is actually pretty good, and remains an obscure gem because of its director, the artistically brilliant James Whale.Mae Clarke, "the grapefruit girl", is believable as the troubled Myra, the former chorus girl who becomes a prostitute before falling in love with a soldier from a fine family. She certainly not as glamorous as Vivien Leigh who played the role in MGM's much more lavishly produced 1941 remake. The fact that she's less than a picture perfect beauty suits the part well and she comes off successfully in her favor. Douglass Montgomery (billed as Kent Douglas) is a winning handsome hero, while Enid Bennett as his mother, a very young Bette Davis as his supportive sister and Frederick Kerr as his alcoholic uncle offer fine support. Nicely photographed and edited simply to get to the point of the basic structure of the plot, this might not please purists, but for depression era audiences, it must have been a thrill. It certainly still can leave a lump in your throat as the tragic conclusion approaches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having watched director James Whale's interesting follow-up to All Quiet on the Western Front called The Road Back, (which sadly suffered from lots of 'troubles' from the studio)I decided that my next Whale title would be one included in a Pre-Code DVD boxset that my dad had picked up a while ago.Originally planning to watch the film after viewing a number of titles for a poll being held on IMDb's Classic Film board for the best movies of 1973,I found that I had to change my plans rather quickly,when my dad revealed that he had just sold the boxset on Amazon UK!,which led to me quickly grabbing my ticket to Waterloo station.The plot:WWI:London-Arriving in London from the US,Myra Deauville decides that she is going to become a chorus girl in a popular London nightclub,in the hope that she will make all of the money that she ever needs.Despite doing very well at being a chorus girl,Deauville discovers to her horror that the level of her income is that low,that she is at serious risk of being thrown out of her residence.Talking about her money troubles with a fellow chorus girl,Myra is told that she may be able to make all of the cash that she needs,by living her chorus girl life behind,and instead becoming a prostitute.Feeling that she has no other options which will allow her to make enough money to keep a roof over her head,Deauville decides to become a prostitute.Searching round for a location where she will be able to get plenty of customers,Myra decides to walk on Waterloo street,due to it being the first road that returning solider's walk down.Waiting round for customer's,air raid siren's are suddenly heard,which leads to Deauville rushing home.Heading home,Myra notices a woman who is struggling to pick up some food items that she has dropped,which leads to Deauville rushing over to help the woman out.As Myra helps the woman to pick up the last items,a US solider called Roy Cronin rushes over to tell the women that they need to get back to their homes due to their being a raid on.Rushing back to her home with Roy,Deauville finds herself taken by Cronin,and decides that she will keep her reason for being at Waterloo Bridge hidden under a bridge.View on the film:For the final title that he would make before entering his most successful era, (which kicked off after this movie came $50,000 under budget,and Universal asked if there was any project that he would like to do,which led to an adaptation of a novel called Frankenstein being chosen)co-editor/ (along with Clarence Kolster)directing auteur James Whale shows a tremendous determination to burn the films stage origins down,thanks to Whale's closely working with cinematography Arthur Edeson and using long,impressively complex tracking shots to show the seedy life that Myra has inadvertently confined herself to.Along with showing the grim,seedy side to Deauville's location,Whale also places to of his main personal themes at the centre of the title,with Whale using long corridor shots to show that Cronini's family is surrounded by upper-class wealth which Deauville finds herself feeling ill-fitting towards.Keeping it as a subtle undertone,Whale's (who was a POW in WWI) gives hints that happy go lucky Roy Cronini is actually suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.Bringing Robert E.Sherwood's play to the big screen,writers Benn W. Levy and Tom Reed show a surprising amount of sensitivity in their layers of character building for Myra,with Reed and Levy making sure that the tough situation's which have led Deauville down this path are always at the front of the film.Painting a detailed picture of Deauville,Levy and Reed stay away from letting the movie fall into any melodrama trappings,by instead allowing for the film to gather a raw intensity,as Deauville discovers that she is mostly wrong over how people will perceive Myra over her 'working life',and Reed and Levy reveal that they are not afraid to give their characters a knock-out punch,as the movie ends on a brilliantly bleak Film Noir note.Walking down Waterloo Bridge, the very pretty Mae Clarke, (in the first of 3 films with Whale)gives a brilliant performance as Myra Deauville,with Clarke keeping Myra away from being all doom &amp; gloom,by creating a strong feeling of optimism,and showing Deauville to always hoping that the sun is about to come out from the thick clouds.Joining Clarke and a delightful,young Bettie Davis,Douglass Montgomery (who also worked with Davis's arch rival Joan Crawford in 1930's Paid) gives an excellent performance,with Montgomery showing Cronini to be dazed and confused as he discovers what is under Waterloo Bridge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WATERLOO BRIDGE (Universal, 1931), directed by James Whale, taken from the stage play by Robert E. Sherwood, stars Mae Clarke in what's possibly her best screen performance. Better known over the years as the girl who gets a grapefruit pushed into her face at the breakfast table by thug (played with no apologies by James Cagney) in THE PUBLIC ENEMY (Warners, 1931), had it not been for the unavailability of WATERLOO BRIDGE, chances are Clarke would have been noted for this film instead. Because it includes future film star, Bette Davis, in a small but prominent part, might be the reason why WATERLOO BRIDGE is often classified as an early Davis feature (her third) rather than one starring Mae Clarke. Overall, it is Clarke who's the main attraction here. Watching her sincere performance here makes one wonder why she never prospered to leading roles in major movie productions. She did work again under the direction of, that of FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1931) starring Colin Clive in the title role. But it was Boris Karloff playing the Monster was not only frightened Clarke on the verge of screaming, but came out an overnight star instead.Set in London shortly before the World War, Myra (Mae Clarke), an chorus girl from New York, acting under the stage name of "Myra Deauville," finds herself unemployed after the musical show engagement of "The Bing Boys" closes. Two years pass. Unable to obtain further theater work, Myra, along with her English friend, Kitty (Doris Lloyd), both acquire other means of support. After strolling through the crowded streets late one night, the two women part company. As Myra walks over to Waterloo Bridge, an zeppelin air raid occurs. Stopping to help an old woman (Rita Carlisle) pick up her spilled basket of potatoes, Roy Cronin (Kent Douglass), a 19-year-old American private stationed from Canada on leave from service, stops to help. After escorting Myra to her apartment, she invites him in. Owing three weeks back rent to Mrs. Dobley (Ethel Griffies), her crusty landlady, Roy offers to pay. At first she rebels due to her pride, but softens herself for the sake of his good intentions. Spending the late night hours smoking cigarettes and getting better acquainted, Roy soon finds himself in love. The next day, following a conversation with Kitty revealing Myra's loneliness, Roy decides he wants to marry her. Before proposing, he secretly arranges for Myra to meet with his mother, Mary (Enid Bennett), stepfather, Fred Wetherby (the lisping Frederick Kerr) and younger sister, Janet (Bette Davis) to meet and spend the weekend together. During their stay in a country home, it is Myra who privately comes to Roy's mother telling her why she cannot marry her son.The sensitive portrait of a troubled girl and a caring soldier was retold in the classic 1940 MGM remake starring Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor. A half hour longer than the original, with Leigh's character changed from Clarke's chorus girl to ballerina, story recollected in flashback through Roy's (Taylor) point of view, plus that haunting yet unforgettable love theme and scoring to "Swan Lake" are sure reasons why the second edition to WATERLOO BRIDGE has enjoyed frequent broadcast television revivals. A third edition, retitled GABY (MGM, 1956) starring Leslie Caron and John Kerr, went even further with its alterations, For many, WATERLOO BRIDGE (1940) comes simply as the best and highest regarded of the two MGM productions.After many years of obscurity, WATERLOO BRIDGE (1931), has become one of those movies one reads about with no opportunity of ever seeing it brought back to life. The opportunity finally did occur sometime in the 1990s when presented in New York City's Museum of Modern Art film department before turning up on cable television. Interestingly, on the evening of December 4, 2006, Robert Osborne, host of Turner Classic Movies, said this to be a TCM premiere. Someone from the programming department failed to mention this same station did air 1931's WATERLOO BRIDGE before, on May 11, 1998. Rather than placing this rare find on a prime time schedule, it was broadcast during the late night without any advertisement nor pre-announcement. Initially thinking this some sort of misprint in the TCM program guide of "Now Playing," I did set my VCR timer to the scheduled time beginning at 4 a.m., to be later surprised the following day of having the chance of finally getting to view this buried cinema treasure. Comparing the two, both are quite good in their own way, with the 1931 pre-code edition being more frank and honest about certain situations than the latter remakes. Kent Douglass, later known as Douglass Montgomery, should not be overlooked for his fine account of a youthful soldier in love. As for Bette Davis, many fans and historians would have to wait nearly 40 minutes before getting a first glimpse of her, from the back of her head.Available on DVD, WATERLOO BRIDGE is further indication of Universal being more than just a horror film studio.

		<shortDescription>The Hurdles of Love, Pre-Code Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mae Clark plays a prostitute who meets up with a young, earnest soldier during World War I. He's from a well-to-do family, and she knows they could never work as a couple, even though she wants to let herself love him. He seems not to care about their differences, even when he finds out what she does for a living. It all ends tragically and abruptly, but makes for some very compelling melodrama in the meantime.The pre-Code frankness and grit do a lot to keep the maudlin sentimentality at bay in this story that could come across as a second-rate soap opera. If this had been made ten years later (which it was, in a version starring Vivien Leigh and which I have not seen), it would have been drenched in a syrupy score that would have given us non-stop cues about what emotions we were supposed to be feeling at every turn. But there's a matter-of-factness about this film that's as surprising as any of the actual content. I've found that frequently with these pre-Code films, what's shocking about them is not the racy material, but rather the tone pervading them.Clark gives a very good performance, but I was actually more impressed with Kent Douglass as the young soldier. He has a natural acting style that seems ahead of its time compared to his contemporaries. And Bette Davis has a small role as the soldier's sister, and proves why she became one of the biggest stars of all time. Every time she's on screen, and even in a few instances when you can't see her but can only hear her, she completely dominates the film.And maybe this makes me sound supremely stupid, but I didn't know London dealt with a blitz during WWI as well.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Whale And World War Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In World War I London, Myra Deauville (Mae Clarke) is an American out of work chorus girl making ends meet by picking up men on Waterloo Bridge. During a Zeppelin air raid she meets Roy, a naive young American who enlisted in the Canadian army.Everything about this movie is great, and the rambling old man is awesome. Mae Clarke is hard to define -- she comes off as flippant and confused, which I found to be frustrating. And yet, her character is incredibly confused... so perhaps I ought to give Clarke credit for successfully fleshing out the emotions of her role.James Curtis calls the film an "assured advancement in style" over the previous Whale film, "Journey's End". Further, it has the added bonus of a pre-fame Bette Davis.Mordaunt Hall called the picture "somewhat sketchy in substance, but it is acted cleverly and there is imagination in the employment of the camera and the microphone." Which version Hall saw is unclear -- the film was cut by censors to push the idea of Myra as a chorus girl and not as a prostitute. (The cuts "horrified" James Whale, not surprisingly.) Whale completed the film $50,000 under budget, and Laemmle was so impressed he gave the director the choice of any property the studio had in the planning stages. He selected "Frankenstein" and went on to become one of the leading directors at Universal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Whale's "Waterloo Bridge" was one of the many movies filmed before the Hays Code, and so it got put under an unofficial ban for many years. Naturally, in the era when we can find all sorts of lewd stuff on the Internet, this sort of movie looks very tame. Even so, you have to imagine being a moviegoer in 1931 and seeing some of the stuff that the movie shows.James Whale is of course best known for directing "Frankenstein", and "Waterloo Bridge" star Mae Clarke played Dr. Frankenstein's fiancée and got carried around by the monster. Talk about some dissimilar roles! There was apparently a more sanitized version of "Waterloo Bridge" made after the Hays Code got established, starring Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, and it became the more famous version. As it stands, the Mae Clarke version is the only one that I've seen, and I really recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bridge must connect two points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale (1889-1957), the once very famous director of most excellent horror pictures such as the original "Frankenstein" (1931), who was later forgotten, after Hollywood forced him, in 1941, to an early retirement due to, amongst other things, non-closeted homosexual liaisons, is recently getting re-detected, having started with the restored edition of Whale's "The Old Dark House" (1932). "Waterloo Bridge" (1931), is his first self-directed feature-long movie. It stands, for all those who know a bit about the difficult life of Whale, closely under the experiences of his early years. The movie has been released for the first time on a film-carrier, having never appeared before on video, due to the self-imposed moral codex of the Hollywood studios and is part of a meritorious series called "Forbidden Hollywood", exclusively never before seen, mostly excellent pictures.Given that "Waterloo Bridge" was made in 1930, compare the acting on the one side with the contemporaneous acting in European movies of the same time - you will find a distance that cannot be bigger, since the over-acting due to the lack of sound which is so characteristic for especially German silent movies, was still sensible for a long time. On the other side, compare the mannerist speaking of the American films noir of the 30ies and 40ies - with both types, "The Waterloo Bridge" has nothing in common. Whale went even so far as to smuggle a few linguistic examples for switching of social codes into the movie - listen carefully the dialogs between the two main actors, the one is a Canadian noble-man turned soldier, the other is a street-walker and former chorus girl. But much more astonishing is not the actual choice of words of different linguistic levels, but the way how extraordinarily open topics are discussed in this movie that would still today be considered improper in many parts of society on both sides of the ocean. Another most interesting sociological feature is that Whale systematically showed the different types of everyday's behavior of a European and a Canadian. The Canadian, very close to the American, is without any reason polite a priori and thus avoiding tough subjects and rather leaves the scene instead of going through to the bloody end. She, the English girl, raises her voice, throws him bucket-wise the stinking truth of her miserable youth in his face - and kind of awakes him in doing so. Compare the scene when Myra admits to her lover's mother that she lives from pick-ups. The mother reacts as if she never had expected such an act of honesty from a girl from her cultural background. What Whale did here is a psycho-gram including not only sociological, but also linguistic behavior.When I was watching this movie, and the movie had nearly reached its end, I said to myself: something is going to happen - otherwise it is not a Whale-movie. And something terrible did happen. Watch this true jewel of highest film work and ask yourself about the function of the bridge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Waterloo Bridge (1931) **** (out of 4) James Whale directed film about a Canadian soldier (Kent Douglass) in London who falls in love with a woman (Mae Clarke) not knowing she's a prostitute. Whale has always been considered one of the greatest horror director's but after seeing this film he certainly should be considered one of the greatest directors ever. No matter which genre he was working in Whale managed to bring out every sort of emotion and that talent is on full display with this rather heartbreaking pre-code. I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I might go as far as to say it's better than Frankenstein, which was released the same year. The way Whale manages to get drama and laughs is once again quite remarkable, although we've seen him do this in countless horror films. The most shocking thing for me about the film is the performance by Clarke, who in my opinion gives one of the greatest performances from any actress. The way she handles all of her emotions is a real treat to watch. Everything from her characters pain to the humiliation of having to tell the guy's mother what her real job is. There are countless great scenes in this film and they all work perfectly. Douglass is very good as the young man, Bette Davis is nice in her few scenes and Enid Bennett is terrific as the mother. It was also nice seeing Frederick Kerr who also appeared in Whale's Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUCH earthier and seamy than the 1940 re-make--this is really not a romantic film at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1940 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE is so different that you really need to look at these completely different films. While the later version is much more romantic and polished, it suffers from some plot problems that keep it from being a great film--and this is all due to the sleazy elements of the 1931 version being chopped out to please censors.The 1931 version was directed by James Whale, and yes, this is the same guy who directed all the great early horror films at Universal. Because of his style AND the Pre-Code era's tendency to focus on the seamier aspects of life, it is so very different from the later film. Instead of being a struggling ballerina driven to eventually sell her body out of desperation and hunger (1940), the heroine is a prostitute when the film begins. So, with the Pre-Code morality, the story is essentially about a man who falls for a whore--not realizing her lifestyle. This must have been seen as pretty hot stuff back in its day and even today would probably make a few eyebrows raise! Because of this element, the film is much more of a tragedy than a romance. In fact, having a character be a hooker is a pretty sure way to keep the film from being romantic. So, if you are looking for a romance, see the later version.Overall, this version of the film is more coherent and makes a lot more sense than the re-make. In the re-make, Ms. Leigh marries Robert Taylor and then becomes a prostitute even though she knows he comes from a rich family--this just doesn't make sense. She easily could have let them know of her plight and avoided all the mess that ensued (making Vivian just "too dumb to live"). Instead, Mae Clark is a basically decent person but she's still a hooker who can't allow herself to either admit to her man what she is nor can she allow herself to marry him--this is a much better plot and DOES make sense. However, aside from the non-romantic aspect of this, the ending of the film is just terrible in this original film. Frankly, although I generally prefer this earlier film, the 1940 version ended much better. So overall, this is a very interesting film due to its subject matter but the film does suffer a bit from the lousy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the shadow of the 1940 film, but to me it was just as good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparing the 1931 and 1940 versions of 'Waterloo Bridge' reminds one of comparing the 1940 and 1944 versions of 'Gaslight'. In that the earlier version is well in the shadow of the later version, but despite being different films and having elements done better in the other both are very good to great in their own way.It is hard to say which is the superior version to me, while leaning towards the more lavish and more visually polished and glitzy later version this version, which is grittier and more steamy whereas the later version is more romantic and tamer (which may be a disappointment to some), is also very good in its own way. Bette Davis, despite still being good, does have little to do in a very early role (safe to say that she did go on to better things), but more problematic is the somewhat erratic and abrupt ending, granted there is emotional impact but the outcome just seemed also too random and contrived.However, while not as lavish as the 1940 film it is a beautiful-looking film with plenty of atmosphere, the cinematography being one of the film's highlights. James Whale's impressionist-like direction also conveys a compelling realism and ensures that atmosphere and momentum is always consistent. Uncredited Val Burton's music score is lush and sometimes haunting, while there is a very intelligent script and a story that's genuinely emotional and intriguingly ahead of its time.It's driven also by the pivotal chemistry between Mae Clarke and Douglas Montgommery (or Kent Douglass), which is depicted beautifully here and some great acting. Doris Lloyd, Frederick Kerr and especially Enid Bennett give priceless supporting contributions, and Douglass' inexperience does not show in a surprisingly naturalistic turn that neither overstates or underplays the naivety, but it's the astonishing and quite heart-wrenching performance of Mae Clarke that's most unforgettable, genuinely reducing me to tears on several occasions.Overall, while this version of 'Waterloo Bridge' is in the shadow of the later version, it is just as good and well worth checking out. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unlikely Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the notable elements of Pre-Code Hollywood is how it managed to give women real meat to sink their teeth into in the quality and diversity of sometimes risqué, sometimes flat-out repulsive, unglamorous, and decidedly feminist roles that were developed for them. For an approximate seven years, roughly from 1927 to early 1934, women were dangerous, sexual, feisty, take-charge, aware of the effect they had in others, CEO's of corporations, they wore the pants around the house, accepted nothing less than everything even if it meant paying a major price for it. But above all they were powerfully feminine, and for those brief years, they were icons.WATERLOO BRIDGE is a curious film from the Pre-Code years because while it is about the doomed love between a prostitute (Mae Clarke) and a soldier (Kent Douglass), it's told without the gloss that would dominate its subsequent 1940 and 1956 remakes (made at a time when women as characters were sublimated female archetypes and conformed to passive behaviour and romance was saccharine sweet and drenched in swoon and color). And while Bette Davis, who plays a minor role in the film as Douglass' sister, is quoted as saying that she could have played the lead (and she most decidedly would do in 1934 in OF HUMAN BONDAGE as Mildred Rogers, the harpy that made Leslie Howard's life a living hell), Myra Deauville demanded less of the Davis fury and more of the Clarke insecurity in order to come off under a sympathetic light.WATERLOO BRIDGE is not a perfect movie in the fact that Kent Douglass is horrible in conveying any kind of true emotion: he was pretty, but that is all. It does feel a tad clunky here and there but this is due to the recent transition from silents to talkies and the stilted feel (American) movies had around this time. James Whale does manage to bring two striking moments within the movie: the one where Myra makes her crucial confession to Mrs. Cronin (Enid Bennett) about how she met her son, and the final shot as it follows Myra's walk to her death under an air raid in London. A great team of actress and director in a groundbreaking movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WATERLOO BRIDGE explores the Myth of Upward Mobility . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . and gives lie to the PRETTY WOMAN fantasy. WATERLOO BRIDGE shows us that if a Rich Guy from America's or Canada's One Per Cent was seriously interested in an impoverished hooker, Fate would go out of Its way to drop a bomb on her head. Teenager Roy is the One Per Center featured in WATERLOO BRIDGE. In one of Biology's great miscues, his cerebral cortex develops just as tardily as that of a street-sweeper's son. Roy's immature Gray Matter prevents him from being able to distinguish a Lady from a Tramp, or from caring about the distinction when someone finally spells it out for him. Strumpet Myra makes the Fatal Mistake of toying with Roy's Innocence, when she is morally obligated to straighten him out as to her status of being a sadder-but-wiser gal from the get go. Such effrontery from a common street walker might be excused if Myra was dallying with a drunken and dirty old man, but NOT with a Rich Young Lad whose step-dad's Alzheimer's prevents him from telling Roy about the Birds and the Knees. Myra grows increasingly discombobulated while leading this young whippersnapper down her well-trod garden path. Just as Roy cannot marry Trigger, he can't be allowed to wed Myra, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Acting And Photography!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I generally get turned off watching movies about sleeze, Waterloo Bridge (1931) does have many noble moments. I kept watching because the photography for that era was crystal-clear, and the editing consistent in its continuity, more so than many movies of that era, and even some made years later.And the amazing thing about the acting was, it was so masterfully real-to-life, but without being plain or uninteresting. It was raw, real, and believable. This went on mostly in scenes between Myra and Roy, (Mae Clarke and Douglas Montgomery). Even very long dialogues just rolled on so naturally, you felt like you were in the scene with them. The conflict between characters also develops well.Roy's mother, Mary Cronin Wetherby (Enid Bennett), was absolutely charming in her manner, reflections, and uplifting advice to - and acceptance of - Myra.The 1941 version was an overall better film, in terms of pacing and cinematography; and since the emphasis was not on sleeze, but charming and budding love. Still, this original (1931) version is a masterpiece of photography and acting for its time. And catch Bette Davis in her 3rd film role, as Roy's sister... utterly charming! Except for the sudden, unexpected, schlocky instantaneous ending, it is an amazing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early version of the Leigh-Taylor film helped by a great performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Done in the early days of sound, 1931's "Waterloo Bridge" isn't as famous as the Vivien Leigh-Robert Taylor version done later on, but it is effective nonetheless thanks to the performance of Mae Clarke as Myra. This film apparently sticks closer to the original story, too. Myra is a chorus girl who, after her show closes, finds herself out of work and unable to get a job. World War I is raging, and she and a friend are out on the streets picking up soldiers. During an air raid, she meets a sweet, naive Canadian soldier Roy (Kent Douglass, later to become Douglass Montgomery) who falls in love with her without realizing she's a prostitute. As in the later film, he takes her to meet the family.The surprise in this is the very modern and still fresh performance of Mae Clarke, best known for getting a grapefruit in her face courtesy of Jimmy Cagney in "Public Enemy." Up until nearly the end of the movie, when she indulges in the old-fashioned histrionics we're no longer used to, she is marvelous as Myra - much more streetwise than Leigh's Myra ever became as she is less refined to start, less vulnerable and stronger. Some of that is in this script; some of it comes from Clarke's scrappier persona. Leigh's Myra was a ballerina; a chorus girl was one step up from prostitution in those days. Unlike the later film, one doesn't get the sense that Myra even knows whether or not she loves Roy. He certainly offers an escape from her circumstances, but she's loathe to take him up on it. She also knows from the very beginning that she has no intention of going through with marrying him, where the Leigh version has her deluding herself.Other than Clarke's work, this is a fairly crudely put together movie. Sound hadn't been perfected, so there are echoes, and Douglass/Montgomery is totally inexperienced and doesn't register well. A very pretty Bette Davis plays Roy's sister. It's a small role, but she's delightful. The rest of the acting is fine.This is a good effort by James Whale, who had a very successful collaboration with Universal. Davis, however, did not, and soon moved on to Warners. Kent Douglass went through a name change and had a checkered career until his death in 1966. Mae Clarke, the model for Lorelei Lee in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" worked in film and television into her seventies, forever known as Cagney's grapefruit recipient. It's a shame. She deserved better.</fullReview>

I must say I missed the first third of the film - came upon it by accident - and considering this I found no confusion at all to knowing this simple story. I agree that there was a great deal of "Silents" type overacting from the "Myra" actress - which undoubtedly accounts for her never achieving stardom - but I tend to look at a film overall. (OOPS I also find no kind words for the acting by Myra's beloved, either.)The other characters played well. Sets &amp; scenery shots were appropriate and well done. (We can overlook bad montage - we still see it in this century!)I really liked the way it ended. After all - there is a great deal of abruptness during wartime. I'm sure my emotional reaction was just what the director intended.I have not seen the 1940 version with finer actors and am quite certain it would be very different. Very superior?

		<shortDescription>An early, much cruder version has no finesse at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, is beyond comprehension.MAE CLARKE's Myra is a far cry from the role as played by VIVIEN LEIGH in the remake. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the "Yeah" responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down. BETTE DAVIS has a nothing role in a bit part.Their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are beyond belief (extravagant bits of overacting)--even given the fact that this is a cruder version of the story when sound was only a few years old and silent acting was still the rage.Just awful. And it ends abruptly with Clarke losing her life during a bombing on the bridge. The End.It has none of the beautifully shaded performances in the MGM remake of 1940, including a sterling supporting cast. Instead, this one is mounted with low-budget production values (and I mean a shoe-string budget) with no subtlety at all. And there's no pre-code braveness in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic lady why she must not marry her son, Roy. She simply says, "I picked him up on Waterloo Bridge." Explanation over. Nothing bold there.Summing up: For once, the original is not the best version by any means. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR have never been surpassed as Myra and Roy in the tender, exquisitely acted 1940 film classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the 1940 remake many, many times and I consider it the greatest classic film tearjerker. I've even read the original Robert Sherwood play and I couldn't help imagining Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh in their roles while reading the text...even though Myra is an American in the original play. It seems that both stars were born to play the roles.Although this film is much more faithful to the original play and is well-acted sometimes, the 1940 remake is still my cup of tea. Here we have a slow, crude relic that's typical of early sound films. This film has none of the excellent cinematography, production values, or acting of the 1940 remake and seems very theatrical. The pre-Production Code frankness is harmless and there is nothing bold about the film at all. The romance between Roy and Myra is neither tender nor convincing and looks improbable and contrived. The limited presence of a young Bette Davis, as always, did nothing for me.Oh, and the ending was so abrupt and awkward that it was embarrassing. It was neither moving nor poignant like the finale of the 1940 remake...just awful. My mouth and eyes were wide open at that point.I will stick to the 1940 remake, despite its unfaithfulness to the original play and its sanitized script and production values. For once, here is an original that is not the best version by any means. And, although I admire the effort she put into playing the role of Myra, the forgettable Mae Clarke is no Vivien Leigh.</fullReview>
