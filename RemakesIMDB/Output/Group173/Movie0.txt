		<shortDescription>Chaos of a life turned on its head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've often thought that if Vivien Leigh hadn't had such a rocky and depressing life (manic depression, lost love in Lawrence Olivier, miscarriages, tuberculosis) she would have found a place among Bette Davis, Katherine Hepburn, and the like. She only made 19 films during her 30 year career, although that includes making legend as Scarlett O'Hara, and helping usher in a new era of acting by providing a pitch perfect classical foil as Blanche DuBois to Brando's smoldering and revolutionary Stanley Kowalski. But her favorite performance was that of Myra Lester in the tragic film Waterloo Bridge. Watching it it's no surprise: the film is subtly directed with a powerful story and well built characters that are an actor's dream to inhabit.The story revolves around Myra, a ballerina turned prostitute during WWI when she believes her fiancée has died and she is plunged into poverty. The film was perfect fodder for melodrama, but rather it's a taut and realistic and uncompromising film. Direction is not overbearing and lets the film play out delicately except for several bold shots here and there which deeply accent it. Although the melodramas of the 40s are wonderful creatures, this film gained a lot by taking a rare path and going realistic.Misfortune rules the day and is invited in after a series of near misses and miscalculations, and yet the plot doesn't feel technical or forced. Thanks to the script and performances, it all feels like the ebb and flow of the lives of these characters, pride and honesty and a slightly naive fiancée are the cause of Myra's downfall. And Leigh gives a performance on par with anything she's ever done, if not as epic as Gone With the Wind or wild as Blanche.Leigh had a special way of handling the screen, of inhabiting her character with a certain distracted quality that made you feel as if she didn't realize there was a camera in the room or that she wasn't in fact the character she was playing. There are few actresses who could make it look as easy as she did, it seems like breathing. She was fierce and fearless, versatile; she could lose all her dignity on screen or be the living embodiment of it, and she possessed the rare quality of immediately communcating any emotion that was as tangible as anything with her face. That said, this is probably her most realistic character and her most tragic, and Leigh makes it profound and gut wrenching by being sophisticated and dignifed, and then at the right moments she takes the fall and gets ugly.There's a brazen brilliant tracking shot where Myra, the former innocent ballerina, walks through Waterloo station in full slinky getup looking for johns, wearing a stone cold face that would intimidate O'Hara herself. It's seductive and we know she hates herself. Still, Leigh doesn't play an ounce of self pity or tragedy, she's determined to survive and get a client. In that way its very much a modern acting performance. It could be sexy, nowadays they'd try to make it sexy, but in the delicately built context of the story it's both mesmerizing and heartbreaking. And when she meets up with her not-dead-at-all love, played with sweet nobility by Robert Taylor, she tries to wipe off her lipstick when he goes to make a phone call, and the shame spills out from the screen.The writing is very graceful (partly out of necessity to appease the almighty Production Code), at times remarkably candid and light (particularly with the earlier love scenes), and not very sentimental or stylized at all (not to say those are bad things, it's just that this film isn't). A lot of the dialogue sounds like conversation. It's romantic, but it doesn't resort to cliché or the easy way out: its tragedy is harsh and entirely unnecessary, the way it usually is in life. And Leigh's performance single handedly keeps you from forgetting Myra's story once the credits roll and you return to life in 2005. Not many actresses have that power. I only wish I could have seen what she would have done with less sorrow in her own life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never a false note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of a tiny handful which, despite repeated viewings, I would award a vote of ten out of ten. Not because it's a great cultural classic studied in hushed tones by post-graduate students (for all I know this may be so, but I've never heard of it), but because it succeeds entirely and seamlessly in what it sets out to do.'Waterloo Bridge' is one of those rare films that never seems to strike a false note or put a foot wrong. There is not a wasted moment in the screenplay -- every shot has meaning, every scene plays its part -- and the dialogue gains its power through the lightest of touches. The single scene that brings me to tears every time is that brief, banal interview in the café, with the dreadful unknowing irony of every word Lady Margaret says.Yet for an avowed tear-jerker, and one that centres around wartime separation and hardship, in an era where unemployment could mean literal starvation, the film contains perhaps more scenes of unalloyed happiness than any modern-day romance. The script is understated, sparkling with laughter and even at its darkest salted with black jest, while no-one can doubt the central couple's joy in each other. They themselves acknowledge, and repeatedly, the sheer implausibility of their romance: but war changes all the rules, makes people -- as Roy says -- more intensely alive. (The actor David Niven, for one, married an adored wife in wartime within days of their first meeting.)As Myra Lester, Vivien Leigh has seldom given a more lovely or accomplished performance. There is a world of difference between her depiction of the sweet-faced innocent who is mistaken for a school-girl at the start of the film and the sullen, worn creature who saunters through Waterloo Station... and then is miraculously reborn. Myra's face is an open book, and Leigh shows us every shade of feeling. In a reversal of expectations, she is the practical, hesitant one, while Roy, older, is the impetuous dreamer; a role in which Robert Taylor is both endearing and truly convincing. I find few cinematic romances believable, but for me this lightning courtship rings utterly true in every glance or smile that passes between them, from the moment they catch sight of each other for the second time.Virginia Field also shines as Myra's friend, the hardbitten ex-chorus-girl Kitty, while C.Aubrey Smith provides sly humour as an unexpectedly supportive Colonel-in-Chief and Lucille Watson is both stately and sympathetic as Lady Margaret. But this is really Vivien Leigh's film, with Taylor's more than able aid, and she is transcendent.'Waterloo Bridge' has a touch of everything: laughter, tears, tension, misunderstanding, sweetness, beauty and fate. It couldn't be made in today's Hollywood without acquiring an unbearable dose of schmaltz; in the era of 'Pretty Woman' it probably couldn't be made at all. But of its kind it is perfect. The only caveat I'd make, under the circumstances a minor one, is that -- as again in 'Quentin Durward' fifteen years later -- Robert Taylor's lone American accent in the role of a supposed Scot is from time to time obtrusive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here, love relies on ineffable mystery and destiny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Taylor was an inspired choice for the role... Not only does he have an imposing screen presence, but he brings the perfect mix of enlightenment, humor, compassion and emotion to the part...Opposite him, Oscar Winner Vivien Leigh, perfect in her innocent lovely look, radiantly beautiful, specially that evening in a trailing white chiffon gown... Leigh floods her role with personal emotion giving her character a charismatic life of its own... As a great star, she delivers a heartfelt performance turning her character into a woman who undergoes an emotional awakening...In this sensitive motion picture, Mervyn LeRoy captures all the tenderness and moving qualities... He makes every small thing eloquent, concentrating the highly skilled efforts of many technicians on the telling of a very simple bittersweet love story... Vivien Leigh paints a picture that few men will be able to resist... Her performance captures the audience to the point of complete absorption... Robert Taylor (carrying sympathy all the way) quietly throws all his vitality as an ambition actor into the task... Their film, a credit to both, is a heavily sentimental tale about the vagaries of wartime...Love is the only thing this movie is about... The story is simple: Myra Lester (Leigh) is a frail creature, an innocent young ballet dancer and Roy Cronin (Taylor) is an aristocratic British army officer... When their eyes met it took no time at all for their hearts to feel the loving call... They meet on London's Waterloo Bridge during an air raid, and fall deeply in love... Their romance is sublime, and they soon agree to marry...The lover's marriage has to be postponed when the handsome officer is suddenly called to the front... Sadly, the sweet ballerina misses her performance to see her captain off at Waterloo Station... Fired from the troupe, she is joined by her loyal friend, Virginia Field (Kitty Meredith), and the two vainly try to find work, finally sinking into poverty and the threatening fear that goes with it... The film is replete with beautiful and poignant scenes, specially the 'Auld Lang Syne' waltz scene in the Candlelight Club, before Taylor leaves for France? Seen today, 'Waterloo Bridge' has retained all its charm and power, all its rich sentiment, and tragic evocations...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Known But Excellent Romantic Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When pressed to name her favorite of her own films, Vivien Leigh brushed aside both GONE WITH THE WIND and STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE in favor of this now little-known film based on a failed 1930s stage drama of the same name previously filmed in 1931 with Mae Clark: WATERLOO BRIDGE, directed by Mervyn LeRoy. Leigh had good reason for her choice. Although she was dazzling as Scarlett O'Hara and elegantly depraved as Blanche DuBois, she was never as beautifully photographed as she was in this 1940 film.WATERLOO BRIDGE is perhaps best described as one of a number of films "with an English accent" that played to American sympathies for England in the years when England largely stood alone against Nazi Germany. The story itself has a wartime setting: beautiful ballerina Myra (Vivien Leigh) meets and falls passionately in love with officer Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor), only to be parted from him when he is called to duty during World War I. Alone and increasingly destitute, she learns that he has been killed in action--and so, broken hearted and unconcerned for herself, she drifts into prostitution, plying the world's oldest profession along Waterloo Bridge.Although Robert Taylor is a bit miscast, Leigh carries the film with a truly remarkable performance. In the opening portion of the scene, she is at the height of her youthful beauty, and cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg makes the most of it; later, when experience has hardened her, she turns the graceful charm of her earlier scenes upside down to create the bitter, brassy tart that Myra has become. The cast also features an exceptional performance by Lucile Watson as Lady Margaret and notable turns by Maria Ouspenskaya, C. Aubrey Smith, and a host of others.Although less well known than such tragic romances as Garbo's CAMILLE, WATERLOO BRIDGE is easily the equal of such and considerably better than most. The romantic aura is powerful, the production values are meticulous, the direction, photography, and script are first rate. And at the center of it all we have perhaps the single most beautiful actress of her era, Vivien Leigh, in one of her finest performances. You'll need a box of tissues for this one; don't miss it.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taylor and Leigh at their best...one of the all-time great tear-jerkers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Taylor's favorite movie is also rumored to be one of Vivien's favorites--although at the time she was sorry that Laurence Olivier had not been cast in it. (She was always seeking him as her screen partner!) But Taylor delivers the goods--great charm, presence and obviously respecting the fine role that he plays. Vivien Leigh is a revelation--here she is fresh from Scarlett O'Hara and able to inhabit another character's skin with ease, back in her oh-so-British mode and looking as young and beautiful as ever. It's a pleasure that two such charismatic stars are still being seen in this--their finest moments on screen in one of the greatest tear-jerkers of the '40s. Special mention should be given to Lucille Watson for the way she plays the restaurant scene with Leigh at their first meeting--the mother-in-law getting the wrong impression from Leigh's reception. All of it is romantic, tender and charming--with an Anna Karenina-like ending after a surprising twist. For fans of Taylor and Leigh, it doesn't get any getter than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Romantic Movie of the Finest Quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best decision I made for this year was to buy several videos and enjoy the old movies. Amongst the first purchases was of course "Waterloo Bridge," an unforgettable favorite. It's a tender love story that unfolds a beautiful romance shaken by the cold realities of WW1. I was reaching for kleenexes at certain intervals as it does get sad. Not only does Ms Vivien Leigh fulfil her role with feeling and charm, but to me her beauty is like an exquisite orchid, almost exotic in quality. Also, it's interesting to observe her in this next role after "Gone With the Wind." Obviously she's my favorite leading lady! Robert Taylor turns in a fine, sensitive performance, and with all that charm, what lady could resist? This is one of countless stories that could be told about the upheavals that wartime caused in people's lives. For anyone who appreciates good acting and a fine tale of romance, it's a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is rare in many ways. First off everyone in America was waiting to see what was going to be Vivien Leigh's first movie after her great performance in "Gone with the Wind". And this was it. This film turned out to be her only "North American"(Hollywood type),non costume drama,non southern accent (Scarlett O'Hara/Blanche DuBois)type movie post "GWTW" while she was still in her twenties."That Hamilton Woman" (1941)was a "British" production. Factor in the fact that when asked later in life which one of her films was her personal favorite, what was her reply? Not "GWTW",not "A Streetcar Named Desire",but "Waterloo Bridge"(it was also "Robert Taylors" personal favorite).This movie gives you a little taste of what might have been if she made more "Hollywood" type movies while still in her twenties. Possibly paired up with some of Hollywood's greatest leading men "Humphrey Bogart","Cary Grant",who knows?Will never know.Highly recommended! Find it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my most beloved films ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire this movie so much, the best I've ever seen since Gone with the Wind, and the most beautiful love story ever told. A touching, tragic, sad story about love, what always makes me cry. As someone mentioned, a perfect movie on rainy days, or anytime, and makes me belive in true love again. The soundtrack was very good, too. My favourite scene's the Auld Lang Syne Waltz in Candlelight Club. Of course, I loved the Vivien Leigh-Robert Taylor couple. After this movie, it was clear that Vivien Leigh is most beautiful creature ever being on this planet, indeed, and Robert Taylor is one of the most handsome men ever. The performances were very good, too, especially Viv's. She played the opposite of Scarlett. It was Robert Taylor's finest performance, too, I haven't got any problem with his american accent. I didn't surprised when I heard that's Vivien's and Robert's favourite film. This movie is beautiful, watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most beautiful love story set in England during the War.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a beautiful film, with such outstanding performances, that it is unique only to itself. Robert Taylor as Roy, and Vivian Leigh as Myra, are beautiful together and it is hard to believe that any other actors could have ever played the parts of the doomed lovers. Roy meets Myra by accident during an air raid and in that brief instant he believes he is in love. He goes to the ballet where she is a dancer and asks her to join him for dinner. Her ballet instructor, Madame Olga, played by Maria Ouspenskaya, refuses to let her girls become involved and tells Myra to refuse his attentions. The part of the Madame is small but very effective, with an outstanding performance by Maria. Kitty (Virginia Field) stops Roy before he leaves to tell him Myra will meet him at the Candlelight Club. They dine, and at the end of the evening they dance to Auld Lang Syne, as the musicians snuff the candles one by one, until the room is darkened and Roy gently kisses Myra. They part and the next day since the channel is full of mines, he has leave. She spots him standing in the rain, outside her flat, and runs to him, with a wonderful breathlessness. They kiss, and he tells her they are to be married. He is so full of innocent bliss, and she is so enamored of him, you can feel their enthusiasm through the screen. Such is the story, but when he has to leave suddenly and they can't get married right then, she tries to go to him at the station, but just catches a glimpse of him on the train. He is gone and the Madame fires her and her friend Kitty who tells her off for ruining Myra's blissful day. They come upon hard times, and Kitty turns to a life of prostitution. Virginia Field is great as the friend with an Oscar caliber performance. When Myra hears from Roy that his Mother will be coming to meet her she goes to a tea room and while waiting for her, reads in the paper that Roy is presumed dead. She is so disraught that when the Mother finally arrives, very late, she seems strange and incoherent to her. The mother played by Lucile Watson, is not such a wonderful person, who is quite stuffy and sees only what she wants and rejects Myra without even trying to ask what is wrong. From then on it is downhill. Myra thinking Roy dead, goes to prostitution to live, until one day at Waterloo Station, looking for a date, she sees Roy in the crowd. They embrace, and he is still so in love that he doesn't even notice how she looks. She tells Kitty she is going with him to the family estate and they are to be married. The Mother strangely welcomes her, and they have a party where Roy introduces her to the family, and they dance to the same song. Realizing that she might ruin him she tells his mother that there is no way they can wed, because of her past. She leaves, he follows, and even after he finds out what she has done, he still loves her, but she has made the decision to kill herself to save him from himself. The token, a lucky piece that they have shared is all you see in the street after she throws herself into the path of a military truck. The opening and ending scenes of Roy remembering Myra while he strokes the small lucky piece, are sad and poignant, and you will cry for a love so pure, and so unfinished, you wish it had ended differently. Robert Taylor was as great as his former performance as the tragic Armund Duval in Camille many years prior to this part. It was his favorite film, and also was Ms. Leigh's favorite. Beautiful, stunning love story. A classic that never gets old, even 65 years after it's release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice - couldn't be made today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LeRoy made a film which flings prostitution in our faces, and in the faces of its characters - yet he doesn't dare mention the word or show the deed explicitly. I'm not complaining; the fact that no one dares utter the p-word helps the film immeasurably. The tragedy plays out best in an atmosphere in which Myra's moral stain, or purported moral stain, is LITERALLY an unspeakable one. No modern director (with the possible exception of David Mamet) would dare NOT be explicit.Unfortunately for a love story, the love scenes are the only interactions lacking in electricity, the only interactions, in fact, that aren't interactions at all. They're the dull bits we endure in order to enjoy the real story. I should stress that they're still pleasant enough, so it's not MUCH of an endurance test.And what IS the real story? The delightful thing about it, I think, is that it's perfectly ambiguous. Taken one way, the romance between hero and heroine is destroyed because of the power of a pervasive, yet false, moral belief: the belief that a prostitute is tainted, unfit for marriage, love, life itself. Taken this way the story is a social tragedy. But arguably the film is asking us to make believe that the pervasive moral belief is in fact true, that the heroine really is (through no fault of her own) tainted; taken THIS way, it's a kind of moral fantasy. Either way it works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1969, when Robert Taylor was dying from cancer and confined to his bed, he requested to view his old films. Apparently, he hadn't seen most of them since their initial release. Afterwards, he was asked by friends which film was he the most proud of. Of all the films he made in his 35 year career, "Waterloo Bridge" was the movie he chose. "That," he said; "was my best film." That aside, "Waterloo Bridge" will take your breath away by the simple fact that two of the most physically beautiful actors appear in it - Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Waterloo Bridge" is one of my ten favorite melodramas ,in the same league as "imitation of life", "magnificent obsession" (2 versions each)or "to each his own" .I'd always thought that "That Lady Hamilton" was Leigh's third best performance (after "GWTW" and "a streetcar named desire" )but I've got to make amends :After watching Le Roy's nugget for the third or fourth time yesterday ,I think this is one of the pearls on the crown of Mrs Leigh's too small filmography."Waterloo bridge" is close to perfection ,so beautiful it can grab even people who do not care much for melodramas.The cinematography is dazzling,stunning:I will only mention this scene when the two lovers arrive in Cronin's desirable mansion ,it looks like a fairy tale.There are so many unforgettable scenes in " Waterloo bridge" it's impossible to talk about all of them: "The Farewell Waltz ",when they snuff a candle each time the dancers go round the dance hall,is one of the most romantic scene you have ever watched.The ball ,in the manor,where Mara looks a bit like Cinderella ,with her ugly "sisters" exchanging gossips behind her back.The search ,in all the low dives of London town,and Roy beginning to understand ...All the cast is incredibly good:Vivien Leigh had everything going for her: acting genius,beauty,charm;Robert Taylor is ideally cast as the young dashing officer every girl dreams of.The supporting actresses are up to scratch too:Madame Oupenskaya we have seen in Frank Borzage' s works ("the mortal storm")is extraordinary as the ruthless ballet mistress;Virginia Fields portrays a girl who sacrifices her own life for her friend's happiness;that's what friends are for :she shows compassion and emotion;we feel for her Kitty as much as we do for Mara ,it speaks volumes about this actress's talent.Lucille Watson is equally impressive as Lady Margaret ,the aristocratic lady with a big heart.One should not forget the use of music either: the three pieces which are heard during the movie always come at the right moment: "Auld Lang Syne" (the farewell waltz) which really belongs here ,"Swan Lake" and "Let me call you sweetheart" .Although completely different,"Waterloo Bridge" is as strong as Le Roy's earlier works "I'm a fugitive from a chain gang" or "they won't forget" .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodrama triumphs over common sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible spoiler) Mervyn LeRoy directed at least two wartime romances that are among the most preposterous melodramas ever made. The second one is "Random Harvest," and its twists and turns are openly bizarre and fantastic. This earlier film (a remake, based on a play by Robert Sherwood) makes more of an effort to disguise the absurdity of its story, yet it's still ridiculous when you really think about it. The whole plot hinges on the idea that two healthy young women descend to prostitution to eat because they can't find any other work--in WWI England! Yes, it's not as though the men had all been drafted; it's not as though the war effort actively recruited and trained nurses, aides and others; it's not as though there were various women's army projects. In reality, war years were probably the only times when unskilled women had no trouble finding jobs, but you'd never know it from this script. Here the war exists only as a convenient device to fool people into thinking that their lovers are dead when they're really coming back later. In other words, the whole premise is idiotic.However, the fact that this profoundly obvious point doesn't occur to many viewers, or that they put it out of their minds to flow along with the tears and suds, shows how skillful and dedicated are the director, the actors and the other craftsmen in concentrating on emotions that are somehow "true" even if the story that contrives them cannot be. Also, it's beside the point that the Production Code required prostitutes to be punished instead of finding happiness; the fact that Hollywood chooses to tell such a story anyway and lavish all its skill on making Vivien Leigh into a tragic heroine is interesting, almost subversive. In a sense, the movie is really about a more general condition of sacrifice and punishment in society. This stimulating glimpse of truth within a tragedy of sheer unreality is one of the things that make the movie so watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor in the lead...that cast made many viewers in 1940 look forward to seeing them in the movie by Mervyn LeRoy based on the play by Robert E. Sherwood. They badly wanted to see Scarlett O'Hara from GONE WITH THE WIND and Armand Duval from CAMILLE, at that time their most celebrated roles. Nowadays, when we, as classic buffs, come back to such films like WATERLOO BRIDGE, it appears that this has three most significant prompts: to admire artistic performances far from computerized voices, to have a rest in classical imagination separated from the robotic world of machines, to turn into subtleness, a bit of sentimentality and romantic love separated from the automatically selfish noise of colorful vanity. Although some films of the era cannot be described in all those categories, WATERLOO BRIDGE can.It's first of all a classical love romance of two people torn apart in the difficult times of WWI, a ballet dancer Myra (Vivien Leigh) and Lieutenant Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor). Since the action takes place in the London of the 1910s, the realities of that time are deeply rooted in Anglo Saxon elegance, calmness, public life. The Waterloo Bridge is a special place for the two: on the one hand, so significant and unforgettable; on the other hand, so tragic and nostalgic. The characters are very easy to identify with since the problems that they face are universal. War is only a background but all the feelings of fear, treason, separation, dreams, honor, desire for understanding and sincerity are every day bread for people of all times. Roy and Myra are very convincing as a pair and as a man and a woman in general. Their romance is short but very beautiful and particularly subtle. Pity we don't find many of such interpretations nowadays. The dialogs are first rate, the chemistry between Taylor and Leigh is the right one.The performances are exceptionally fine. Vivien is beautiful and talented. She is not Scarlett O'Hara, she is even better in some moments. Robert Taylor is also magnificent as Cronin: very good looking and genuine in the role. No wonder he said once that WATERLOO BRIDGE had been his favorite film since here, he gives his finest performance. From the supporting cast, Lucile Watson is worth attention as an elderly kind hearted Lady Cronin, Roy's mum and Myra's mother-in-law to come. She wonderfully portrays someone of a very good heart and the first moment you see her, it's just obvious that you are looking at a decent person (dream to have such a mother-in-law...) Virginia Field is sweet as Kitty, Myra's friend but the performance is shadowed. The last of the cast I'd focus on is the great C. Aubrey Smith with this specific face and an aristocratic way of acting manners. He's brilliant as the Duke who at last has a chance to dance with Myra.The direction by Mervyn LeRoy is outstanding together with cinematography and lighting. Vivien is beautifully photographed. But, finally I'd like to concentrate on a slightly different aspect that perhaps does not appeal to people today as much as it did 67 years ago but still a significant one: the movie touches the problem of people in poverty. What is there to do if a dream for any wealth or at least for slightly better financial conditions are in vain? What do people usually turn to? The director seems to be with them who are making terrible decisions in order to survive somehow. Mervyn LeRoy, having been poor himself in childhood, perfectly directs our attention on Myra, her psyche, her decisions and sorrows, her thoughts, her conscience, her exceptionally hard situation. Is it right to judge such people? What would we do in such circumstances? But not to address the philosophical side of reflections since that is not the gist of the movie, I'd like to say something at the end. This film is very good, very worth seeking. I heartily recommend everyone to see WATERLOO BRIDGE, a movie where you will surely find something decent for yourself. Like love build bridges between people, WATERLOO BRIDGE builds bridges between generations now. It's a pure entertainment in silver screen but with a golden spirit of message! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Waterloo Bridge movies were based on a play by Robert E. Sherwood, written in 1930. The play itself is in fact based on an incident in the authors life: namely, he was an American who joined the Canadian Army during the First World War. When based in London he had a brief affair/fell in love with an American girl, who turned out to be a street-walker. He never forgot her. I couldn't find any details whether she actually died at that time or not.This movie works on so many levels for me it is not possible to really cover them all. Of course it isn't perfect, as there has to be some artistic license taken here and there, but I think it is Vivien Leigh's best movie performance, and Bob Taylor's best also. They are just about perfect for each other. As it was made in 1940 it was severely affected by the Production Code in what it was able to say and show (apparently the 1931 version, which I haven't seen, was a lot more forthright about the prostitution theme, for instance), making it necessary to invent an explanation as to why Myra had turned to hooking (in the play and the 1931 film version she was already a hooker when she met Roy and the reasons for it are unexplained).Still, the story and the performances are great. When watching the movie I think sometimes I just want to shake Myra, to make her just be honest and truthful, and let the chips fall where they may. But it's important to try to keep the movie in the context of happening early in the twentieth century in a class structured United Kingdom. The attitudes of the guests in the Scottish ball sequence attest to the fact that the love affair is doomed - even if Roy, his mother, and the Duke are prepared to accept Myra (and remember at that stage the Duke is unaware of Myra's past as a working girl)it is obvious that most of the rest of the Scottish aristocracy won't. It is obvious that even if Myra married Roy, life would be a nightmare of judgement and recrimination, and she couldn't ever be happy.The complaints about the accents being wrong on these pages are irritating - remember Roy was based on an American in the Canadian Army, and anyway many of the aristocracy in Scotland are of English heritage (they don't all talk with a brogue you know). And I'm not so sure that employment for young women in London in 1914-15 would be as available as people are suggesting. The film makes quite an issue about the girls' search for and failure to find work - any work, such in teas shops etc. Definitely it would have been easier for women to find work in the munitions industries or in nursing later in the war - but early in the war not ALL men had volunteered and the war was not yet draining the life blood of the nation. It finally took military conscription to keep the meat grinder in Europe fed.I prefer to focus on the beauty (in fact sometimes the tragic beauty) in the movie, rather than it's faults. Surely the Auld Lang Syne scene in the Candlelight Club is one of the most beautiful, romantic things in movie-making. Just as Myra going under the ambulance's wheels at the end is one of the saddest tragedies. His desperate search for her before her suicide only compounds the tragedy. Roy still having her lucky charm more than 20 years later was a nice touch. It looked as though he might have never married, perhaps as he could never love any one else as he had loved her. His fond remembrances for a time and a love long ago make it even sadder.One thing that keeps coming back to me is how, when Vivien/Myra stares straight ahead with those beautiful blue eyes, unblinking and deep in thought and emotion (this happens several times in the film) it made me think of Olivier. It is the exact same look he used to use, maybe a technique they shared? Richard</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent acting, excellent movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Vivien Leigh, mainly because of her extreme beauty, but also because she was an excellent actress (may she rest in peace). In this movie she showed that she was much more than the selfish Scarlett O'Hara and as far as I'm concerned, she did a much better job here than in GWTW. If both these movies had been made today, her performance in GWTW would not have been considered at all by the academy, but I think 100% of them would have voted for her performance in Waterloo Bridge. The story is amazing, a little dated of course, but as the movie progresses, I was stunned by the performances of Leigh, Robert Taylor, C. Aubrey Smith, Virginia Field and last but not least, Maria Ouspenskaya. What a lady and what a performance! Check out the scene after Myra has received the message from Roy where "madame" takes control of the situation. Especially the line "...nor troop movements" is great. One thing that makes the movie much better than expected during the film is the end which is NOT a happy ending. Vivien Leigh's character actually dies. The remake "Gaby" (1956) starring Leslie Caron, also has some great moments, but I was very disappointed to see that she didn't die in the end. As if "The Green Mile" would have been such a great movie if John Coffey had been pardoned... I rate Waterloo Bridge a 10 out of 10 as it is one of my all time favourites...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Myra, a gorgeous ballerina, walking along the Waterloo bridge in London, meets handsome Roy Cronin during an air raid. It's clear they are meant for one another, but fate intervenes in mysterious ways, separating the lovers when Roy is activated to the front. Myra, who has defied Mme. Olga, the head of the ballet company where she is engaged, and her best friend Kitty, are left without a job at a time when it was hard to find employment.When Roy's mother, Mrs. Cronin, comes to London to meet the young woman, Myra has learned that her beloved man is listed among the casualties, but neglects to mention it to Mrs. Cronin, who senses Myra is going through some tough times, but she has no idea of what's really in the young woman's mind. When Kitty turns to prostitution in order to make ends meet, Myra has no other choice but to follow her friend.Waterloo train station is one of the places where Myra frequents, searching for men. When she sees Roy Cronin appear, she doesn't know what to think. Roy, who wants to marry her, takes Myra to Scotland to spend some time with his mother. It's at that place where Myra's recent past comes to haunt her. She is too much of decent woman to deceive Roy.Director Mervyn LeRoy's take on the 1932 remake of the Robert Sherwood's play, tries to sanitize the version because there was just so much that he could do in the Hollywood of that era. The film is not as explicit as the original version. Yet, Mr. LeRoy gave the movie a different look thanks to the cinematography of Joseph Ruttenberg and the additional material plays well in the context.Vivien Leigh, one of the most exquisite beauties of the movies, is perfect as Myra. In spite of the fact she wanted Lawrence Olivier to play Roy Cronin, she, and co-star, Robert Taylor, show an excellent chemistry. Ms. Leigh, who was fond of her work in the picture, makes the most of her character. Robert Taylor also makes an excellent appearance as the dashing man in love with Myra. Virginia Field gives also a great performance as Kitty. Lucile Watson, a great character actress appears as Mrs. Cronin and C. Aubrey Smith is seen as the Duke.It's clear why "Waterloo Bridge" is a film to watch over and over, thanks to the great work by Mr. LeRoy and his collaborators.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film - watching it alone a humid night in July. Photography is excellent - with all the streets of London, the fog, the shades of gray and the characters - who all are just that; good characters.Its theme is quite social-realistic, yet the movie is sentimental (in its own unique way) and not particularly obsessed with "looking" realistic, made by someone who obviously knew how to treat his clichés. I admire how effective the story is being told and played. I like the way the movie's subject is being treated - and left for the viewer to make a stand about.And of course Vivien Leigh is just fantastic in the way she leads us through the movie.

		<shortDescription>Vivien Leigh was never lovelier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When asked what her favorite film of her own was, Vivien Leigh brushed aside her Oscar winning roles as the southern belles Scarlet O'Hara and Blanche Dubois, settling on this little-known but much loved gem, Waterloo Bridge. This may come as a surprise to many whose favorite movie is Gone With the Wind or stage actresses who study every nuance of her Blanche, once you see this movie there is no doubt that this may be her loveliest performance--while her Oscars prove that she could deliver astoundingly good work under the notoriously difficult shoots on her famous two films, Waterloo Bridge is a testament to her grace, her subtlety, and her ability to never feel sorry for herself or beg the audience for pity--and therefore earns every inch of our attention.Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor), an aging soldier on the eve of WWII, remembers years earlier during the First World War (it's better if you ignore the obviously "modern" clothing and just enjoy the damn movie). He met and ballerina Myra Lester (Leigh), and oh boy how the fell in love (I have yet to see a sweeter or more beautifully photographed love scene than the Candlelight Club). However, just before they can find a way to get married, Roy is called unexpectedly early to the front. Myra misses a performance to say goodbye to him and is fired from the dance company. Along with her faithful best friend Kitty, Myra sinks lower and lower into poverty, and her faith is lost when she believes Roy is dead. Hopeless, she falls into prostitution (this is where Leigh is at her best--there is not a shred of self-pity in her performance when Myra becomes a "fallen woman."). How will she cover up her past when Roy shows up alive and suggests that she meet his crusty, upper-class family? The synopsis provided above has all the inklings of a sappy, forgotten melodramatic "woman's movie" that were popular in the 1940s. So why is it so good? Because in the hands of director Mervyn LeRoy and his stars Leigh and Taylor, they make you believe in these characters, hope for them and root for them. Myra is no Scarlet in the sense that she does not whine and wait for her love to come home. Even while delivering lines like, "I loved you, I've never loved anyone else. I never shall, that's the truth Roy, I never shall," Leigh is never flashy as her Scarlet may have been--when Leigh sinks into a role, she gets lost in it. Vivien Leigh gives a spirited and beautiful performance--she proved that her handling of Gone With the Wind was not mere luck but that she was talented and here to stay. Though Robert Taylor's role is not as complex as Leigh's--remember, this is a "chick flick"--they have wonderful chemistry together, obviously comfortable with each other's presence. While most romantic movies of today are simply composed of throwing two stars together without much chemistry, this is a movie that makes you ache for the old days and the old movies full of ambiguity, wry double-entendres and, above all, a sense of hope for real love.Do you think you'll remember Waterloo Bridge now? NOTE: Because of some cosmic fluke, this movie isn't available on (Region 1) DVD and a VHS copy is rare, but because of some cosmic fluke, this is one of the most popular movies of all time in China, resulting in many various imports. This is a movie worth seeking out, but double-check where you buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivien Leigh is marvelous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Vivien Leigh is best remembered for her star turn as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind (1939), her role in Waterloo Bridge is said to have been her favorite. Leigh's presence and performance alone provide the force and focus of what might otherwise have been a forgettable romance. She utterly outclasses romantic interest Robert Taylor in the projection of personality.To appreciate just how wonderful Leigh is in her role in this film (and give director LeRoy due credit for some first-class film-craft), take a step back from it all and you see'll how sentimental and shamelessly contrived is Robert Sherwood's plot. But it doesn't matter, really. Vivien Leigh's sensitivity to character and her unsurpassed charisma keep you watching and responding to every unlikely development. It's all very old-fashioned and still very moving, and Vivien Leigh is the main reason it all works so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful performance by a beautiful actress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this film, and it is confirmed: Vivien Leigh is my favorite actress of all time. She was, IMO, one of the greatest actresses of that time period. Her performance as Myra in Waterloo Bridge goes alongside Blanche Dubois and Scarlett O'Hara as one of her greatest. You know an actress/actor is doing a great job when they can get you emotionally involved in their character's plight--you feel for them and want the best for them. Well, that's what Ms. Leigh did to me when I saw this. For the film, it was a very good love story; sad in the way war came between the two lovers and caused her to fall into despair and death, and yet bittersweet in the ending--it's sad, but in a way uplifting. This is one of those four hanky films where the women, and perhaps even the men, get misty-eyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How is it I have missed this Vivien Leigh gem all these years?I am a huge fan of Vivien Leigh but have never seen this before today. I caught it on TCM but don't remember having ever seen it before, so they must not run it often. This is such a good film that I marvel it isn't shown more frequently.It won't leave you with a Hollywood "happy ending", so don't expect that. It is almost like it is 2 films: the first half is quite happy and romantic, while the latter half reveals the dark, cold side of survival during wartime. I think I had several unrealistic expectations going in - having read the TV synopsis, I was expecting a war romance. But there is very little "war", and the tragic elements in the latter half leave you with very little romance at the end.A fascinating undercurrent throughout the film is Myra Lester's (portrayed brilliantly by Vivien Leigh) defeatist attitude. Watch for it throughout the movie - and how it becomes essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy. Yes, she makes some very stupid decisions - i.e not telling the future mother-in-law what she just read in the paper at the restaurant, and running out on her only chance of happiness by not marrying Cronin. But I think it is because of her internal belief that nothing good will come to her. Though she makes attempts at happiness, ultimately, she is always waiting for the proverbial other shoe to drop. Leigh inhabits this role with such ease and makes it so believable. When she is truly happy and, for the moment, optimistic - she just beams. But her moments of sadness and despair are so palpable but without a shred of overacting or melodrama to her emotions. And that face of hers - watch it in several of the different close-ups at the train station as her emotions change before your eyes.I think the good luck charm brings an interesting element to the film as you follow who is in possession of it, and if it is bringing them good fortune. (I personally don't believe in superstitious trinkets but it makes for an interesting plot device nonetheless).There are numerous favorite scenes - The Farewell Waltz, how truly beautiful and romantic. I think the director used pure genius to not have any dialogue during this breath taking dance as the candles are being extinguished. I love when Myra is looking out the window in the rain and sees her Captain waiting unexpectedly in the rain for her. Whose heart doesn't jump during that scene? And her giddy reaction, running around the room trying to get ready to go meet him. And the restaurant scene as she scans the fallen officer list and the camera creates suspense by panning every so slowly down the alphabet. And what great camera perspective as she takes that long slow drink of wine and the camera zooms in on her anguished face, only to reveal Cronin's mother staring right at her. And Myra's reaction to the mother is so excruciating to watch - like a train wreck! I could just go on and on about the many things I love about the film. Leigh's and Taylor's chemistry is wonderful as they play off one another. I think Leigh is as beautiful in black and white as she was in the glorious Technicolor of GONE WTIH THE WIND.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a tear-jerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Waterloo Bridge" was to be a typical vehicle for Vivien Leigh's fresh fame, gained after her magnificent performance as Katie Scarlett O'Hara. The play by Robert Sherwood, on which the film was based, was quite different from the story revealed in the movie from 1940. Maybe because of censors. Most likely. But, although the story seems to be not any original one, there is something about this film that can't be forgotten.Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor knew each other, because they made their first screen appearance together 2 years earlier. Vivien played a very different role of seductive Elsa Craddock. Now she is Myra Lester, a poor young woman who is destiny is pain.The story is typical for a tear-jerker. Myra Lester (Vivien) is a young ballet dancer who, during the World War I, meets a soldier, Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor). They fall in love immediately, but the war and bad luck separates them.What is the quality of this movie? Of course, the direction. Mervyn Le Roy was a really good director, who proved he knew his job many, many times. But there is also a great cast. Lucille Watson is so warm as Mrs. Cronin. And C. Aubrey Smith also gives a nice, memorable performance. Maria Ouspenskaya is perfectly cast as the demanding Madame. The supporting performance I love most is this of Virginia Field. I really regret that I have never seen any other role of her. She never gained any stardom and few remember her now. I can't understand why. Her Kitty is a very powerful and unforgettable piece of acting job.Well, let's say something about the two leading actors. Robert Taylor is Robert Taylor-extremely handsome and charming. He plays Roy very good and is really good-looking. But playing opposite an actress with such a quality as Vivien Leigh had, demands more. Both Taylor and Leigh had beauty and persona on the screen. But Vivien was also an outstanding actress as well. And her portrayal of Myra shows it. I think that everybody who thinks that she was able to play only roles of women with great temper should see her Myra. Leigh's Myra is from the very begging "signed" with ache and pain. From the very beginning we do not know why, but we feel she won't be happy. She never is. She never believes in happy ending. Even when she smiles, it looks like she was aching. Her smile is full of pain. She manages to show something very different in the same time-coldness and warmth, happiness, but with pain. It is a performance worth of every possible award. I think that the best performances of 1940 were of Joan Fonataine's in "Rebecca" and of Vivien Leigh in "Waterloo Bridge", though Joan received the nomination for Oscar, and Vivien, surprisingly, not. And she should have won the award, without any doubt.Even if you are not fond of tear-jerker, you must see it. It's full of great acting job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much loved film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of Britain's entry into World War II, an officer walks across Waterloo Bridge and remembers the love of his life from World War I in "Waterloo Bridge," starring Vivien Leigh as Myra and Robert Taylor as Roy. Leigh is a beautiful ballerina who meets the dashing, handsome Taylor in an air raid shelter; love and tragedy follow. Believing her fiancée dead, fired from the ballet company, and her roommate turning tricks, Leigh, unable to find any other job, turns to the same life. Heavily made up and cheaply dressed, she's in Waterloo Station doing the "hello, soldier" thing when who should appear but Roy. He wants to take up where they left off and continue down the aisle.This is the type of movie one both loves and hates. Two of Hollywood's most dazzling stars, dancing to candlelight, involved in a beautiful romance - but she falls from grace and has to pay. It's unfair. Ditto Myrna Loy in "The Rains Came" and a million other movies.Leigh was such a wonderful actress. Fresh and vibrant in the beginning of the movie, she manages with a cold, hard facial expression to show that she's changed. Her guilt, her sorrow, her self-loathing are all deeply felt, yet she wants to believe she has a chance at happiness, and you can actually see the moments where she tries to talk herself into it. Robert Taylor is very good, though one can really see Olivier in this role. The part isn't as well structured as Leigh's and Olivier may have been able to mine it more. The camera loves Taylor, and his scene at the end of the film is extremely touching. Virginia Field is marvelous as Kitty, Leigh's true friend.This is a film that stays with you long after it's over. And the next time you hear the word "Waterloo," trust me, you won't think of Napoleon. You'll think of "Waterloo Bridge."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is truly lovely. Like "Random Harvest", it manages to create a sense of the vital centrality of love in someone's life - regardless of anything else going in the world or one's own life, it is so wonderfully mysterious that love for someone may completely take control. I would propose that the scene in the Candlelight Club is one of the three most romantic in movies. (The other two are Ronald Colman and Garson together by the fire in Random Harvest - and David Niven falling in love in the last moments of his life with the radio controller in the Battle of Britain while his Spitfire is on fire and spiraling out of control).One reviewer's comment about the availability of work for a woman during a war is true - and an unfortunate problem of credibility in the movie. Still, the movie is just SO enjoyable - and Vivien Leigh has never been more beautiful. It's very powerful and the music is wonderful - I can hear it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the tremendous acclaim Vivien Leigh received from Gone With the Wind topped off with that Oscar, there was tremendous interest in what her next project would be. After working so well with Gable in Gone With the Wind, MGM decided to team her with another of their romantic heart throbs Robert Taylor. What I don't understand is how as a newcomer to the USA, Leigh rated top billing over one of MGM's biggest box office draws. In any event Taylor must have conceded the top spot to her and would have if asked because he was always the most agreeable of contract players.Like Gable in Mutiny on the Bounty, Taylor does not even attempt a hint of a British accent. The film opens in 1939 a few days after the second World War starts. Taylor, now a field grade officer finds himself on Waterloo Bridge in London and he starts to think back to the first World War and his lost love who he met during a Zeppelin attack on London.That lost love was Vivien Leigh, an aspiring ballerina under the tutelage of Maria Ouspenskaya, one formidable old woman. The film is Taylor and Leigh's story. They are as romantic a pair of young lovers as has ever been seen on the silver screen. Leigh is more fragile here, more true to her own life, than she was as the independent and forceful Scarlett O'Hara. One cannot ever imagine Scarlett making the choices that Leigh's Myra Lester makes in Waterloo Bridge. Interesting how audiences accept Taylor as British without him even attempting an accent. The old American as Canadian gambit isn't even used to justify Taylor's presence in a British story. Shows that attractive and capable players can cover a certain amount of artistic sin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the only film that i have watched about four times and ended up crying at.Its always the last half an hour of the film where the tears start rolling,i wish i could go back in time to change the ending,and they both live happily ever after.But alas no.I don't know why this film in particular upsets me,i think its probably because there is so much chemistry between Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor that they really make such a beautiful couple,and they seem so natural together.If you watch vivien with Clark Gable in G.W.T.W the chemistry is not the same,although their performances were great,you can tell they were going all out to win Oscars,thats the difference.In Waterloo Bridge the film was on a much smaller budget,smaller sets and not a lot was expected of this film,as G.W.T.W was still circulating the cinemas,and yet Vivien always claimed this to be her favourite film of her whole career.Of coarse the film has flaws,but very minor ones .With a lot of 1940 films you have to use your imagination to get around the story,for instance,there was lots of jobs for women in 1914 helping towards the war effort,women also took the mens jobs when the men went to war,but then don't forget this is London and thousands of women are going after these same jobs,and the two girls need money for lodging straight away.They may not have intended to become full time prostitutes,as many didn't,but if you were young and pretty it was easy money,after all lots of women turned to prostitution during these times.Also i don't find Robert Taylors American accent that strong to detract from the story, Roy may be an Englishman who's travelled to the states,besides Myra says she was born in Birmingham,she definitely doesn't have a Birmingham accent,but then she doesn't say that shes lived there all her life.This film does play a lot on the viewers imagination,after all you never hear the word prostitute mentioned and yet you know what this film is about.Shame its not on sale in the UK,as it is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivien Leigh's Post Scarlett Superb Performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Waterloo Bridge' 1940 - Starring Vivien Leigh &amp; Robert Taylor. I remember watching this movie for the first time when I was about 17 years old. I also remember crying like a dithering idiot at the end of the film. I watched the film again for the first time since that initial experience only one week ago! 31 years later and I still had a lump in my throat and tears falling involuntarily down my face! This isn't a case of my own emotional vulnerability at the risk of sounding like an 'old sook'. Moreover, it was a perfect example of where character depiction in a story sees no weariness through the ages of time. This is due entirely to the magnificent performance of Vivien Leigh in this role. Vivien developed her character from a place that few actors can make claim to, and that was directly from her heart and from her soul. Now I am not trying to place an esoteric value on the depiction of how she played her role in the film, but moreover, recognition! Vivien Leigh connected 100 percent to the plight of her character and her performance in this role as testament to her real life experiences. Robert Taylor leaves a lot to be desired in his role as the love interest, and I find him stiff and lacking in the emotional proportions required for such a story. However, this does not detriment the film or the story within the film one bit, as every crucial moment during the plot is rescued by Leigh's stunning portrayal in every scene that Taylor appears with her. Leigh's ability to literally wear her heart on her sleeve is an understatement. Taylor pales in every scene with her and that is only because Leigh's interpretation is not only a personification of Leigh herself, but also her ability at displaying frailness and fragility which was an inherent component of Leigh herself. Every single time the camera focuses on her, the sheer uncertainty of where this woman will find herself in the next scene is written all over her face. Leigh's performance is so relaxed and honest that it almost appears as though there was never a camera there in the first place. This has to be a true reflection of Vivien Leigh as a person and what was to follow later on in her life. Leigh's plight, desperation and vulnerability are as raw and as naked as any actor could wish to portray! The irony of this is, and I am sure that Leigh was never aware of this at the time, is that it only makes her performance that much more memorable, believable and significant! This was the first film Leigh made after 'Gone with the Wind' and her depiction of this character couldn't be more removed from that of Scarlett O'Hara. It's for this reason alone that the film is a must see as it is such a contrast! I would have preferred Laurence Olivier in the role played by Taylor, but those films were yet to come! In my mind, 'Waterloo Bridge' is a magnificent example of where art imitates life! The raw emotions of rejection, the need to be loved and the uncertainty of what will happen in our lives next are as relevant now, as they were when the film was made! Vivien Leigh encapsulates these human insecurities in a unique timeless manner! The plot may seem 'old-hat' and the background of the story far removed as to any of our own personal experiences, but the truth of human plight remains the same! It is for this reason alone that I strongly suggest you watch this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just incredible romantic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's truly terrific film in its own rights. I really enjoy watching this film a lot. No wonder Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh have mentioned that Waterloo Bridge is their favorite and indeed it's on my top 100, which is very impressive. The atmosphere is just beautiful and you just don't see that in modern films anymore. I believed that Taylor and Leigh should have get the nominations for Academy Awards for this film. What really impressed me a lot about this film that this film used flashback sequence to gain our sympathy for both characters, which Taylor and Leigh played. The direction is very flawless and it's just very enjoyable film. Taylor had fell in love with Leigh, which is very fantastic. Wonderful sequence is when they dance together in very dark restaurant. I really enjoy that a lot. Maybe I'm sucker for romantic films but who knows?I believe that if I'm watching this film over and over, it's more likely that I would even wish for different ending than the original ending but it just worked that way. Like one of the user who wrote a review for this film, she thought she would see different ending everytime she saw it but it always hit her. Maybe that's same case with me. Really terrific film. I wish DVD version of Waterloo Bridge would be available. I don't think it's fair that this is probably most overlooked film of all time because it's truly terrific film. I really enjoy this film a lot.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, how I loved this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just caught a glimpse of this unknown masterpiece on Vivien's biography, and I decided to purchase it! I was simply stumped to why this did not receive a bigger audience (although it was released not even 6 months after GWTW was released). Vivien Leigh is spectacularand totally un-Scarlett,as a fragile ballerina who meets hunky Robert Taylor on the infamous bridge where they fall in love. He is called to duty just before they are to be married. She is heartbroken, and must wait. It is horrible the way her soon-to-be mother-in-law treats her and makes her wait at the cafe, and she is badly treated by her ballet instructor who throws her out because of her new love. She must, reluctantly, turn to prostitution to make ends-meet. The soldier returns to find a tired woman, and with tragic results. The ending is just too much to bear, I cried for nearly an hour. A great movie for a rainy day, or anytime (especially if you're a big fan of the lead actress, note: my surname). A chance to see a nice Vivien Leigh movie that is totally opposite of the fiery mistress of Tara. 9/101940 109 minutes Rated: G CC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical errors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie and until I searched the internet did not realise there is an earlier (more original version), The first noticeable error was that there were no air raid sirens in 1914 as the Germans and the Allies had few bombers or even aircraft that could be used as such, So the presence of searchlight batteries in the background is a surprise. There were Zepplins of course but the first actual raid on London (which was considered to be an accident) was in 1915.There were raids on the ports and facilities closer to coast but in 1914 the usual method of attacking flying craft was with machine guns and rifles, most artillery had to be adapted to be able to rotate the barrels higher, The first allied air force of any consequence was in France.There were no air raid shelters or even anyone authorised to make use of any facilities for their use. The first two purpose built AA guns were used in 1915 and had their first success in April of that year (one aircraft was shot down), The air precautions act was not passed until 1934 and the first Government circular was not issued until 1939 designating and creating the role of air raid wardens and that the underground stations could be used for that purpose.The second error was that they could not be married due to their residential status under the existing (at that time) marriage act, regardless of the time of day. The most puzzling thing to me is how did Robert Taylor get the "lucky charm" back ?. unless she had some form of identification (which was not required) on her person when she was killed and who would be able to identify the body and inform him so that the charm could be obtained from the police.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waterloo Bridge (1940) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Very impressive remake of James Whale's 1931 film tells the story of war torn lovers. Robert Taylor plays the British officer and Vivian Leigh plays the dancer who fall in love after meeting on Waterloo Bridge but before they can marry he's called off to the war. During the war money is hard to come by and after she hear that he's been killed in action, she begins working as a prostitute only to have him walk back into her life. I watched the original version of this film earlier in the year and really loved the raw and tragic elements of the story and while this version is watered down there's still enough here to make this one of the greatest love stories from Hollywood's golden age. Leigh is downright terrific in her role as she perfectly sales her innocence in the early scenes and then shows off her anguish at the end. She perfectly captures this sad and lonely spirit and her work with Taylor makes for a great combo. This is the best I've ever seen Taylor who nails all his scenes, especially the opening and closing sequences where he says all we need to know with just his eyes. Lucile Watson, Virginia Field and Maria Ouspenskaya add great support. I think a lot of the love stories from this period have dated over the years but this one contains all the power and emotion of the original story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a tear-jerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both the 1931 and 1940 films of 'Waterloo Bridge' are very good and well worth watching in their own way. Some elements are done better in one than the other if one must compare, but despite being in the shadow of the 1940 film the 1931 version is much underrated.The 1931 version is darker, grittier, steamier and more ahead of its time (plus more faithful to the original story), but this reviewer leans a little more towards the more lavish and even more poignant 1940 film, despite it being tamer and more romanticised. There is one element that is preferred personally in the earlier version than here and that's the male lead.Robert Taylor is certainly dashing, shares a very tender chemistry with Vivien Leigh and has very rarely been more handsome, but he is also a little stiff and dull in places for my liking (Leigh apparently wanted Laurence Olivier for the role and he would have been a better choice) and Kent Douglass was more effective bringing out the character's naivety.On the other hand, it is very lavishly produced with sumptuous costumes and sets with immaculately directed. Mervyn Leroy directs with elegant simplicity, atmosphere and momentum always consistent, while Herbert Stothart's music score is even more memorable, more lush and more haunting, in perfect keeping with the more "melodramatic" feel.'Waterloo Bridge's' (1940) script is intelligent and surprisingly multi-faceted, and the execution of the story is what gives this version the slight edge over the earlier film. Despite being tamer, lacking the darkness and grit of the 1931 film due to code constraints, the story did move me a little more and the ending is less erratic, less random and less abrupt - it's incredibly moving too- if ever so slightly contrived still.The characters are very well written, and the chemistry between the two leads is remarkably tender. There is a sterling supporting cast, with a scene stealing and charmingly loyal Virginia Field, a sly C. Aubrey Smith and a sympathetic Lucile Watson. Vivien Leigh's heart-breaking performance- to me she and Mae Clarke are about equal- is the one that dominates and it one for the ages and every bit as good as her performances that garnered her Oscars.In summary, such a beautifully done and tear-jerking. If you're asking which of the 1931 and 1940 films to watch, check out both of them, they are well worth it. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The luminous Vivien Leigh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in the heyday of the studio system and movie stars, Waterloo Bridge is one of those films that once seen, will remain forever unforgettable. It features the upbeat Robert Taylor and the incandescent Vivien Leigh. Forget the outdated elements of the plot: surrender yourself to the luminous on-screen presence of Vivien Leigh, and you will not be able to take your eyes off her. That face goes through a gamut of emotions, particularly in the restaurant scene when she waits for Lady Cronin alone at her table, as she slowly turns her attention to the newspaper. Robert Taylor is no slouch here, too. He shines in the opening scene of the film, as he stands on the bridge. Both actors are outstanding, and there is a palpable chemistry between them. Virginia Field, Maria Ouspenskaya, C. Aubrey Smith, and Lucile Watson complement the two stars in one of the most romantic films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly One of the Most Romantic Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only just saw this movie for the first time on TCM and was completely and utterly mesmerized by Vivian Leigh and Robert Taylor. The scene in the Candlelight Club is so beautiful I am still dreaming about it. The dreamy ambiance of the whole movie just pulled me in so that halfway through the movie I just started bawling, knowing that there had to be a tragic ending. Nothing makes a woman feel better than a good cry at an old romantic movie. The only movie that made me cry more was "Wuthering Heights" starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. They just don't make truly romantic movies like that anymore. I guess that's due to the lack of any truly innocent characters in modern screen writing or literature and it's the tragic loss of innocence that makes the most romantic stories.</fullReview>

Myra is a dancer and falls upon bad times and is protected by her girlfriend, who supports her and brings her back to health. However, Myra turns her life around and takes a different path in life she never thought she would ever take. This is a very romantic and heart breaking story, and somehow, I think things could have turned out differently if a certain person told the Truth from the very start.

		<shortDescription>Vivien Leigh's favorite film, BUY IT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waterloo Bridge was another brilliant performance by the incomparable Vivien Leigh, along with her sometime costar, Robert Taylor. This film was done immediately after Gone With the Wind, just before GWTW was released (1939-40 era). Vivien was still clearly at her peak here. This romantic saga will envelope you completely to want what is best for Myra Lester (Leigh) and Roy Cronin (Taylor). Even though this film was done 65 years ago, it is still relevant today.It is amazing how insightful this piece is considering that it was done just at the opening of World War II. There was clearly some war propaganda here: the big rich American actor (playing a Brit) taking care of the beautiful English girl. Look how things fall apart when they get separated.Having viewed most of Miss Leigh's available work, this is easily in the top three with Gone With the Wind and Streetcar Named Desire. All three films are very different and show her grat talent and versatility. Do not miss Waterloo Bridge.Copies can be found on ebay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Every parting from you is like a little eternity."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the eve of World War II, British officer Robert Taylor thinks back to his time in the first World War and his romance with ballerina Vivien Leigh. The second film version of Robert Sherwood's play is a glossy MGM production, which brings with it certain pros and cons compared to the 1931 version made at Universal. For starters, it has first-rate production values. Although it's separated by less than a decade from the other film, the technical aspects of filmmaking had come a long way in a short time. The cast, direction, cinematography, and music score are all excellent. This is a polished, beautiful film with two of the most attractive leads in movie history. Which leads to the main complaint I have about this film. The original Pre-Code film was grittier and seamier, both in terms of its production and its script. The script here was rewritten to make Vivien Leigh's character more 'acceptable' by the standards of the Production Code. This leads to some head-scratching plot points and an ending that is, quite frankly, the film's weakest part. I don't want to give too much away but I'll just say that up until the ending this was one of my favorite romantic movies of all time. If they had just followed the outline of the original story but kept the MGM gloss on the romantic parts, I would score this a ten. As it is with the changes, I have to knock a little off. Still, it's a picture any classic film fan will want to see at least once. Any movie with Maria Ouspenskaya in it is worth a look. It's a prime example of the lovely old-fashioned style of melodrama that MGM excelled at. It's not close to perfect but few movies are.</fullReview>

Vivien Leigh's face was a silent mirror as she ran the emotions of love and then horror when she knew she would be found out. Taylor gives an inspired performance, and they seemed to have strong chemistry on screen. The supporting cast was terrific. As an amateur historian, I am mystified by the terrible costuming and hair that fit the 1940 issue date, not the 1914-15 period of the story. How could all the trucks (lorries) be so right and the soldier's equipment and the men's and women's costumes be so wrong? I wish Vivien Leigh had made a hundred more films for us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waterloo Bridge....a Beautiful Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Taylor is an officer in WWII London, who chances to meet ballerina Vivien Leigh in this story of love, sacrifice, and faith. Of course, they fall in love, but his leave is cancelled and he is ordered back to the front. Thus, the crust of the film is established. But, this is far from a suspenseful, plot-driven movie. Instead, the viewer is given a rarity from 30/40s Hollywood: a truly beautiful, moving experience as we are thrown completely into Vivien's world, that rests solely on her ability to captivate her audience. From one pivotal moment in the middle of the movie, you're in it for the long haul, and everything she feels, you feel with her. You feel like it's happening to you. If you've not seen this very special and romantic film, you're missing the best of Hollywood. They just don't make them like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic film about how a few crucial missed opportunities lead to doom for a young dancer. The film does its best to portray as touching a love story as is possible to put on screen, with handsome young Robert Taylor and eternally beautiful and elegant Vivian Leigh, who share a great dance in a club as the house band extinguishes one candle after another in an ever darkening scene that evokes a lot of emotion and is marvelously filmed, choreographed, and acted between Taylor and Leigh. It's not so much their social class difference which does them in as misfortune for Leigh and her roommate who are both fired from their positions as dancers in a troupe run with an iron hand by a strict matron, and who sink into prostitution, a field in which, by those prevailing social standards during which the film is set (WWI England) and from which there is no chance of rehabilitation. Leigh's transformation into that life grips the viewer thanks to her great talent. Unfortunately, it's a little bit overdone and too played out, though that's the fault of the script and not Leigh's, whose film this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching, sentimental film, but seriously flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a touching story, and a nice film, but it is rather too seriously flawed to be regarded as a "great" film. One of the rather obvious flaws (as pointed out by many reviewers) is that unskilled female workers were in high demand during WWI (to work on munitions etc.) so there was absolutely no danger of unemployment or need to resort to desperate measures.But the main flaw by a long way was the casting of an American in the role of an upper-class British officer. And it's not just the completely blatant American accent--the character portrayed by Robert Taylor IS an American. He's brash, self-assured, suave, glib, impetuous and extravagant--and none of these characteristics are what one would associate with an English (let alone Scots!) gentleman of that period! When British characters act like this, they are generally being portrayed as "cads" (see Terry Thomas or Patrick Macnee for example)--only an American can pull off this sort of behaviour and still appear charming.See how Robert Taylor's character is completely at odds with those of his mother and uncle who are perfectly portrayed as they would actually have been--could this man really have been a member of that family? And the cultural dissonance here is not merely an aesthetic problem--it's a problem with the unrealistic way the character behaves throughout the film--would an Anglo-Scots gentleman have been so brash and overconfident in making a proposal of marriage in 1914? No, he would not, and the way he would have acted would, I think, have made for a more interesting and poignant film. Robert Donat would have been ideal for the lead role (he needn't necessarily have been quite as shy and retiring as Mr. Chips!), and he would have added emotional depth to the character of Capt. Cronin (who comes across as a little superficial, as well as just blatantly American).That aside, I felt another flaw was a poor representation of the period. Although I am not an expert in the style and dress of the WWI period, the film did seem, overall, to be set at a time contemporary with its making. Vivien Leigh's hairstyle, for example, seemed anachronistic. Also, and more importantly, the horrors of trench warfare were in no way even *hinted* at--why are all the men at Waterloo Station, returning from the front, so apparently at ease with themselves? They've just seen their best friends blown to pieces on the battlefield! It doesn't make sense! Where is the sense of anger at the Hun, on the streets of London? It isn't there. And what of Robert Taylor's rather smug and cosy explanation of his war exploits? It's almost as though he's just returned from a blissful holiday on the continent!Finally, another reviewer has commented that the "insidious" British class system in some way had an effect on the fate of the female protagonist. This is not only insulting, but absurd. If we leave aside the fact that the Captain is a typical American in every conceivable way and displays *no* British characteristics whatsoever, we can see that the two people who were the most noble and kind to Myra were the Captain's aristocratic mother, and The Duke himself! In fact, the Captain's mother is apparently very willing to forgive Myra and only allows her to depart because she does not seem to be able to forgive herself--I think this rather amply demonstrates the level of her compassion and understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bridge of Sorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the way the bridge itself is used by the original playwright (Robert Sherwood) to create a sense of structural unity to this very tragic story. This is where the film opens, in the midst of World War II in London, as Captain Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor) reminisces about his past and as a flashback immediately delivers us to the very same spot, where he meets ballerina Myra Lester (Vivien Leigh) during the chaos and panic of an air raid during the earlier world war. It is also the very same place where Myra meets her doom, not only once when she is compelled to negotiate with her first "client" but a second time with her dramatic and heartbreaking final end. At the film's conclusion, we are once again brought to the bridge with Captain Cronin. The flashback of his life is over, and he, along with the rest of Britain and much of the world, must contend with yet another major, catastrophic war. Somehow, life must go on.The acting in this film is exceptional, not only on the part of the two leads but of their entire supporting cast. Depending on the material that is handed to her, Ms. Leigh is almost always outstanding. More about her later. As to Mr. Taylor, I believe that this must rate as one of his finest performances. One of the most unforgettable moments in this film, if not in all of cinema, is his facial expression when he finally, fully understands the kind of life that Myra was forced to lead after she mistakenly believes that he was killed in action. It should not surprise us that this film and the roles that they played were considered the very favorites of both leads. We can see it in every word and in every emotion that they deliver to us so beautifully. Clearly, Ms. Leigh and Mr. Taylor love what they are doing, and we love watching them do it.Their supporting cast also delivers very, very well. The amazingly versatile Maria Ouspenskaya, who has played every kind of role under the sun from the kindly Baroness in Dodsworth to the spooky Maleva in The Wolf Man, is absolutely detestable as the tyrannical, even inhuman ballet director who sets much of the tragic action in motion by her cruel and obsessive behavior. At the other end of the likable spectrum is C. Aubrey Smith as Roy's powerful but compassionate relation. Virginia Field is excellent as Myra's lovable and loyal best friend. Finally, Lucile Watson is very convincing in her role of Roy's aristocratic mother, Lady Margaret. The two critical scenes in which she appears demand a wide range of strong emotions, and her wonderful performance is a vital contribution to the entire movie.I was struck by the extreme contrast of the poverty and near starvation of Myra and Kitty, on one hand, and the wealth and opulence of Roy's family and neighbors. This contrast of what life actually became for Myra and what life could have been for Myra is a major factor in the immense tragedy of this film. Somehow, the situation reminded me of the circumstances behind "A Place in the Sun", but that is a different review for another time. If only the waitress in the restaurant didn't hand Myra the newspaper, her life would have turned out totally different. Just one, slight gesture by an innocent bystander determines the entire fate of two very important lives. This is excellent writing, and it takes a very gifted cast to make the script soar even higher, along with our emotions as viewers.No review should omit the contribution of Herbert Stothart's beautiful musical score, especially at the most critical moments of the film, including Myra's discovery of the erroneous report of Roy's death and when we want to hope, beyond all hope, that Myra and Roy would live happily ever after with the melancholy interpretations of "Auld Lang Syne" and "Let Me Call You Sweetheart" in the background during the country estate segment. I don't know about you, but my heart was already breaking at Lady Margaret's party, and it must have been because of that haunting music which hinted ever so slightly at the tragic events that would soon follow.Credit goes to Mervyn LeRoy, as director, for the quality of the entire film. The parade of Red Cross lorries on the bridge near the end was another effective warning to the viewers of the tragedy that would soon ensue.My one regret about this film was its reminder to us that the real Vivien Leigh was taken from this world far too soon. I count only about 18 total works in her remarkable but much too short film career. I would have loved more, but I value what we do have and what we can continue to love even after many, many viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have the 'Caeser &amp; Cleopatra' film, as well as 'Gone With The Wind,' 'That Hamilton Woman', 'Anna Karennina, 'A Yank At Oxford,' and 'A Streetcar Named Desire' however, 'Waterloo Bridge' is my favorite. Lady Olivier was gorgeous and her ability to take on such a role on a subject that may not have been palatable to others at the time. It took me a long time to find this film, and when I did I was not disappointed. Of all the films listed above I found her quiet beauty and her hope for herself in this particular film captivating. In my humble opinion, Vivien Leigh surpasses even Katherine Hepburn. If you can find 'Waterloo Bridge' you too will love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a terrific melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was bored tonight so looked and found this wonderful gem of a movie. The title actually is the catalyst for this drama. First we meet the star crossed lovers then we see the heroine fall from grace and at the end how the movie ends. The acting is superb and I would like to say when Miss Leigh is on the screen it crackles with life and energy and watch her eyes how she does not have to say a word as her eyes are her voice I find that is such a skill she has and in addition her eyes are mesmerizing. At the start we find her character young and full of love and happiness and then watch her fall into despair over a love she thinks she has lost but then when she finds out that her love is alive she cannot live with the shame that she brought upon herself. I was moved and this movie I could watch over and over just for Miss Leigh. Robert Taylor was good along with the fine character actors in the MGM casting. In many ways you could say that Vivien Leigh had a skill at playing the doomed heroine but she is so good and yes so gorgeous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great romantic drama. Moving, and ultimately quite sad - certainly not your average romantic movie. Very original, even after all these years. Also quite intriguing, as you know roughly how things are going to work out, but you don't know why, until the end (my money was on the old crone from the ballet company screwing things up...).Superb performance from the beautiful Vivien Leigh. Every sentence and expression is perfectly nuanced. Solid performance in the male lead by Robert Taylor. Good support from Virginia Field and Lucile Watson.They certainly don't make romantic dramas like they used to...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Myra Lester, Vivien Leigh has seldom given a more lovely or accomplished performance. There is a world of difference between her depiction of the sweet-faced innocent who is mistaken for a school-girl at the start of the film and the sullen, worn creature who saunters through Waterloo Station... and then is miraculously reborn. Myra's face is an open book, and Leigh shows us every shade of feeling. In a reversal of expectations, she is the practical, hesitant one, while Roy, older, is the impetuous dreamer; a role in which Robert Taylor is both endearing and truly convincing. I find few cinematic romances believable, but for me this lightning courtship rings utterly true in every glance or smile that passes between them, from the moment they catch sight of each other for the second time.Virginia Field also shines as Myra's friend, the hardbitten ex-chorus-girl Kitty, while C.Aubrey Smith provides sly humour as an unexpectedly supportive Colonel-in-Chief and Lucille Watson is both stately and sympathetic as Lady Margaret. But this is really Vivien Leigh's film, with Taylor's more than able aid, and she is transcendent.'Waterloo Bridge' has a touch of everything: laughter, tears, tension, misunderstanding, sweetness, beauty and fate. It couldn't be made in today's Hollywood without acquiring an unbearable dose of schmaltz; in the era of 'Pretty Woman' it probably couldn't be made at all. But of its kind it is perfect. The only caveat I'd make, under the circumstances a minor one, is that -- as again in 'Quentin Durward' fifteen years later -- Robert Taylor's lone American accent in the role of a supposed Scot is from time to time obtrusive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully filmed and acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very romantic film with fine actors. Robert Taylor is quite American, but it seems that Hollywood intentionally used Americans in films that were supposed to have all (or nearly all) British characters so that American audiences would not find the films too 'foreign.' Some of the supporting characters in Frank Capra's 1936 "Lost Horizon" come to mind, for instance. While Robert Taylor is of ideal stature and appearance in "Waterloo Bridge", a British actor like Ronald Colman would have been a better fit (though he was beginning to get on in years by 1940). Colman did appear in Mervyn LeRoy's "Random Harvest" two years later, and, interestingly, the haunting music of "Swan Lake" makes its way into that film, too. Vivien Leigh does not even seem to be acting in "Waterloo Bridge". It is as if she and the role were one, which is a supreme compliment to an actor. And it is always a pleasure to see a veteran character actor like C. Aubrey Smith, usually cast as blustery (but lovable) curmudgeons---retired generals and the like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine picture with a radiant Vivien Leigh...I just wish it weren't so sad. This was her first picture after GWTW, and I actually liked her much more in this one, probably because her character was more sympathetic.It's interesting that because most of the film is done via flashback, you immediately know how things will unfold, and you watch the rest of the film just waiting to see how they get to the ending that you already know will happen.I can't quite figure why they cast Robert Taylor in the lead male role, as the film is set in the UK and he doesn't even attempt a British accent. I think William Powell would have been better, but that's probably just a nit.Although some parts are dated (how could they not be), a really good film when you're in an emotional mood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Acting, Lovely Score, Bit Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is of its time - one of those WW II "weepies" where you just know things are going to end badly. But, it is so beautifully shot and directed - the score is lovely and the acting is top notch. Leigh and Taylor have such amazing chemistry - it just leaps off the screen. I had only seen Taylor in all of his Ivanhoe type films and was so impressed with his performance here. He plays off of Leigh wonderfully and their scenes are so real and romantic (even when some of their spoken lines are hokey and corny). The rest of the cast is magnificent - Virginia Field as her fallen friend, Kitty and C. Aubrey Smith playing a role he played a hundred times, that of the British officer/gentlemen. A great film to catch on cable - as I said, parts of it are dated but for what it is - a romantic tragedy - it is one of the best. Written by the terrific writer, Robert Sherwood who also wrote Hitchcock's Rebecca and my favorite film of all time, The Best Years Of Our Lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine performances hamstrung by a weak plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This script desperately needed another revision.After learning that Britain has just declared war on Germany in 1939, the movie opens with an aged army officer driven through London to catch a train in order to sail to France to begin fighting in WWII. He seems a solid chap, and he turns out to be Robert Taylor, who orders his driver to detour his route to Waterloo Station by going via Waterloo Bridge. We learn this man fought in WWI. He's a hardened soldier. He stops at the bridge and calmly reminisces about a woman. He even has a small good luck charm.Utter nonsense. As we learn by the end of the movie, the man loved the woman in a tragic, miraculous romance. No soldier would cheerily allow himself the indulgence of "fondly" thinking about something that came to such a horrible, tragic end. This movie is a heart-render, a tear-jerker of the first order. Your guts get cut out. No man would want to relive this. A soldier would simply close the door of his memory and blot it out of his mind just like he would a horrible battlefield experience. Yet Taylor with a bit of a smirk goes and daydreams on the bridge about a woman who he one time said he will "love forever". The bulk of the movie is seen through this flashback contrivance which has you gritting your teeth with annoyance five minutes into the picture.That's your opening. A tragic twist of mistaken identity causes the crisis in the movie. Our heroine Myra (played by the astounding Vivian Leigh - more on her in a moment) learns of the tragedy as she is just about to meet her future fiancé's mother. Myra is in shock and comes off badly with the future mother-in-law, who is very gracious and still hopes that the two can one day be "good friends". Fast forward to the climax of the movie, where Myra is wrestling with the results of the tragic twist. She seeks out the future mother-in-law, who again has said that she knows that the two of them will be "good friends." But in Myra's time of need - in great crisis - the mother-in-law DOES NOT act like a good friend; she DOES NOT take her years of experience and guide young Myra through her crisis. She stands idly by like she just met someone at the library. Either take out the multiple references to "good friends" - OR - have her act like a good friend! Total failure of vision. The mother is a fine full character until the moment of crisis and then she becomes a cardboard cut out, leaving us alone in agony waiting for the destruction of Vivian Leigh. No movie with such a sequence can be a 10.Hence the movie gets an 8.On the plus side is the incredibly beautiful Vivian Leigh bathing us in a large array of emotions via her heavenly face. Her beauty is striking. And the emotions that shine through that beauty make them all the more powerful. She walks the line of frailty trying to become strong with great grace. Taylor, who always seems to be aping that annoying Errol Flynn "what, me worry?" positivism, has found the perfect role here for his talents and dispositions. His optimism about his new fiancé', his instantaneous love, only serve to remind us just how beautiful Myra (Ms. Leigh) is. It underscores the miracle of the movie: if YOU were to randomly meet Vivian Leigh in a bomb shelter, wouldn't YOU fall in love with her? Those things do happen in life, and having them happen with Ms. Leigh makes them especially precious. Once you get swept up in the miracle, the movie sails away and takes you on a fine ride - until the crisis, and a good friend acting badly.The beginning, the ending, the lucky charm are all incredibly weak and annoying. But in the middle is a fine film and perhaps Ms. Leigh's greatest performance.</fullReview>

It's otherwise well directed and photographed, too. Surely many people will love it if for nothing more than its stars.

		<shortDescription>Waterloo Bridge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie but have noticed a mistake in the script continuity that the screenplay writers or someone at M-G-M should have noticed. After Myra and Roy meet during the air-raid on Waterloo Bridge, the scene elapses to an Underground shelter where they chat but never exchange names. Afterward Roy shows up at the ballet and when it is finished he sends a note to Myra in the backstage dressing room that is handed from dancer to dancer until it reaches Myra. The evil Madame of the ballet demands the note from Myra and orders her to write him back explaining that she can't meet him. When Madame asks her "What is his name?", Myra replies "I do not know". Afterward Myra's friend Kitty rushes out the stage door in secret and assures Roy that Myra will meet him later on that night and he looks at her with a confused look on his face as if he didn't even know who Myra was and asks "Myra?". According to the script, up to that point he didn't know. I want to know just who he addressed that letter to that he had sent to the dressing room. This oversight annoys me more than the unrealistic accents of three of the lead player. Vivien Leigh's lovely English accent is much too refined and gentrified to make us believe that she is an orphaned, impoverished woman. Robert Taylor's blatant Oklahoman accent does not sound Scottish at all nor does Lucille Watson's very, very English accent as his Mother. Also, when Roy comes back to London to search for Myra after she leaves his Scottish home, he goes and knocks on the door of Myra's friend Kitty's apartment which is now across the hall from where it was during the first half of the film. Did she move? And if so, how does Roy know which door is hers? Oddly enough I've found a continuity error in the original 1931 version as well. After Myra and Roy meet he tells her that he had been living in the States with his Mother and his English Stepfather until he left for war. Afterward, in the middle of the picture when he actually meets the stepfather, the stepfather says that he's only been to America a couple of times and hardly knows America or Americans at all. How do these flaws work for screenplay writers? Does anybody out there know? Bottom line: Waterloo Bridge 1931 version *** stars out of **** stars and Waterloo Bridge 1940 version ***1/2 stars out of **** stars.</fullReview>

Every now and again, he'd say something vaguely English-sounding, and I'd wonder if maybe he was actually supposed to be English. However, the whole matter was resolved some way into the film when it transpired that the character was actually Scottish (?!?)Fantastic casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful picture that you will never forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently had the pleasure of seeing "Waterloo Bridge" on the big screen, and it was an experience not to be missed! One of the most beautiful, saddest and romantic movies ever made, "Waterloo Bridge" has, in the words of noted film historian Bill Collins, "never been accorded the esteem it so richly deserves", despite being an audience favourite for over 60 years.What's with all this carping about Robert Taylor's accent? I do not think his voice was jarring or anachronistic at all...Taylor's cultured 1930s American accent is reasonably close to British voices as displayed in this movie, as were the accents of most American stars of the period- which is why someone like (say) Ida Lupino could convincingly play the sister of Joan Leslie, Roland Young and Douglas Fairbanks Jr made a sterling father-and-son combo, and did American Myrna Loy stand out like a sore thumb next to Irishman George Brent in "The Rains Came", in which they both played British aristocrats? No, she did not. Besides, even if Taylor's accent was not perfect, (and I think it was perfection), isn't it more important that he played the role of Captain Cronin so wonderfully, with such romantic energy and heartbreaking sincerity? (Look at all the emotion he conveys, using just his eyes, in the final scene on the bridge.) And my goodness, he is just fantastically good looking as well! I do not think he comes across as overly "American" in personality, either. As we all know, the British do not have a monopoly on such characteristics are reservedness and restraint, just as brashness and confidence are not strictly American qualities. Besides, nationalistic stereotyping is something we need *less* of in movies, not more! (As an Australian, I know whereof I speak- Steve Irwin, can you hear me?)Robert Taylor's fine performance is matched by those of Vivien Leigh, Virginia Field (who probably should have won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this movie), Lucile Watson and C. Aubrey Smith. Special mention should also be made of the outstanding musical score by Herbert Stothart, whose arrangement of "Auld Lang Syne" sets the scene for one of cinema's all-time great romantic scenes in the Candlelight Club. We also get such favourites as "Smiles", "It's A Long Way to Tipperary", "The Minstrel Boy" and "Loch Lomond" as well as Stothart's memorable original theme- a sad little waltz underscoring the doomed romance of Myra and Roy.All in all, if your heart doesn't break during this movie, you may want to check for a pulse, or perhaps consider emergency cardiac surgery!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what I call a "procrastination movie". In other words, it is a one of those "must see" films that your friends told you to see, and you wound up "putting it off" for a long period of time for one reason or another. When you finally took the time to see it ... you wind up "kicking" yourself for waiting for so long to see it. Dumb me! I did the same thing with films like "North By Northwest" and "Glory. Vivien Leigh plays Myra, a ballerina, who meets Captain Roy Cronin, Robert Taylor on Waterloo Bridge during an air raid in London. The two are forced by fate to share several hours together. Sound familiar? Kind of like Rhett Butler's fateful situation of sleeping on a couch and running into Scarlet O'Hara after a conversation with Leslie Howard. Yep! It's Gone With The Wind all over again .... two people madly in love finding themselves surrounded by the chaos of war as they suffer the trials and tribulations of separation and reunion placed by circumstance. It is also my understanding that Vivien Leigh had to agree by contract to make this film when she signed for the role of Scarlet O'Hara in "Gone With The Wind". What a great flick this is! There is no question in my mind that this is Robert Taylor's greatest performance, and Vivien Leigh's 2nd best performance. How could she or anyone possibly top her Scarlet O'Hara? How does it end? I'll never tell ... but I wills tell you this .... Maria Ouspenskaya, who plays Leigh's Balarina Mentor, makes Bette Davis and Joan Crawford look like Girl Scouts when it comes to playing a "queen bee".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not done well, but one is surprised to see it done at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Waterloo Bridge" started life as a stage-play; this is the second of three cinematic adaptations. (The others are a 1931 film, also called "Waterloo Bridge", and "Gaby" from 1956). The film opens on 3rd September 1939, the day World War II broke out. Roy Cronin, a senior officer in the British Army, is travelling to France to join his regiment. He briefly stops on Waterloo Bridge to reminisce about his experiences during the First World War, and the rest of the story is told in flashback. His memories, however, are not of the actual fighting but of his romance with a beautiful ballerina named Myra Lester whom he first met on the bridge. The two plan to marry, but are prevented from doing so by circumstances. Myra loses her job with the ballet company whose formidable director, Madame Olga Kirowa, objects to her relationship with Roy. (Her surname was presumably chosen to suggest an association with the famous Kirov Ballet, although the ballet did not acquire that name, that of an assassinated Soviet politician, until 1934). Believing- wrongly- that Roy has been killed in action, and unable to find alternative employment, Myra and her friend Kitty descend into prostitution to prevent themselves from starving.Yes, you heard right. Prostitution. And that in the heyday of the Production Code. I have never seen the 1931 version of this story, but understand that it dealt with the subject much more frankly and as a result was banned in America after the Code came into force. It is therefore surprising that MGM could get away with making a remake, although the subject is dealt with very cautiously. (As Dr Johnson said of a dog walking on its hind legs, it is not done well, but one is surprised to see it done at all). The dreaded p-word is never actually uttered, and the dubious nature of Myra and Kitty's method of earning a living is conveyed only by euphemism and innuendo. Nevertheless, the audience is left in no doubt that the two are what would have been called, in the language of the day, "fallen women".Which leads us to the film's greatest plot-hole. The screenwriters were doubtless influenced by memories of the "hungry thirties" when many women may well have faced the unenviable choice which confronts Myra and Kitty. As others have pointed out, however, economic conditions in 1917/18 were very different. Even if Myra and Kitty could not find work as dancers (and there must have been many West End shows catering for soldiers on leave), there were a great number of other jobs available to women, either in work directly related to the war effort (nursing, munitions), or in industries left desperately short of labour by the exodus of men to join the Forces. The film's central premise, therefore, just does not ring true. The "extended flashback" structure also struck me as a mistake because it means that the viewer is aware, from the very beginning of the film, that Roy survives the war and therefore knows that the report of his death must be erroneous. It might have made for greater emotional impact if we had been allowed to believe, with Myra, that Roy has died.The film's other main weakness is the miscasting of Robert Taylor as Roy. (Vivien Leigh would have preferred her husband Laurence Olivier as her leading man, but was overruled). When the film began I wondered why Roy had an American accent and two possibilities occurred to me, besides the obvious one that Taylor did not want to attempt a British one. The first was that Roy was a Canadian, the second that he was an American who had volunteered for the British Army before America's entry into the war and had subsequently acquired British nationality. Neither, however, turned out to be correct. It transpires that he is actually a member of an aristocratic Scottish family, and as such Taylor seems completely unconvincing. Had the script been rewritten to make him an American he might have been quite good.On the positive side, Leigh is heartbreakingly beautiful. (This was her first film after "Gone with the Wind"). The film was a box-office success when first released, and her popularity must have played a major part in this. Her role may have been badly written, but she plays it with great sincerity and enables the viewer to empathise with Myra. I would say that she is the best thing about the film, although there are also good contributions in smaller roles from Maria Ouspenskaya as Kirowa and C. Aubrey Smith as Roy's elderly uncle. Overall, however, "Waterloo Bridge" is a film which does not hold up well today, partly because this sort of sentimental melodrama has gone out of fashion, partly because of its own weaknesses in plot and casting. It is hard to understand why both Leigh and Taylor considered it a personal favourite; both acted in much better films than this. 5/10Some goofs. The church where Roy and Myra hope to marry appears as a vast Gothic cathedral from the outside and as a modest chapel in the Classical style from the inside. We learn that the badge of Roy's regiment (the fictitious Rendleshire Fusiliers) is a broken lance, but he wears a different badge on his cap, the flaming grenade of the Grenadier Guards. The style of his uniform looks more American than British, and other British soldiers, even in scenes set at the end of the war in 1918, are seen wearing the uniforms of 1914/15, with peaked caps rather than helmets. The list of officers killed in action is headed by a Gunner; the term "Gunner" in the British Army refers to a private solider in the artillery, not to an officer. And why are Myra and the other female characters all dressed in the fashions of 1940, even though the action takes place more than twenty years earlier?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the finest movies I have ever seen. Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor make sheer magic together on screen, and both give touching performances. My favorite part is when Myra sees Roy in the station, after thinking that he was dead. The look on her face is the complete opposite of his! The ending with the little troll is especially sad. Still, it's a wonderful movie, and everyone has to see it at least once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Saddest Most Tragic Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautfully photographed and acted by two major stars at their near peaks. It deals with someone at the start of WW II looking back (while on Waterloo Bridge) at a love affair in the First World War and how a poor ballerina and a rich officer got together and fell deeply in love, only to have it all lead to disaster - Absolutely heart-breaking; if this doesn't get a tear out of you nothing will. I saw it once, have it on tape, but don't want to get through it again. Although it should be seen at least once for the great movie it is. Usually neglected in reviews is the profoundly INSIDIOUS effect the British class system had and how it helped bring about the tragedy. In this respect, it is also most frustrating. Nonetheless, SEE IT, at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WB's relation to an older play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I too was struck by the anachronistic costumes (WWII garb for a WWI story) as well as by the inaccurate depiction of WWI airwars and bomb shelters as noted by one of your reviewers. I thought another reviewer's point well taken as to how did Taylor actually reacquire the little good luck charm after Leigh's death. But Taylor's Americanism as noted by another of your reviewers was accounted for by Sherwood's original play protagonist as actually being an American (himself.) So that we can accept.But I noted too that while your reviewers referred to Sherwood's original 1930 play as well as to the 1931 James Whale original movie version an important predecessor to this story seems to have escaped everyone, namely Arthur Wing Pinero's celebrated play, "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray" (1893). In this play, famous in its time for its faux-realism and its eagerness to put the question of prostitution onto the stage, a lady with a doubtful past likewise aspires to membership by marriage into the aristocracy. But when her past is discovered she too chooses suicide as the only way out. The parallels between SMT and WB struck me immediately. Perhaps WB is even more directly related to SMT than either Sherwood or Whale.Herbert Stothart's score was quintessentially typical. HS' method was usually to take familiar melodies (such as "Auld Lang Syne") and doll them up with fantasy orchestrations. You can usually tell a Stothart score when you hear it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hats Of To Mervyn LeRoy Despite His Misjudgement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a very bad habit when watching old films (something I do most evenings) in that I rarely pay much attention to who the director was. As I began watching this film, which I inexplicably had never seen, even as the opening credits passed by I thought it reminded me of the opening credits for my second favorite film (after GWTW) -- "Random Harvest". And then there's the classical music, which is common to both films. I jumped up to check the computer and realized that, yes, the same director for both films -- Mervyn LeRoy.I do think that LeRoy made one mistake in this film. For the first 58 minutes it's a simple love story of a soldier (in this case officer Robert Taylor) who quickly falls in love with a young woman during World War II. The fling went on for so long that I began to wonder if there was actually much of a plot. Then, just about an hour into the film you finally begin to realize what the plot is going to be. That left less than 50 minutes for the real meat of the story -- the mistaken belief that Taylor has been killed in the war, the turning of Vivien Leigh's character into a prostitute, the realization that Taylor is not dead, her attempt to hide her past...for a while, his search for her, and her suicide. The appetizer portion of the film should have been shortened by at least 15 minutes so that the meat of the film could have had more depth.One of the most interesting aspects of this film is that despite the fact that the plot hinges on prostitution, and because of the censorship code in force at the time of the filming, the word prostitution (or any synonym) is never mentioned, only implied.Was Robert Taylor ever more handsome or suave? Vivien Leigh was striking, of course, although even in GWTW, I always felt that a certain dark nature was evident, and of course that was true in her later real life. There's not much opportunity to savor supporting actors here...all their parts are key, though their screen times were minor. C. Aubrey Smith is always a delight, as is Maria Ouspenskaya. Lucile Watson as Taylor's mother was wonderful, and so much more could have been done with her role, had the film been reorganized a bit. But if one costar stood out, it was Virginia Field, as Leigh's friend, fellow dancer, and fellow prostitute.It was tempting to give this film a 9, but the weak, overly long first hour's story line makes me reduce it to an 8. But this is a film that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A year or so ago I saw the original cinematic adaptation of this Robert E. Sherwood play. Directed by James Whale and starring Mae Clark, it was a near masterpiece in the genre of tragic romance. I had doubts about the remake. I figured, since it was made in 1940, the Hayes Code would have destroyed any reference to prostitution and the film would be much weaker. Thankfully, that isn't true at all. I have no idea how they got away with it, but the female protagonist, here played by the always remarkable Vivien Leigh, is a prostitute. She doesn't start off that way (as she does in the original), but she does eventually slide into the world's oldest profession. And there's no attempt to hide it whatsoever. You'd have to be pretty dense, even in 1940, to miss it. I also had some fear that I might dislike this version because, of late, I've been kind of bored with studio era Hollywood melodrama. But, damn, this film really worked for me, just as well as the 1931 version. The film kind of starts off like The Clock, with Robert Taylor, a soldier, falling hard for Leigh. The two of them, barely knowing each other, share a whirlwind romance (the candle dance to "Auld Lang Syne" is one of cinema's most romantic sequences). It's supposed to end in marriage, but Taylor is abruptly called back to duty. Leigh, a dancer, ends up losing her job over the romance (Maria Ouspenskaya plays her harsh employer), and she and her best friend (Virginia Field) end up as prostitutes on the streets of London. It plays out a bit differently than the '31 version, but it's no less effective. Leigh is much better here than she was in either of her Oscar winning roles. I'm shocked she didn't get nominated here. Taylor is good enough, but it's Leigh's movie all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Tears Than Anna K...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mainly I wanted to know how Taylor found that lone lost suicide survivor, the kewpie doll. It had to have been crushed during cleanup of the accident scene but of course, he could have just purchased another good luck charm. This, among other non-sequitur questions, remain after viewing this film. Another, after reading of her fiancé's death in the paper, how could she contain her grief to Mama given that she was a dancer, NOT an actress! A simple search for her name would turn up a kid or two unless she had changed her name which most fallen women do, right? Hmmmm, doesn't make much sense to resort to this profession when so much help was available. Perhaps the unwritten script is that she secretly liked to dance naked for money? I was most impressed with how they aged Taylor over 20 plus years, a hint of baby powder on the mustache and voila! vs Leigh in "That Hamilton Woman" end scene.Despite the above mentioned issues, I really enjoyed the film immersed in it's many foibles. And, oh I forgot the dress code of the early 20th century in England, good thing Downton Abbey got it right! Have you ever fallen in love with such urgency and not just based on attraction alone? It is quite a spectacular moment in life and very rare indeed but occurs more in real life than on screen truth be told.Leigh never looked more ravishing in exquisite gowns, ballet attire, and close ups were her dearest ally. What a refreshing face, so expressive and eyes divine. Even Ol Blanche was positively lovely. A great loss to the film world with her limited productions.Be prepared for a tear jerker though, the many decisions in life that forced her to depart reality were reminiscent of that crazy unpredictable element named, Fate. Many feel they were irresponsible, rash decisions with little forethought but how easy it is to judge.High recommend for Leigh fans, a new take on a Ouspenskaya role (LOL), and several lost in dreamworld dance moments that will be retained in memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water under the bridge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Taylor (Roy) asks his taxi driver to stop at Waterloo Bridge on his way to enlist for WW2. There, he pulls out a lucky charm and reminisces about his whirlwind romance with Vivien Leigh (Myra) during WW1. The bridge is significant as it is the location that they met during an air raid. It is also the location where tragedy struck? This is a romantic war story that does leave you with some memorable moments, eg, the singing of "Auld Lang Syne" as couples dance the Farewell Waltz. The orchestra plays and gradually extinguishes more and more candles until we are left with dark silhouettes dancing. There is no dialogue and the whole sequence is hauntingly romantic. The film is well directed, eg, the scene where Leigh waits for her encounter with Taylor's mother Lucile Watson ((Lady Margaret). She has a newspaper with an update of the names of those soldiers who have fallen. Dare she look? Vivien Leigh evolves from ballerina good girl to prostitute and it's unfortunate that shame plays such an important part in this film. I used to know someone who worked as a high-class escort girl, ie, prostitute, and she raked in the cash for doing very little. One of her customers liked to get all his Nazi memorabilia out including books and toy tanks and ask her to watch him while he masturbated over it. That was it - ?500, thank you very much. Leigh could have made a financial killing in the wartime with customers like that.The supporting cast are all excellent with standout performances from ballet company director Maria Ouspenskaya (Madame Olga) and Vivien's friend Virginia Field (Kitty). I'm not sure that the story is entirely realistic as Robert Taylor wouldn't be smiling over his reminiscences. It feels like it's all water under the bridge to him. The film has a rather 'Anna Karenina' ending to proceedings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woefully Inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible SpoilerAs a previous poster commented, the idea that Vivien Leigh's Myra (or her friend for that matter) would need to turn to prostitution to eat is absurd--not only was this especially true during wartime---but it should be remembered, both Myra and her friend were trained dancers. In fact Violet (I think) had originally been a chorus girl.I also didn't care for the 1930's fashions in 1915, nor did I think Taylor and Leigh had particularly strong chemistry. Still, I like Vivien Leigh--but one's time would be better served watching "That Hamilton Woman" to see her talents shine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bridge Over Troubled Matter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WATERLOO BRIDGE 1940This is a 1940 remake of Robert Sherwood's earthy play. Vivien Leigh- hot from Gone With The Wind- has a line about how it takes a war to heighten our senses to value of every minute- a straggling survivor- I suspect- from the original Sherwood script. This movie is simply baloney. Nobody really believes that in ninety minutes Vivien goes from ballerina to prostitute, anymore than they believe Robert Taylor's white-powdered aging. Prostitutes wouldn't ply their trade on Waterloo bridge; it's too windy. But who cares? The whole thing works; Hollywood limbering up to do what Hollywood did best- make magnificent baloney. So magnificently that, like eager adolescents confusing prettiness with substance, 1940 audiences weren't only delighted to be confused, they were desperate to be. Reality hurt too much. In any case, given that man knows zilch about the most important punctuations of his being- conception, birth and death- who needs substance when there's a war on? All we want to do is ponder what if things had been different. Maybe Roy and Myra might have??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-done...to a point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**EXTREME PLOT SPOILERS**This takes place in Britain during WWI. Captain Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor) meets and falls in love with ballerina Myra (Vivien Leigh). They plan to get married but he's sent off to fight before they can. Then tragedy after tragedy strikes. Myra finds out he's dead, she's fired from work and turns to prostitution to survive. Then she finds out he's not dead...It all leads to a tragic ending that I saw coming a mile away.I did like this. The plot is more than a little silly and it throws in every romantic cliché in existence but they pull it off. This has a good script and is beautifully directed but it's Taylor and Leigh who put this over. He's dashing and unbelievably handsome (when he smiled I got weak-kneed) and Leigh was so beautiful it was unreal. They worked well together and I never doubted for a second that they were in love. However the story never hit me on an emotional level. I cry easily at movies like this but I was dry eyed the entire time. To be honest, I had trouble taking the plot too seriously--that's why this only gets an 8 from me. Still it's well worth catching. Taylor said this was his favorite film. I can see why!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you notice Vivien Leigh could never say what she had done while he was supposedly dead. Or that no one else could. While this movie is very nice to watch and completely innocent, something provocative for the times would have been amazing drama. Instead they opt for imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivian Leigh,....as a prostitute?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been remade several times and I doubt if in this day and age the old fashioned plot would succeed. This is because the plot is full of lots of melodrama and situations that today just seem too unbelievable. However, being a fan of older films, I was able to suspend disbelief and just watch the movie and accept it for what it was.Ms. Leigh is a struggling ballerina in love with a rich guy about to go off to WWI. They are desperately in love and she ultimately gives up her career for him. Unfortunately, he goes off to war and is assumed to be lost and she has no income. His family is far from welcoming and so she is forced to sell her body to support herself! Now, most people today would think "yeah, she COULD just scream and yell and demand support from his family or why doesn't she just go out and get a job?" and this is the main problem with the film. Also, it's hard to reconcile the fine romance and romantic cinematography and music with her becoming a hooker. They just don't go together. These plot holes, it turns out, are a result of a massive re-writing of the script from the 1931 film of the same name--where the character Ms. Leigh plays is already a prostitute when she meets her love AND she never was a ballerina!! However, in spite of this, it's still an excellent film and is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that did not stand the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw WB many times, in 80s, 90s and again in 2009. I love Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, both are handsome people and good actors. Taken historically, WB was a solid film when it was released in 1940, and may had warranted 8/10 rating at that time ? not today. From a film making point of view, it holds no special appeal. Characters development is very sketchy and superficial. Myra (Leigh) is just a beautiful woman, which stands out from the crowd because of her looks, a poor ballet dancer and an orphan girl - not much further concerning her characters is shown or could be inferred from the film. Roy (Taylor), by the implication of his name is of a noble (royal) blood. He's good looking, pleasant in manners, simple minded and naive. Myra and Roy belong to different social classes and, as film shows, members of these classes should not cross class boundaries, to avoid peril (exemplified by the death of Myra). Their marriage just fated not to be, first due to a technicality, and then because Roy's leaving for a war. Mistaken death of Roy is a test for Myra, an ordinary person, which she could not possibly pass. Should she be of a royal blood, she would rather die before sinking as low as becoming a prostitute. In general, it is very difficult to justify someone becoming a prostitute, no matter what the excuse. For a person of higher class to become a prostitute would be tantamount of death anyway, because of pride etc. But an ordinary person will act as ordinary person, and will do anything to survive - the loss of honor is not crucial (life/death) for her. A person of high birth will be honorable, truthful and decent no matter what. So the ideology of the film is still biased toward tradition, nobility and eugenics. Albeit it is possible that preservation of selective gene pool may result in a better person - I am not arguing ideology - in today's world this is no longer significant. Today even interracial marriage is everyday occurrence and class distinctions became rather wealth distinctions.In my opinion, the plot is silly, at least so it appears today. The scenes when Myra and Roy contemplating present and past on the bridge (a symbol of what connects and separates them at the same time) are maudlin and not believable. There is just not enough subject matter to justify what is being shown.I believe this film aged particularly badly and is deservedly receives no popular attention.</fullReview>
