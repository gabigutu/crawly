		<shortDescription>Thundering Shogun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a dark-edged delight from beginning to end when I saw it at the 2010 edition of TIFF. The audience there loved it too, breaking out into spontaneous applause during several scenes.Solid direction by Miike, great characters, beautifully shot and simply some of the best and most intense action sequences put on film - ever! It does have it's obvious influences, such as Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai", but damn, this one kicks ass mightily! You've never seen Shogun like this! And something else to point out: the sound on this film was thundering, shaking and stellar! THIS is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to a movie theatre to enjoy a film on a big screen, why we turn off our cell phones and immerse ourselves in the experience of cinema-going, as opposed to staying home on our couches.I'll go see it again on the big screen when it hopefully returns to town - you can bet on that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far Miike's most outstanding film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been furious at American cinema for releasing some garbage over the past few years, I have purely focused on international cinema and more so Asian cinema. You would be hard pressed finding better films than what South Korea has to offer. Unless you stumble across 13 Assassins. My god, what an experience. And that is exactly what it is, an experience. Exactly what cinema is meant to be. I will not spoil any part of this film other than saying, if you are sick and tired of the same old melodramatic, over hyped, under performed, over budgeted, egotistical, run of the mil ho hum doldrum from modern day cinema, then you must (and I mean must) see 13 Assassins. This film is a solid entry from Takashi Miike. His previous films were everything from outstanding to bizarre, but this film speaks volumes. It is a film reminiscent of 7 Samurai, brilliantly executed. Takashi Miike has certainly matured in his vision, bringing to the screen an instant classic. Tell your people, friends, family, scream it from the rooftops.....13 Assassins is brilliant! Now, how long will it take Hollywood to bastardize this film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another brilliant genre masterpiece from Takashi Miike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Miike is arguably one of Japan's hardest working directors who has tackled several different genres, generally with good results. It used to be he would do a dozen or so projects a year, and more in his earlier days. This, of course, has diminished in place of bigger projects, but the man still remains one of Japan's most well known and prolific directors. So, it shouldn't surprise anyone that his undertaking of yet another new genre, the samurai epic, is something of a highly anticipated film. And yes, it succeeds in being another brilliant masterpiece from the man.13 Assassins, though full of characters, is quite simple actually. A master Shogun samurai is charged with the killing of a cruel and masochistic Shogun lord before he can become more influential in the Japanese Shogunate. With this mission, he gathers together 13 samurai to join him in what appears to be a mostly suicidal mission as they take on a small army of soldiers. For years I have argued that Miike is a master filmmaker that doesn't get nearly the kind of recognition he deserves, as his experience and resume put him up with the likes of other classic filmmakers. This shows in Assassins as he brilliantly puts together this simple, yet purposeful film that calls back to the era of epic samurai films of the likes of Akira Kurosawa. In fact, the influence of Seven Samurai is quite apparent here, even going so far as to model some similar characters. However, do not be mistaken, as this is very much a Miike film, a combination of his abilities to craft a mainstream film and a cult hit. And the trademarks are certainly there, with the sadistic young Shogun lord bearing the bizarre violent fetishes that have been displayed in Miike's more obscure works, namely Ichi the Killer. As you might suspect, the violence early on is shocking, effective, and often unexpected. This gives way later on to more stylish violence, but none the less, the film is incredibly violent, worthy of a hard R rating by American standards. Miike fans should be very pleased as he both employs his skills as a filmmaker while at the same time adhering to the general guidelines of making a samurai film. Here, he delves greatly into the genre, showing what it means to be a samurai and questioning their purpose through multiple views. Our master samurai, Shinzaemon, sees samurai as being for the people, while Hanbei, his rival, sees them as entirely in servitude to their master without question. Even the young lord, Shinzaemon's target, has a view, thought it is certainly the most negative of any of them.If I have any complaints, it's two. First, the film does little exposition of the large cast and most of the assassins are simply there to be a fighting force. We learn very little about most of them, and even the samurai we do learn about, including Shinzaemon, get little exposition besides what we already expect, that he's a great samurai of justice. The second would be the clunking over the head about samurai ideals. Miike continues to push messages we've already acquired early in the film and it becomes slightly redundant by the end. However, these are minor complaints that are mostly easily ignored as the film runs at a fast pace with a 45 minute battle that is one of the best samurai battles I've seen on film, comparing to Azumi or Zatoichi's finale, but arguably handled better and with a master's touch.It's hard to know if this is Miike's pinnacle. He certainly creates a modern samurai masterpiece of an epic here. One particularly powerful scene will remain with you for a long time, and this is the power of Miike's film, one that goes to places many are afraid to tread to leave a lasting impression. Violent, entertaining, and with good examination of the samurai and their duties, fans of Miike's previous films and fans of the samurai epic will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>413th Review: Excellent Samurai Movie And One Of The Films Of The Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an epic masterpiece and is clearly a cut above most films in direction, acting, and cinematography. But what really sets it apart is that it connects the viewer to Bushido and has those values firmly at its core.The sadistic tyrant who must be assassinated or Japan will turn once more to feudal warfare is told with verve and elan, but also with real dignity and a great sense of pace. The first hour is simply superb as we watch the recruiting and planning of the assassins. The second hour is a maelstrom of action with katanas flashing and impossible odds. I actually preferred the first half in the main, but absolutely no complaints with the action either.All in all, this is simply, by far and away, the best action film of 2011 so far, but putting in a genre does not do it justice - for this reviewer, it is the most complete cinematic experience since Winter's Bone and is that rare animal these days - a film that looks, feels, and produces the sensation of film rather than TV.Probably one of the better films (Japanese or otherwise) I have seen this decade without exaggeration - it actually attempts to embody Bushido and understand the meaning and purpose of the Shogunate and the Samurai - plus Katanas - oh yes - lots and lots of katanas.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mainstream Film-Making at its Very Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Miike Takashi was once a cult film phenomenon in Japan with controversial films such as 'Audition', 'Dead or Alive' series, and 'Koroshiya Ichi'. Recently, however, his works are getting more mainstream-friendly with high-budgeted films such as "Crows ZERO" series, 'Ryuu ga Gotoku', and 'Yatterman'. Sure, there's still plenty of violence, but nowhere near as shocking nor horrifying as his earlier films. Is he a sellout? Perhaps. But how can we blame him? You'll be approached by major studios once you attain certain level of fame, and higher budget means it must appeal to more people in order to get the investment back. '13 Assassins' delivers exactly that despite being a Japanese period piece, which traditionally appealed only to the older generation and film buffs. The movie was screened at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival under 'Masters' category, "Films made by the most influential directors living today", and Miike Takashi lives up to expectations.'13 Assassins' is supposedly a remake of 1963 jidaigeki (Japanese period piece) of same title. Let me tell you this, the movie is not a true jidaigeki. Miike Takashi has transformed it into a 126 minutes of pure fun and excitement.The story is about an assassination attempt of a tyrant lord by 13 'true' samurais who are believers in justice and uprising on behalf of the People in the year 1844. The original film was famous for its 30 minutes of continuous battle sequence, and the remake's may be even longer. Long story short, it's action-packed, and more people got slashed than in the 'Azumi' series in this movie.As a service to Miike's cult following, the movie is far more violent than typical jidaigeki, with plenty of gut-exploding, head-rolling action and some grotesque scenes involving a woman with separated limbs (who created a plot device that ultimately became one of the most dramatic scenes in the movie). Unlike other Japanese war epics, the movie also has a modern sense of humor with plenty of comedic reliefs, astonishingly beautiful cinematography in the forest, and advanced battle tactics. What's surprising, is that none of it felt unnatural and corny like every other modern jidaigeki films that attempted and failed miserably to modernize period pieces, such as "Tsukigami" and "Sakuran".The cast is truly star galore with some of the biggest names in Japanese acting, and experienced supporting actors. About half of them are actors with extremely unique or modern faces that I would've never expected to see in a period piece, but none of the characters seemed out of place even though their faces are still very much identifiable. The biggest surprise was the choice of boy band SMAP member, Inagaki Gorou as the twisted villainous lord. Not only did he hold his own among far more talented full-time actors, he was vital in much of the humor that made this film a success. Truly talented directors are capable of drawing the most out of his cast, and Miike had done just that.'13 Assassins' is a movie destined to become a blockbuster. Time just flies by when you're having fun, and the audience at the TIFF screening were applauding in every cool and dramatic scenes, and eventually turned into a standing ovation as the credits started rolling. Remakes are all about translating an outdated (or foreign culture) piece into a work that appeals to the modern (or local) audience. '13 Assassins' does both with universal language of comedy and violence which transformed a classic period piece into a thriller for the modern taste that anyone over the age of 12 (or whatever age restrictions this film will get in your country) can enjoy despite being a jidaigeki. I would recommend this movie to just about everyone. In fact, you don't even need to be a Japanese movie buff to appreciate it. Mainstream film-making at its very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Master Strikes Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Takashi Miike, so I was very excited to be able to attend a sneak peek of his latest film. Miike's one of those directors who seems to be trying to make at least one film in every style, and this latest is his foray into the classic "samurai avenging injustices" genre. Only, we all know by now that Miike's style is anything but "classic." He always manages to find a way to infuse his own unique, warped imprint into everything he touches. Especially since he insists on making the most bizarre cameos possible in all the films he directs. They are always really fun to watch for.So, this film is great. It starts off just as slowly as any of these old period pieces set in feudal era Japan, but it quickly descends into pure mayhem and madness. Shinzaemon is a retired samurai, but he is prompted back into action when he learns that the Shogun's "adopted" (code for bastard) son, Lord Naritsugu, has been terrorizing peasants. He's been killing and mutilating men, women and children all throughout the land, and all with the most cold- hearted, disinterested cruelty. So Shinzaemon decides to assemble a band of other idle samurai to hunt this despot down and assassinate him. Those would be the thirteen assassins that give this film its title. And they really are a very mismatched band of warriors. And these men are caricatures?each outrageous in his own way.The one thing I really love about Takashi Miike's style is that he's never afraid to just go for it. He's got no shame, and absolutely no restraint. I think this is because he has a deep-rooted sense of humor (albeit a very dark one). It's an ability to identify and appreciate the absurdity in life. Miike's films have a reputation for being pretty violent and bloody (and this one is certainly no exception). But they are also incredibly funny. The gore is certainly meant to shock, but I don't think it's just for the sake of a cheap thrill. I think it's meant to throw us of balance. His work is horrifying where we expect delicacy, and actually quite subtle where viewers typically expect to find vulgarity. Of course, we can always count on Miike for some truly silly stunts too. The result is audiences that are quite delighted and amused, even after witnessing all the horror and disfigurement and devastation. Those moments are upsetting and heartbreaking, for sure. But, Miike really understands how a film should flow, and balances these difficult scenes with the right dose of irreverence. He's a true master, and this film is a roaring success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Samurai Movie Seen in A Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I had heard a lot about this movies and read about it a lot, so i was very excited to see what was all the craze about....And boy was I in for a surprise, its one of the best samurai movies in a long time, and one of the best if don't count Akira Kurosawa's works, I have seen the best of em all, be it seven samurai, sanjuro, yojimbo, the sword of doom... This movie makes a place for itself between those masterpieces.Right from the start you start getting a feel for movie, the actors portray their parts very well, especially the one who play's the Lord, his cold hearted portrayal will remain in your hearts for a long time, and the last 30 min of the movie is unbelievable, all the blasts, the sword fights, the massacre, the last one on one sequence could have been a little better but it was awesome anyways.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best I've seen..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has an immense amount of depth for a movie of it's genre. There are many things about this movie that motivated me to rank it as I did. Starting with the acting - from the main characters, their roles, words, facial expressions, movements - done with such sincerity. Honest, real emotions. It gives you a glimpse into a world where honor is defined and mutated by the hearts of men. One Samurai, honors and views his position as a guardian of the people, able to see, comprehend, and act upon injustice. And the other Samurai? His heart is not towards the people, but has, as I've said mutated into an honor, that seemingly cloaked in the traditional honor of serving and protecting his lord, is really mutated into a self-serving, blinded existence that could potentially be his downfall. Who knows? Who triumphs in this movie? Be prepared to be surprised on many levels! The swordplay is bar none in my opinion. The landscape genuine, with fantastic cinematography. As many movies in this genre, there are moments of 'over-the-top' exclamatory remarks that often typify a Shogun/Samurai flick, this just keeps reminding you that an American producer with more eye for gore than plot is NOT at the helm of this ship. This movie has it all for me. It has a plot, a story line that will have you remembering the 7 Samurai, The Magnificent 7, and a little of the A-Team, but done so in a remarkable fashion, executed in a classical, raw, well orchestrated fashion. I will watch this again. I will undoubtedly see more to this movie then, than now. And that will be a treat unto itself. If you are a fan of the Samurai/Shogun genre of film. Watch this. pop the popcorn or whatever, but don't drink too much because you will not want to get up, even for a bathroom break on this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 assassins, one memorable movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thirteen. The time has come to lay down your lives for the greater cause. Are you ready?"13 Assassins is all about the payoff. And the payoff comes in the form of 50 minutes of absolute carnage at the end of the movie. The story is about 13 warriors, some of the last truly capable samurai at a time when the era of those legendary soldiers was coming to an end, who band together to kill a despicable, deranged and utterly evil lord who is step-brother and future heir to the ruling shogun. Greatly outnumbered, the men devise a plan to force Lord Naritsugu and his guards to a village that they've prepared as what can only be called as a deathtrap. &nbsp;If you liked the "Crazy 88's" fight from Kill Bill Volume 1 or the massive battle at the end of Azumi, then the epic showdown at the end of 13 Assassins automatically makes this a must see. But what about the preceding half of the movie? Most of that time is spent introducing us to the 13 assassins, Sir Hanbei - the noble but loyal to a fault man who is in charge of Lord Naritsugu's safety, and making us hate (and I mean REALLY hate) the lord himself. This portion of the movie was necessary to setup finale, but it was understandably not as exciting or captivating as the lengthy battle it precedes.&nbsp;Rest assured though, the storytelling doesn't stop when the action begins. Some action scenes in movies can be so endless that they become monotonous (and boring, as a result), but 13 Assassins neatly avoids that trap by including character development until the very end.&nbsp;This is a brutal, visceral movie, from the sadism of Lord Naritsugu to the blood-soaked, frenetic finale. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, I heartily recommend that you give it a shot.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most polished and accomplished work from Takashi yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On my list of favorite directors, there is always a place for Takashi Miike. I was introduced to Miike with Audition in 1999 and I have collected his titles like a hunter would deer heads. Go up and down my DVD collection and you will find Ichi the Killer, 3 Extremes, Visitor Q, Gozu, One Missed Call and Imprint. I don't know if any other working director has as many titles represented on my 'owned' list. Naturally, when I saw that Miike was bringing his latest effort, 13 Assassins, to the Toronto International Film Festival, I was sure to secure a ticket for the screening. 13 Assassins is a bit of a departure for the hard working Miike (Miike has 82 director credits to his name on IMDb.com). His films have generally been violent films set in modern times. And many of his films have been banned or misunderstood (Audition, Ichi the Killer). The synopsis for 13 Assassins - A group of assassins come together for a suicide mission to kill an evil lord - doesn't read like a Takashi Miike film, but with the violence and torture evident in the film's first reel, I was quickly assured that 13 Assassins was imprinted with classic Miike moments. 13 Assassins starts by addressing the villain of the film, Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira (Gorô Inagaki) who is one nasty sonofabitch. We watch as Naritsugu shoots arrows into an entire family who are bound and lying on the ground. Even the youngest child isn't saved from the flying arrows. We also witness a peasant girl who has had her arms and legs cut off. Even her tongue was removed by the sadistic Naritsugu after her family was massacred. These atrocities propel Shinzaemon Shimada (Kôji Yakusho) to abandon his Samurai values and he begins to amass a group of warriors that will attempt to ambush Naritsugu and his army of approximately 70 men in a town named Ochlai. His warriors amount to twelve, but when they set out on their mission and inadvertently become lost in the thick jungle, a 13th assassin ? a hunter who knows the terrain ? joins the band of samurai out to avenge past wrongs and to ensure that Naritsugu doesn't reach the Akashi domain where he is destined to become second in command to The Shogun. The first third of the film deals with Shimada amassing the team and learning of further Naritsugu acts of violence against the people of Japan. But when they samurai set up their ambush in Ochlai, the fun really beings and the final chapters are non-stop action and samurai fighting. 13 Assassins is not only the most accomplished and polished film of Takashi Miike's career, it is also the best film we have watched so far at the Toronto International Film Festival. And judging by the audience's reaction, I was not along in this sediment. The action sequences were relentless and maintained a momentum that The Expendables could only wish for. Every one of the 13 assassins were identifiable and had interesting attributes (the warrior, the loco, the one who uses spears?). The sound that accompanied the action was award worthy. The theatre rocked with explosions and with the sounds of blades cutting flesh and was only drowned out by the consistent audience applause in appreciation. Last year, I picked The Good, The Bad and The Weird to be my favorite film of the year. This year, 13 Assassins stands tall at the top of the list with just a few months to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Future Classic by Takashi Miike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1844, the peace of the Feudal Japan is threatened by the cruel Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira (Gorô Inagaki) that is politically rising and getting closer to his half-brother, the shogun. After the harakiri of Namiya clan leader, the samurai Shinzaemon Shimada (Kôji Yakusho) is summoned by the shogun's adviser Sir Doi (Mikijiro Hira) of the Akash Clan to listen to the tragedy of Makino Uneme ((Takumi Saitô), whose son and daughter-in-law have been murdered by Naritsugu. Then Sir Doi shows a woman with arms, legs and tongue severed by Naritsugu and she writes with her forearm a request to Shinza to slaughter Naritsugu and his samurais.Shinza promises to kill Naritsugu and he gathers eleven other samurais and plots a plan to attack Naritsugu in his trip back to the Akash land. But the cunning samurai Hanbei Kitou (Masachika Ichimura) that is responsible for the security of his master foresees Shinza's intent. Shinza decides to go with his samurais through the mountain, where they find the hunter Koyata (Y?suke Iseya) that guides them off the mountain and joins the group. Now the thirteen men prepare an ambush to Naritsugu and his army of two hundred samurais in a suicide mission to stop evil. "J?san-nin no shikaku", a.k.a, "13 Assassins", is a future classic of the samurai genre by Takashi Miike. It is inevitable to compare this film with Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurais" and the epic "The 300 Spartans", but "13 Assassins" is among the best samurais movies I have ever seen, with a solid story in the Edo period of Japan, stunning cinematography, wonderful performances and fantastic choreography in the battle scenes. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "13 Assassinos" ("13 Assassins")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Stinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director's stated purpose was to see if "they" could make a classic-style samurai movie. He and "they" utterly failed. Having seen this garbled junk I would proffer the guess that his real purpose was not to make a movie but to get material to write a how-to book, one that could be titled: "How to Make a Samurai Movie by and for Idiots." It's not just the U.S. that is dumbing down, is it? Pity Japan.Three-fourths of the way into the movie I mentally disassociated from it because the endlessly repetitive overkill became boring. Suddenly I could care less about the movie and began to wonder what it would be like going to a restaurant run by Takashi Miike. It would be, perhaps, somewhere in the foothills of western Tokyo. I would arrive at dusk and be welcomed into an old thatched-roof cottage converted into an elegant restaurant. The darkness of the interior would be softly illuminated in places by the warm glow of paper lanterns. Each dish would arrive one by one like scenes in a movie, one after another. First a lacquered bowl of miso soup would arrive at my table, wisps of wakame, a few green slices of scallions, and tiny cubes of tofu would be floating in it. Yum. Delicious. Then would be brought a side dish of thinly sliced lotus root, green soybeans, and hijiki. So far, so good. Then, about halfway through the repast, industrial fluorescent lights would be clicked on overhead, the purpose of which would be to destroy the deeply rich traditional atmosphere. Then, with about as much finesse as his scenes in the movie of ultimately boring, repetitive, endless crowds of slashing that went on and on and on and on. And on and on. And on and on and on and on and on, Miike would toss down a slab of cooked eel right on the bare wood of the table in front of me, not even bothering to use a plate. He would uncap a jar of powdered Japanese sansho pepper and dump the whole jar all over the cooked eel. Looming over me and wielding the bloodied thigh bone of a wild boar he would force me to eat this concoction with my fingers. Me, all along, thinking, like while watching the movie, that good cooks know that a dish of food can be ruined by using too much strong spice. The movie was made unpalatable by that boring, eye-numbing endless crowd slashing scene. Watching these scenes could be likened to trying to eat sushi that is more wasabi than rice or fish, or that eel above that isn't just tastily seasoned with sansho pepper but thickly submerged in it.And that stupid ending. The guy doing a terrible impersonation of Toshiro Mifune's Kikuchiyo in "Seven Samurai," walks up to the only other survivor of the "total massacre" showing zero evidence of his having been stabbed through the throat and otherwise slashed by swords deeply. I was thinking perhaps they were both dead until I didn't care. The only meaning that scene had was Miike was messing with the audience. So it's like back at the restaurant, I'm finished; unsatisfied, nauseous, and with an enormous mental bellyache, but ready to pay the bill. Miike says, "Ha ha. You know that eel you thought you were eating? It wasn't really eel. It was just textured vegetable protein. Ha ha. Fooled you, didn't I?" Betrayed to the very end. I mentioned idiots above. Whenever I see a movie this bad I look at the hundreds of people listed in the end credits and wonder how so many people can be involved in the making of a movie and not one of them with an ounce of intelligence. Today I got to thinking that movies are often not so much group efforts as mob efforts, and, after all, a mob has the intelligence of the least intelligent member, and the emotional stability of the most psychologically-screwed-up person in the mob. Why was the evil Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira riding a horse when people in his position at that time would be carried in palanquins? Stupid. How did those 13 idiots carry tons of explosives by foot over those mountains they got stupefyingly lost in? They hardly had anything at all they were carrying. Stupid. What was that business with the jerk who had rows and rows of spare swords to swap with the ones he was using? To show him throwing them to amazing effect would be something to see, and an excuse to have a ready supply of them, but, no, he just drops the ones he's using, leaving himself briefly unarmed, just to pick up another sword. Stupid. That huge vat of dark-looking blood spilling from the top of a building that had neither precursory scene nor effect. Stupid. Those 13 jerks who have their quarry trapped like vicious barracuda in a barrel. What do they do? Figuratively get naked and climb into the barrel. Stupid. They didn't have to kill 200 armed warriors, they just had to kill one man. One man who was constantly in the open riding a horse. That they couldn't is just, well, stupid. Takashi Miike and his crew. Stupid. Me for wasting my money on this trash: The most stupid. Downright imbecilic. Thanks for making me feel that way Miike, not.But is it possible that the film makers became so befuddled that this movie, beginning in a super-realistic way, at some point, in a totally confusing fashion, reverted to being something merely symbolic and representational in a ludicrous way? Exactly. Ludicrous. Way beyond stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Samurai brought together in a spectacular film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've never seen anything by director Miike Takashi then be prepared for a no-holds barred film. I've been a bit of a fan for many years having watched some of his best known films (e.g. Audtion and The Dear or Alive trilogy) and have quite liked his style. It may disturb as much as it amazes, but you will have to acknowledge some great film-making.The énfant terrible of Asian film-making world (according to one review I read) here he takes a complete sidestep with this take on the traditional samurai tale. A group of samurai are brought together to bring down a sadistic Lord who is expected in time to be elevated to higher levels of authority. As a foil to the group is another senior samurai figure who is hell-bent on protecting the Lord in belief that it is their duty not to take politics in their own hands but to serve.Some very violent scenes, the story is excellent and builds up to a long battle scene which sees our heavily outnumbered group battle to complete their mission. The fight scenes are incredibly well choreographed and paced excellently, and very violent also as you would expect.It's not just the action that is the crux of the film, but actually the story is well done and the acting is exceptional. One added member of the group (admittedly not a samurai) adds some comic relief which helps to ease the tension at times, and is a nice touch.The settings are exceptional and the dialogue is excellent. It can be difficult to follow early on as you try to figure out the political world and the figures that are relevant in this world, but you will capture the gist of what is to be taken from it all.I thoroughly enjoyed it and if you are into old Samurai tales then this is one for watch. Very engrossing and will likely be one for repeat viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Assassins/J?san-nin no shikaku (2010) directed by Miike Takashi is a remake. The black and white 1963 version is a stoic film that is beholden to Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954). It revels in the detail of the plot to kill the cowardly and arrogant Lord Naritsugu. It also revels in strategy and tactics of the eventual battle.Miike Takashi's remake changes a few minor elements of the plot, adding a terrifying and gratuitous moment of a victim of Lord Naritsugu's perverted amusements. This is the most successful and disturbing scene in the whole production.It is surprising how similar the first hour of Miike Takashi's remake is to the original but unlike the original, this new version seems to rush, as if desperate to get to the action. As a consequence, some memorable scenes in the original, such as the attempt of Lord Naritsugu to cross a bridge, feel less dramatic and rushed.Miike Takashi has changed the character Lord Naritsugu, as depicted in the 1963 version. Instead of an arrogant, cowardly and childish character, Naritsugu has become an angelic psychopath, softly spoken and not at all, a coward. This new version of Lord Naritsugu is less satisfying than the hysterical and broader characterisation in the original movie because, now, Naritsugu enjoys the battle to the point of orgiastic pleasure rather than being fearful for his pathetic life. Miike Takashi's remake throws out of the window any attempt to explain the battle in terms of strategy and tactics. Here the extravagant traps and automated barriers look as if they were designed to keep out hungry dinosaurs rather than improvised fences to trap an enemy and dictate the conflict. The original 13 Assassins (1963) succeeds completely in showing how the village is converted into a death trap and the desperation of those that can't escape. Miike Takashi, instead turns the battle into a chaotic frenzy with ridiculous and utterly unconvincing computer generated flaming cattle charging down the main street. Another WTF moment, is the explosion of blood that pours down the roofs after two Samurai are blown up.Miike Takashi can be a stunning film director and although 13 Assassins could be called his most mainstream adult work, it fails in comparison with the 1963 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like an average Hollywood action-flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this film reminds a lot of the superior Seven Samurai, it is more like the average Hollywood action flick. At the beginning of the movie the 'bad-guy' is introduced. He seems to be so evil that he's hard to believe as a real character. Unrealistic villains like this are very common in bad action films and we all know that 9 out of 10 times a bad guy like this gets killed or punished at the end. This brings me to the biggest flaw of this film, the predictability.There are no surprises in this film, there is no suspense. You'll watch it the same expression on your face from beginning to end because everything is predictable. After 20 minutes into the film you already know what will happen. There will be a big fight (not all the samurai are going to survive) and at the end the bad guy will get killed and they lived happily ever after. But then you have to wait about an hour before this takes place. This is quite a boring hour because all they're doing is sitting in a circle discussing how they are going to attack (which is not interesting to listen too, trust me). Meanwhile the villain is traveling from A to B. They talk some more in a circle, villain travels. They talk, villain travels.Then finally it's time for the grand finale.....but..it's just plain boring. Plain sword fights, nothing special, some of them die like you predicted and it's time for the final showdown with the bad guy. The clichéd, hurt villain crawling on the ground begging words like 'it hurts! i don't want to die! i'm scared!' is nothing original. This has been done way too often and most of the time in B action flicks. There's nothing new in this film that we haven't seen before already. Sure the cinematography is OK, the acting is decent, but that's about it. It's better to go watch Seven Samurai instead, which I'm not even a big fan of but it's definitely better than this knock off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but with minor flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Assassins is a bad ass movie. I would have loved to see this movie in cinema, but unfortunately German audience, cinema and distributors are ignorant, so it was a direct to DVD-release. Story is simple: mid of 19th century. Evil lord who loves torturing people should be assassinated by a group of samurai. Similarity with Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece Seven Samurai is given, but it is a remake of a 1960's movie with the same title. Unusual "normal" for a Takashi Miike movie, he proves in my opinion that he is able to create movies for bigger audiences and not only film lovers with focus on Asian cinema. Although he has left the underground a long time a go. Like I mentioned above, this movie would have deserved a theatrical release. I love chambara movies and have seen many. This is definite a return to the genre, even if Miike makes some mistakes at points, the movie is outstanding. Costume, setting, actors. Everything has been created with extreme love for the detail. A entire village was set up (and then more or less completely destroyed for the movie). The main battle is epic. 40 min non stop action. Miike keeps the violence relatively low for his standards. Two or three decapitations, not really any severed limbs. Could have had more I thought, but then it probably wouldn't have worked for a bigger audience. The actors are superb and suit their roles. I did feel reminded of good old sixties with Mifune and Nakadai. The actors might not possess their status and their charisma, but they are close and Miike is proving that he can handle serious and bigger stuff. The CGI he should have let done by an European or American team, then there wouldn't have been any visual flaws. The blood from the roof....I really would like to know if Miike was inspired by Kitamura's Azumi, in which there is a similar scene towards the end. For people, who don't like dialogs and long introductions: the movie is split in two. A very long build up over half of the movie and the last third the battle. I am reviewing the international version with its 2H 5min runtime. The Japanese is half an hour longer. I am looking forward, once released....and for the next Miike-movies. A director the international critics can't ignore no longer.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stylised remake of a 1960's Japanese historical drama, 13 Assassins focuses less here on any attempt at claiming to present hard fact, and instead concentrates on the stoic camaraderie between the cast of protagonists, and the eventual impossible battle they must wage against a psychopathic warlord.Director Takashi Miike is not known for tame movies, and here he does not disappoint, forcing the audience to confront a victim of warlord Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira's cruelty, and prompting his actress to give the most heart-wrenching scream I've ever heard in a film. Happily, the gore is not too over-the-top; there are severed heads, but we do not see them being severed. The only exception is an unrealistic amount of blood generated due to an exploding samurai, but the irony of this becomes apparent in the end.Unlike the original portrayal of Naritsugu, Gorô Inagaki's portrayal is of a despot, bored of peacetime life and wishing to return to the ways of war. Indeed, at the end one is left with the impression that Naritsugu inflicted all of his cruelty only to create the chain of events that led to his demise (although I don't believe he truly intended to die quite just yet.) Kôji Yakusho's Shinzaemon is stoic but identifiable, portraying a leader who connects to his followers (and his audience) better than most I've seen in recent years (if he speaks English, he might want to consider a move to LA).The battle sequence is convoluted, but watchable, and the glimpse rendered into feudal Japan, although perhaps not entirely accurate in historical terms, gives one a better understanding of where Japanese culture came from.*MAJOR SPOILER*There is a definite departure from reality, however, in the character of the guide the 12 meet in the forest (the '13th Assassin'): he dies several times, and it quickly becomes pretty clear he's this film's interpretation the Buddhist 'Monkey God'. This leads to an amusing close, as the last samurai left alive is left in disbelief when, after seeing the guide run through, the guide is left without even a scratch. This leaves the viewer with a mild impression the 12 had 'divine approval' of their bloody activities, and ends things on a bit of a lighter note than the simple grim specter of the massacre, and the irony of the feudal system where to obey was one's foremost duty, regardless of the insanity of those one served.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anything I say is pointless- just see this film and be in awe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Miike's remake is one of the best films I've seen in 2011 and possibly one of the action films I've ever seen (I'm waiting to see the full version.) The plot of the film has a samurai asked to quietly put a plan together that will assassinate the heir to the Shogunate. The problem is the heir is dangerously and homicidally insane and people fear that if he takes the throne everyone will die for his own amusement (the guy really is evil). The samurai gathers together a band of men who he can trust and they set about setting a trap to snare their target. The film's climax comes in a sustained 40 plus minute battle scene that will impress even the most jaded action movie lover.This film floored me. It's a slow building tale of honor and loyalty that ha sights and sounds the likes of which I've never seen. It's a film that raises the stature of the already impressive director to the level of the greatest directors of all time. What he accomplishes is truly amazing.It's a magnificent film that is one that needs to be seen on a BIG screen. The Japanese film industry (or any film industry for that matter) is simply not doing epics of this sort unless they are loaded with tons of computer manipulated images. They are the sort of things that are the reasons many of us attended the movies with any regularity.I think the film is one of the best of the year.I'm seriously considering putting this on the list of greatest action films of all time. I hesitate because there are a few minor flaws, the villain kind of disappears in the second half, and some of the characters are not fully drawn. I'm hoping that the reason is the fact that the version I saw is "The International" one which shaves off about 15 minutes from the run time.(based on other films that Magnolia and Magnet have released trimmed, the things that went were the character development parts).A must see, especially for anyone who like action films. This film will kick you to the curb and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic homage to Seven Samurai.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only a couple of years ago i saw the famous Akira Kurosawa movie " Seven Samurai" for the first time. A movie that inspired other directors to make great films such as "The Magnificent Seven" and "A fist full of Dollars" and there is no doubting that 13 Assassins resembles Seven Samurai in many ways and although this will never be talked about in the same way as Kurosawa's masterpiece , i enjoyed nearly as much.It's a very simple story about a group of samurai who are out to kill an evil lord who could destroy the country if he is allowed to live.This is extremely violent and at times , especially in the first half hour , some scenes might be classed as upsetting but it's totally justified so we feel the emotion of wanting the lord dead and knowing how important it is.I have to admit i did get a little confused when so many Japanese names were being talked about at the start and the fighting did go on a little bit too long in the last half but all in all it's a good film that fans of the genre will absolutely love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not enough words to explain the Execution of this feature film.Miike Takashi did a fantastic job proving his potential again.The first few minutes pulls you into the whole plot involved.Evil Lord(Naritsugu) is on his last step to become the senior adviser of Shogun(council) which is 2nd most powerful post in the country. Sir Doi as council elder cannot do anything politically as the council appointed lord Naritsugu to be the senior adviser effective on his next visit to EDO.So he appoints Shinzaemon Shimada to stop Naritsugu before he reaches to Edo.And he then forms the team that head out to do so.The battles were executed with great perfection and were very realistic.I say realistic because there were no "oh! we gotta slow down the swing of the sword or someone might get hurt" moments.There were some Strong Violence (maybe a little more than some).But the good thing about is the movie is not 2 hours of violence.It has breaks, to get you back to the seat in theater, then pull you back in when it needs to.With Realistic characters, story and Violence, It definitely is one of the best samurai movies lately.I rate it 9.6/10...Hope This Helps. Thank You for reading my review.HAPPY VIEWING-Ajit</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Assassins (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For so long I've waited to be blown away by a film. Every movie I've watched recently just doesn't measure up. As films continued to disappoint me I found solace in comics and TV. Finally, Takashi Miike releases his masterpiece. This film is grand on every scale and is so beautifully composed, it hit every note. I'll start with the expectations of a Miike film. He is known for his violence and gore, which is simply underestimating the man. Sure, films like Visitor Q and Ichi the Killer flirt with controversy before sodomizing it, but he knows how to create a movie. He manages to reduce and compromise our expectations with the opening scene. A man commits harakiri. Always gruesome, but Miike actually cuts to just the man's face. Is Miike getting soft? Far from it. This just means that the violent showdown is all the more powerful. He releases the violence when the time is right. Unlike recent Hollywood action films, Sucker Punch and Battle LA, the journey towards the action is what makes it so fascinating. Miike spends a long time exploring his characters and their beliefs, as well as the themes of the movie. This means that the final fight is about something and someone. They aren't just trying to kill a guy, they are showing us what they believe. Like many samurai films, this deals a lot with loyalty, duty and honor. However, it is far more critical of these things than previous films. Inagaki plays such a despicable villain, that it parodies how dedicated his samurai are. Inagaki is such a fun villain to hate. He's egotistical and grotesque, always relying on those around him for protection. The film has a lot of dialogue as it escalates towards the finale, but it never tells us the exact plan. I was completely unprepared for the last 40 minutes. Miike has built up his characters, has outlined the threats (and then increased them) and everything is set to go. So why is the finale so epic? First of all it starts with the absurd. Despite it's build up Miike throws a curve ball, but does so with such confidence that we are still gripped. He presents his 13 assassins (at first) as being almost invincible. They dive around, take on dozens of samurai etc. but it's all a lot of fun. Next, he starts to injure the protagonists. It comes as a shocking reminder that these guys can be hurt, making us now fully invested in the scene. Miike shoots everything with a simple fluidity. You can see what is going on, who is killing who, even though you are surrounded by blood and explosions. Finally, as the characters have been whittled down, we get a personal confrontation. One that reminds us what all this is for. It takes a lot of skill to make a lengthy action scene enjoyable for its duration. Especially when it goes from fun, to tense, to tragic, before it all comes to an end. It's a film that really does come together. I was more than satisfied, and I felt that I had been escorted on a complete journey, whilst enjoying the sites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a bloody affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Miike's "13 Assassins" is the Japanese gore maestro's first true epic film. The movie is bloody and incredibly realistic, yet there's also some elements of the supernatural thrown in for good measure. And did I mention that the film is incredibly bloody? The film's climax has to have set a record for the longest cinematic action sequence and the requisite body count to boot. Set in 1844 Japan during the Edo Period, the story concerns an assassination plot that basically amounts to a suicide mission: 13 samurai, under the leadership of Shinzaemon (Koji Yakusho), have been hired out to assassinate Lord Naritsugu (Goro Inagaki), a sadistic young Lord to the Tokugawa shogunate. The first half of the film, in what I could guess is a nod to Akira Kurosawa's epic "Seven Samurai" (1954), deals with the selection and recruitment of the men for this mission, and the second half of the film is basically an hour-long bloodbath. Miike's reputation was made around the world with the 1999 horror film "Audition." With his latest, it shows that he has indeed matured as a filmmaker and is definitely ready to take on hefty subject matter - the historical samurai epic. Although there's plenty of blood and guts here, Miike is more concerned with the reasons why these men are fighting and who they are exactly. Many of the samurai recruited by Shinzaemon are either too young or too old for this mission (and some are more developed than others, the film's only true weakness with such a significant cast), but they fight anyway because they believe that if Lord Naritsugu is elected to the shogunate council, it'll plunge the country into a civil war. So a great many things are at stake here, the most significant of which is the very future of the country. This is undoubtedly Miike's epic, his modern-day equivalent of Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai.""13 Assassins" - 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Japanese culture and consequently Japanese cinema, I was surprised not to have seen any film by Takashi Miike prior to this. But that was possibly not too improbable, as Miike is notorious for his over-violent blood-stained movies that have a hardcore audience that indulges in extreme violence and perverted images. Truly, this film is violent and yes, blood flows aplenty during its 50-minute (!) battle sequence, but the merits of "13 assassins" far exceed the stylistic presentation of gore and extremity. The film is based on true events that took place 100 years prior to the Word War II. A veteran samurai by the name of Shinzaemon Shimada is ordered by an elder of his clan to assassinate the Shogun's adopted brother, Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira whose lustful and extremely brutal actions threaten to plunge the country into chaos. Simple as that. But the execution is truly a work of art. Using photography that immediately hurls the viewer in Edo period Japan, Miike first portrays the evil nature of Lord Naritsugu through ingeniously crafted scenes, such as the close-up to the samurai's face who is committing suicide by harakiri in protest and the portrayal of the tongueless dismembered woman whose bloody tears create a feeling of grotesque horror and disgust towards the Lord's conduct. Those are the most powerful scenes in the film and yet they show almost no blood at all (contrary to Miike's usual preferences). On the other hand, blood flows during the epic battle sequence at the last hour of the film, as a battle ought to be - realistic and merciless. The sheer brutality of hand to hand combat is shown in a no-nonsense way that few Hollywood filmmakers can capture (or are allowed to...). And yet Miike manages to create a connection between almost all of the characters and the audience, as character development is something which is taken very seriously. He conjures outstanding performances by all of his cast, namely Koji Yakusho, Goro Inagaki and Masachika Ichimura, as Shimada, Naritsugu and Hanbei respectively. Humor is also present in the film, at the right amounts to give a relief, but never exaggerated. The exception is the inclusion of a hilarious scene of one of the group and the mayor of the city which is shown only in the longer Japanese version of the film. Although too far-fetched it didn't bother me at all. It's yet one more example of Miike's bold filmmaking which manages to "bend" even mainstream "rules". Not suited for conservative audiences, but then again, when were Miike's films like that? In all, we 're dealing with an impressively directed film, abundant with brilliant performances, capturing photography and filled with scenes that will follow you for a long time. I can't get over the human wreck crying blood from her eyes and writing with a brush in her mouth "EVERYONE DEAD"... Even if some scenes (especially in the longer Japanese version) require some understanding of Japanese folk legends, history and/or geography, in order to get their deeper significance, the film is enjoyable nevertheless. It's not for the faint-of-heart, but it's as realistic as it should be. A modern "period epic" about honour, dignity, war and justice. One of the best films of 2010 and probably a standard for future historic epics. Truly impressed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how the common man prevails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great true story of how a maniacal lord was to take power. In the thresholds of the house of the Shogun, a man with a lust for the macabre was becoming something of a tyrant, where by cutting off limbs or torturing the more less fortunate people for his pleasures. During this romp of chaos, a middle man Sir Doi (Mikijiro Hira) gives a secret order to stop this crazed individual by use of a group of assassins, thirteen in all. Heading this group is Samurai Shinzaemon Shimada (Koji Yakusho) who orders his men to stop this crazed individual by any cost, which includes their lives.But to do so would mean to buy up an entire town and set it up so it becomes a literal death trap. But the lord Naritsugu Matsudaira (Goro Inagaki) has his own methods of outsmarting his foe. By fortifying the odds, and recruiting more men which toppled two hundred. Now with the town fortified with booby traps, and Shinzaemon's men ready, they go into battle in quite possibly the most blood drenched sword fighting scenes (Over 20 minutes) I have ever witnessed in a movie.This is how the wars between the common man, and the samurai had been held. With no mercy or any kind of remorse to their actions. What makes it such an interesting film also, is that hardly no music is played to add to the scenes of fighting. This adds a more real, and more deadly ambiance. Though music does add some impact to the genre, I found it to be most satisfying without music.You can hear the grunts, the screams, the metal to metal clashes of swords which make you cringe. In the most recent years, this is the movie for fans of this kind of genre. To see how it was back in the days of wars, noble houses, and the Edo period for which it is still as potent today as it has been for the last two hundred years. I give this film a high recommendation for those who love to watch the code of the samurai at its best. Imagine, thirteen men against two hundred, and defeating them all. Not a film for those under seventeen.</fullReview>

Very good acting, Takayuki Yamada is a very talented young actor and for the other cast is first class Japanese actors...the fight scenes are perfect, really, i mean perfect: no blur, no flying camera, no bad artificial effects or recreations (like CSI...). The first part of the movie is fantastic...you can feel the tension growing; you know that is going to explode but you don't know really when and when it comes you just want more and more and this movie gives you enough. Takashi Miike is known for the color filters (and violence)and in this movie there is an appropriate use of these (both). His maturation makes him a real artist, and this is prove of it.

		<shortDescription>Bloody Jidaigeki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most modern action movies feel bloated and overlong, with unnecessary subplots sprouting on every scene, 13 Assassins has the opposite problem. An epic Jidaigeki homaging Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, the film follows veteran warrior Shinzaemon Shimada, entrusted with the task of eliminating a bloodthirsty powerful nobleman, untouchable by the law; Shimada assembles a team of fighters for the dangerous mission.Structure is simple. In the first act, 13 Assassins introduces the major players and displays the nobleman's atrocities (one moment in particular is truly disturbing, cementing the movie's R rating); in the second, Shimada and his men reach an isolated village to prepare the trap, while the nobleman's right-hand man Hanbei attempts to anticipate their moves. The last act is a bloody, pulse-pounding battle which, in spite of its length (over thirty minutes), maintains a great level of tension.While action is spectacular, characterization is lacking. Kôji Yakusho is excellent as Shimada, but only three or four of his men - including his nephew and a clownish bandit who is a clear homage to Seven Samurai's Kikuchiyo - get any kind of development; the rest are simply guys with swords. With deeper characterization, the last battle would have been even more powerful.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Great Samurai Film By Takashi Miike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll give director Takashi Miike credit for taking on adaptations or topics that would be very difficult to be made into films. However, If there is one genre I never expected this director to get his hands on a jidaigeki or samurai films. His directional style worked for this film and he surprisingly made a very good jidaigeki. I have not seen the original and plan to watch it as soon as I get my hands on it. However, from what I have seen, the storyline was actually pretty good. The film focused very well on these assassins planning out their tactics, giving character depth on the characters who mattered, and portrayed their final battle against the warlord in a violent fashion that was just brilliant. One warning though, you will most likely be watching a film that follows the samurai's, planning out their tactics against the evil warlord throughout the film. Usually, this type of storytelling leads to a very boring movie; however, everything worked well enough where you will barely be bored and will be entertained. The film makes up the long wait with its final battle as the fight is one long fight. I liked how Miike presented the film as a samurai film and nothing different. You have the samurai honor, samurai code, and the samurai's and citizens acting like how they should during that time period. I liked how the director portrayed the characters as it follows the time period and historical perspective of the time period. Unlike "Seven Samurai" as all of the samurai's played a vital role in the story, some of the recruits are not paid close attention to, as they are not in the same class as the samurai's who are paid attention the most. As the final battle occurred, I did forget that these assassins exist, but overall, their existence matters. Although they do play a vital role near the end, do not expect the film to focus onto these characters. All you need to know is that the Yakusho Koji's character, among others who have the most dialogue are the character's who you will care for the most. I haven't seen a good cast in a Japanese film in quite a while. Yakusho Koji, Yamada Takayuki, Iseya Yuusuke, among others who are casted in this epic jidaigeki and they were all fantastic as their roles. Out of 13, at least 4-5 assassins were focused the most because of their class and all of the characters are awesome and likable. Iseya Yuusuke does play a character that you can recognize in "Seven Samurai," the wild character who joins the group of assassins; but I liked the character and he is a very good actor. Everyone who mattered in the film, performed very well and I really liked the cast they used for this film. You have a good amount of Japanese actors/actresses who were well casted and all gave it their best. Possibly, the most surprising was Nagai Goro who portrays the main antagonist. In Japan, there is a talent agency called Johnny's which holds a group of male idols who sing and dance around; basically an agency that promotes a great amount of Backstreet Boys. Most of them can't act nor sing and cause a film to go downhill fast because of their lack of talent. Nagai Goro is part of one of the boy bands named "SMAP" and isn't great when it comes to his acting skills; but surprisingly he was pretty good. His character is sadistic and evil as it comes and Goro pulled it off pretty well. What surprised me most was the serious tone he delivered for this film. From all of the films I have seen by Miike, he always had to add these ridiculous scenes in between the plot; to add humor in between the story. I watched the 20 minutes of deleted scenes from the international release and surprisingly, all of the scenes that were cut out from the final cut didn't have as much ridiculous moments that I expected; they were scenes that could have made it to the final cut. However, as expected, their was one ridiculous scene and was glad to see that part being cut out. One thing that might be weird to people will be the ending as something peculiar happens. The ending will definitely cause some confusion, but I really liked how he made it an open ending. His ending will definitely get you thinking and it really worked for me. If you have watched "Seven Samurai," then you know that the film presents a very long climactic battle. As I read in a few Japanese websites, both, this and the original, presents a very long climactic battle. If I remember correctly, the final battle is at least 45 minutes and what a long battle it was. The battle goes non-stop as you see the assassin's cut down their enemies one by one and seeing their planned tactic go into play. Miike really used his style of directing and created a bloody and violent battle that was entertaining. This film is a gore fest as you see blood squirting everywhere and seeing that all of the characters are pretty awesome. It's been a while since I've seen a very good samurai film and Miike definitely surprised me with this flick. If you enjoy Miike's work or love samurai films, then you will have a blast watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had all the hallmarks of Akira Kurosawa's greats but with Tarantino editing, large free flowing cinematic fight scenes amazing CGI blood spurts and on top of everything actors with HEART.There are some shocking limbless scenes but nothing too grotesque like Ichi the Killer for example. I really wish Hollywood would take note of great films like this, and leave them well alone.Takeshi Miike deserves acclaim for this, it is his most subtle film.Absolutely Knockout- plus a great, great no country for old men style ending.The only person who could re-make this film in my opinion for a western market would be Tarantino himself.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing intensity and vivid cinematography make a stunning film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always admired Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai for its ability to translate a good story into superb cinema. Here the seven become thirteen who are to rescue people from a disturbingly unpleasant tyrant whose leadership has run out of control. A meandering opening paints the story upon which we have eavesdropped in a way oriental films excel in. We are introduced to the characters who will, by the second half of our evening at the cinema, be battling out an intense, bloody and relentless fight to an honourable end.Such is the way with these stories that advantage pitches first one way and then the other as if good and evil have no role to play in human affairs. All that matters is the honour of the participants each of whom has a sworn duty to their leader or master. There is no way out of this pitched battle and all else is swept from out of sight of our eyes and minds.The cinematography, sound, editing and general continuity are absolutely masterful. The sets are like pictures spun to impress on us the time, the atmosphere, the tension, the emotions, the nerves, the sheer human quantity of not knowing what will happen next.This is not another episode in martial arts for it is far too good to be just that. As in the Seven Samurai there are moral overtones to almost everything that we see and it is that upon which the film concentrates. And in the end we are exhausted but ever so willing to watch the whole film all over again.Please see this film if you are in the least interested as to how good movies are made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Samurai film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title implies, this is not a family picnic at a park on a Sunday afternoon. Instead it is 1840s Japan and the time of the Samurai. A Shogun's son spends his days and nights raping and pillaging the otherwise peaceful community. Political machinations cause the bad boy to rise high up in the chain of leaders and so an old warrior, Shimzaemon gathers together eleven fellow Samurai to train for a mission to assassinate the evil man, Naritsugu on his long trip home. Their ambush is met with strong resistance from Naritsugu's men. The force is two hundred so they rely on guile to overcome being so outnumbered. The battle scenes, with swords, knives, arrows and explosives are beautifully choreographed and lead to an inevitable fight to the finish between a Samurai and Naritsugu. Although 13 Assassins covers a well worn theme, it is a journey worth taking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A samurai film that ascends to modern action standards while still true to its roots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Samurai films tend to lean toward either overly talkative and boring or hyper-stylized to the point that credibility comes into question. Striking that middle ground, however, can lead to greatness, or rather ? great honor. Takashi Miike's "13 Assassins" might not match the great Akira Kurosawa films, but boy does it come close, and it does so with themes and blades of equal sharpness.If swords-and-sandals flick "300" had been less concerned about abs and Gerard Butler screaming war hyperbole, it would have looked and felt like this film. Anyone who hails Zack Snyder's 2006 film as a masterpiece should pull up a seat with this film for two-plus hours and see how it's really done.Both the aforementioned film to which comparison is inescapable and "13 Assassins" tell a story about how the number of men indicated in their titles fought against an army numerous times the size. In this film, the reasons for fighting a battle most certain to result in death are less glossy and brash, as well as guided by some consideration for historical relevance.The story takes place at nearly the end of feudal era Japan, when samurai have become nothing but show thanks to a lengthy time of peace. Yet one lord seems to undermine this peace with acts of cold-blooded violence: the shogun's half brother, Lord Naritsugu (Gorô Inagaki). It is expected, however, that when he returns from Edo, he will have a place on the shogun's council and have political influence to go with with warmongering ways. After a respected samurai commits harakiri in protest, the elder of the shogun council charges a samurai named Shinzaemon (Kôji Yakusho) with putting together a squad of samurai to kill Naritsugu before there's widespread unrest.The beginning of the film shows us Naritsugu's cold and horrifying ways with enough brutal imagery to make anyone want to pick up a sword against this guy. The story then continues with the assembling of the 12 assassins (the 13th comes later) and their strategy for accomplishing the task. Yet on the other side is Hanbei Kitou (Masachika Ichimura), the samurai sworn to obey and protect Naritsugu who must develop counter-strategy to foil Shinzaemon, an old classmate of his from the dojo.The game of strategy boils toward a 45-minute climactic battle in which the 13 assassins use everything from trickery to explosives to straight-up sword hackery against an army of 200 men from Naritsugu's clan. The delivery of these sequences rivals any modern action film, and that includes battle cries, little humorous lines tossed in for fun and especially creativity. One samurai takes out 30-plus guys in a narrow corridor that he prepped ahead of time with several swords carefully stationed throughout.But most impressively, "13 Assassins" never loses sight of what its whole conflict is about. The plot doesn't exist merely as a formula guaranteed to produce an unforgettable culminating battle. Throughout the entire film, characters are questioning the values passed down to them for hundreds of years of honor and duty. Having essentially stood their whole lives as symbols of a fading age, they take on this quest in search of finally fulfilling that purpose of total commitment and servitude, yet this battle will teach them what it truly means.Essentially, this is not the same movie if set in another time or another place, which sets it apart as a truly great action film. As replicable as a story of a small band of skilled warriors taking on the impossible is (it possesses a great number of similarities to what's considered the best of its kind, Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai," for one), writers Kaneo Ikegami and Daisuke Tengan give "13 Assassins" its own thumbprint with the context. Miike then delivers the full impact of all the tones from pure syrupy action to dark, shocking drama. He knows exactly how to take a high-tension scene to a whole other level by creating a full spectrum of what we see versus what is kept from us, especially in terms of violence. As soon as he wants to export those talents to Hollywood, someone better answer. We could use more action films like "13 Assassins." ~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What did I think? 4.5 of 5 stars. Caught it on Netflix but wished I could have seen it in a theater. Great acting despite having to divide attention to subtitles. Samurais at the end of Shogun era in Japan with a soulless Lord who is about to be assassinated by samurais numbering you guessed it, 13. Well 12 at first. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and very elaborate, it can be a little hard to keep up with who is who but not so much to make you lost. Takashii has probably created his best work to date and hopefully will keep it at this level. All of the actors did a great job not only emotionally but physically as I am sure the action was tough at times. Great action scenes in the end and good pace. Overall a great remake to the 60's original.What did you think? Movie and TV reviews. Visit us on Facebook.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brave Samurais are making the plot truly strong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taksshi Mike gives a new face to the 1963 classic '13 Assassins' and he has executed it at grandeur level portraying an event which took place in Japans feudal era.When an evil and sadistic lord is bringing horror to countrymen, few Samurais who were once loyal to the throne foresee a greater danger. If this Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira plunges himself to the throne in near future the country will be devastated and torn with war. Thus these brave set of men creates a silent and elite secret force in order to assassinate the lord. Gathering only 13 men to their force they fearlessly goes head to head against an army of 200 to fulfill their goal. Brutal and merciless Samurai swords speak for themselves.This movie is a wonder of its own creation. It brings out ancient lifestyle of Japan in to light with details. And more than that the spirit of the brave Samurais are making the plot truly strong and when they fall and die one by one still they keep the heads high and hearts strong. Courage and determination of a worrier may not seem this strong in any recent movie which I recall.However be warned that 13 Assassins is not an easy movie to digest. It has blood and gore in great volumes and violence sometimes you might not really expect. Yet they are important in order make the story run to your blood stream. And once the war hits the screen after a long and silent slow momentum, it goes right until the end which is nearly 30-40 mts. So you might actually lose the count of killing.My reviews at flickshout.tk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rustic in the Woods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some directors that you just consider geniuses. They innovate, walking into new modes, vocabularies. My list of these artists is short. They greatly enrich because they expand and challenge.Other filmmakers may be talented and even capable of making personal films that are effective. But they are in a different class. They need to be approached with a different spirit. It is only an accident of the medium that they are lumped in with the greats. Miike is in this second tier.He has made some films that I recommend, and I suppose them to be ones he generated from his soul. He also has some films of a different type, films that prove to himself that he is equal to those he considers the greats. As if often the case, this involves a copy or near-copy of an esteemed film.Judging these is a tough business because the things I value the most are things that well up from a filmmaker's being, so when he intrudes on the original that difference is valued where another viewer might be offended. I thought the 'Psycho' remake was hypnotizing because of this.Unfortunately, I do not know the original. But I am well familiar with the type, and I'd say that Miike goes a bit too far in suborning the instincts he has so that fidelity is preserved. Perhaps this is apt. The anchor of the story is absolute loyalty to tradition regardless of whether it is evil. The main body of society here is held together (we are repeatedly told) by tradition. The thirteen assassins of the title are working under official but secret aegis to kill an evil lord who is next in line for control. The idea is to save society. We learn at the end, but any Japanese viewer will know from the beginning that the resulting 'new order' became the traditional framework in which they now live. So we get the tasty cake and eat it because we get to celebrate the formality on one side of this battle with the noble boat-rocking on the other.This is no 'Seven Samurai' though the basic form is the same: the first act is the offense, the second the collection of the heroes, the third an epic battle against all odds where nobility of spirit triumphs. My guess is that Miike decided to use the stationary camera of Ozu with formal framing in the first two sections, and something like the fluid composition of Kurosawa in the battle. I think he failed on both accounts. His framing and focus are not overwhelming in their order as Ozu could routinely produce. And in the battles he uses the modern 'Braveheart' camera (recently noticed on 'Transformers'), that gives blurred snippets giving less information than you need except when a notable slice, grimace, death or trap appears.This is tolerable, but it does not do the job the man wished of it. It does not prove he is among the immortals. He seems to comment on this deliberately. Of the 13, one is not a samurai, but a simple, goofy thief. He, it turns out is the survivor and we get to hear him denigrate the masters he has fought with.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elevates Drama, Repurposes Bushido, But Loses Much Of What Set The Original Apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the original, Miike's remake reflects its time of production while elaborating and exceeding the genre tropes. However, it varies the direction of this deviation in interesting ways compared to the original and to such an extent as to stand on its own. Kudo's film had characters, protagonist and antagonist alike, motivated by bushido. And the late Tokugawa setting established these not as typical giri/ninjo conflicts of the genre, but as largely outdated ethics that turn their proponents into victims of historical and social forces outside of their control.Miike brings in more of a gender component early on, with Goro Inagaki's Lord Naritsugu engaging in not only rape and child murder, but sexual mutilation and slaughter. This allows Miike to draw in contemporary audiences expecting such spectacle from him instead of talky, jidai-geki set-up. But it also explicitly gives the villain dialogue elaborating his view of bushido - that it is the way of samurai to die for their master, as it is for women to die for their men. This slight element of feminism is largely original to this remake, although it is more present in the second film of Kudo's trilogy - The Great Duel.Through such explicit violence Miike also establishes more clearly delineated good/bad roles than the original film, to a different end. An innkeeper makes an aside to the effect that in these times, katana are only good for cutting daikon, and he has dozens piled up from losing ronin gamblers to prove it. It is the setting in which ethics have to be codified due to their irrelevance to daily life, as bushido has become a rationale for the sadism for the elite.The original 13 Assassins by Eiichi Kudo was a reaction to genre convention, like Masaki Kobayashi's Seppuku or Hiroshi Inagaki's Chushingura/Loyal 47 Ronin of the year before. It shares the revolutionary spirit and critical sensibility of Hideo Gosha, Kihachi Okamoto and Kenji Misumi. In Miike's iteration, differing concepts of bushido are more explicitly stated as a means to update and simplify the material for contemporary audiences. Our heroes more explicitly shed their identities as the travel towards the final clash, encountering a country bandit played by Yusuke Iseya. He is suspended from a tree as punishment for philandering, and is jokingly referred to as a tanuki. But the character provides meaning through contrast, as Mifune's Kikuchiyo did in 7 Samurai.Genre convention is played with, but more as a means to provide spectacle, a degree of feminist edge, and an updated film that casts the heroes as on a more current search for identity. Certainly less of a critique and deconstruction of those genre norms so prevalent and still popular at the time of the original film.The climactic village death trap could also be interestingly contrasted to the finale of Seven Samurai. Director Kudo had Chiezo Kataoka lead the 13 assassins into executing an elaborate series of traps, leading up to his final duel with the villain's equally noble chamberlain played by Ryuhei Uchida. This film has Koji Yakusho doing the same, with the addition of some flaming CGI buffalo.But whereas in the original, they are not killing one another out of personal malice but necessity, here the lines are clearly drawn and characters are assigned more or less noble deaths according to their virtue. The heroes attack and retreat in guerrilla fashion, but they do not die in quite as desperate and pointless a manner that the ending of the original film drove home. I won't spoil that ending here, I already did that in my spoiler-laden review of that movie.It is the anti-climactic fashion of key characters' ends that defied cliché genre expectations in the original, and this is largely lost. Although the melee is equally frantic, and arguably even more well choreographed and excitingly shot by modern standards - it serves different and perhaps less pointed ends. By making the killing serve a dramatic point, it loses much of what set the original apart. That sense that hero and villain alike were bought and paid for, a product of their time and made to serve the ends of others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot summary:First 15 minutes: The half-brother of the Shogun is a stereotypical Japanese psychopath who likes killing and maiming his servants for sport. He'll soon be promoted to some Council where he'll have more power to do bad things. Therefore he needs to be assassinated. Let's call him Bad Boy.Next 30 minutes: Recruitment of the 13 Assassins. Next 30-40 minutes: Bad Boy is travelling from some part of Japan to another part of Japan. 13 Assassins plan their attack. They buy over some village that they know Bad Boy will pass by. and set it up Home Alone-style.Final 1 hour: Bloodbath. And surprise, surprise! Bad Boy gets killed in the end!! End of movie.Review: Everything is utterly predictable and stereotypical. Bad Boy is just the usual psychopath. The samurai assassins are your usual samurai. The story develops EXACTLY as predicted. Nothing interesting. No character development, no nuances, nothing.When it finally gets to the bloodbath you are a little relieved because it has been a total bore so far. The initial Home Alone-style surprise attacks and explosives are somewhat amusing. But when it gets to hand-on-hand (sword) combat it is just STUPID. The sword fighting had all the realism of a bad 1970's Hong Kong movie. All the bad guys (supposedly 130 of them) just dicking around, hovering in the background, while each assassin gets to pick off the bad guys one at a time. Each bad guy waits patiently for his turn in the queue to get sliced up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no avoiding the violence in this film but it is also incredibly beautiful. It is therefore hard to disagree with the hateful Lord Naritsugu at the end - where he declares that the war has been the most exciting part of his life. Prior to seeing this film I really did not understand the Shogunate and other Japanese cultural references. I'm pleased to have learnt some real history and come to appreciate more of the Japanese just from watching this film. OK, some of it might be fantasy but, for an entertainment, to have such an impact on me suggests its great power and value. Sound and colour are tuned to the max - leaving the impression of great subtlety. It is a real masterpiece and I will be adding it to my personal library ASAP.

		<shortDescription>A pale copy of Kurosawa's "7 samurai"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of samurai movies, from Kurosawa to Kubayashi, or even movies like Zatoichi (old ones), the twilight samurai or Ghost Dog. So I was expecting something fresh with 13 assassins but I just found a pale copy of 7 samurai. It does not come close to the quality of Kurosawa's movie. The film tries to be realistic but is over the top quite a few time. The characters are just like in 7 samurai: One of them is not a real samurai, you have the pro, the young, the gambler etc.... It's just a remake of 7 samurai. The final battle in the village and the trap is also comparable. This movie is just more boring and does not show us anything new. A big disappointment for me. I'm saying all this because each time something happened in the movie, I was thinking "Damn again something stolen from 7 samurai".... I mean come on, give us something new apart from your super last fight which was honestly over rated. The manichean pseudo moral does not go to far either. They want to kill a very very very bad guy (who obviously has mental issues) and they try to turn this as a good vs evil thing... The actors and the music, which made 7 samurai unforgettable don't compare either. TO be honest, I got bored and I thought about stopping the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome movie,especially for a remade classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually looking for the 1963 Black &amp; white movie this one is a remake of but got this one almost by accident.However, I'm not exactly disappointed because it's a Takashi Miike movie(not surprising he directed it if you know his works). This wasn't my first rodeo with Miike &amp; I've watched his earlier works like 'Koroshiya Ichi"(Ichi the Killer) &amp; "Visitor Q" &amp;"Audition". So I expected the "Splatter Gore" he is so well known for &amp; also his penchant for the Strange &amp; Weird.But "13 Assassins" is him with a milder version of violence(on movie scale,that's comparable to Tarantino bloodfest &amp;not overkill on fountains of blood except for one explosion scene in the movie that'll actually make you go "Soreha no Takashidesu")&amp;no weirdness in story,probably since it's already off a well-known play &amp; a movie.But characters in the movie have definitely been revamped to up the ante &amp; have their own unique identifiers of 'just-off' which is super-cool! So whether it's super-samurais Shinzaemon &amp; Hanbei(one master-less Ronin &amp; other serving Akashi-clan tyrant Daimyo),classmates,rivals &amp; with distinct qualities of opposing natures chosen to oppose each other, a violent Hiruyama(movie shows adviser Doi picking him for his "spirit of sword" kenki),apprentice Samurais Higoichi &amp; Hioke who train in explosives but almost always get time of explosions wrong or mercenary spear-man Sahara,who just wants to live big..they are ALL a bit-off normal &amp; chosen specifically to assassinate an even crazier &amp; almost philosophically sadistic Daimyo(feudal lord) &amp; King's adopted(read 'natural' or 'Bastard') Half-brother Naritsigu from a well-drilled Akashi army led by Hanbei. Weirdest &amp; wildest of them all is 13th member,almost accidentally so &amp; clearly inspired by Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai''s Kikoichi character immortalized by Toshiro Mifune, the wild-ling bandit Kiga Koyita(played by Yusuke Iseya,who's a far cry from Toshiro,but is equally comic &amp; nearly as unkillable). Takashi Miike got a lot of fun out of him but actually made him almost magically able to heal a sword wound &amp; run around jumping after.He's one character who is hard to swallow..but rest are well-cast &amp; great. A driven Shinzaemon(Koji Yakusho), strategic &amp; 'okashira'(boss &amp; trainer of 13) Kuranaga(Matsukata), Lost to gambling&amp;finally-found a purpose(Takayuki Yamada with probably the widest scoped character of 13),Harakiri-driven Mamiya clan Zuso(Uchino)&amp;Yahaachi Horii(Koen Kondo) are all well cast.Honor killing,Harakiri by Seppuku &amp; assassination is the crux of the whole movie.The sadistic character of Goro Inagaki as Naritsugu deserves all the plaudits it can get &amp; it was superbly put to life.He rapes,murders,mutilates,philosophizes, strategizes &amp;dismisses his servants &amp; enemies alike with equal disdain &amp; is one for archives! All in all,story is well known,chase &amp; strategizing &amp; period drama dialog straight out of a Manga &amp; actors brilliant.Definitely the best I've seen of Takashi Miike.When he's not being strange,he is one of Japan's best directors.Worth a watch as much as 1963 Eiichi Kudo version.Ones who like action will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Build Up Into and Explosive Third Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "13 Assassins", Takashi Miike succeeds in making a samurai film for the ages. While the first two acts of the film can be seen as slow, they set the stage for the frenetic third act: one of the most enjoyable and creative action scenes in modern film. The first two acts of the film do a wonderful job of characterizing Lord Naritsugu, a man who has come into power and is not afraid to abuse it. Naritsugu is truly one of the most despicable characters of any story and his twisted nature provide the audience a reason to root for our "heroes", the 13 Assassins. The first and second acts also excel at establishing the samurai code, and its inherent conflict. Should Hanbei, Naritsugu's main body guard, stick to the samurai code and follow his Lord until the end, even through the atrocities he witnesses firsthand; or should he stick up to his Lord and protect the weak?The third and final act of "13 Assassins" might just be the most enjoyable 50 minutes I have ever seen. The action not only feels real, but is creative, unexpected, and has a surprising amount of comedic relief. When 13 Assassins have to face an army of over 200, they need to innovate and Takashi Miike does exactly that.While the movie does a great job of building up tension in the first two acts and releasing it in the third, it does fall flat in certain areas, most notably characterization. While the 13 Assassins all have interesting backstories and personalities, we are only hinted at those in each individual introduction, which only last about 30 seconds. In the entire film, only about four characters experience any meaningful development: Naritsugu, Hanbei, Shinzaemon (the main hero), and Shinrokuro (Shinzaemon's nephew). The amount of exposition also takes away from the film as the story is generally told through explanation by one of the characters rather than by visual cues or inference.Although not perfect, Takashi Miike accomplishes his goal in "13 Assassins", to create a truly enjoyable action movie. The build up of tension, culminating in the third act, is nothing short of brilliant and leaves the viewer near the edge of their seat throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie about a group of 13 Samurai warriors towards the end of the Shogun Era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished this movie last night. I really loved the film for what it's purpose was, a classic action movie. The beginning is very similar to how many movies of this genre begin. They find the few men who are willing to fight for what they believe in, and then they go fight in an impossible situation. The movie really takes off when you learn about the young man who is the brother of the current Shogun and the next in line for the throne. This man is supremely evil. He kills a newly married couple after defiling the young bride, and he also slept with a woman only after cutting off all of her limbs. This man is wreaking havoc on the nation at this point in the story. Our main character is approached by the elders in his village and is asked to stop the Shogun's brother, and the only way to do it is by killing him. The protagonist gathers his initial 12 men and sets off to kill the second-in-command. Along the way the men get lost in the mountains and stumble across a young Japanese man. This man is not a Samurai, but has extensive knowledge of the surrounding area. He joins the twelve, leaving us with the final thirteen men. When they finally reached their destination they decide to set the trap. The Shogun's brother ends up with a small unit of about 200 men, but heavily outnumbers our heroes. The initial traps were awesome, all except for the bulls that the men set loose only after setting them on fire. I really hated this part of the movie because you can clearly tell that is was CGI. The terrible animation of these running bulls really detracted from the story. The whole rest of the movie looks really natural and has some really great shots. This was really the only negative for me. I think when people watch this in twenty years, that scene will stick out like a sore thumb. Finally, the ending. Ten of the men initially die and we are at the final sequence with the protagonist and his nephew. They are face- to- face with the Shogun's brother and his commander with two guardsmen. The guardsmen are killed pretty quickly and so is the commander. The protagonist and antagonist face off for a split second and you think the bad guy wins. He sticks his sword into our main character, but that is quickly reciprocated. The heir-apparent thanks the men and tells them that it was the best day of his life. Our protagonist dies and we are left with his nephew and the mountain man who appears at the very end of the movie. Altogether, it was a great film. It was very reminiscent of Seven Samurai and I think they even drew a bit of inspiration from that film. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves action movies. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, moving, fabulous film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's histrionic and overwrought, and hard to believe if you don't buy it's premise of duty and conflict, set in Miike's beautiful and masterful style. But if you do allow Miike's unabashedly sympathetic portrayal of feudal Japan and the caste system of the Samurai to appeal to you, then this is an epic. It's also a positing of the modern Japanese questioning of the purpose of duty, of values trumping allegiance to a static system, and interestingly Miike doesn't have a neatly gift-wrapped answer in this film to Western observers who are curious about where modern Japanese identity is headed. So it's great fodder for dinner conversations!The pathos of the victims of the villain, the absurd and gory violence that Miike relishes and makes you sit through throughout the movie, the beauty of rural Japan, and his punctilious attention to beautiful traditional costume and architecture are all just wonderful elements of this film. Anybody can enjoy this movie, and walk away from it with a very rich aesthetic sense of Japanese feudal history. And so I think as a viewer you have to congratulate the director for making something which feels commercial and big budget and paced and crisply edited, and yet captures moments of ambiguity and moral complexity that make the experience of watching it very compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both a visual pleasure and an engaging tale of violence, honor, and tactics set in 19th century Japan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Assassins is a film by renowned director Takashi Miike, a man most famous for films like Ichi the Killer, Visitor Q, and Audition. If you're familiar with his previous work then it comes to no surprise that 13 Assassins is a very violent movie, though the violence in this film is never as "disturbing" as in his other films. It is also a remake of the 1963 film of the same name directed by Eiichi Kudô. In short, 13 Assassins is both a visual pleasure and an engaging tale of violence, honor, and tactics set in 19th century Japan. If you want to watch a film with well directed action, then this is a great film to watch.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~13 Assassins is a very drab looking movie, and I use the term "drab" in the most respectful way possible. For most of the film the screen is covered in shades of grey, while other scenes are painted in such striking color that you can immediately tell what Miike was going for, which was to show the obvious wealth gap between the rich and poor. While it's never pointed out specifically, it would be an historically accurate representation of Japanese society in the 19th century. The actors, particularly Tsuyoshi Ihara, all do an exceptional job at giving their characters a sense of realism and a legitimate purpose in their reasons for joining the Assassins. Every character breathes with life in ways that few films manage to do and this might be the strongest aspect of the entire film. We often see characters interacting with each other and making jokes in way that provides some insight into why they're risking their lives for each other.Despite for a few quick battles, much of the action is reserved for the final act of the film which serves as a very long battle in a small town turned into a death trap. Some might say that the battle alone is reason enough for watching the movie, but I personally found it boring at parts, though I recognize how impressive it all is despite that. The scenes with actor Gorô Inagaki are easily the show stealer for me. His character, Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira, is such a comically evil bad guy that despite his incredibly disgusting actions, I can't help but love him. His cruelty is unmatched in this film and everyone, including his own men, knows it.I would recommend 13 Assassins very much. It might be Miike's most approachable film and is a great example of blending story and action in a way that doesn't feel forced and trite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly epic battle of good versus absolute evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"13 Assassins" is an epic battle of good versus evil, with the stakes as high as they could possibly be. You've got a group of rag-tag heroes pitted against a villain so diabolical every cell in your being wants to see him killed. Don't think that means he's a cartoon though, because what really makes this movie something special for me is that while the film is grandiose and epic, it's never so outlandish that it feels like a fantasy film. The climax is nothing short of incredible. It grabs you, pumps up the stakes as high as they can get and never lets go until the credits start rolling. It's a sure hit for anyone who loves Samurai movies or any film where the underdog stand to lose everything but decide to take the chance anyway. One note though, when you watch the movie have your remote ready during the first few scenes because with the subtitles being at the bottom of the screen at the same time as some crucial written information being displayed, you have to pause the movie in order to get all of the little bits of information and the names memorized. If that sounds like extra work, you won't even mind after seeing the explosive action contained within this truly legendary battle.

		<shortDescription>Breathes new life into the samurai film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Miike, better known for darkly funny and sadistically violent fare like AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER, delivers an excellent period samurai film which also comments on the nature of honor, bushido and the concept of the samurai itself. The plot is rather simple: a group of 12 samurai (plus one other person they meet on the way) have decided it's in Japan's best interest to kill a lord with ties to the Shogun. The reason, well-established in early scenes, is because of his reckless disregard for human life. The first half is concerned with how the samurai conceive their plan and the second half is the execution of the plan, which is glorious and bloody. There was a lot of attention paid to the characters and their various motivations, and the story unfolded at a very nice pace: not too fast and not too slow. Also, being a Takashi Miike film, there was a couple of elements which put his stamp on the material (which is a remake). One is a particularly graphic suicide which opens the film, and the other is a naked, limbless woman without a tongue. One thing I did like about the movie was the meta-comments that were made on the concepts of bushido and the samurai, which completely removed any romanticism that might have at one point been associated with them. These ideas are expressed mainly through the 13th assassin and the lord (Naritsugu) who they're on a mission to kill. In such a stunning film, the only thing I can really complain about are some obvious CGI bulls (which are on fire) that appear in the second half. Other than that, this is an impressive movie no matter which way you look at it. Highly recommended, especially for fans of Japanese samurai films.</fullReview>

Nothing is better than a gritty tale of correcting injustice.This movie did an excellent job of pulling you in to the actual plight and motive of the 13 assassins. There wasn't a lot of special effects to rely upon, and as a subtitled movie, the dialogue was concise and good at conveying the plot. I especially loved the speech given to the Samurais as they were training: "If you don't have a sword use a stick... if no stick use a rock... you'll die but make the enemy feel pain." It's not a precise quote, but those are some very inspirational words. Comment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy if you're a fan of Takashi Miike, then you're gonna love this. A remake of Eiichi Kudo's 1963 black-and-white Japanese film of the same name, Takashi Miike brings "13 Assassins" into the spotlight like a "Hammer" studios produced monster classic. Ridiculous buckets of blood, superb characters with surreal choreography all brings Miike's most ambitious project (So far) to life stunningly.Amongst the beautiful panoramic shots of a superbly rendered period Japan, the movies villain is without doubt one of Eastern Cinema's most brutal to come along in quite some time. If I was to tell of any flaws, I would say some scenes feel too stretched out even for the style this movie superbly creates. But when all is said and done, the overall climax of this movie is without doubt the movies highlight. Limbs fly, swords cut and a real code of honour comes across our heroes and even the supporting cast.Final Verdict: I feel nowadays Cinema is lacking in many samurai flicks (Even westerns), which is why I urge you to please find this movie and see what your missing. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action epic with a soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1844 peace in Japan is threatened by the cruel lord Naritsuga and his followers. A council is held by the shogun adviser Sir Doi, and as he tells the mighty samurai Shinzaemon Shimada of Naritsuga's evil deeds, it becomes clear that the man must be taken care of. 13 assassins was a movie I avoided watching for a long time, partially because of my ignorance towards foreign films (which is long gone) and also because I judged it to be a typical action movie with little plot and over-the-top action. Reflecting on this stubborn mindset, I don't think I could have been any more wrong. Takashi Miike, who I'm quickly becoming a fan of, directed the hell out of this movie. He did an excellent job of establishing the villain and getting you to side with the 13. The actors in this film, none of whom I was familiar with, all did a terrific job in bringing their respective characters to life. Each of the samurai were unique, and all showed humor and heart to contrast with the dark tone set by the film. I even found myself getting upset as they were felled one at a time in the final battle. The first half of the film was more akin to a drama, and that was fine. There is a great deal of talking and walking as the characters are introduced, and at the same time we become more aware of just how evil Naritsuga really is. The film has a heart, and the values of the samurai, their honor and their beliefs were exceptionally well done. These men are shown as tea drinkers who rise up when called upon to protect their country. You see how they are willing to lay down their lives for the greater good, and would rather die than be dishonored. The climax of this movie was unforgettable and truly a highlight of modern cinema. The movie built up to the confrontation between the 13 assassins and Naritsuga. The battle, a 45 minute show fest of swordsmanship and blood was possibly the best action I've ever seen in a movie. forced to go through a village, Naritsuga and his force of 200+ men run into booby traps and explosives in what was to be a "total Massacre." After some messing around the 13 samurai all unsheathe their blades and jump into a suicide battle. The shots, choreography and editing in the scene were fantastic; it was vaguely Tarantino-esque in terms of violence, (think kill bill) but it was beautifully done. Nothing was better than seeing the 13 of them cut through Naritsuga's samurai like butter. Overall, this was a great movie and a very satisfying watch. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and sword fights, or to someone who just wants a really well told story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'13 Assassins' is a masterpiece of the action genre. It owes it's success to nothing truly unique though. What we get here is a story with well developed characters and high stakes (it really is all that simple). Takashi Miike silences all the filler and aesthetics that dog down so many poorly made American action films and delivers a sensational film that has meaning. It has been a long time since I have seen a film as thrilling as '13 Assassins'.American action films are all about aesthetics and '13 Assassins' doesn't care about them as it's primary concern. Miike is a brilliant storyteller. His superb 'Audition' is an exercise in building tension and suspense. It delivers the horror it promises but after a long and intricate build up. I thought he was the closest someone had come to Hitchcock. in '13 Assassins' Miike does what he did for horror for the action genre. In many ways this is a film about giving substance to the fighting and that is really what I miss in American action films. '13 Assassins' is a slow and deliberate film that delicately balances motives and ideas. There is a good hour before any samurai sword play takes place and I actually thought the first half was by far the more intriguing part of the movie. Miike invests his time wisely in explaining the mythology of the samurai to the audience. We get to come to understand what drives these characters and what a powerful force it is. He has a challenge in having a cast of thirteen characters and yet no one feels out of place because Miike explores the motives so well. And in the end like all good stories it is a story of good vs evil and Miike has a grand hero.Koji Yakusho is outstanding as Shinzaemon. In many ways our hero is one we have seen many times before but Yakusho and the script bring something very fresh to the character. Shinzaemon is a brilliant character because he mixes the samurai code with very real human feelings. It would be far too easy for Miike or Yakusho to indulge in simply making this character be all about appearances but Shinzaemon is driven as much by samurai honor as he is by being a human being. Some of the finest acting in the film comes when Shinzaemon is shown the horrors Naritsugu has committed. Yakusho delivers a look of awe free of the facade he has created for the samurai. The character takes this suicide mission because he believes in the good he can do in the face of evil while others like Hanbei blindly follow samurai code. This is a great character in the mold of all heroes of lore and he is expertly performed by Yakusho.Make no mistake '13 Assassins' is a gory film with a grim final act. But it is a film that gives weight to it's violence. We fear for these characters and are drawn into the action because we do. A film can have brilliantly choreographed action but for the action to have impact there has to be an emotional connection. We aren't watching a dance here we are watching a war. It is a brilliant finale that Miike has set up. These characters go to die for something that the audience thinks matters and that is really the highest compliment you can give a film like this. It is a testament to Miike's direction and also the expert performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film of two halves but both work well in different ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a little wary of films from Takashi Miike as, although they are generally received as good, my experience of them has been that they are bloody and very odd. Thirteen Assassins though seemed a bit more accessible in terms of being more straightforward, which in some ways then makes the violence a little easier to watch. The plot here sees the amoral behaviour of Lord Naritsugu infuriate a small group of men who, led by veteran samurai Shinzaemon, set out to trap him and his 100+ entourage of guards (led by samurai Hanbei) in order to kill him and end his rise to power for the greater good.This plot essentially cuts the film in half. The first half of the film is the setup and is mostly dialogue driven. It is slow and patient but not dull as the main thing it does is to turn the main character (and the audience) against Naritsugu by virtue of the terrible things he has done. This is brutal and quite shocking in regards some of the things we see, half-see or view the aftermath of. At the same time it gives us some time to get to know the thirteen main characters; although there is an air of honour to all of them, the characters do have traits of humour, weakness, anger and so on, which mark them out but also add some colour to the telling. The second half of the film begins when the trap is sprung and a small village becomes a contained killing field soon to be filled with bodies and blood.I had wondered how I would find this because there was always the potential that action involving this size of a crowd would just be a mess of flailing and blood and that it wouldn't have any tension or flow to it. To a certain extent, this is a bit of a problem at times but mostly Miike overcomes it by splitting up the characters across the village and mixing smaller conflicts with bigger ones. You do still need to buy the sight of tired individual men cutting through a stream of 20 men but the narrative sort of makes this easy (it is a time of peace with a lower standard of samurai) but also it isn't all this type of action. It is bloody but without being overly gory for the sake of it. The delivery manages to make me believe the concept of the honourable death (not something I do normally) because of how dishonourable Naritsugu is and how likable Shinzaemon is throughout. The cast do well in this regard not only to make characters but also to remain distinguishable in the midst of the chaos and blood. Yakusho is strong in the lead and he contrasts well with Ichimura and Inagaki well; both of whom are also good even if Inagaki has a bit of an open goal in regards doing a simple amoral character. The supporting cast are good and mix their characters well with my favourite being Iseya who is fun and funny even if what his character represents sort of doesn't work for my western viewpoint.Overall though, Thirteen Assassins is an engaging film that has good build-up which explodes into chaos and violence for the second half. I don't think it is perfect but in fairness some of the problems I had with it came with the plot and the territory, so they are not failings so much as just part of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a Miike movie this is definitely very conventional. There are bits and pieces thrown in (no pun intended), where you might see the craziness shine through, but overall, this is pretty standard. That is not to say that it is bad. It might even attract people who are not fans of Miikes work to watch this.But of course his update on the "7 Samurai" theme/story, moves along as you might expect it. The fact that we have 13 people here make it even harder to distinguish every single character (or to really give everyone rhyme and reason, let alone a 2-dimensional character). Still Miike does his best to pack as much (back)story and fight as possible in the running time. I think he succeeds in making a very entertaining movie. Not a masterpiece, but surely something that anyone who does not despise Asian cinema will probably like a lot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moral evaluation of samurai culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brutal meditation on the absurdly extreme values of Japan's Samurai era and the extraordinary human beings they shaped, 13 Assassins would be a great film even if it didn't include one of the most awesome martial arts battles in cinema history. Director Takashi Miike is unflinching but never exploitative of either his characters' physical or emotional anguish. He builds a solidly straight forward plot of political and military maneuver and laces through it pointed observations of Samurai culture and late feudal Japan. When he brings his story to a climax with a jaw-droppingly daring fight scene that takes up over a third of the film, there's nothing at all outsized or excessive about any of it. The movie is so powerful and wrenching that it couldn't have ended with anything less.Lord Naritsugu (Goro Inagaki) is the half brother of Japan's ruling Shogun and unspeakably evil. He treats the rest of the world as if it exists for his empty amusement, which by law and custom of the day, it practically does. With the Shogun unwilling to punish or restrain the murderous madness of Naritsugu, his chief adviser (Mikijiro Hira) must take matters into his own hands. He tasks Samurai master Shinzaemon Shimada (Koji Yakusho) to assassinate Naritsugu before he can grow powerful enough to threaten the peace of all Japan. Shinzaemon assembles 11 warriors and one woodland hunter and sets an ambush, only for the 13 to find themselves facing over 200 loyal soldiers of Naritsugu who are led by Hanbei (Masachika Ichimura), an old friend and classmate of Shinzaemon and a better Samurai by far than his lord deserves.While the moral outrages of Naritsugu and the righteous revenge of Shinzaemon dominate the surface of this motion picture, its underbelly is all about the perverse-by-modern standards culture of feudal Japan. It is not a world of freedom or liberty or even justice. It is a tyrannical existence of master and servant, where servant is more like slave. These storytellers are phenomenal at getting to the paradox at the heart of such authoritarian, autocratic societies. When they are built about a good master, the most amazing and inspiring things are possible. When the master is unworthy of such responsibility, however, life becomes a hell on earth for everyone including the master. Naritsugu commits the most repulsive of acts, yet stands revealed at the end as a man driven mad by his own empty and pointless existence.The battle scene at the end is just?wow. It isn't merely exciting and bloody. Director Miike brings out the soul of this kind of hand-to-hand, sword-to-sword combat. It's not intricately choreographed. It's hack and slash and run and fall and lunge. Guns are one of the greatest democratizing forces in human history in that an untrained novice can be as deadly as the most skilled gunman. With swords, one man who knows what he's doing can massacre scores of guys who don't. That vicious inequality is what Miike brings to the big ambush and he emphasizes it by having many of the 13 assassins die more from exhaustion than being outdueled.I also want to salute these filmmakers for the different characterizations they bring to the different generations. The younger samurai are all rather rigid and on edge, so consumed with the demands of their position that there's almost a brittleness to them. The older samurai, however, have been around long enough to let go of the ridiculous demands of their lifestyle and ethic. They hold true to the samurai essence but are far less worried about following every last detail of protocol and propriety.13 Assassins is an incredible motion picture. You should absolutely make an effort to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Miike = Great Miike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a admirer of Miike's work since Odishon and some of my personal favorites include Ichi the Killer, Visitor Q, and Gozu. His more recent work has shown far and fewer standouts. However, I've always appreciated how Miike includes what he wants in his films no matter how extreme or upsetting. This usually results in great reactions from a live audience. His vision and non mainstream methods of directing occur on different levels (sometimes WAY WAY different). After viewing 13 Assassins, I must admit that Miike has successfully mesmerized me again with this dark tale.Miike uses a big budget to collaborate the sets, location, weaponry and authentic clothing to really show the times of feudal Japan. Very minimal cgi is used (although one highlight scene garnered a great response in my theater) and the sound effects are powerful ranging from heavy horse hoofs, arrows in-flight, and blade striking blade. Shinzaemon and his nephew Shinrouko really shine. Any scene with Koyata is a blast and he really stands out anytime on screen. I liked how the Assassins and Lord Naritsugu's troops are both well versed in war with the no mercy rule in full effect. Few weak links on either side makes war that much more interesting.I'd recommend seeing 13 Assassins. It will most likely be an addition to my cinema library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bloodfest - but in a good cause</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see many Japanese films but I love a good samurai movie and you don't see many of them these days. "The Last Samurai" (2003) was an American effort, yet rather good. "13 Assassins" is more authentic in being Japanese and is in fact a remake of another Japanese work of 1963. The director Takashi Miike is noted for being prolific (this was shot in just two weeks) and excessive (this is certainly a bloodfest, although somewhat restrained by past standards). Using a minimum of CGI, this is a gritty, muddy conflict in which limbs are lost and heads do roll.Set in 1844, at the end of the Edo period of rule by the shoguns, the story pits the noble warrior Shinzaemon (Kôji Yakusho) and 12 volunteers for death against the brutal Lord Naritsugu (Gorô Inagaki) and his entourage of 200 soldiers. After a slow process of selection and training of the assassins - a process familiar from both "Seven Samurai" and "The Magnificent Seven" - we have a terrific last three-quarters of an hour of non-stop combat in a deserted village. It would not be a spoiler to tell you that, at the end of its all, not many are left standing. Not since "The Wild Bunch" in 1969 have I seen such a concluding orgy of death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 ASSASSINS. The Dirty Baker's Dozen? Prolific Japanese director Takashi Miike (Audition, etc) leaves behind his preferred milieu of gangster thrillers and horror movies to venture confidently into Kurosawa territory with this sword and samurai action film, set in mid-19th century feudal Japan. 13 Assassins is a remake of Eiichi Kudo's 1963 black and white samurai movie of the same name, but infused with Miike's distinctive brand of graphic violence and carnage. A band of thirteen mercenary warriors and samurai set off on a suicide mission to kill the sadistic and bloodthirsty Lord Naritsugu (Gorô Inagaki), whose actions threaten to undo the years of peace that Japan has enjoyed. Cue plenty of swordplay, bloody action, mayhem, decapitations, and a body count that would make the likes of Tarantino envious. The film is slow to start as it spends a bit of time delving into the political machinations of Japan under the rule of the shogun. But once the film gets down to action it is full on as Naritsugu's army is lured into a booby-trapped village of Ochia. The climactic battle sequence is epic in scale, and occupies much of the film's generous running time. Miike directs these exhilarating scenes with gusto, and revels in the carnage. His action scenes make films like 300, with its CGI armies, pale by comparison. Like Peckinpah's classic The Wild Bunch, which echoed the death of the old west, so too does 13 Assassins reflect the death of the samurai code and way of life in Japan. Characterisation is fairly slim, especially given so many characters, and Miike doesn't give us enough detail about many of the characters to allow us the engage fully with them or empathise with their fate. Veteran Japanese actor Koji Yakusho (Babel, Memoirs Of A Geisha, etc), brings a sense of gravitas to his role as Shinzaemon, the veteran and principled samurai leading the gang of mercenaries. 13 Assassins is a formulaic film for sure, but it also succeeds as a wonderful homage to the samurai cinema of yesteryear and classic like The Seven Samurai.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Period Piece from Miike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In feudal Japan, the heir to the current Shogun, Lord Naritsugu, is a sadistic devil, raping and murdering at will ? doesn't matter if it's peasants, samurai families or anywhere in-between ? and because of his standing, nobody will stand up to him. Until samurai Shinzaemon (Koji Yakusho) gathers together a dozen intrepid samurai, and picks up one very odd peasant hunter to make 13 assassins, determined to stop Naritsugu at all costs. Doing so means buying a village and rigging it up as a death trap, and being completely prepared to die horribly, as long as the mission is accomplished. Will the 13 assassins manage to win against all odds? Will the evil Lord Naritsugu see his comeuppance finally? Well, you'll have to see the movie to find out....At FantAsia 2011, we were treated to the Director's Cut of this film, the director being Takashi Miike, who can sometimes be uneven in his work, but here he does an extraordinary job. The last hour of the film is essentially an extended fight scene and even I, someone who doesn't feel a need for a lot of fight scenes in a film, didn't get tired of it or bored ? it was just amazing to watch. The actors are all terrific, and the film takes the time for the audience to get to know the characters, to admire the brave samurai who are all fighting for various reasons but mainly for love of honour, and to roundly despise and hate the evil Naritsugu (played marvellously as a bored aristocrat by Goro Inagaki); the viewer is invested in these characters, and that makes this film truly remarkable. I don't know if Japanese mythology has a Trickster God similar to Coyote in some Native American traditions, but the indestructible peasant the samurai meet in the forest is very much a Coyote character, who adds immeasurably to the humour of the piece as well.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: 13 Assassins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Assassins is that big budgeted, ramped up samurai action picture in the same spirit as Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, where a group of skilled swordsmen get their destiny all charted out when the people look toward their expertise to uphold justice, and the men stepping up to be counted in the face of societal adversity. It's that typical story of moral courage of a few good men chosen to execute a mission to try and reset the status quo, or die trying while at it.Miike's film is structured in a wonderfully simple way, and it starts off with perversion in introducing the main villain, Naritsugu Matsudaira (Goro Inagaki) who is the Shogun's brother, but earning a reputation of being a cold heated killer, rapist, and just hell bound bad guy with zero morals or respect for the sanctity of human life. This film would not have worked without this basic, powerful half hour set up where a character so vile gets luxuriously painted to get you to thoroughly hate the person, his action and his guts, while painting him to also be a formidable, skilled opponent that you wonder just how difficult it would be to get to him for a face off, but how delightful it would be to finally get that shot to take him down.The film then launches into its midsection which played out like a typical heist movie, with the recruitment of the would be perpetrators and an introduction to what they bring to the table, coupled with the meticulous planning in preparing for an almost suicidal mission where a few men would be taking on an army, guessing and second guessing intent and what the enemy would likely react to any planted changes, in an effort to stay an extra step ahead. And there's the tense face off between the leaders from both camps, rivals once when young and now standing on opposites, engaging in barbed dialogue and scare-mongering, psychological tactics to size up a known opponent. It's a poignant scene on how each are duty bound by their orders through their honour and the usual samurai values they live and die by.With 13 heroic characters crammed into 141 minutes meant an unequal amount of screen time getting devoted to each of them, so a tradeoff becomes inevitable, but the ones who do get introduced in depth thankfully turned out to be as varied and as interesting as can be. There's the leader Shinzaemon Shimada (Koji Yakusho) who got tasked to take up this mission, and in doing so assembled his team which included trusted deputy Saheita Kuranaga (Hiroki Matsukata), a star pupil Kuzuro Hirayama (Tsuyoshi Ihara) whose skill is excellent par none, and various other inner circle, trusted members to undertake this secret mission, including his nephew Shinrokuro Shimada (Takayuki Yamada who also worked in Takeshi Miike twice in the successful Crows Zero series) a compulsive gambler and womanizer who's obviously in this mission on a quest for redemption.But the character of Koyata Saga (Yusuke Iseya) served as the most interesting of the lot, not being of samurai stock, and chanced upon by Shinzaemon and team en route through a forest, before Koyata's wit and know how in navigation earned his place to be with them. Providing a fair share of comedy and critique on the ways of the samurai, I thought this chap personified a higher being for his stunning turnaround scene at the end which may leave some bewildered, as well as to provide Miike an outlet to deal with some of his more signature stuff, including Koyata's an incredibly large member and high sex drive which did stick out like a sore thumb in the more serious build up where Shinzaemon's troops got down to fortifying and booby-trapping the village.One needs to look no further than the two Crows Zero films to know that Miike can deliver full scale assaults with balletic qualities, accentuated by an adrenaline pumping soundtrack. If it's action you're craving, 13 Assassins delivers by the loads through a gloriously choreographed 45 minute action set piece utilizing a series of weapons from bows and arrows, spears and explosives, where it becomes like a reverse Bodyguards and Assassins where every angle of the ambushed town got covered in blood and body parts, with plenty of on-screen dismemberment of limbs. It's no holds barred where the element of surprise, and the discovery of being grossly outnumbered, brings forth that sense of inevitable dread amongst those from both sides, as one seeks to cut off the head of the hydra, while the other frantically looking for a way out of being uncharacteristically cornered. Plenty of pathos got built in as well especially in that final few fights, where you will find it hard not to weep for the fallen.It isn't easy to take down the corrupt who have power and the sworn loyalty amongst the powerful, but this film inspires in that provision of hope that so long as good and able men are willing to make that sacrifice for the common good, there is still that fighting chance to make right the things that have gone wrong under the hands of the criminal. Even Fate would also lend a hand. Definitely highly recommended as this swash-buckles its way to be amongst the best of this year's selection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Assassins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shinrouko?being a Samurai is truly a burden."Two Samurai clans are at peace until the half-brother of a powerful shogun starts destroying all the people under him (such as servants, women, and children?this sadistic cretin kills anything that breathes) leading to the selection of 13 assassins who will vow to kill the evil Lord Naritsugu (Gorô Inagaki; a villain in the grand tradition of Miike's movies, cold-blooded, soulless, with an empty void incapable of feeling for those he harms). Shinzaemon Shimada (Kôji Yakusho; a force of nature) and nephew Shinrouko (Takayuki Yamada) are members of this suicide Samurai squad, with no other goal than to put an end to Lord Naritsugu before his gaining of further power on a high counsel. Sir Doi (Mikijiro Hira), powerless himself to stop Lord Naritsugu (he must obey his master), commissions Shimada for the mission, knowing that if he hears stories of what the madman has done to his own people, it might convince him to accept what will certainly be the embrace of an eventual demise. All of this started when Lord Naritsugu raped the daughter-in-law and killed the son of a Samurai in his own village; this village, ironic enough, will be the place where Shinzaemon and his twelve assassins(they pick up a bandit along the way who actually helps them reach an important road after getting lost in the wilderness) go to battle with Naritsugu's 200 man army, the scene of the crime which caused everything afterward. Masachika Ichimura is Shinzaemon's lifelong rival, Hanbei Kitou, who will protect his lord with all his might. Regardless of what Lord Naritsugu had done, Kitou is devoted to his master, as is the Samurai code, but Shinzaemon has dedicated himself to a greater cause, defending the endless slaughter of many innocent people. Miike's old school Samurai opus features quite an extended battle for the finale. It's an incredible conclusion, stretching credibility to the max (seriously, 13 men being able to mow through 200 + men is asking us to go out on a limb, wouldn't you say?), with some amazing, exhilarating camera work and editing showing all kinds of action throughout the village?this is not an easy feat considering you have Shinzaemon's Samurai spread out the village engaging in furious combat with Lord Naritsugu's army. I imagine many will find the Samurai swordfighting a bit repetitive after a while since it consists largely of bodies en masse falling, the sound effects of metal slicing flesh really signifying an enlarging body count. Yakusho emulates Toshiro Mifune, exuding a quiet strength and exemplifies integrity, his fate an example of fighting with dignity, for a purpose that defies the common Samurai code warriors are raised to upheld. Inagaki's Naritsugu truly believes that servants can be treated anyway their master so pleases, property to be dealt with as he sees fit. If a psychopath is allowed even more power than he already has, only further horror awaits peasants and village citizens in the area within and around Edo. Shinzaemon also fights to keep him from receiving this honor. Not as graphically violent as you might expect: Miiki even keeps the camera from showing the spilling entrails of those who commit hara kiri, respecting these characters instead of exploiting them to give gore fans extra kicks. The film, like a lot of Samurai films, takes its time setting up for the great battle (the Samurai train against one another), as Shinzaemon and company fortify the village, creating booby traps and explosives for Lord Naritsugu's army, even though by the end the strength in numbers makes things difficult for our heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: 13 Assassins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the film buff that I like to pretend I am, I am still yet to see Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai- a work that has supposedly spawned many films since and is widely regarded as one of the first films to introduce plot structures such as recruiting a group of characters to to accomplish a specific goal and having a main hero undertake a task unrelated to the main plot. 13 Assassins leans on this movie which it has clearly been influenced by.The story follows the efforts of a group of samurai as they aim to assassinate the evil Lord Naritsugu (Gorô Inagaki) whose malevolence and monstrosities against his people know no bounds. Unable to touch Naritsugu due to his links with the former and current shogun , a senior politician realises that he has to be stopped before he obtains a higher rank and becomes an even more dangerous threat. He secretly enlists the help of a trusted samurai Shinzaemon Shimada (Kôji Yakusho) to gather a group of samurai together with the task of eliminating Naritsugu.Despite me not being the best judge of the way of the samurai, I was not born in the 1840's in Japan, I felt that 13 Assassins portrayed what it could well have been like during that time. Setting the film in a time of relative peace was a good choice as it meant many of the samurai had no real life combat experience or know-how which gave them more depth- they are trained killing machines and yet for some of them, they have never even killed.The main draw of this movie is the combat sequences and action shots which are impressive to say the least. The whole movie is basically enacting out one long battle scene with the first half setting up the characters and the last hour being dedicated to the massive battle scene. There is quite a bit of gore to keep an eye out for in both the fighting scenes and others with many limbs being severed and plenty of guts on show. The fighting scenes are well done although if I had to find fault, I would say at points it did feel as it the samurai were fighting wave after wave of enemies leading to it feeling a bit 'samey' and instead of heading straight for Naritsugu the samurai felt compelled to slash their way through the footmen first when they could have gone for him straight away. But that's just me nitpicking.The number of unfamiliar Japanese names being mentioned along with the fact that the samurai are all wearing similar attire and have the same haircut whilst having to spend time reading subtitles rather than watching can lead to some confusion. This does fall away though while the movie progresses as the characters take on more individual personalities especially within the samurai group.Credit must go to director Takashi Miike who not only has created a beautiful movie in terms of cinematography and direction but also has brought the honour, tradition and way of life of the samurai and Japanese culture to the viewer in emphatic fashion. Awesome fight scene, solid acting and the ability to not shy away from the gore lead me to wanting to watch this again.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for fanboys and fangirls of epic gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as we hate to admit, violence is entertaining. Why else would the WWE be so popular? One might even agree that violence is in itself, entertainment. Witnessing the madness and chaos that are involved in an act of physical violence is both thrilling and arresting simply because they are out of place in most of our 9-5, middle-class, democratically- governed realities. In other words, through it we find escapism. Not only that, appealing to the cavemen (and cavewomen) in us all, there is a sense of liberation too in watching violence. When a movie opens with a realistic cringe-inducing scene of a man performing the infamous hara-kiri or self-disembowelment, you know that you are in for a treat. Despite the historical and cultural contexts which might be unfamiliar to some, the epic film stays dedicated to engage the audience. With scenes involving exploding bodies followed by showers of blood (yes, they do have bombs during the feudal times), hacked limbs and rolling heads, the explicit no-holds-barred violence is intended to surprise yet fascinate the audience with morbid, unthinkable gore that are not out of place in contemporary horror movies like the Saw franchise.At the heart of all the madness in this film is the evil Lord Naritsugu. Used to not hearing no to every destructive whim and fancy thanks to his ties to the shogunate, he develops a nihilistic complex that is so extreme that the only sane reaction would be nervous laughter. Well, at least that was what the writer found herself doing. Without giving away the details, the lord rapes, tortures and kills just for kicks. He even eats a whole fish with his face buried in it. Ermm, yeah. Set to take over the reins of feudal Japan, he worries all those who still believe in hope and justice. Enter the 13 Assassins ? a band of samurais who are keen on posing a much-delayed challenge to the insane lord with the intention of defeating him.One should be wary to simply label the film as a mindless samurai bloodfest. Coupled with a classic good versus evil plot are insights into a world that is exclusive to those who are born in it. Directed by Takashi Miike who is probably most well-known for his ultraviolent controversial film Ichi the Killer, 13 assassins serves to explore with meaning the ways of the samurai. In an age where samurai heroics are dying and kept strictly to the dojo, the audience is posed with questions regarding the strict nature of the samurai lifestyle and its complex repercussions to society and the samurai himself. Known for their loyalty to their cause, the film asks if a good samurai can still be respected for his loyalty even if his cause is bad.Spanning two hours, the film takes its time to deliver both a subtext- filled story and entertainment to the audience. And from that, you should take the cue to prepare yourselves for a 45 minute long battle scene that is nothing short of epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honor and cause</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot here is basically about 13 assassins getting together in order to defeat a evil dictator or tyrant. His way of getting what he wants no matter who he kills or rapes makes you really loath him. The plot may seem very simple but it's the execution of it all that really drives this movie. This really is a entertaining flick that adds to the excitement with good action scenes and because it makes you believe in their cause to fight. This is a brutal movie but it's difficult not to be against the brutality the assassins dish out. The task at hand may come off simple at first but leads to a lot more, however the constant reference to the way of the samurai or samurai code gets overused a bit and gets overplayed. While not giving something new that most warriors in general follows. The build up is done well enough and the sword fighting sequences are cool because of it's method and tactics before entering battle.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Assassins is guilty pleasure for seekers of violent action who are patient enough to wait for its execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Assassins, a Golden Lion nominee at Venice, is a sumptuously photographed film that is excellently set-up by the filmmakers, features an action-packed second half whose intensity rivals that of the climatic hospital sequence in John Woo's shoot-'em-up masterpiece Hard Boiled (1992), and ends on a slightly ambiguous note that unfortunately feels a tad too surreal for a film that is anything but. Directed by Takashi Miike, the infamous director of insanely violent films such as Dead or Alive (1999), Audition (2000), and Ichi the Killer (2001), 13 Assassins is surprisingly tame in comparison, though I must say the decision not to make this a gore fest is spot on.The premise is as simple as it can be: Lord Naritsugu (Goro Inagaki) is the evil younger brother of the current Shogun who enjoys torturing and killing women and children to satisfy his weird desire for violence and lust. A group of samurais, led by Shinzaemon (Koji Yakusho), is hired to assassinate him before he ascends politically to the top and declares war on peaceful clans. The mission is extremely tough because Lord Naritsugu is protected by hundreds of men and a master samurai called Hanbei (Masachika Ichimura), who trained with Shinzaemon when they were apprentices, adding a layer of intrigue.The villainous nature of Lord Naritsugu is depicted very well. Early scenes show his cruelty, in particular a vile scene that sees him shoot arrows at a family that is tied up, including a small boy. There is also a very disturbing scene featuring a nude woman with all her limbs severed, with a character explaining how she is used as a sexual plaything. The soulless eyes of actor Inagaki and his lack of emotion towards human suffering are very effective in building a strong sense of hatred for his character.In comparison, there is no one strong protagonist, though Shinzaemon comes close. Like Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), the samurais in Miike's film are collectively portrayed as both battle-hardened tacticians with skills to outwit any foe and overly enthusiastic warriors who know the meaning of sacrifice. But unlike Kurosawa's masterpiece, each samurai's personality in 13 Assassins, with the exception of Shinzaemon, is developed only minimally and enough for the function of plot. Very predictably, there is the requisite sword duel in the climax, which gives us a relatively quiet moment of calm in what is a loud and chaotic second hour that while relentlessly entertaining, may be a trifle too overwhelming for some.In a nutshell, 13 Assassins is guilty pleasure for seekers of violent action who are patient enough to wait for its execution. This Miike film is well-directed and should provide an interesting alternative to the loud fanfare of Hollywood summer blockbusters.GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic samurai flick by Miike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of a 1966 Eiichi Kudo film, Takashi Miike's "13 Assassins" finds a small band of elite samurai embarking upon a mission to assassinate the sadistic young Lord Naritsugu.The film belongs firmly to the "men on a mission" genre ("The Dirty Dozen", "Ocean's Eleven", "Seven Samurai", "300", "The Magnificent Seven" ? notice a trend?), in which a leader typically puts together a team of misfits and specialists and then embarks upon a mission against ridiculously superior odds. Here the first half of Miike's film is spent interviewing and gathering men for the assignment, followed by a 45 minute battle in which our 13 assassins square off against hundreds of enemy soldiers. It's a Pekinpah/Spielberg inspired bloodbath, in which our heroes nobly accomplish their mission, before themselves dying.In terms of flaws, the film's script lacks surprise, and Miike too often ignores strategy in favour for repetitive hack and slashing. Miike's battles themselves lack spatial sense, and are often unrealistic. The film does eventually win us over with its sheer, bloody relentlessness, but a better director would have added a more tactical, and intellectual kick ? and thereby more drama ? to the wordy, political battles of the film's first half, and bloody physical battles of the second.Like most samurai films, "13 Assassins" espouses simple, even offensive values ? sacrifice, submission, murder, honour, servitude etc ? though it eventually pushes past such things and enters somewhat original territory. Here, Miike's ragged band of heroes advocate nothing less than making your own leaders bleed before they get into power. Only with this asserted pressure, this constant threat of force, will they then govern with fairness. It's an interesting idea - reverse dictatorship, where the populace governs its rulers with fear? ? but one which the film has no real interest exploring.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing. See instead: "Twilight Samurai", "Hara-kiri", "The Seven Samurai", Hiroshi Inagaki's "Samurai Trilogy", "The Hidden Blade", "47 Ronin", "Yojimbo", "Sanjuro", "Kiru", "Throne of Blood", "Goyokin" (1969), "Chushingura" (1962), "Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance", "Samurai Assassin" (1965 version), Kurosawa's sublime "Ran", and the great Masaki Kobayashi's "Samurai Rebellion".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"As a samurai in this era of peace I've been wishing for a noble death, now fate has called me here." After being told of the horrors of the evil Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira (Inagaki), Shinzaemon Shimada (Yakusho) recruits a group of 13 samurai to stage a suicide mission and kill him. As I have said before I am not a big fan of martial arts type movies. While this was more of a strict samurai movie, I have to say this movie was excellent. Not knowing much of the history behind the samurai I was surprised to learn how guerrilla like their tactics were. The first half of the movie is a little, not slow necessarily but more deliberate in the pacing. It involves the reasons why Lord Naritsugu must be killed and the training. When the actual battle starts you will be glad you watched. The choreography is artfully done and the fighting is very, very brutal, but in a way that it's not in your face bloody. Very, very well done. For anyone that loves these type of movies this will probably be one of the greatest movies they have ever seen. For someone like me that is not a big fan of this genre it is still an excellent movie and actually makes me want to see more movies like this. Overall, a very well done samurai movie that will appeal to all audiences, not just the martial arts crowd. I give it a A-.Would I watch again? - I think I actually might.*Also try - Legend Of The Fist &amp; Hero</fullReview>

No character development, no plot twists, no turns or surprises - nothing.The cruelty of the evil lord was most memorable and sometimes, I felt, given the film's almost total lack of depth, gratuitous. In fact, the problem with the evil lord was he was SO evil death was too good for him! So that left you holding the bag when it came time to resolve all that you'd seen from him.The (very) ending was great.

		<fullReview>13 Assassins is a throwback to the samurai movies of the 1950s-60s. No fancy CG work or special effects. Just guys in well choreographed sword fights, m?lées and battles.Miike's version is slightly different from the original in the ending and atrocities committed by the lord. If you were to compare the original and Miike's, Miike's is lacking in some areas. The pace is faster and does not convey the suspense and gravity of certain scenes. Also black and white is better at portraying the nastiness and desperation of battle.However if you have never watched the original, Miike movie is good. The 1st part is a bit slow but the 2nd half is battle. Best comparison is to 7 samurai. Body count 212. Desperate men fighting desperately to stay alive. Nothing pretty and no gravity defying swordsmanship. Simple hack, slash and stab. Oh and being a Miike movie, you see gushing blood, decapitations and dismemberment,I hope it starts a trend where movies of this genre move away from all the CG.</fullReview>

Then we see the dealings of the justice and the samurai. Then you wonder whether we'll ever meet this villain. And then we are introduced to him. A nasty fellow who thinks very highly of himself and thinks that everyone else is his servant and that they are his property and thus their lives are his to play with.The main samurai who is also a childhood nemesis of the guy in charge of the villain's security has to gather more samurai to confront the army of security around the bad guy who happens to be traveling around the area. he gathers 12 sad samurai either too young or too old but all willing to die for the mission.Things get exciting as they plan their attack. Even the first couple of minutes of the actual battle is interesting. But things go downhill from there as the fighting is nothing noteworthy. It all build ups to climaxes: the two rivals facing each other and someone facing the ruler. Both of these are handled in the most anti-climactic fashion imaginable.This movie is slow to start, builds up some momentum, and what ought to be a complete blast turns out to be a letdown. There is nothing in this movie that stands out or is in some way excellent, it's not even good. There are some interesting lines about power, war, death, and that's about it. Perhaps one has to be fanatic of the director to appreciate this movie, or love all things Asian. There is no other explanation for the glowing reviews that this mediocre movie has gotten. None of them explains in what way this movie deserves high scores, let alone why it would be a masterpiece as some claim. This movie would have to have been filmed as an R-rated movie, it was given an R-rating for no good reason as there is barely any violence and blood. There is some cheesy humor, some unintended humor in the apparent spirit of amateurishness with which 13 Assassins was filmed.</fullReview>

They plan to ambush him on his trip back to the Akashi land. The men get lost in the mountains and meet hunter Kiga Koyata. The 13 assassins fight overwhelming odds after converting the town of Ochiai into a fortress.It's a samurai movie with big action and a solid story. The story is well laid out although I would have preferred it to be snappier. Samurai movies do have a lot of ponderous expositions. The lady with no arms is creepy. Also some of the assassins don't get enough screen time. There are 13 of them. However it doesn't get better than the big giant samurai battle in the last act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this samurai bloodbath runs a little longer than it should have, it arguable is also the best film that Japanese legendary filmmaker Takashi Miike has made. Beginning on a slow note, 13 Assassins picks its pace up really well in the second half and ultimately culminates on a rousing high with blood splattered all over the screen. Impressive enough to be ranked as one of the best samurai films in recent times, 13 Assassins also pays homage to Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai in many ways &amp; as far as the battle sequences go, at one point it seemed as if the battle will never come to an end. Wonderfully directed, sincerely performed &amp; violently told, 13 Assassins is too bloody &amp; violent to satisfy everyone's taste but for those who can handle it, it's an incredibly entertaining action film with massacre written all over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7 Samurai - 2 stars = 13 Assassins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The prolific and protean Takashi Miike, having already amassed a vast and varied back-catalogue of contemporary thrillers, romance, comedy, gore, action, drama and musicals in less than two decades, sucks it up and takes on Kurosawa with this period samurai epic.Japan, 1840s. It is an era of peace. A time of waning power and relevance of the samurai order, and the decaying final years of the ancient feudal Shogunate regime.Lord Naritsugu, the preening and sadistic younger brother of the current shogun, carves out a swathe of terror and suffering, seemingly out of mere listless petulance. But with higher political office likely to come his way soon, and following the protest of ritual seppuku committed by a wronged clan leader; Sir Doi, a senior official in the current political order, covertly seeks out an experienced samurai to help rid the land of this cruel and dangerous presence.From this set up, you can probably guess the rough structure of what follows. Our de-facto master samurai must assemble a small group of warriors to ensnare and take down the evil overlord, protected as he is by a small army of his own. This will involve the recruitment of some grizzled old fighters who have seen better days, some over-idealistic young students who have yet to fight a real battle, and of course, an unruly, somewhat comedic outsider who will be grudgingly admitted into the ranks against better judgement to make some unlikely but crucial contribution.Whether it's Seven Samurai, The Dirty Dozen, or Ocean's Eleven, this is a movie in that grand tradition of the numbered, but outnumbered team of good guys taking on a big bad against the odds. What matters here is not that we can't see what's coming, but that this is a movie that takes such care and pleasure in the unfolding of the story.Naritsugu is a truly appalling creation, grotesque in the casual disinterest he shows in the terrible violence he inflicts, like a child half-heartedly pulling wings of insects in boredom. He's a man out of time, no longer of use to a Japan at peace and soon to join the modern world. He only seems to engage with anything when the heat of battle is up, but even then, not to care over the win or loss that he and his men might achieve or suffer, but merely to have, briefly, any consequence at all.The samurai , we gradually comprehend, are in a similar situation. The long unfolding of the first act explores the archaic ritual and routine of their antiquated order, the rich and complex intertwining of codes of honour, and conflicting loyalties, but also of nostalgic wistfulness for glory days long passed. It's a powerful and telling moment when the leader Shimada is shown (in an effort to sway his heart in horror and pity to the mission being proposed), a woman tortured to a gut- wrenching, nightmarish vision of Dantean hell, and rather than displaying anger or grief, his mouth twitches into a wry smile. He's just been shown a reason and purpose for his continued existence.After that, it's men on a mission greatness. Plans, maps, subterfuge and misdirection, treks lost in the wilderness, and the "let's make our stand here" turn, with all the classic war movie / western / A-Team tension-ratcheting preparation that this entails. The third act battle is coming, and it's going to be something special.A smartly constructed, character-rich adventure that segues into an object lesson in clear, dynamic battle staging that takes up at least a third of this lengthy movie and never bogs down or loses focus. Takeshi Miike, the infant terrible of Japanese gore, and crazed seven-films-a- year auteur of chaotic zombie-musical-comedy spoofs has pooled all his considerable talents here to craft an altogether more mature work. And, if he hasn't quite equalled the perfection of Kurosawa's samurai masterpiece, he's come majestically close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An electrifying Samurai flick since Akira Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Miike, notable from his excessive portrayal of sexuality and ghastly violence on his films "Audition" (1999) and Ichi: The Killer, is on top of his game once more. His next picture "13 Assassins" is a true masterpiece since the late and legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa reign supreme. Probably influenced by his unforgettable works in the Japanese film industry, Miike is simply engrossed with the idea that he himself could revive his notion into something bold and more compelling. And there's no denying the fact that Miike has outdid it gain, with a compelling story and strong performances, he follows Mr. Kurosawa's legendary epic with a touch of his modern and relentless style of filmmaking.The film is a slam-bang remake of Eiichi Kudo's film back in 1963 of the same title, though it didn't go well that year. The story is set in 1844, the medieval Japan is threatened by the barbaric Lord Naritsugu (Goro Inagaki), and is posed as threat for the Japanese era and is becoming powerful. After the hara-kiri protest of one of the Namiya Clan members, the protagonist shogun samurai Shinzaemon Shimada (Koji Yakusho) is summoned by a shogun adviser Sir Doi (Makijiro Hira) to listen to the tragedy of Makino Uneme, whose son and daughter-in-law have been murdered by Naritsugu.After Sir Doi has revealed what Lord Naritsugu has done brutally with a woman, Shinza has been requested to defeat Lord Naritsugu to avenge her and all the people who have been murdered by Naritsugu's madness. Though the senior shogun adviser cannot defeat Naritsugu, Shinza gathers 13 samurai and plots to defeat him and his samurais, 200 warriors to be exact. Takashi Miike has the wit that a number 13 samurai warriors may and can defeat a number of 200 villains, even though the odds are pretty rare. Pretty much like Zack Snyder's 300, but I wouldn't compare this one into a somewhat mediocre sleaze-fest premise that Snyder made. 13 Assassins is a big-budget Blaxploitation film fueled with breathtaking narrative, great cinematography and costume design that really fulfills the wish of an epic world for Miike fans. The characterization is sharp and develops some humor which is evident in most of Miike's filmography. Though it'll take some gradual time before the film takes off to what the viewers are waiting for. As any Miike films filled with fountains of gore, 13 Assassins is a bloody-wish fulfillment.The action remains to be the longest samurai battle of this century, but it is absurd to look at the time when it's over. It'll make you glued to the screen and harness a great action film. It's bloody and gripping especially when the Samurais are now engaging in a killing spree of clanging swords. It's impossible to resist an action battle like this.Much has been said about the narrative, it's also quite long and talky. It'll take time before the action to arrive. But the film is ingenious on dialogue and is decisive. No matter how long we wait for the greatest moment on the film, it still matters how great the actors were. It is a balance of diminutive drama with more laughs and much more anticipation. But what it really bothers me is that somehow the film relied on CGI effects, though it's not that noticeable. More and more films will still follow Miike's love of the Samurai films. Having said so, the next film he will direct is Hara-Kiri: The Death of a Samurai in 2012. I'm not quite sure whether fans would think of it as a sure bet for another Takashi Miike experience, but what the hell, if he can make a good film as good as 13 Assassins, I'm already sure that the next great experience is still yet to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miike mayhem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many of the best Japanese directors, the versatile Takashi Miike makes seamless transitions from genre to genre. The results vary, of course, but in general are satisfying. 13 ASSASSINS is the by-now-familiar tale of a group of samurai recruited to save a village. (While Akira Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI happens to be the greatest movie ever made, I don't really have a problem with the basic premise being borrowed for "reinterpretation"- though one WOULD like to think that contemporary versions were being undertaken to ADD to the mythology and not just to cash in on the originality of the original.) If I have a complaint (or two) about 13 ASSASSINS, it's in the way over the top fx: explosions one can kinda sorta accept (gunpowder, and all that), but the apparently very hastily constructed moving walls were altogether a bit much- and the minimal wirework could've been scrubbed completely without sacrificing anything at all. The Big Battle is good in that it gives one just a hint of how physically and emotionally wearing just such a confrontation might be. My final gripe is more confusion than anything else: was the guy at the end a ghost, or what...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Assassins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Assassins is a surprising development from Takashi Miike; one that I hope doesn't continue. Coming from him, even the inevitable carnage that unfolds on screen is surely modest. An explanation might lie in the fact that this is a remake of a half-century-old film, which could explain his unusual restraint. Perhaps fidelity to the source material which is based on a notable incident of recent Japanese history mandated rigidity with regards to the narrative. It's isn't bad as much as it's surprisingly inert. Still, of all of the ways the movie could have undone itself, its adroit avoidance of glamorizing the historical period in which occurs or cheaply exploiting its heroes' masculinity is admirable in our era of shallow epics. This allows it to actually work as the biopic it purports to be, unlike many of its contemporaries. Miike's direction is evident, though it's odd to praise the subversive director of films like Ichi the Killer for being conventional.The story occurs late in the Edo period, which ended around the 1860's. This was when shoguns ruled the country through hereditary titles and military superiority. Samurais were their personnel who kept them in power, though some samurais were independent. So if a bad guy happened to inherit power, there was little the people could do to resist him. Many conventional movies have emerged from this setup, and this one fits nicely within its predecessors. 13 Assassins is the story of how a small group of samurai managed to overcome a force of 200 men in a small village.Aging Shinzaemon recruits 11 men and sets out to kill Matsudaira, a local tyrant who loves to dismember and rape. There's nothing of note here until Shinzaemon splits his forces in two and sends one to the forest to take a short cut and the other to ready a village for capturing Matsudaira. The forest group encounters the movie's best character, Kiga, who adds some beneficial comedy to the leaden script. Kiga isn't a samurai at all, but the group reconvenes and adopts him as its final member. He may not even be human either, though you wouldn't know that without either being Japanese or reading Wikipedia.The group meets at the village for ambushing Matsudaira, and actually manages to kill a lot of them before they die individually. Miike depicts their heroics and deaths like battles are normally shown in modern films. Each warrior gets his own screen time and occasional banter, though only Kiga's is memorable. He treats the entire scenario, including his own death, as a farce. Of all the stupid ways masculinity forces people to act irrationally, the belief that one must die to uphold an intangible honor is irrational, and thus bizarre. Mentioning this through Kiga was a great touch while he making a film in support of this crazy ideology. Eventually one samurai triumphs and is greeted by an otherworldly Kiga before the film ends.13 Assassins is actually more worthwhile than I may have made you to think. If you haven't seen any of his earlier treasures, don't see this one yet. It's an unremarkable effort from a director full of films that are uniquely his, as you should see for yourself. The only Miike subversion I identified is Kiga's character, though he remains static throughout the entire picture. Miike recycles him from his first appearance to the end with little else to offer more demanding audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very well made with some quite awesome fight scenes, so hats off to the stunt guys and fight arrangers (great stuff!). I found the beginning of the film very confusing, there is a lot about the politics of the day and I found it hard to decipher just who was doing what to whom. After a while though the threads of the plot did begin to make sense and I found it much easier to follow (&amp; enjoy). In many ways it did put me in mind of two films; 'The Magnificent Seven' (based on the 'Seven Samurai' which sill lurks on my 'to see' list), and 'The Dirty Dozen'. Both fine films in their own right, but I could see links to both of them here. For me, I felt the level violence (&amp; gore) could have been turned up a notch, but I guess they really wanted that 15 certificate. Over all though, I found it a very enjoyable film and one I have no problem in deeming RECOMMENDED (provided you have no fear of subtitles (or gore)?).My score: 8.4/10IMDb Score: 7.7/10 (based on 19,910 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 87/100: (Based on 23 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 85/100 (based on 111 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 88/100 'Liked It' (based on 17,600 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my samurai favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie takes place during the Tokugawa era, nearing the Meiji restoration, where samurai are virtually non-existent or considered a relic of history. I am no Japanese history expert, nor am I skilled with a sword, but as a martial artist I certainly respect and sympathize with many of their cultural values, as well as the shared understanding of the warrior spirit. With 13 different samurai, it is easy for a vast audience to identify with at least one of the characters. This movie inspired me to take my weapons training more seriously, thus resulting in some nunchaku adequacy as well as some katana insight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood and guts for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found myself struggling to get through the first hour of 13 Assassins. Through that point the film appears to be a workmanlike Seven Samurai retread, well-constructed but not especially interesting. And then the other part of the movie strikes: an hour-long siege battle that's both an orgy of violence and a cinematic masterwork, ebbing and flowing with the kinetic, creative energy that Miike has become known for. It's a breathtaking sequence that manages to capture the thrill of battle as well as the horror of it, a line few films have managed to walk.In the end, I'm not sure if I can describe 13 Assassins as a good film. The characters are paper-thin and the plot isn't much better, but at least the first half of the movie expects us to care deeply about these things. It's only once it plunges into full-on spectacle that it becomes great. But that final battle is more striking than anything a lot of films with deeper stories. I wish Miike would have dispatched with the pretenses a little earlier, because as bloody fun 13 Assassins is thoroughly satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the obligatory elements of samurai lore go into making this one an essential entry into the canon.Miike's darker elements have been toned down considerably, although not eradicated entirely, relying on story and action to supply the entertainment rather than shocks.In fact, apart from the opening few scenes, the film is a largely straight samurai action movie driven by plot, character and scenes, which while always being entirely derivative of the source material, still feels fresh.The final section of the film certainly delivers on the promise of its set-up. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Assassins (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film by acclaimed Japanese director Takashi Miike is about 13 samurais tasked to assassinate an evil Shogun lord before he can sit in full power and be a tyrant. At the core of this is the samurai code of obedience vs. doing what you know is right in order to protect the people.This is no doubt a great homage to Seven Samurai and I welcome it with both arms wide open. Some characters in this film are very reminiscent of the beloved classic. The first half features how our samurai protagonist, Shinzaemon (Kôji Yakusho), recruits samurais for this mission and planning the assembly. We also see how the Shogun lord (Gorô Inagaki) is painted to be the villain with no redeeming factors whatsoever. Because of his deeds you as a viewer would happily see him die. The build up in the first half is quite slow but it all leads to the epic second half of pure battle. If there is another movie that I can think of with the same plot line aside from Seven Samurai it's got to be 300.I've only seen 4 films from this director but if I can describe his films I have to say they are collectively "cool." How this film was shot is fantastic. There was an amazing scene where a "sweeping camera" effect was utilized. By the opening shot you just hear voices talking and slowly, with the sweeping motion the subject enters on the far right side of the screen. By the time the sweep finishes he (subject) is on the left side lower frame even if he didn't move at all. This says a lot on how it was thought of because you have to time these things ? from the dialogue to the camera movement to the positioning of the characters. The photography is clean and orderly and each frame looks very nice. The film is R rated but some of the violence are implied (thank goodness) and wasn't dwelled upon, oddly from a Miike film. When someone does a hacking it is out of frame and the focus is only on the facial reaction of the poor fellow. If it isn't out of frame it is a very quick shot. I have to mention this because there are some films that would really show to you the full out violence. For example, when someone stabs another, they really focus on the stabbing part, making it all gruesome and dramatic and a stomach-turner. Here I find the violence to be just the right mix, without it being too gory and manipulated (or maybe I just watch many gory films and I find this tame in comparison.) Some scenes are very haunting and disturbing though.The characters are mostly caricatures but I find myself still rooting for them. Their growth didn't come on deep conversations or choices they make but it was really on the battlefield where they exercised strength and bravery. Some aren't given the focus though so as a viewer I got confused on who's who. There was a particularly cool character named Hirayama Kozuro (Tsuyoshi Ihara) who arguably has the greatest shining moment in the film. The guy is pure badass. If you watch this film you know what I am talking about.This is a good film and very enjoyable to say the least. On top of the great photography the accompanying music does it's job fairly well. It takes you right into the action. I think some may find the first hour boring with all the set up but the pay off is the second-half. If you are looking for a nice samurai film pick this up and wait for the moment where assassin Hirayama takes on some of the evil lord's soldiers. That alone is a great reason to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He who values his life dies a dog's death."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Miike has always been a filmmaker for people with particular tastes. He's best known for massive amounts of blood and insane or grotesque moments in his films that make you double take and verbally gasp. Films like Audition, Visitor Q, Ichi the Killer, and Gozu illustrate this point to disturbing perfection. But there's more to the Japanese director's repertoire than most expect or even know about. The man has dabbled in just about every genre; The Happiness of the Katakuris was a musical, his Black Triad trilogy brought his extreme violence to the crime genre, he tested the waters of both westerns and the English language in Sukiyaki Western Django, and he even jumped head first into the superhero genre with Zebraman. Takashi Miike may be known for disturbing and violent cinema, but that isn't entirely fair to a filmmaker who has directed over seventy productions since 1991. It was only a matter of time before Takashi brought his versatile sense of filmmaking to samurai epics and 13 Assassins is an incredible place to start.13 Assassins is a remake of the 1963 film The Thirteen Assassins. Without actually seeing the original film, this is more of a review of just the film as a standalone feature. What I have read about the comparisons between Takashi's Assassins and the original is pretty astounding. Hollywood remakes tend to make the mistake of remaking films frame by frame with all the same story points and conclusions. It makes the entire process feel like a waste of time. Takashi actually takes ideas from the original film and expresses them in different ways in his remake. This is done by swapping characters in the scene or different camera angles. Wildgrounds posted an article that goes into a bit more detail and it's worth a look. This alone makes 13 Assassins special. It almost completely redefines what a remake can and should be.This samurai epic is a slow burn meaning it takes quite a while for the action to really get going. At a little over two hours long, 13 Assassins does seem to over explain things. Also there's a fairly large chance you won't be able to remember all of the thirteen assassins; at least by name. Most of the movie is spent gathering the troops and acquiring samurais for their cause. Once all of that is taken care of there's still training to go through, a run-through of their plans, and a lengthy forest sequence. But despite feeling over explanatory, it is still worthwhile and fairly intriguing along the way. That forest sequence does pay off by introducing Koyata (Y?suke Iseya), who eventually becomes the 13th assassin. The character is an obvious nod to Kikuchiyo (played by Toshiro Mifune) in Seven Samurai. Koyata is quite possibly the most interesting character in the film due to him not actually being human and his similarities to Kikuchiyo make him awesome right from the start.The last battle is epic in itself. Everything in the film has been building to this. Lasting nearly forty minutes, it's safe to say it pays off. People expecting Takashi's over the top violence will walk away disappointed though. There's one crazy moment in 13 Assassins that comes to mind and a few fairly gory scenes, but it's not up to the standards you're expecting. The violence is strategically placed to mean a bit more once you actually see it and not come off as completely senseless. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, as well. Fog plays a pivotal role and the forest, while being hell for the characters on-screen, is a joy to look at.While I can't compare 13 Assassins to the film it's based on, it did have shades of all of the great samurai movies I have had the pleasure of seeing. It even felt like a new version of Seven Samurai at times without making the mistake of modernizing everything. 13 Assassins does come off as a bit too long for its own good and has the tendency to explain things in too much detail, it is still one of the few films out there that can be considered a true remake. 13 Assassins shows how far Takashi Miike has come as a director while focusing more on the story than the beneficial expectations some have come to anticipate from the director. Despite its flaws, 13 Assassins is one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Blur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similar to the western story of 300, 13 Assassins tells the tale of 12 samurai &amp; 1 forest bandit and their elaborate scheme to murder a sadistic and evil lord, Naritsugu (who you will grow to abhor - Goro Inagaki does an incredible job of portraying him). My impression upon the first hour and fifteen minutes of the film were pure brilliance. The film is filled with beautiful imagery that captures the essence of feudal Japan. There is a clear internal conflict within the characters regarding duty, honour, and what is right in a system so tightly dictated by a social code. The first 10-15 minutes of the battle scenes are well choreographed and incredible to watch.Now, here's where the "blur" part comes in. Typical of a 1 vs. 1000 fight scene, the one-on-one battle scenes are a blur. I watched with some level of confusion of who is who, and what's going on... and at that point, the film slips from sheer brilliance to cliché, reminiscent of 300. And then bam.... it's all done... I'll need to watch more samurai films to compare, but my overall opinion is the film shines in some scenes, but turns into a chaotic whirlwind more than halfway through... Still a good watch though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 Assassins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another year, another film, another new style of film-making from Miike Takashi. This time, the samurai epic.So, obviously this film is very similar to that of Kurasawa Akira's 'Seven Samurai'. A samurai is tasked with a mission, and so has to hastily pulled together a crack team of samurai, of different characters, culminating with a epic battle in a small Japanese village. All pretty solid, standard stuff.This time round it's the pervy weirdo Lord Naritsugu that is the bad guy; ordered to be assassinated by his Shogun half-brother. This leads samurai Shinzaemon to seek out a team to carry out the Shogun's decree, plotting the head him off at a small village. And so goes the first hour of the two hour film.After preparing for battle, the second hour is then an all-out sword- fest, with the kind of fight scenes that took months of choreographed planning rather than split-second decisions in the face of death. And impressive it is, often exhilarating as the 13 heroes take on over 200 hundred useless henchmen who politely wait to be killed one-by-one.The first half is not your typical Miike fodder, filmed as any mainstream epic would typically be, but the second half has more of a bloody and violent feel that you would more expect. Serious moments can appear a little comical in places ? perhaps one of Miike's flaws, hindering from being as revered as his peers ? and there is little real character development here among the 13 titular roles. Unlike 'Seven Samurai' where the team is considered and thoughtfully put together, here samurai appear here and there, and little is known of them bar their name, with Miike preferring the audience to enjoy their bloody demise rather than create any empathy for them.But like many of his films before, while all are different is style and content, they all have that little element that makes them typically Miike; mixing both comedy-violence and a sense of disbelief at what you have just seen. While neither his best, nor the best samurai epic ever filmed, it is a joy to see that Miike can make a more serious, accessible film after many years and an extended filmography of gore.www.politic1983.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with many contrasts and some memorable scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 assassins is a typical Takashi Miike movie with some hints at Japanese history and mythology. The movie has many stunning scenes that will stay on your mind for a while. Already the harakiri opening sequence is quite intense but there is also the scene of a young and crippled woman begging for vengeance and the scene of a family massacre that are really touching and maybe hard to watch for some people. On the other side, there are also some humorous scenes that lighten this movie up in a good way. The filming, the music and the locations are also always well chosen.The movie is clearly divided into two very distinctive parts. The first half introduces a lot of characters and features many dialogues. As in many other Miike movies, it's not always easy to follow what happens to whom and why but it's less difficult than in movies such as "Family" or "Gozu". I watched this movie with a friend from Asia and I'm relieved to see that it wasn't only me as someone who has grown up in a occidental culture who struggled with some parts of the plot. The movie gives some interesting insights at some characters but should have been more precise at some points.The second half of the movie is a total massacre in a small Japanese village. The movie features many great sword fights, explosions and original traps. For about forty minutes, the movie gives you no time to breathe but it ends on a rather smooth note after all.In the end, I think that the transition between the two parts of the movie happens too fast and both are redundant at some points. In the first half, there are too many dialogues and it takes some time to get into the movie. The second half starts with a lot of action but doesn't vary very much and get's a little bit redundant as well. The fighting scenes and choreographs are amazing but forty minutes non stop violence gets a little bit boring after a while. I also think that the final scenes of the movie are not touching or intense enough. I might also add that some parts of the original version had been cut for an international release and I would have liked to see them to understand the characters (for example the bandit that seems to represent an immortal ghost spirit as I read later) a little bit better.On the positive side, the movie has many memorable scenes, a couple of intriguing characters and great images and words directed by one of the Asian's best directors. Any fan of samurai movies should check this film out. It's far away from being a masterpiece but an interesting release you could loan or buy at a cheap price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grand, old-fashioned slice of entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Miike's new samurai film is very much like the classics of old ? and, in particular, Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI. There's a slow and gradual build-up, during which time we're introduced to the titular characters and one very unpleasant villain, and then one extended, rip-roaring climax in which an entire village becomes a battleground for the heroes and the army opposing them.Viewers expecting more depth than that will be disappointed, as 13 Assassins is very much a straightforward film. There are elements of Miike's perversity in the hideous crimes carried out by his bad guy, Lord Naritsugu, and in a sub-plot involving a forest-dwelling spirit which has been excised for international viewers, but viewers expecting a bloodbath will be disappointed. This is a surprisingly restrained film, at least on a visceral level; there's little focus on blood and guts action, although the sound effects more than makes up for that. Still, the film doesn't need it either: the choreography of the climatic battle is excellent, stylishly putting across the heroism of those involved and the frenetic nature of the running conflict and keeping the momentum and excitement going at all times.Both script and cast are understated in the best Japanese tradition, and it's rare for one of the good guys to betray emotion. Koji Yakusho, as the elder who forms the team of assassins, holds the film together with a performance of genuine gravitas. Goru Inagaki's villain is truly a man who deserves to die, thus setting up a story in which the suspense never dies down, instead building until the fittingly epic-feeling climax. There's a danger of 13 ASSASSINS getting lost amid the dozens of similar historical adventure films coming out of Asia at the moment, but that would be a shame as it's a rousing, old-fashioned film in the best sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Assassins is about a group of unneeded Samurai, due to the arrival of guns from the west, that are put on a special mission and rise to the occasion despite their inexperience.What Slices; 1) The acting swings well 2) The story chops sharply 3) The directing is a stab through the heart.What Decapitates; 1) Confusion. For me 13 was enjoyable overall. If you enjoying a good Japanese fighting flick, that you will like this but it takes effort to get over the beginning. Have no fear though you will be well rewarded in the end. To enjoy it more I recommend watching it on as big and bright and high quality a TV as possible, since the dark colors are part of the reason I was confused (every character wore similar outfits and I couldn't tell the actors apart).Also drink an energy drink and take a nap before hand because you will need to be super focused to catch the wave in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So those of you familiar with Takashi Miike probably know of him for some of his more over the top movies like Ichi the Killer and Audition. This was the first movie of his I have seen that takes on a more traditional story line and he does a excellent job. If you have seen, Kurosowa's Seven Samurai, or the American remake, The Magnificent Seven then you already know what goings on here. 13 Assassins come together to face off against an evil Lord and impossible odds. This movie is not really bringing anything new to the table but it is still a really enjoyable watch, and filled with lots of action. If you are fan of this genre then don't miss this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Crap!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should just be said right now that there is a 40 minute long action sequence that closes Takashi Miike's 13 Assassins, and if you can just sit through the film for that alone, it's totally worth it. Luckily, there are still more reasons than just that to catch this samurai epic.The whole film is greatly directed; the action sequences are both comprehensible and thrilling and the work before that is equally as impressive. The cinematography by Nobuyasu Kita captures the sweeping grandness of the story and it's certainly clear why these assassins are so passionate to kill this villain. It's full of typical samurai thematics such as honor and bravery, while also accenting the struggle to respect the declining samurai genre directly through the characters who also try to honor the brethren with who they once stood with. It manages that, to a point, though it lacks the depth of a Kurosawa film and might have too many characters to ever get invested in any of them. But as a purely enjoyable action film, those last 40 minutes and the final denouement sequence will leave you breathless. B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Japanese Samarai movie I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a girl and the only reason I bought this movie is because my husband has been dying to watch it. I've been looking for it everywhere to rent to no avail and finally gave in to buying it. The guy at the video store said he didn't understand why it had such great reviews, only 1/2 the movie had fighting in it, blah, blah blah. My husband and I would completely disagree. The first part of the movie is an incredible story (though sometimes hard to follow because everyone wears the same thing and you have a hard time telling them apart). A Shogun's brother is destroying families and becoming an embarrassment because he uses people like they are trash (maiming a servant, raping another, killing an entire family). He's brutal and without remorse. The Assassins step in and decide they need to do something. The fight scenes and brutality scenes can be quite bloody but everything feels very authentic- it's not a cheesy Japanese movie, it's a real, thoughtful and thought-provoking movie not for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have found the film just OK. For my tastes it is really too old school. Directing/filming fights in this way, is for me prehistory. I do not like either films where all is special effects. But here all is just confused and flat. So many people fighting, no breaks, no special angles, direction is really straight and old school. There are moments that in my opinion are even ridiculous. I cannot understand how this film got to get 7,6 rating here and 96% in Rottentomatoes! That's just extremely exager-rated. Anyway, the acting is OK, and in the fights (which are concentrated in the last third of the movie) there are some good moments. But honestly I felt absolutely nothing watching this film. No tension, no emotion, no excitement, no epic feeling. And the characters gave me also absolutely nothing. The film is written and directed and shooted in a way that I felt just a distant observer of a flat scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Be warned, if you aren't into samurai flicks then don't watch it, if you don't understand the Japanese lifestyle, leave it. If you think that this is another typical gory Takashi flick (imprint for example), leave it. If you want to see a great flick about samurai and the way the system went back in those days then this is surely one to watch. The acting is sublime and even as it clocks in at two hours it never bored me. This isn't just about slaying and murdering, there is actually a story going on.The way it was directed was excellent, a thing we could expect from Miike. Naturally he's getting older and moves away from ultra gore but the red stuff do flows. The movie starts rather slowly but you have to get into the 13 assassins to get involved with the characters. Of course it isn't that simple because we aren't used to those names. Further on you need to know a bit about the classes in the Japanese lifestyle to understand why and who everybody is reacting to. The last 45 minutes the battle begins and it really never stops. There is use of CGI for the running of burning cows and some blood is CGI but overall everybody got really messy with the red stuff. This is a perfect example that Samurai flicks are watchable as they are made by Japanese directors. Again, great acting and perfect directing. The master is back.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a history of feudal violence, peace finally reigns over Japan, but the calm is threatened by the growing power of the Shogun's sadistic half-brother Lord Naritsugu (Gorô Inagaki), who rapes and murders at will, his evil deeds hushed up by the authorities. Shogunate adviser Sir Doi (Mikijirô Hira) recognises the danger that Naritsugu poses and hires samurai Shinzaemon (Kôji Yakusho) to assemble a team of assassins to take care of the problem.Prolific director Takashi Miike is best known for his bizarre and gory cult movies, including shocking horror Audition, ultra-violent live-action manga Ichi the Killer, and taboo-busting familial drama Visitor Q; for 13 Assassins, he turns his hand to the classical samurai genre, delivering a two-hour-plus epic of two very distinct halves.The first half establishes the plot and introduces its characters; the pacing is slow and deliberate with lots of dialogue. Fans of the director's more uninhibited movies might find the going a little tough at times, although Miike does at least see fit to include a couple of typically warped scenes amidst the chit-chat (Naritsugu using a defenceless family for target practise, and a limbless woman with her tongue removed?another victim of Naritsugu's perverted ways?writhing helplessly on the floor).The latter half of the film picks up the pace, as the seriously outnumbered samurai prepare booby traps for the enemy in a village, using the element of surprise to help them cut a swathe through countless soldiers in order to complete their mission. The violence is well choreographed and energetic, but with the final battle consisting of 40 minutes or more of non-stop sword-slashing, and the graphic gore kept to a minimum, I found it to be a little on the repetitive side. As unrealistic as it might be, I would have preferred to have seen Miike employ some old-school Lone Wolf and Cub-style arterial spray and a variety of severed appendages to prevent monotony from setting in.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb. Not at all bad, but a little too conventional to be amongst my favourite Miike movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the reviewers compare this movie to the Seven Samurai of Kurosawa, but I don't know what movie they were watching. Yeah, like comparing Apocalypse Now to Kickboxer 4. Kurosawa's masterwork had a plot in this universe, a continuous plot that had logical elements built on top of each other. The 13 Assassin is a lot less convincing movie with serious logical glitches and holes. Is it a part of some post- postmodern reading that I didn't get? What is the point of someone dead being revived just add some stupid sentences into his mouth? The Lazarus coming back had his throat cut some 20 minutes earlier... This movie had everything subjugated (logic, reality) so that it could show scenes the director held important. The ending scene, the flowing blood from the rooftop out of nothing, not killing the prince because he has to be left last so we can have the "great revenge scene", all this is a part of a great fan-service. I'm still waiting for the review that explains all this and maybe I'll see the movie with a different eye, but sadly most of our reviewers rejoice the gore and the action, saying this is a masterpiece and caring not about plot continuity or logic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 AssassinsThe problem with thirteen assassins sent to kill one person is that, by the time it's your turn to strike, the target's been dead for 20 minutes.Fortunately, the objective in this action movie has enough armed-guards to keep all of the killers content.In Edo, the son of a former Shogun (Gorô Inagaki) terrorizes the countryside, raping and murdering at whim.Fearing the sadistic lord will rise to a higher position, the services of an elderly samurai, Shinzaemon (Koji Yakusho), are sought.In order to snuff out the savage noble, Shinzaemon assembles former samurais to assist him in the ambush.Unfortunately, the anticipated 70 guardsmen turn out to be 200 strong.Inspired by true events, 13 Assassins is a blood-soaked, myth-laden, revenge mission, heavily rooted in the bushido code of honour.Samurais are so respectful, in fact, that disemboweled warriors will actually mop up their own guts before dying.

		<shortDescription>13 Assissins is Miike's Magnum Opus...a crowd pleasing tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miike's remake of Kudo Eiichi's "Jyu-Shichinin No Shikaku" (13 Assassins) is a masterpiece of samurai fiction. While resemblances to Kurosawa Akira's landmark "Seven Samurai" as well as Zack Snyder's "300" may be unavoidable, Miike's newest film is his most mature work and accomplished work to date and shows that he is indeed capable of crafting films outside of the bizarre, horrific and avant-guarde films he is most know for such as "Audition" and "Ichi The Killer"."13 Assassins" is set in the final years of Japanese feudalistic society before the Meiji Restoration. Gone are the days of an idealistic nobility and Samurai virtue and in it's place is a decadent and opportunistic age where those born of class abuse their lineage and show unmerciful cruelty on the lower class. Such is the case with Lord Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira (portrayed by SMAP idol Inagaki Goro against type), a pompous and sadistic young nobleman who by virtue of his class ascends to his current position of power as second only to his brother the Shogun. Lord Naritsugu's brutality (he callously rapes one nobleman's wife and goes so far as to create a limbless living "husk" of another), causes one senior Government Official to commit ritualistic "Seppuku" in protest. Sir Doi (Hira Mikijiro) considers this the last straws and secretly plots Lord Naritsugu's assassination. He recruits a former Samurai Officer, the virtuous Shimada Shinzaemon (played by the wonderful character actor Yakusho Kôji)to lead the team against the evil Lord. Shinzaemon knows that he cannot go up against such a foe alone and thus recruits a small army of former Samurai and Ronin to assist him including his gambling nephew Shinrouko (Japanese movie heartthrob Yamada Takayuki), the majestic Ronin Hirayama (Ihara Tsuyoshi)and his young pupil Ogura (Kubota Masataka), Sahara (Furuta Arata) who demands money for his skills as a expert spearman and fellow Samurai officer and loyal friend Kuranaga (the great Matsutaka Hiroki)who also brings with him five loyalists to the cause. The twelve plan their attack on Lord Naritsugu by entrapping him in the small town Ochiai along the route from Edo to his home province. Yet the assassins have to deal with Shinzaemon's friend and rival Hanbei Kitou (Ichimura Masachika)an Ashikawa loyalist and Lord Naritsugu's loyal vassal who despite detesting his Lord's evil must obey him without question. Along the way they also meet the Koyata Kiga (Iseya Yusuke) a wandering bandit who made the unfortunate mistake of falling for his boss' wife. Together can they defeat Lord Naritsugu's 200 man army? At just over two hours,"13 Assassins" is an engrossing and entertaining film that is never boring. Miike wisely plays is simple and straight with the story and the film's brisk pacing is definitely much appreciated. Much of that probably is credited to screenwriter Tengan Daisuke who does a very good job adapting Ikegami Kaneo's original story.Miike's unique visual style is still very much a strong point with this film and he does very well with keeping the film interesting visually. As noted this is Miike's most conventional, mainstream film to date and Miike definitely delivers a great looking film without the excessive aspects of some of his earlier films (one scene however does hark back to his horror roots).Much has been mentioned about the elaborate and violent climax of the film. Some comparisons may be made to the finale of Kitamura Ry?hei's "Azumi" or even Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" but I felt it made very exciting cinema and definitely was a crowd-pleaser albeit a bloody one.The talented all-star cast was remarkable and featured a refreshing mix of both current hot talents as well as some very good character actors from the past (I guess this is where Miike and Quentin Tarantino excel at). Inagaki Goro surprised me the most with his villainous portrayal of Lord Naritsugu and he was very effective in his sadistic role. Yakusho Kôji and Matsutaka Hiroki have always been favorites of mine and they do not disappoint here as well bringing a sense of nobleness to their roles. Yamada Takayuki shows that he is definitely a star in the making as he delivers another great performance."13 Assassins" in an epic masterpiece and hopefully Miike Takeshi will catch Hollywood's eye more now. This film proves that Miike Takeshi is not just a fanboy film maker but a true artist who can make films for the general public not just only in Japan but the world as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a mixture of battlefield scenes plus a nonsense story. 13 men kills a group of 200 men and there is not a logical story to justify it!! Acting aside, which was not good at all, I could not find a good line in the story. I was expecting another ending for this movie. In my opinion the story is the weakest point in this movie. For example, in the middle of nowhere the group of warriors meet a bandit in their way. He happens to be much better in fight than other Samurais; I don't have any problem with this story, but the story must somehow support this that I can believe it. It was a poor job supporting this and this bandit stay alive at the end. The current rating in IMDb is unbelievable. It is not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible samurai film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lately I have become interested in samurai films, so I have been watching quite a lot of them - from the entertaining Lone Wolf series to the Kurosawa classics, with the late legend Toshiro Mifune. Those old movies are great but they lack in good resolution and better color. So I came across this Japanese film "13 Assassins" filmed in 2010. Recent stuff, sounded interesting. So I watched it - very good production, with a stellar cast including a member of the Japanese band SMAP who plays the bad guy. The problem starts with the plot. It's the old "small group of brave samurai against bad guy with army in larger number" just like Seven Samurai, The Last Samurai and 47 Ronin. Here, the 13 assassins are gathered to fight a sadistic lord. Despite the fact that the plot is more of the same, this is a post-Hollywood, post-video game samurai movie. It has all the action, sound effects and visuals of the blockbusters, including bombs and boars on fire (yes)... and gore, lots of gore. It has disturbing scenes, like the amputated woman and even a non-explicit homosexual intercourse. The biggest problem for me is that the guy who hired the 13 samurai to kill the lord Naritsugu actually had the opportunity to finish the job at the bridge. He had his fellows pointing their guns to him (but that would make the film end at the 1 hour mark.) Anyway, this is entertainment for the young audiences, craving some ketchup. Great production but lacking substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the tradition of Kurosawas "The Seven Samurai", this movie is for Samurai-movie lovers. The story is simple: bad prince must be killed and thirteen men get the task to do it. There is very little background about most of the men - it's just about planning, followed by one huge festival of limb slashing, rolling heads and awesome sword fighting choreography. The last forty minutes absolutely rock! The martial battle cries and the typical Samurai yadda yadda and pseudo- philosophy (loyalty of course), are somewhat forgettable - there are better films out there, like "Ame Agaru" ,"Rashomon", "Seven Samurai", "Yojimbo", "Ran", "Zatoichi". Nevertheless, I personally liked it, since I got plenty of sword swinging Samurai scenes. But one must be a fan of such flicks to like 13 Assassins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Takashi Miike shoots the film well. This is exemplified in the climatic battle where we quite often switch between the constantly on the move assassins, yet you never struggle to follow what is happening, and are allowed to properly see the samurai in action.This extends to the score as well, which shy's away from the thunderous noises we've come to expect of the modern action film and instead compliments the film, never drowning out the dialogue or action.The story itself is nothing original, with an obviously evil villain, and many of the characters lacking distinguishing features, blending into one another. Even with its generic nature though I can't deny that it was well told and entertaining.The action itself also shows us nothing we haven't really seen before, but like the story it's well done and doesn't bore. In fact it's rather impressive. No matter how skilled the assassins are though I do wonder if they could really survive as long as they do.Still, if your in the mood for some samurai action then there's really nothing not to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically polished but lacks true depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Assassins is not a bad film at all. However, it is not a great film. Essentially we are in the territory of Kurosawa, so comparison with that great master is in order. The references are abundantly clear, particularly to The 7 Samurai.The director is self-consciously quoting not only some of the plot elements of 7 Samurai, but also Kurosawa's classically-influenced style, which Miike updates technically for the video-game generation. We see the immaculately choreographed war councils in classically elegant rooms, but Kurosawa's grainy black and white photography is replaced by lush colour tones. This is indeed beautiful and the technical performance of most of the main actors is more than adequate to the high demands of the setting.Though 13 Assassins is impressive in parts, they do not make a satisfying whole. It lacks tonal structure and progression. It is messy and excessive at times. Much attention has been paid to detail, but not enough to the overall structure. More importantly, it lacks the underlying presence of the master's hand and eye which dignifies Kurosawa's films and makes them very much more than beautiful, carefully constructed stories. Clearly, one does not expect from Miike a straight reconstruction of Kurosawa's philosophy. However, with such abundance of quotation, I think one is entitled to expect more than this rather empty and often scrappy technical performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I was expecting something different going into this film. I was under the impression it was going to be sort of an art house piece and the violence would be extreme. And, I was disappointed on both accounts, but, overall, this is still a very good movie. I see the international version is a different running time, which may mean there is more gore--something I hoped for. If you want serious carnage, look elsewhere. While hundreds are killed in one on one combat, very little blood is actually shown, a few severed heads tossed in, and that's about it. I suggest if you want a bloody mess, you check out the Baby Cart series, or Shogun Assassin(if your attention span is short), Lady Snowblood, or Sword of Doom. Basically, in the plot, you have a ruthless lord who can fight well, but is also something of a little girl(as you'll see in the end), and he is quickly moving up the chain of command in the samurai world. After he abuses his power on countless occasions, several men get together and decide they have to cut him down. However, they can only muster 13 men total who are going to take on 70 of the lord's soldiers. Whoops, I mean over 200(a little surprise in store for our heroes). A lot of work went into the set designs, and it seemed very much like a fantasy film, even though there are no mythological monsters to be found. Although probably lost in translation, some of the dialogue is very cliché, but it's not overbearing. I look forward to reading up on the reviews for the extended cut. Hopefully, there will be a lot more bloody goodness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very average, at best, period action flick that manages to hit all of the clichés in the genre without making any of them particularly interesting. The ending battle, featuring a 13-on-200 confrontation, borders on parody, with all of the requisite slow, meaningful deaths for the heroes and the absurd dispatch of scores of anonymous villains. At least Xena would crack a few jokes and wink at the camera while involved in this sort of silliness as opposed to the endless declarative shouting that compromises a majority of the dialogue delivery in this film.More entertaining than the movie is the reading of the reviews on this site as the 'cinephiles' try to justify why this mediocre genre flick is an 'action masterpiece'. Not terrible, but you can find better in many of the Hollywood summer films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A summary of this film: a bunch of skilled swords man make huge efforts to behead this psychopath evil lord and eventually most of them are dead. And nothing more, really.Well I had a lot expectation about this film as I am a martial art person and a huge fan of Samurai movies. Although made in US, The Last Samurai really is my all time favourite. And I have to say I had been biased and never really thought Asia countries could produce great movies (even though I 'm Chinese) as I have been disappointed over and over by those over used cliché story and commercially intentional crap. But before watching this film I pulled my biased mind away and hoped to learn a hard lesson to get my mind opened up. Again, I was disappointed.Despite the excellent acting of some of the main characters (not for many supporting roles though!!) and amazing outfits design, this film still fell into the same circle that most Japanese films had done: overly exaggerating the intention of the story by making the background meaning too obvious plus over using hack and slash scenes. I know the story tries to tell me that people should have the courage to stand up against evil rulers, but the film does not convey this message subtly so that eventually this message becomes bluntly intentional, factitious, and of course, unconvincing. It made me, at least, feel like watching a bunch of MTV act which everyone in there seems a bit awkward doing things that are really unnatural and weird.I don't mind a lot of hack and slash scenes since I love action movies. But apparently this movie was not meant to become just a set of bloody visual entertainment, therefore it hasn't done a good job to convince me that it worth more than that. So, in my opinion, 6/10.</fullReview>

The concept of honour, especially of people acting their own roles has often been shown as strong in Japanese culture on film, however this one takes on a whole new level, valuing role-honour above even the torture and execution of innocent local families. Yes I could see it being a slick, dark and well made film that probably has good action scenes later, but I could not bring myself to continue watching a film that started so oddly.

		<fullReview>In 13 Assassins a sadistic and psychotic warlord in feudal Japan must be killed before he ascends to the rank of Shogun. Lord Naritsugu, played by Goro Inagki, is son of the former Shogun. As such Naritsugu travels around Japan with his entourage of samurai raping and murdering whomever he chooses. When the war scarred samurai Shinzaemon, played by Koji Yakusho is witness to the atrocities of Naritsugu, Shinzaemon decides to assassinate the warlord before he reaches the capital city. Gathering a band of loyal warriors, Shinzaemon leads his samurai to what is surely a suicide mission in order end Naritsugu's terror. The build up to the epic ambush in 13 Assassins is pretty confusing. A lot of it stems from the fact that there isn't enough character separation between all the main characters. They all blend with each other with similar dress and similar hairstyles. In this case yes, all Asians look alike. Another factor is that there's not enough close ups so that we can clearly get attached to faces. A lot of the conversations are shot with wide composition. This took me out of the human aspect of the film and I only really got attached to characters after the half way point when I could recognize them as "the leader" "the best fighter" and "the crazy forest man".The cinematography fluctuates from being fabulous to being dull. All the action looks amazing and the the out door shots look brilliant. However a lot of the inside shots that took place during discussions were dry. It might be that American audiences are just accustomed to looking at faces with blurry backgrounds rather than seeing the whole room.The end battle scene is exhilarating and totally worth the build up. 13 samurai vs 200 soldiers is a lot of fun to watch as the 13 hack and slash into the warlord's army, slowly and painstakingly whittling it down. The acting is totally over the top and doesn't really work outside the context of the action. When they're talking about how evil Lord Naritsugu is every character has their own diatribe, which gets boring really fast. However it's not so bad coming from a badass samurai covered in blood after he's just cut down five men. Who this film is not for:-People who hate watching violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Until Ridiculous Final Overlong Battle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me a good movie until a disappointing ending, "Jusan nin no shikaku" really loses itself in what could've been a great finale stretching out in both time and belief leaving me shaking my head. (spoilers) The "finale" fighting lasted over 25 min featuring supposedly 13 swordsmen defeating a small garrison of 200 in the usual 10 baddies encircling one hero and engaging one-at-a-time. When I was 10 years old this might've passed as fun to watch, but realism begins to kick in and you start asking wth? For filmmakers, if you're going to make a mythic type battle make some better ground rules for your movie, like as some of the Chinese cinema at least have guys flying around so you can better ensure your disbelief at the start. There's certainly some great sword and in general fighting choreography....anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessarily fawned over Asian Expendables.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might prove unpopular with the 'cinema aficionado' set, but if 13 Assassins was made in America with an English speaking cast it would be merely another film. In this case though it is made by renowned gonzo Japanese director Takashi Miike, 13 Assassins boasts a surprisingly straightforward plot and tones down his usual theatrical gore in favour of equally cringe inducing offscreen violence, before a prolonged battle sequence ends the film.Is it bad? No, but it isn't as awe-inspiring as I've read. In fact the prolonged battle that ends the film becomes repetitious, confusing and clichéd, and is probably as long as the Battle of Helm's Deep without actually earning the right to be so indulgent.It is peace time in Japan, troubling times indeed for out of work samurai and ronin ? swords for hire ? but I guess not a bad time for those that don't like to be cleft in twain by sharp steel blades or skewered by errant arrows. Swings and roundabouts.This tenuous peace is threatened by a rogue, who despite his heinous activities and generally reprehensible nature is deemed untouchable due to being related to the shogun, who far from reprimanding him for his constant mistreatment of his minions actually plans to promote him, giving him more power and more scope to misuse that power.But even the most connected of bad guys can only continue his naughty ways for so long, and as we are shown more than once in the early goings Naritsugu is an especially callous and cruel ruler, and his casual slaughter of those he should be protecting is becoming perilously close to inciting revolt.A ritual suicide in protest only draws more unwelcome attention to the area and Naritsugu's exploits. This leads another leader Sir Doi to quietly seek a solution to this problem. As so often in these situations the solution is to have Naritsugu killed. And the samurai are back in the game? The leader of the group is Shinzaemon Shimada, a noble and principled samurai who follows a code that is constantly being restated and relayed to the new members of the group, some of whom have become a little rusty with all this accursed unseasonal peacetime.The dozen death dealers are a mix of the old and young, experienced and raw, principled code-followers and mercenaries. Honour, duty and glory and death by the sword. Such is the way of the samurai.The problem for Shimada is that Naritsugu has under his employ a samurai bodyguard of his own. He is Hanbei, a man that might not approve of the way his master runs the show, but one who remains loyal and dutiful at all times because that is what being a samurai demands. Hanbei and Shimada have a long history that stretched back to their youths, so when Hanbei hears that it will be Shimada that is in command of the expected ambush he realises that they are faced with a worthy adversary. Naritsugu on the other hand is disdainful of the threat and sees an imminent attack as a welcome distraction and another chance to inflict pain upon others.So now everyone knows it's on. It becomes merely a case of when, where and how.The where is Ochiai, and the titular (now) 13 assassins arrive early and commence preparations, giving us ample time to learn about the motivations and thought processes of the individual samurai. Thought processes that are altered a little when they learn that it is not 70 men that they will be facing, but over 200.The battle itself is well over 40 minutes long and features some sequences that are to be frank reminiscent of the classic 80s TV series Monkey, with many assailants alternately attacking and being attacked by one or two samurai, and running from and chasing same. Obviously being a motion picture and not a tacky TV show there is quite a deal more violence, but with so much going on it is more the hack and slash type.In true few men against many fashion no assassins are killed in the early stages of the battle, despite that being the period where they are most heavily outnumbered, and Naritsugu's henchmen die quickly and quietly. Once the battle progresses far enough that it is time for some good guys to die in order to increase the dramatic tension they obey the rules too, with their deaths being long and drawn out and just long enough to spit out some dramatic last words. By the conclusion of the film when the 200+ becomes single digits all involved have perhaps earned a noble death, and thankfully the film ends where it should. I thought the early stages of 13 Assassins more effective than the drawn out finale, Naritsugu was truly an evil man deserving of a brutal fate, and his many misdeeds were more effective as they were often offscreen ? even if the blood was usually most definitely on screen.Final Rating ? 5.5 / 10. I found much to admire about 13 Assassins, but repeat my assertion that if an American equivalent was made it would be consider merely another film, and the seemingly endless battle that ends to film would be decried as unnecessarily violent and indulgent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Were my expectations too high? Perhaps. Countless of reviewers, whose opinions I value, extolled this movie. I must be missing something. To be fair, the opening 2 minutes sucked me in. Beautifully done.That being said, this thing quickly turns into a snooze fest. The only way I could get through the next 73 minutes of boredom is by the promise of 40 minutes of movie-ending awesomeness. Endless chit-chit. Suspense? None. Humor? Not even a forced chuckle. Did I at least have a Koyuki (Taka in "The Last Samurai") to keep me breathing? Hellz no. Just dudes and their mindless banter about the strategy to get the bad guy. Is that stratagem even interesting? Not at all. Just about zero character development.Why 3 stars? There were 3 worthy characters developed in the first 75:1) Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira - was sweetly painted as a mean S.O.B. who deserves to be dealt with very harshly. Just about the only thing that kept me alive: will the bastard go down? If so, how?! 2) Hirayama - this dude develops to potentially be a butt-kicking machine. Perhaps Naritsugu's? That would be sweet.3) Hanbei Kitou, a notable adversary who puts his duty to defend his Lord, whom he does not respect, above everything else.Here comes the fight scene!! Rescue me, oh Lord. Uh, wrong again. The whole things is stupid from beginning to end. These Assassins have the engineering genius to booby trap a town like you have rarely seen. Yet, they can't focus on the one guy they are trying to kill. Shall we continue to rain down arrows on these pathetic fools? No, "enough of these tricks", let's get down to mindless slashing. 200 chickens with their heads cutoff trying to get 13 samurais. Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash.There may be 45 seconds worth of good fighting. But at least, Lord Naritsugu is going to display some major skills at the end, right? Wrong again. The thing is about as anti-climactic as things can be. To add insult to injury, the last few minutes of the movie consist of a resurrection of one of the characters with nary a scratch on his previously-obliterated body. He is seems to be bad combination of Jackie Chang's Wong Fei-Hung (Drunken Master) and Kikuchiyo (Seven Samurai). What was that? It is the director Miike just mocking me. That's what.The worse part is that this was my father's day choice of movie. I used to hold the edge for my wife making me sit through three hours of the Horse Whisperer 12 years ago. I had it for 12 years! Now that I made her sit through 140 minutes worth of this, I am never going to here the end of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't avoid feeling that the first 90 minutes were extremely slow. Long dialogs where only a few words get said, long shots of face expressions in fixed angles, and overall, a non-complex story that seemed like never taking off. In other words, I felt like this movie was a broken record for 90 minutes and then, the last 40, that finally made justice. To put it in perspective, the last 40' felt like the Samurai version of "Saving Private Ryan's" last battle. And it was good, but nothing I've never seen before. To me it was just OK, but I also have to recognize that I already had this kind of disappointment with oriental movies. I guess it goes with the person. I felt this movie was a long stretched bubble gum with the flavor at the end of it. If you only want the sweet part, then start from the other extreme and play it backwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mean to insult the movie its actually a good adaptation of 7 samurai and with a 7.9 i was expecting it to be better than 7 mercenaries. I have to say i really enjoyed the plot, probably better than 7 merc/sams. The mistakes lie within the spreading of the film, i'd say 9 of the 13 die within a period of 10 minutes and it completely destroys the pace. It was a mistake to make it 13 assassins, mainly because even Kurosawa didn't give perfect characters to his samurai, and this director is definitely no Kurosawa so fitting in 13 characters... is just plain dumb. The movie would have benefited if there were a couple of fight scenes instead of a big one as it felt dragged and the constant rescuing felt unrealistic(like where did he show up from a roof? was he not fighting the entire time and just waiting to rescue?). The acting started well but went downhill and i especially found that the final confrontation did not deliver.All in all its not a bad movie but i feel like outshining 7 mercenaries was within reach but it was not done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not much entertaining value when the enemy is so under-skill that they could not injure any of the protagonists after twenty minutes of battle. For example, no soldier could fire their muskets while the arrows were raining down on them is too far fetched. Extreme one-sided ability as compared to the enemy is absurd. Cinematography is reasonable.I expected stealthy ninja actions, but I made the wrong guess based on "assasin" keyword in the movie tile.Quite surprised this movie got an above average rating. The Last Samauri movie is an example of a much better movie than the 13 Assassins.</fullReview>

A soft sound of static emitted from the screen. It was the only sound in the otherwise silent room. Kristl pressed a button on her wrist watch and glanced at the display."Fifteen minutes.""That long?" Henry gasped.Kristl nodded."Maybe we can skip to the fight, you know the one that is claimed to be the best since.. Kill Bill?", Henry said."I somehow got the feeling that it will be as brutal, sadistic, gruesome and otherwise revolting as the part of the movie that we have seen up till now. In fact; I would not want to chance it, even if there was a small chance that it will turn out to be otherwise.""Uhm?""You think it will?" Kristl stared at him."I lost you there... Yet, you know, Kill Bill. It was a great fight scene. I assume that they mean the fight between the bride and the 99.""Well the suggestion is there. Assumption and all that.""It makes me so curious. Just to see if it is really that great.""The filmmakers would be happy then. They got you hooked by just alluding to Kill Bill. You immediately draw comparisons. It creates expectations without actually promising much and thus you want to watch the movie.Smart advertising."Henry nodded."But just think of this.

Will become to resemble Kill Bill?""Not very likely...""So why should I want to suffer all that just in the forlorn hope that it might turn out to be different?""Eh.. because maybe it will?""Okay.. I can not stop you from trying, but I rather watch something that I like to watch and I think might be watchable till the end. Let's pop in another movie?"

What do you mean?""There are some twisted people out there.""Yeah.""I hope they remain out there and out of my mind. I find those twisted images and thoughts disturbing.""Right.""One more reason not to watch this movie.""If you think so. I wish it had a sassy fighter girl..I would have watched it..

		<shortDescription>Bigger budgets don't make better movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Miike, the director of 13 Assassins, once said in an interview that he sometimes watches big budget movies thinking "With that budget, why didn't they make more crazy things?". He also said that he likes working on low budget movies because they allow for more creative freedom. It turns out that 13 Assassins fulfills his concerns. Compared with many of his lower budget movies, it is a very conventional if not mediocre film. The only thing miikesque about 13 Assassins is the depiction of the sadistic Lord Matsudaira's cruelties, which isn't a redeeming factor.As for the story, said Lord cannot be stopped by political means, hence a group of Samurai is tasked with his assassination. Which isn't an easy job since he is protected by an army that outnumbers the assassins by far. So the plot deals with a situation which became classic since Kurosawa's 7 Samurai, but contrary to embarrassing claims of some commentators, 13 Assassins is not "a copy of 7 Samurai" but in fact a remake of a movie named - guess how - "13 Assassins", from 1963.The fact that the movie is a remake begs the question why it was even made. It is not original, there are no twists, let alone is there any of the goofiness that characterizes much of Miike's work. Perhaps Miike wanted to show that he can do big battle scenes. Well yes, he obviously can. But while the battle scenes are the most outstanding feature of 13 Assassins, the fighting left me strangely unaffected. The key question was how the small group will defeat the army, but the way the battle is unrolled isn't clever or elegant, it relies too much on technically improbable traps and incompetent opponents. Now there's a point where a lower budget could have helped: With a lower budget, the movie might have concentrated less on sets and spectacle and more on how the Samurai outsmart the army.I don't understand why 13 Assassins gets so many enthusiastic reviews. But I hope it grossed a lot of money that gets invested into more original movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad adaptation of Seven Samurai</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Miike. I watched Audition and found it OK, Izo horrible and I don't know if I'll ever watch Ichi The Killer. All the hype around Miike doesn't attract me that much I guess.Anyway, I thought the trailer of 13 assassins was nice and so I decided to watch the film.To say that 13 assassins has resemblances with Seven Samurai is a blasphemy. To say that 13 assassins take inspiration from Seven Samurai is a blasphemy. To say that 13 assassins is less than a tribute/remake/rip off of Seven Samurai is a blasphemy. There are too many coincidences for 13 assassins to be other than a variation of Kurosawa's imitated classic. In fact, the only differences are the number of samurais (13 versus 7), the "bad guy" (Lord versus bandits) and the name of the town where the big fight takes place. Of course, the name of the characters are also different, as well as other little details. However, a good set of other little details are basically the same too. Take, for instance, the tengu in Miike's variation. It's simply another Kikuchiyo. Also, the fascination the young samurai in 13 assassins for his "master", compared to the fascination of the young Okamoto for the skilled Kyuzo in Seven Samurai.All that said, this is not a bad film. It's well executed, entertaining, fun to watch. Don't expect so much blood or violence as others may promise though. Even being a blatant copy of Seven Samurai and suffering from that lack of originality, 13 assassins certainly has its own merits and you won't feel like you wasted your time by watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading so much about this "wonderful" gem of a movie I decided it was time to see it.The movie starts off good with the harakiri scene, but after that things start sliding downhill. The script is lame and boring without any deeper character development.As for the "finale" (if you can call 40 minutes of a movie a finale) it was astonishingly boring and ridiculous at best. The swordplay was garbage and had no grace to it at all (except the very last fight). Pure hack and slash.This movie felt like watching a Ferrari in a slow motion wreck going up in a ball of fire just to have Bozo the clown pop up and smack a cake in my face. I mean...really? The outlaw survived having his neck completely pierced by a sword and a slash across the gut for good measure? And then just pop up and jump around like it was just a scratch? Old school samurai movies are head and shoulders above this crappola. At least they had grace and story with character development.Very sad to see Japanese film industry turn into a Hollywoodburlesque freakshow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Assassins is set in the 1830s in Feudal Japan. Madman Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira (Gorô Inagaki) is on a killing spree, murdering people at will, raping a woman and using children as a pincushion. He is nearly untouchable as he is the son of a Shogun. It is feared that if this lunatic reaches a new clan he will be untouchable. A former samurai warrior in Shinzaemon (Kôji Yakusho) is brought in to take out Naritsugu before he can reach his destination. He brings in eleven other warriors to help him and they secretly plot the ambush. One of the men is Shinzaemon's nephew (Takayuki Yamada) and he has to explain to him that this is a gamble worth fighting for. On their way to a village they find their thirteenth warrior in a colourful hunter named Kiga (Y&#x16b;suke Iseya). He's more of a misfit that a true samurai. The group takes shelter in a village, working to block off the path of their target. But just as the ambush is about to begin they realise that they are not being faced with seventy men, as originally expected, but over two hundred soldiers. All of the bloodletting in 13 Assassins is skin-deep. That's not to say the film isn't violent. The opening of the film is sickening as we see a man commit Harakiri by plunging a blade into his stomach. There are grotesque images in this film that are difficult to watch too. A starving woman, who has had her limbs lopped off and her tongue cut out, is revealed to Shinzaemon and the audience. What does this all mean though? You can read the film as a Dirty Dozen-like imitation with moments of courage against insurmountable odds. But there's little beyond that mere incision. It is difficult to find inspiration in these characters because they are so broadly drawn. The film would have been better with fewer assassins, who were more complete characters, instead of these vague constructs like the comic relief guy or the wise old samurai. And with little knowledge of this foreign cast, I found it very difficult to tell the more obscure members of the group apart because they are so similar in type. They can do little to distinguish themselves emotionally with stilted dialogue either. When one of the men is leaving his partner at home he tells her: "If I'm late...I'm at the festival of death". Maybe it reads better in a native tongue. That's a big 'maybe'. There are bigger problems relating to the film's politics than just the actors though. The film seems convinced by individual sacrifice and the glory of gambling your life in moments of national crisis. Contextually that might seem honourable and moving for some. But there's a refusal to critique or deconstruct the questions of sacrifice in a meaningful way. It makes the film seem primitive, without making a point of it. And it's equally uncomfortable to watch when you consider how much real mindless bloodshed we're exposed to today. One of the film's major selling points is that the final battle rages on for forty minutes. Twenty minutes is too long for me and anything over that is just excessive. The first half plays like a cartoon and is at odds with the grittiness of the violence shown earlier. The group cut down hordes of men without being touched. Where is the tension? And there are silly portions of the battle that diminish the realism. Where did the giant bamboo gates they use to block the baddies suddenly come from? And who let the CGI cattle on fire? In the last twenty minutes it washes over you so much that what happens seems of little relevance. The film is well crafted in respects to costume and set design. But it lacks the visual inventiveness and symbolism of similar oriental epics like Hero (2002) with its selective use of colour. A lot of scenes here are overly dark and the film's tones during the day are endlessly grey and washed- out. Perhaps this film will be more attuned to those acquainted with Japanese history than a dopey Westerner. But I found the continuously mindless slaughter unspectacular and extremely difficult to sit through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was truly a masterpiece, I haven't seen a movie this good in decades. If you enjoy a good old fashioned samurai movie with all the works of honor and peril this is the movie for you, there's lots of action and a genuine storyline.In the beginning of the 18th century there was a shogun who had a sadistic brother, if the shogun had died his brother would have taken rule over the people and the methods in which his brother lived his life showed that this would lead to a terrible dark period. While in the midst of being in his own temple he raped and murdered a samurai and his wife. The father of this samurai watched all of this and in his disgrace vowed to get revenge so he asked a samurai to kill this man, but since the number of guards around this man was vast the samurai needed support so in his wisdom he had retained men, and this is a story of what happened afterward.There are no 3d effects in this movie its fantastic camera works gives it a real 18 century china feel, 10/10 for anyone who enjoys classic Chinese movies this is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>13 Assassins or 13A is a "historically inspired" film about a small group of samurai trying to assassinate an evil nobleman. In late feudal Japan the brother of the Shogun, a wicked, extremely cliché' evil dude commits all sort of power-mad atrocities since well, he's the brother of the Shogun, so there; a bunch of other Japanese dudes are really cross at this and want him dead, but you know, etiquette and such means a few guys will have to commit harakiri first, then a dozen or so samurai are going to take him out. Plans are made, then the group of samurai plus a non-samurai (yes, i know it sounds like 7 Samurai, but it's not) fortify themselves in a village (yep.. but still, it's not 7 Samurai) where they take out 200+ other samurai in a +CGI showdown of quite comic proportions, mostly through the use of (the same tactics in 7 Samurai) and through late-manga swordplay. Cue every Akira Kurosawa film ever made, throw in a good dose of Kitano, rip off every character Toshiro Mifune has ever impersonated, and that's 13A for you.Now, this film does have a few redeeming qualities, it's well shot, well directed and the acting isn't bad at all, at least until the ridiculous finale (and also, excluding all the Evil Prince Dude sections which are just pitiful, never mind realistic); i guess if you were really starved of samurai action then 13A could do it for you .. but the downs are hundredfold to the ups. 13 Assassins could be as high as a 8, but for the horrid ending i must take at least a point off; for ripping off T.M.'another point, for pretending Kurosawa doesn't exist another, and for generally not being *that* interesting after all yet another point.Judge for yourself, but this bland imitation of Shichinin no Samurai to me is worth no more than Final vote: 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in all but name a remake of 'The Seven Samurai' and 'The Magnicent Seven.' It is not as good as either of the aforementioned but is a stunning achievement, albeit if you are over-familiar with either it will seem too similar. Plot - Nasty, horrible, vicious young man about to ascend to political power in 1840s Japan (and we get his nature in graphic detail - be warned!) which could bring years of peace to a shattering end. Cue courtiers trying to find a way of disposing of him without anyone losing face. The plan is for an honourable samurai - now virtually unemployed - to gather a group of his ilk to assassinate the baddie. Watching this film you can see where George Lucas got his influences from! So cue the usual characters - the faithful old second-in-command, the ultra professional and his young apprentice, the poor spearman looking for action, and the troubled young samurai who drinks and gambles because his class have lost their raison d'etre. The plot is hatched to trap the villain and his army (complete with old former samurai rival) at a small village and kill the lot ( it turns out to be 200!). A peasant comic relief joins to make the 13! The last 45 minutes is a gory bloodfest (but not overdone) as the samurai battle for victory. Yes, honour, the meaning of life, duty and loyalty are all present themes - and how refreshing it is after various yawnfests of comic hero films which Hollywood keeps churning out! the final showdown is taut and meaningful, with hints of modern day Japan's problems and its enduring guilt of blindly following warmongerers. A good film but to be enjoyed more if you are not as old as I am!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A week copy of 7 Samurai</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally I enjoyed watching. Action was OK. A little bit confusing with too many Japanese names, but If you concentrate you may catch it. Some might say this movie is inspired from 7 Samurai, but I would say it is almost a copy. More or less only difference is 13 instead of 7. And last one a crazy person. I think it could be a little more creative.The end was very week. I really did not understand why the guys just walked each other defenceless and killed each other. Crying of the bad guy was a week way of expression. I also did not like the part about the guy with big dick. Was it really necessary to have that kind scene in this type of movie. It was more like a scene from a absurd comedy movie.Anyway if you are fun of Action / War / Hero type movies, and you have watched all the best ones, this might be an alternative. Not a good movie but not boring also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BAD, HORRIBLE AND STILL BAD. It is hard to imagine a worse movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying this is my first review ever. After wasting 2hours of my life the only way I knew to bring good out of the bad movie I had just watched warn everyone else away from it. It is a shame IMDb does not allow negative votes because I feel hard done offering 1/10. This movie honestly deserves -5/10 and had it been just 15 minutes longer it could have made it all the way to -10! Do not watch unless you really want to punish yourself. The story execution is so bad that it makes one think this movie was done behind the director's back or maybe to ruin his/her name. The action scenes are monotonous frantic disorganized and loud forgettable frames of screaming men running at each other with drawn swords. Nothing good at all. Nothing slightly impressive. And definitely not worth anyone's time. It hurt that I believed the IMDb reviews in praise of this movie; do not make the same mistake. If I were employed as a movie reviewer for a magazine, I would demand a salary raise if my job made me watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slow start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe i'm too used to watch Hollywood movies, but from my perspective The first hour can be removed. I know this is added because of the remake of 63, but still it's a very very slow start. The second part makes up for it, but the end result is still a bit disappointing.*SPOILER* The introduction of all the assassins could be done in a much spectacular way, in this movie i really do not care what happens to them. Maybe if some more battles of every assassin was pursued in the first hour it was more enjoyable. *END SPOILER*In some shots i even thought "did i press the pause button"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So close and yet so far......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at the Toronto Film Festival. This movie was so close to being a perfect 10 if it wasn't for the extended gut spilling slasher in the end. The key word here being extended, because it went to the extent of being brought down to the level of commercialism to appease the masses, very much like at the Colliseum. The first half however is RIVETING. The acting superb, the production values impeccable, and the script very very taut (even though I saw it with subtitles). The movie brings out the best of a dying samurai era, with the key conflict for some to decide between duty and right. The beauty of that is intensified with the more macro conflict of the relevance of the samurai altogether, in a Japan on the brink of the Meiji era (modernization). Beautiful cinematography captures the essence of mid 19th century Japanese society, most remarkable for the large number of Ronins (masterless samurai) roaming around, which was an issue at the time. The latter part of the movie, unfortunately leads off tangentially, almost as if directed by somebody else. Nevertheless, it could be watched for the first part alone, at least once.The Roving Eye</fullReview>
