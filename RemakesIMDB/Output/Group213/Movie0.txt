		<shortDescription>Maybe not the most original movie, but a very good one in the genre of the heist / action flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago I saw this remake of the sixties classic with the Mini Coopers for the first time and I remember liking it a lot. Now, about two years later it was shown on television and I just wanted to know whether I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes.The movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. They escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem they didn't take into account: Someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one survive and they are out for revenge. One year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...The story on itself is of course not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. This is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. The action is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are real eye-candy, the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Even the acting is very good, something which you'll not often see in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, fun, caper flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. It's not heavy with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it's not violent or profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly around the crowded streets of L.A. and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek-turned-crook (played gleefully by Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this film.Special kudos to the background music. They truly set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed. Apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music, I found it to be the classiest part of the film.8 out of 10. Not awe-inspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office.Barky</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film despite a few fallbacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last few months, I have seen a lot of reviews for The Italian Job, many of them negative. The gist of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that, for all its modernistic bravado and high-budget technology, the film doesn't have much substance where it counts. Look, people, it's just a fun movie. This is the type of picture where you're supposed to sit back, relax, and just enjoy the steady-moving pace of the film. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking (lucky for some of us). Granted, "Ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot may have some holes (there's a huge one about 3/4 of the way through), the action may not be as gratifyingly gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be, and some of the dialogue may seem pointless and cheesy, but again, who really cares? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What more do you want? I think it's time to drop the fake Roger Ebert meets Gene Shalit act and enjoy yourself for once! Oh, and another thing, whatever you do, don't compare it to the original because, to reiterate what F. Gary Gray has told the press a million times, THIS IS NOT A REMAKE!! My advice- if you're interested in nit-picking your way through a good-humored, fun flick, don't even bother seeing The Italian Job. But, if you don't have a severe inferiority complex and/or want to see Ed Norton get jacked by a bunch of Ukranians, go ahead. The Bottom Line, my fellow moviegoers, is: Lighten Up and Have Fun, Dammit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place. It is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters. It is always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky Mark. That image is burned in my mind forever. As an actor though he is pretty good. This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns. I will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, amusing caper film; Gray's best movie featuring Davis' best soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My reaction to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude I was feeling at the time was enormous. In consequence, my enjoyment of "Italian Job" was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth. Still, I picked it up used on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I have never seen the original (though I have heard it is an absolute classic), but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes. What initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most supple, textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around. IJ opens with a sly, witty, pulsing arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brush work and quiet moments - it won me over completely from the opening seconds. And the whole movie is like this - I haven't heard this kind of ringing, chiming, pulsing soundtrack music since Stewart Copeland left the Police and started doing soundtracks for movies like "Rumble Fish". There are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here, along with some pop song remakes that range from "all right" to "inspired". For people to whom the soundtrack is important, this movie is a delight. On to the movie: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he's okay here as the leading man, and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He's the weakest "major" actor in the film, but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in a bit part. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid, fat-free performances. Norton seems to mostly be phoning it in (rumor has it that he didn't really want to be in the film), but he's still a natural even at 1/2 power. My one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character "Wrench", who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be shoehorned into the movie, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the "late walk on" nature of the character). If I were a cynical sort,I would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a supernumerary role? Nah, never happen...Production values, camera work, stunts, plot...everything cooks along quite nicely and Gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly (with the exception of the "Wrench" character, see above). The dialog has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he's just lost the element of surprise. Wahlberg proceeds to cold cock Norton with a right cross, and then asks him, "Were you surprised??" Hmmm, maybe you had to be there...) Of course the movie requires a certain level of "suspension of disbelief" to work, but if you just relax and go along with it (and don't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater, or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic via a laptop, etc), you'll have a fun ride. "The Italian Job": it's lightweight summer fluff, but it's very good for what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything else. It isn't good enough for an "8" but I'd give it a "7.5".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>non-stop action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie very much. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a safe-cracker, a computer genius, a wheel-man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun. This film is entertaining although it has no central idea. It is a non-stop movie with lots of actions. All the stunt work is gorgeous. From the speedboat chase in Venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in Los Angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter. The best boast chase I have ever seen. I like the mini coopers. The expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the motor-bikes is amazing. They chased underground. I can say there was not a moment I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) really did a good job. I like the actors in this film. I have seen a lot of heist movie but The Italian Job&amp; is one of my favourites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I do love this kind of movie.</fullReview>

I thought the cast was just great and so were the special effects, with the safe and truck just dropping out of sight. If you like fast paced action movies, this is the one to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining Heist Movie &amp; A Big Plug For MINIs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder how many MINI Cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie? It couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car, which is featured in this film, along with an attractive cast.This is a very, very entertaining heist-and-chase film. It features a "cool" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham.The best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in Venice, Italy. The film doesn't overdo the violence, has a pretty intelligent script (with a few short exceptions). features interesting characters and is nicely firmed. The cat-and-mouse game between Norton and Theron's characters is suspenseful and fun to watch.Once again, however, we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as "the good guys." How many times has this happened since the days of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? It's twisted Hollywood, for you. In here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang, so he's the worst of the bunch and the film's villain. Also Theron's character is in the typically overblown-feminist mode of Hollywood in which women can do all things (including driving a car) better than a man. A third minor irritation is Seth Green's smug, smart-ass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because it's hip and cool. Despite these hindrances, it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex....and, yes, those little cars are cool. Everyone I've talked to who has seen this film, enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Bridger's gang of thieves are double crossed and left for dead after a daring gold raid in Venice. The surviving members regroup and convene in L.A. to enact revenge and recapture their gold.......the job is on!This could have been a complete disaster, I'm British and the wave of revulsion that boomed in my homeland upon hearing of this remake was explosive; "how dare they remake a British institution" was the cry. Things were not helped in the run up to the film's release by it's main star {and drawing card} Edward Norton, proclaiming that the film was a contractual obligation and that fans of his work would be better advised to give The Italian Job a miss!Had to be a stinker then surely? Actually no it isn't. Director F. Gary Gray hasn't remade the Italian Job of 1969, in fact he hasn't even re-imaged it, the minis are in there, the gold is in there, but all the stand out moments so beloved by many in the 69 film of the same name are not to be seen at all. So what we get is a very cool heist-come revenge movie-that's maybe a tad too glossy at times, but it's got a pretty sharp script, tight action sequences and a group of actors working very well as a team. Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green and the delectably delicious Charlize Theron all come out smelling of roses, whilst Edward Norton really had no cause for concern because his portrayal as Steve is a smarmy delight.I have jokingly titled this film Ocean's 5, but that is in no way detrimental to The Italian Job, it lacks the jazzy coolness of Soderbergh's Ocean's 11, but its a fun and enjoyable picture all in its own right, its rating of just under 7 here on IMDb is actually spot on. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Sauce, just Plain Boiled Pasta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a woeful Hollywood remake of a classic British film. Everything that made the original "Italian Job" entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie "scripted" by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly "directed" by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (the screenwriter of the original film) allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear. Martin has worked on some of the finest film and TV projects of the last 40-odd years. Even being vaguely associated with this stinker is NOT A GOOD THING.The humour is forced, the drama is laboured, all the characters are cookie-cutter likable crims (with the exception of Charlize Theron's implausible, beautiful safe cracker/rally driver)and the plot only matches the original on the following points:(1) Three Minis (the modern BMW-made versions, but Minis nonetheless)(2) Use of the names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the main characters(3) Disrupting a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it.(4) Er, that's it.Otherwise, what you get is a bland and implausible American by-the-numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate. Believe me, it feels like an awful long time before they do. The cast do their best with what they're given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd-polishing exercise after reading the script. None of the original film's quirky nature and distinctly British flavour has survived being fed into the Hollywood hamburger machine. Do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound. It's a wonder that Noel Coward hasn't done an Aunt Nelly, jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats.Italian Job? More like Italian Jobbie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sickening travesty of a classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, I was against this movie from the outset but I tried my hardest to be impartial, I really did, but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated, witty, entertaining, quirky British classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset.People in my house were watching this so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films (I have studied them at Uni after all).As expected for an American film of this sort, the movie began with a chase which wasn't bad. Indeed, many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark.Yet the characterisation was abysmal, the set-pieces could very easily have been spliced from any American schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character.Seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery, the US version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of Donald Sutherland's character. This allows our US cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic, dewy-eyed vengeance-seeking against the 'evil-doers' which it milks to predictable excesses. This is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring Charlize Theron (oh pretty! oh so pretty! Look at her pretty, wounded Bambi eyes, everyone!) which were thoroughly nauseating. Her entrance scene, particularly, was like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider which were both a) more entertaining and b) had better beginnings because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with British cinema which was already chock-full of spark, people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration. But I digress, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham-fisted manoeuvre I've seen in some time and exposes cynical Hollywood blockbuster-lust for what it is.If you like any of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the above comments, DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS FILM! If I had the opportunity of watching 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after seeing Ed Norton in this, I would have declined. Likewise Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I suppose 'The Transporter' is okay if you like that sort of thing).Sadly, all the set-pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking, 'Wow! He's smart!', 'Coo! He's cool!', 'Hey! What a tough guy!'. Then there's the 'funny PC guy' who has 'comic relief' splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance. To be honest, if you've seen one or two films like it, you might easily confuse the two as clones from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable. Not that Jerry is irredeemably awful, by the way, but he just uses the clichés to excess as everyone knows (or should).This is where I have to come clean. I didn't manage to make it to the end, so I couldn't even say whether the brilliant ending in the Michael Caine version made it but, I'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare films that, if I'd seen it at a cinema, I would have walked out and staged a small protest outside. It's not just that it is another identical by-the-numbers Ocean's 14 or something (Ocean's Eleven was fine but don't bother with the rest!) with all the glitz, glamour, fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but I couldn't recognise anything from the original at all.So, if you are expecting 'THE Italian JOB' and not 'OCEAN'S 14' albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters, some disingenuous elements and cardboard cut-out script-writing then DO NOT WATCH! I don't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchet-job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic. Seriously, show some pride! I felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when I first heard that the film would be made. Avoid at all costs!P.S. Some of the action sequences aren't bad at all so add an extra '1' to the mark if you like this sort of thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining film with good performance director F. Gary Gray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thrilling adventure, very entertaining for the most part, especially at the beginning of a spectacular and insane pursuit, and explosion impossible maneuvers that do not match the credibility of the rest of the film.The plot is fairly simple, a revenge story about a friend who betrayed them in an old hit. Although the film is no comedy, with enough touches of humor are appreciated and that streamline the viewing.John Powell's music is perfect, as always in this type of film mounting vibrant.Charlize Theron's performance is a success, and gives a level not very splendid cast .... Another great attraction of the film are mini cars that appear in some scenes, which are most curious and striking, the action scenes are original. : The beginning of the script in Venice makes it interesting from the start, and the rest of the action, although not as intense, if it is very effective.It's a good commercial cinema films of typical theft is very well done and get to entertain the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caper by numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Italian Job" is a caper movie done by the numbers. Riding on the back of every caper cliche, it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the month.The biggest problem is that "The Italian Job" possesses no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and done better then. The acting is fine the cinematography is completely acceptable, but this film breaks absolutely no new ground.Let's tick off the cliches: - "old-school" criminal father figure and his protege - another gang member jealous of protege - a double-cross - only bad guys use guns while good-guy criminals don't have to - good criminals always outwit the bad guysAnd that's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the heist and car chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. This is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so I already knew what to look for.For me, a caper film works only if it has an element of realism - that maybe, just maybe, it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or "just because" moments. Parts of "The Italian Job" just throws that out the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving (especially going down the stairs) and not one single police car responding to street explosions, recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. Must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response.The acting is passable, with the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) being at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is just too smarmy as the "nice guy" hero while Charlize Theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and shows up Wahlberg's deficiencies every moment they are together.Overall this is a pretty uninteresting film. Given the IMDb ratings, it's the girls that really love this film, which I can understand to some extent, but there are such better caper films out there - even the vapidness of the recent "Ocean's Eleven" outshines the non-event that is "The Italian Job".***SPOILER***At the conclusion, take a moment to think about what is going to happen to Norton's character. Are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise, especially since it would appear to be long and painful? He didn't deserve that, simpering creep that he was.***END SPOILER***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cool movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first started hearing about this movie I was totally against it. Although I've never seen the original, I knew of it's status and was afraid that the remake would be bad. I went to see it last night though and discovered that I'd fallen into the trap that a lot of movie critics do. I was negative about the movie without having seen it. When I went, I was completely surprised. It's a really fun movie with good acting all the way around. There's some pretty good jokes in there too. I always wondered where the name Napster came from. If I had one complaint to make about the movie, it would be that not enough time was given to the Mini chase. I've heard that the chase in the original was awesome, with the Minis going over rooftops and all kinds of other stuff. Here it just didn't seem long enough to me. Other than that, this is one to see. It definitely "Blew the bloody doors off" of the summer, but probably not off of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're Only Supposed To Rip The Bloody Title Off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many people, I was prejudiced by the title. It betokened yet another hammy Hollywood re-make of an earlier and far more engaging movie, but with the dubious improvements of a bigger budget, more pyrotechnics, and some inevitable CGI.And - that's more or less what we got.It began slickly enough with a tense little heist episode set in the back-waters of Venice. This served as entrée to a boat-chase that was so clearly ripped-off from 'Puppet On A Chain' and a couple of inferior Bond movies that the makers might have borrowed one of their less iconic titles instead (Oh gosh; surely that wasn't another gondola being chopped in half!)The gold they made off with was actually Ukrainian. And that was were the 'Italian Job' ended.What followed was a needlessly violent double-cross, a bout of self-indulgent grieving that I thought would never end. And, of course, revenge - a very long revenge. There were one or two occasions when I was genuinely bored.That initial heist in Venice was simple, self-explicit and therefore quite involving. However, the rest of the movie was played out in San Francisco (yawn) which is obviously a much cheaper location, being just down the road from Hollywood. There's no obscure, crooked bureaucracy or foreign language to get your head around either. But I've seen it in so many movies by now that I could surely draw a street-plan from memory. And it was here that a presumption of audience stupidity set in, and things began to happen with practically no explanation at all. It was high-technology, you see. Viewers had to be computer whizz-kids. You either understood it or you didn't. I lost count of the frequency with which I saw fingers deftly running-over keyboards with little or no explanation. And likewise there were brief shots of data flashing up and across screens, but again with no additional clarity. Basically, the message was that a laptop in the hands of big enough nerd could work miracles. I wasn't convinced. Then, without the least introduction, new characters just popped-up to fill plot gaps, including one huge fat 'fixer' like Jabba the Hut. Fifteen seconds of fame for him (and perhaps a crash-diet to follow). After the 'Puppet On A Chain' chase rip-off, we were next treated to a 'Bullit' chase rip-off through the streets of San Francisco, and finally a rip-off from the original 'Italian Job' with mini-cars chasing through storm drains. I also spotted a number of other little out-dated and stolen clichés, but frankly - just one day after viewing - I have already forgotten what they were.Memorable, this isn't. Since 1969 I have seen 'The Italian Job' many many times. I know how it goes and how it ends. But it's such a fun feel-good movie that it still entertains me today. This? I don't expect to see it again.'Story' I was once told, is something that happens to somebody you have been moved to care about. And there's the rub. Like so many other modern movies; I couldn't care a hoot about any of these implausible two-dimensional plastic characters: not them, or what happened to them. The standard Hollywood 'pouting totty' was the least plausible of all. Though naturally; she wasn't just a pretty face; she also happened to be an expert safe-cracker and rally-cross driver too. A sort of latter-day Lara Croft. Quite. It's no more than I've come to expect in this age of emancipation.Perhaps they should have called it 'All The Crime Caper Movies You've Ever Seen Rolled Into One Job', or maybe 'Ocean's Eleven Clichés'.There are worse offerings to watch, but you could pile-up a much bigger stack of better ones - unless perhaps you're a computer-nerd.Nice title - shame about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely Passable as a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really disappointed by this movie. Great actors in it, and potentially a great plot, but it just seemed to limp along.Charlize Theron was masterful in her role and beautiful, but it seemed like 90% of her on-screen work was in car chases done with Austin Minis. Product placement gone wrong, so very wrong.The direction seemed off, too. Edward Norton is the bad guy, and it was so obvious right from the start. Every time the camera would pass over him, it would linger too long and Norton would grimace or something. C'mon, Hollywood, give us a little credit! It's okay to surprise us with a plot twist without having to telegraph it.Sorry, but this movie was just below average. I have always been one to appreciate the work and talent that goes into a movie, but this one just didn't have it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First 15 minutes are OK..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do.After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "AWESOME".Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever B-stars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating-to-detail their gold heist. All in all, lots of noise about nothing.I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more as he's been before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's "look, I'm here too" appearing in the beginning I'd say this movie ought to have a "pass if you're above 18" all over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job is not an awful movie. But it is certainly no Ocean's 11. It brings nothing new to the heist genre. The performances are all decent, but it doesn't really seem like any of the actors are excited to be in the movie. Compared with recent heist fare like The Heist and The Score, and with other films out this summer, I would have to recommend the Italian Job, though it isn't anything special.</fullReview>

I was sleeping most through the movie. That's how BORING this was.The way Mr. Norton was acting in this movie. You can so so tell that he was AGGRAVATED to be in such a LOW BUDGETED FILM. Such LOW ratings too. This movie should hit TV soon. I guess it's still in the movies for the brain-dead.If Edward Norton Wanted OUT of this movie. That should tell the World a little something. DON'T GO SEE IT!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!! And just because Mr. Norton wanted out, I WON'T EVEN GO SEE IT!! If the The Matrix called on Norton, he would have jumped ALL over that opportunity.Hey, it's self-explanatory from here on. DON'T, JUST DON'T !! WHAT A TOTAL MESS. 0 out 10 stars. Norton WANTS OUT!!!Go see The Matrix and Reloaded instead. Atleast you have actors and actresses performing with passion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with several people - this film is entertaining. But that's about it. It's perfect for teenage girls - Charlize Theron is definitely the gem of this movie. But everyone else comes off as some sort of overblown caricature (even of their ethnicity - Mos Def, and Franky G come to mind as bumbling or over-macho colorful characters, and the white people are always "IN CHARGE" here). My favoritecharacter was Jason Statham as Handsome Rob - he pulls off the character with class and wonderful acting. Seth Green and Mos Def were more intriguing than the main character, Mark Wahlberg as "Charlie". WAAAAY to much product placement in this film - you can't help but notice it. The Red, White, and Blue minis driving around as some sort of ??? American statement really reminded me more of the French flag. And if that is some sort of stupid patriotic statement, then why do the main characters engage in acts of crime so huge that I'd consider it terrorism (shutting down a government computer system). The best things about this film were the big golfing guy, Skinny Pete, and the Ukrainians. Edward Norton doesn't deserve this... he did pretty good (you've seen Edward in so many good performances at this point that he always SEEMS good), but was he under some contractual obligation? He seems unhappy making this film even as he's acting. Some wonderful action scenes, on par with anything that I've seen, but a better story with less big budget solutions and big plot and realism holes would have made this a better movie than it is. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacular robbery in a not so spectacular film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a promising opening scene of a great robbery, you would think this movie would have more potential like other robbery films such as The Score, which, ironically, also stars Edward Norton. However, as most other B rated movies, this movie falls short on many levels.The Italian Job is a remake of the original The Italian Job (1969). It's about revenge over the death of John Bridger (Sutherland) after a $35 million heist. Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) leads his team of men and long with Bridger's daughter, they take a vengeance on Steve Frezelli (Norton) who stole the money from them in the opening scene. The three mini-coopers seem to get a lot of attention in the movie (I wonder how much mini-cooper paid?). So much attention, in fact, that they had to show them from almost every angle for a good 3/4 of the movie. In fact, by the end of the movie, I myself was wanting one of the little powerful machines.Actually, that's unfair to say because in the original, mini-coopers were also used. In any case, these cars swerve in and out of traffic during car chase scenes like no other. But even with these small, manueverable cars, they never make the action feel complete. When you go into an action movie, you expect action. Though action is delivered (during the robbery scenes), the action during car chase scenes never holds up. It's what you've seen in just about any other car chase scene ever, nothing spectacular.There are a couple scenes though, which make you just laugh. Lyle(Seth Green) brings comedy to the screen and though the jokes are always on the same subject, they never get old. Norton, on the other hand, does not deliver. Not so surprising though, as he said in an interview that he did not look forward to making this movie.The worst thing about this movie was the fact that it cut too many scenes short and made too many scenes long which should have been shorter. This was probably done so that the pacing would be steady throughout the movie, but it never makes the viewer feel satisfied.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Italion Job in L.A.? Mark for Michael? Surprisingly it WORKED!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the classic version from 1969 with Micheal Caine so I had no preconceptions of how it should be but what I saw was very enjoyable. It is very similer to Ocean's Eleven in the sense that the two most important factors to a Heist is teamwork and an unlimited budget. Both feature heists that are very convincing in explanation and execution but as far as the heists being a plausible reality (in terms of real thieives actually seriously going about a heist in such a way and then executing it flawlessly), is a whole other story. However, just like Ocean's Eleven, this implausablility only makes the movie that much more fun. What also makes it a fun movie is that all of the actors go about their characters in a very enjoyable fashion. They seem to know that this type of Heist is very unlikely but still go about it as if it is such a heist could be done and pay attention to little details (like the cars having the proper power and suspension for transporting gold) which, in most cases goes ignored. That is not to say that the movie had no fun or funny scenes, in fact, it is quite the opposite. The majority of scenes were light hearted and only got real serious when it called for such seriousness (like mourning the death of a character). Ironically though, given the incredable chase sequence at the end, the best part about it is the mutual respect that every character has for one another and not resulting to the compitition of genders (Charlize Theron plays a very important part in the Heist) which usually leads to scenes that are nothing more then showing the woman having the advantage or the man having the advantage which really amount to nothing (unless you are either a male shovonists or a femonist).Moving onto the action, there are actually only two action scenes both of which are chase scenes. Again, these chase scenes are executed very convincingly but are very unlikely in terms of practicality but still 100% fun. The rest of the movie is comprised of heist preporation scenes which are as interesting as they are fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gold thieves take their revenge on a double-crosser and murderer in their midst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Italian Job" (2003) is a long movie. At first it's engaging, but eventually it becomes tiresome. It becomes mechanical and distant. Its emotions become pseudo-emotions. Its characters become stock characters without depth. The gang relies heavily on super-computer and hacking whiz kid operations, and this has a magical or unreal aspect, convenient for a superficial kind of story. The gang is a politically correct assortment. The actors are actually given little to do of a substantial nature. Donald Sutherland has become more charismatic as he got older, but he's bumped off early in the movie.Overall, I was disappointed. After seeing it, I wondered how this compared to a more robust classic caper movie like "Topkapi". There we have a super and superior cast of actors, and each one creates a memorable character. They face a challenge and we see how they work to overcome each part of it more or less realistically. The caper engages us thoroughly. There is no need for chases or outrageously extraordinary deeds such as are depicted in "The Italian Job". A feeling of realism is maintained. One can watch "Topkapi" again some time without feeling bored. I cannot imagine watching "The Italian Job" (2003) again. Why would I want to? What is there in it that bears re-watching?</fullReview>

You can do what they did to a Cooper let alone a Sherman tank and keep it running.If you have half a brain this movie isn't for you. Even Theron's good looks can't save it. It is mindlessly boring.

		<fullReview>Having not yet seen the original The Italian Job that Michael Caine I have no frame of reference to compare it to. Still this version is fast moving and fun and you got to tip your hat to a bunch of professional thieves who know their business and steal without it being bloody. Donald Sutherland has assembled a crack team of thieves all with special skills that include Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Mos Def, Jason Stathem and Seth Green. The six pull off a well timed heist of 35 million dollars in gold bullion bars. But then Norton gets real greedy and in turn steals the bullion from the rest, killing Sutherland and nearly all the others. Of course they're out for revenge, but revenge is a dish best served cold. Still they're all a little emotional on this one given the circumstances.New on the team is Charlize Theron who is Sutherland's daughter and she brings safe-cracking skills into the mix. They will be needed before the film is over.Edward Norton in his career has done a nice variety of sociopathic types from The Score, Primal Fear, and American History X. He's some piece of work in The Italian Job, but Norton is an actor who creates a peculiar fascination with the evil he does.The key man as the team attempts to heist the bullion again from Norton is Seth Green the computer hacker. What he does I can't say, but it's the equivalent of directing a mouse in a maze.This version of The Italian Job can safely stand on its own merits as entertaining and thrilling. Even without me seeing the first one as of yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, if inferior to the 1969 film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1969 film I don't revere as a classic but it was very entertaining, and I have to say this film is just as enjoyable. While inferior in some aspects I actually noticed one or two improvements. The plot does meander slightly in the second half, and I found Edward Norton's villain too sleazy and one-dimensional. The film is also a tad too long by about two or three minutes. But it is very fast paced, looks great, has a great soundtrack and has some wonderful set pieces, very like the 1969 film. Where the improvements come are in the direction and the script, here the direction is super-charged, in the 1969 film I found it too flashy, and the script was smarter and more consistent. And the acting wasn't bad either. Mark Wahlberg takes on the Michael Caine role with real enthusiasm and charm and Seth Green is very funny in a very different role. Not to mention Charlize Theron, who is very beguiling as the sassy safe cracker. Overall, entertaining and enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrelenting action!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is your basic remake of an old caper film and while it has nothing new to offer as far as the plot is concerned, the action sequences are thrilling to watch. The story is about an older thief named John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who is in Venice with his gang and they steal 35 million dollars in gold bars but when they are in the Alps they are ambushed by a bunch of armed men headed by Steve (Edward Norton) who is in their gang as well. John is killed and Steve takes off with the bars. A year later Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) gets the gang together again and have tracked Steve down in Los Angeles. The gang consists of Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Left Ear (Mos Def), Lyle (Seth Green) and they also enlist Johns daughter Stella (Charlize Theron) who is an expert safe cracker. They elaborate a scheme to steal back the gold bars and the action never lets up. Sounds like a very familiar story and it is but director F. Gary Gray does a very wise thing with this material. Its loaded with car and boat chases with helicopters and the way they steal the gold bars is actually pretty creative. The action never really ceases much so the film never becomes boring. Forget about logic, this is one of those summer films that you can just sit back and enjoy. Its nowhere near being a great film like Michael Mann's "Thief", but it is a little better than "Swordfish" minus a beautiful actress getting topless. Edward Norton has stated that he only did this film out of a contractual agreement but he does seem to be having fun playing a real bad guy. His character Steve is your cliche' backstabber but he is enjoyable to watch. Seth Green has the funniest moments in the film as Lyle who insists that he is the original Napster and doesn't generate much respect from his fellow gang members. If you go and see this film you can expect the same story you have seen many times before but the characters are engaging and the theft itself of the gold bars is done in a very exciting manner. Sit back and have fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood doesn't learn its lesson very well. This remake of the original English film with Michael Caine and Noel Coward, among others, should have been left alone, as it suffers in the translation to the American screen big time.This film also points out how can a great actor of the stature of Edward Norton, work so differently with two directors. In the 25th Hour", he gives a great performance under Spike Lee's direction. Here, evidently surrounded by such mediocrity and directed without any spark by F. Gary Gray, he acts by the numbers. His being in this film was the only reason I adventured to go, in spite of reports of his conflict with this production. It is very noticeable how bad things must have been on that set.As capers on screen go, this one is only about car and helicopter chases. It just doesn't add anything to the genre. It also suffers from Mark Wahlberg's almost expressionless approach to this "genius" he is supposed to be within the gang. He exudes such blankness about himself that it's surprising that he is constantly cast in these types of roles where he could be more effective in another type of film. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the money that movie studios make, it's nice to know that there are still people out there who can take the time out of their busy schedule to thank the people who got them where they are. Paramount for example has been kind enough to shrink down their latest caper movie, "The Italian Job" in to a nice 45 second trailer. If one is fortunate enough to catch this on TV (which shouldn't be a problem), they should take the time to write Paramount and thank them for keeping $7-$10 in their wallet. This movie was THAT 45 SECOND TRAILER STRETCHED OUT OVER 90 MINUTES. I am sorry, but they put everything that would have been enjoyable about this movie in the trailer. From Seth Green's one liners to the (anti)climactic car chase, the movie seemed to drag if only because I was used to seeing it resolved in under a minute instead of two hours. Save your money for something else, just take it as a thank you from Paramount.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a movie you watch over and over again, but this "re-imagining" is not that bad. In fact, give it any other name and the only similarities between this movie and the Michael Caine version would be the presence of mini's. The story is pretty predictable and forgettable, but it is the characters that make the story watchable. Or at least, some of the characters.Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron, though OK, aren't the larger-than-life characters you'd expect from a film like this. Accordingly they pale next to the likes of Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def, all of whom seem to compete amongst themselves to see who can steal scenes off each other. Seth Green seems to win most of the time but Mos Def in particular was a pleasant surprise. I'm no great fan of musicians turning to acting, especially ones with weird names. But he gave a great performance and gives me hope for "The Hitch-Hikers Guide..." out later this year.As mentioned, the plot is best forgotten in favour of watching the characters interact, which is where the film really scores.It's good enough that I'll watch the sequel when it arrives, but just for the characters, you understand. I'm sure the plot will be drivel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof That Trailers Are The Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler Speaking from the perspective of being young enough to have not seen to original, this movie serves as an example of the fallen nature of movie previews. The important and fun parts of action films like "The Italian Job" are the plots twists; however, when all the twists are known to all the audience before the film starts, then the film must depend on other elements.This is a film whose story can be summed up simply as: the crew gets the gold, Norton kills Sutherland, the crew recruits Sutherland's daughter, and then the crew finally get even. While this would normally serve as ample material for a film of this genre, it is unsatisfying because of the extensive trailer. We know that Norton kills Sutherland. We know that the crew finds Norton. We know that the daughter gets involved. We even know that in a mass traffic jam, an explosive is used to bring an armoured truck to the underground.A caper film does not, thankfully for "The Italian Job", necessarily have to depend exclusively on action and plot twist. It can depend on things like original and comic characterization, as in "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels", but there is no Steve Martin or Michael Caine in this film. This film is a triumph of the flat character.Alternatively, a caper film can be a success when it contains many many more twists than its trailer reveals, as with "Heist", starring Gene Hackman.Furthermore, a film of this kind can be a good movie if, through traditional means, it proffers an important theme unto its audience. The theme of "The Italian Job" is that good guys win and bad guys lose. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff than this.This is a film with no surprises. All is known from beginning to end. No one character is explored to the point of serious interest. While I was hoping that the trailer was a red herring, and there would be a surprise somewhere, I was bitterly disappointed. It failed to say or do anything important, which was per se the only real surprise, given Ed Norton's record as a villainous philosopher in films such as "Rounders", "American History X", and "The 25th Hour".</fullReview>

I haven't had the pleasure of watching the original which personified the 'heist' theme, but I surely can say, I know what 'The Italian Job' is all about.The film is about a team of thieves who plan to steal gold bullion from a former associate who double crossed them. The film scores big time, mainly because it entertains you from start to end. Stylish and Accomplished, filmmaker F.Gary Gray pays homage to his favorite film and has done his job exceedingly well. He's a fan of the film he's making, and that's quite visible throughout. The action sequences are amazing. The climax, is spell-binding.In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg is fantastic. The actor lives his character from start to end. Charlize Theron looks a billion bucks, and delivers a truly fine performance. Seth Green is terrific and provides comic moments. Jason Statham is perfect. Mos Def is good. Edward Norton is a bore this time. Donald Sutherland is okay in a cameo.Watch this heist remake... it entertains and has it's moments to leave you talking and thinking about it. Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

Not the acting, not the end, not the far fetched story, but the details.It was lively I admit, which made it pleasant to watch, but it's not all about the rhythm. There are other things which should be take in considerings, like: characters. The character typology was standard: the beautiful, dangerous woman, the impulsive leader, the computer genius, not to mention the handsome skilled driver. It wasn't something new, and surely wasn't fortunate.The simple alignment of a title, to action genre doesn't or shouldn't undervalue important aspects such as originality and authenticity, which are clearly neglected here.Not bad but still lacking originality and authenticity.

		<fullReview>The Italian Job is the ill-advised Hollywood remake of the much-loved Michael Caine classic about a gold heist in Italy. Now I, like most people, really enjoyed the original film and I expected that this film wouldn't and couldn't hold a candle to it. Surprise, surprise, it doesn't, although it is a solid action film. This movie can best be thought of as a precursor to the FAST AND THE FURIOUS franchise as it feels very similar to those films. The dialogue is snappy and the action is fast paced, with lots of enjoyable car chases. This and the GONE IN 60 SECONDS remake would make a good double bill.A word on the cast: Edward Norton is ill at ease, making a film he has no interest in, but Mark Wahlberg is a solid enough and charismatic lead. Donald Sutherland is ever the professional and Charlize Theron does well in a star-making turn. The real stand out is Jason Statham as one of the crew; he did well enough to turn his back on ensemble movies for many years, instead making a series of fun action vehicles occasionally more entertaining than this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to lie, this is a great movie. It has a clever plot, good action and is very well directed. But I'm going to knock off a few stars for the obvious; that being that it is basically a two hour commercial for mini coopers. And Pepsi Blue. And I'm sure a ton of other stuff I wasn't paying attention to while watching this last night. The marketing boys at Mini Coop must have gave the director a set amount of minutes that the car was required to be in the movie for. It is frankly annoying and takes you out of some of the movie. There is a scene where the stupid mini coopers jump out of a tunnel and crash face first into the ground but a minute later you see absolutely no damage on them. Ironically enough, I will never, ever ever buy a mini coop just because of this film. But ignoring the mini coops and other BS, this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less a remake; more a homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More a homage to the 1969 heist caper than a true remake, the 2003 'The Italian Job' fascinatingly takes place in a universe in which the Michael Caine film exists with our heroes plotting to carry out a heist and "do it like 'The Italian Job'". What similarities exist between the films are entirely due to the characters here taking inspiration, and the parallels are very few, one chase sequence aside. With an essentially new plot, we are treated to better fleshed out characters. Donald Sutherland only appears briefly, but the surrogate father bond between him and Mark Wahlberg (in the Caine role) is so strong that it provides ample motivation. The chemistry between the characters sizzles more here too. There is a lot of great repartee and some genuine laugh-out-loud bits, such as Seth Green imitating Jason Statham, accent and all. More interesting as the characters may be though, the performances are not quite as good. Wahlberg is particularly ineffectual - too withdrawn and uncharismatic for the leader of his gang, and his predictable romance with Charlize Theron lacks sparks. Some of the stunt work is also a tad over-elaborate. There is an instance in which Wahlberg survives a glass window shattering in his face without any cuts or bruises. For the most part though, this is a very impressive remake, just as effective upon revision, and if it were not for a corny ending, one might even argue it as superior to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action, intricate plans and good acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is really exciting and the plots are just so intricately thought out. What I really like about this film is how engaging it is, that it pulls you in by sheer force. From the beginning the film shows us how they pull off heists, and this sets the expectation for what this group can do. So while we are unsure of what they plan to do later on, we willingly follow knowing it will be great. Also, I think this was the film that made me appreciate mini coopers. The acting was great in this. Mark Wahlberg is a little mild, and does not really seem to be the robber type, but he played his part well. Charlize Theron did great too, unfortunately she is the only female in the film and so obviously is given the emotional role. Plus it was her father who died, so there is justification for her tears. But I must admit, her character was pretty tough and badass which I give props to. Jason Statham, Seth Green, Yasiin Bey and Edward Norton did their parts well too. Apart from minor background stories of the group and how they started their career, we do not see what motivates them to steal in the first place. When planning the revenge on Steve, the phrase 'it's not about the money' constantly comes up, so if money was not a big motivator for them, why did they become robbers in the first place? The rest of the film is motivated by revenge obviously, but without giving a reason for their start in crime, it depicts that these robbers aren't really robbers, since they are robbing from the biggest robber of them all. Also, Charlie is pretty much the only mastermind in the film which makes the rest of them there to provide muscle or just for comedic effect. Overall a really engaging and exciting film that did not exaggerate masculinity which I am grateful for. It would have been nice to have more than one female character though.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sort of Ocean's Eleven Meets Die Hard-- Descent Heist Flick But Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the brilliant remake of "Ocean's Eleven" with Clooney, Damon, Cheadle, et al, heist films have been in vogue. There are about two or three per year since circa 2001, a few have been outstanding, most are about average, and a few are duds. They are entertaining, more or less, but sometimes they rely on too many known plot devices. Some of the exceptional ones include the first "Ocean's Eleven" film (not the Sinatra one), "Inside Man", one of the cleverest of such films, and "The Score" (also with Edward Norton, by the way), which keeps you guessing all the way. (If you want to see a really great heist film set in Victorian England, I suggest "The Great Train Robbery" with Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland produced in the 1970's.) Some average but descent fair include "Tower Heist", and "The Art of the Steal". Among the less memorable ones include both of the "Ocean's Eleven" sequels, "Ocean's Twelve" and "Ocean's Thirteen", and the remake of "Fun with Dick and Jane". The present film, "The Italian Job", despite a few nice moments, fits into the middle category of being marginally enjoyable but not great.Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, an up-and-coming sophisticated thief who uses high tech to achieve his plundering aspirations. His mentor is older thief John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who helps him plan for a heist to lift $35 million in gold from a safe which happens to be in the hands of the Italian Mafia in Venice, Italy. Like Ocean's Eleven, they use a team of safe-crackers and embezzlers who enact the theft. Everything goes as planned, almost too easy, until after the heist is completed, everything goes wrong.Without giving away what happens exactly, the thieves lose the gold, which is possibly the best part of the film, The film then focuses on about the thieves finding out where the gold resides and how to retrieve it while also getting revenge on those who stole the gold from them which was stolen originally from the Italian Mafia, who also must have stolen it from other people. They also solicit the help of Bridge's daughter, a crackerjack safe-cracker, to lift the gold. The film then uses a lot of Ocean's Eleven-type devices, describing each of the henchmen which will be involved in the heist to retrieve the gold lost from the original heist.While the film has a couple of unexpected twists, particularly at the beginning, unfortunately it lapses back into tried and true formulas. There's lots of the standard car chases, some subplots and a few characters get "offed" for their troubles. Despite the shortcomings, Edward Norton offers a stellar performance in the clothes of one of the most ruthless characters I've ever seen him play. His performance saves the film. At the same time, I felt some of the other characters were rather flat, especially Mark Wahlberg as the Danny Ocean equivalent in "The Italian Job". Sometimes I find Wahlberg just a bit too humourless and rather stiff. Clooney in the first "Oceans" film is always playful with lots of unexpected comic relief. The film in question is a descent effort, but again the script needed more work, and the ending was a bit predictable. I was hoping for a major unexpected twist at the end, but it never happens. The film tries to be another "Ocean's Eleven" using its devices but little of its charm. I guess my expectations are too high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good a Job as What Michael Caine Delivered.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job (2003): Dir: F. Gary Grey / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Jason Statham, Donald Sutherland: The title doesn't describe the film as a whole but it is a remake of a much better film. The characters had potential but none have personalities. They are double crossed after a heist. Those remaining narrowly avoid death and plot revenge a year later with plans to steal the gold bars they originally stole. Setup isn't new but structure details the operation. The conclusion more or less glorifies crime. Director F. Gary Grey previously made the cliché filled farce The Negotiator. Mark Wahlberg is no Michael Caine but he does pull off the desire for revenge after a hefty double cross. After devising the plan he is assisted by Charlize Theron who plays the daughter of his deceased boss who was murdered during the opening sabotage. Both are driven by revenge, which serves against any sympathy in the end. Edward Norton plays a double crossing sleaze who learns that his intelligence is outmatched. Other roles are not as broad although Jason Statham is featured among the supporting cast. Donald Sutherland plays their former boss and Theron's father but the role isn't very broad. It substitutes the original's humour for action with little purpose. The result is an action film that doesn't represent Italy let alone get the job done. Score: 4 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and lots of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) assembles a crack team to pull off one last job; a daring heist of a safe which contains $35 million dollars worth of gold bars. However, shortly after the heist has been completed, one of the team turns against the others and escapes with the gold and leaves the remaining members of the team for dead. Following this betrayal, Charlie and his crack team which includes computer genius Lyle (Seth Green), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), and getaway driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) set to work in recovering the gold back from the 'rat' in the group with the assistance of safe cracker Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron).I saw the 1969 version of The Italian Job some time ago and remember finding it reasonably enjoyable (although I recall it having a rather bizarre ending). However, I have to admit to possibly enjoying this remake/reboot slightly more....I think the biggest strength of this film lies with the characters and their dialogues; as we're introduced to each character we're given a little bit of background information on each character in order to explain away their relevant 'expertise' but it's done in a way that was both funny and clever. I quite liked the way that each character was set-up in this way. I also felt a great sense of camaraderie between the cast; the whole production was done in a very slick and tongue in cheek manner; I thought the scenes between Green and Statham were the funniest and strongest scenes, but the rest of the cast were all great as well.Another big strength with this film is that it's just so much fun; some heists films have a tendency to become over-plotted and throw in twist after twist. However, with the Italian Job we're just given a straight-forward plot, but yet it's still entertaining enough to keep you interested.The chase sequences are fun, the direction, editing and basically all technical areas are also excellent resulting in a film that's not only fun, but it's also quite a good looking film too.Perhaps having low expectations helped here - I thought the original was a good film rather than a great one so I wasn't expecting much here, but the plot moved along almost as fast as the Minis, the script and the camaraderie between the cast were also top notch and above all else it was fun. Definitely worth watching (especially if you were a fan of the original).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite a few fall-backs it's a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last few months, I have seen a lot of reviews for The Italian Job, many of them negative. The gist of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that, for all its modernistic bravado and high-budget technology, the film doesn't have much substance where it counts. Look, people, it's just a fun movie. This is the type of picture where you're supposed to sit back, relax, and just enjoy the steady-moving pace of the film. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking (lucky for some of us). Granted, "Ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot may have some holes (there's a huge one about 3/4 of the way through), the action may not be as gratifyingly gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be, and some of the dialog may seem pointless and cheesy, but again, who really cares? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What more do you want? I think it's time to drop the fake Roger Ebert meets Gene Shalit act and enjoy yourself for once! Oh, and another thing, whatever you do, don't compare it to the original because, to reiterate what F. Gary Gray has told the press a million times, THIS IS NOT A REMAKE!! My advice- if you're interested in nit-picking your way through a good-humored, fun flick, don't even bother seeing The Italian Job. But, if you don't have a severe inferiority complex and/or want to see Ed Norton get jacked by a bunch of Ukranians, go ahead. The Bottom Line, my fellow moviegoers, is: Lighten Up and Have Fun, Dammit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not many reasons to call this 'The Italian Job'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest version (there being only two.....so far) of The Italian Job has no merit to its name. Director F. Gary Gray and screenwriters Troy Kennedy-Martin and Donna Powers have taken the best out of Michael Caine's original (three Mini's in a car chase, one thought-out heist) and glamourised it (Hollywood A-listers, pristine, clean shots) but with out the charge and the adrenaline we assume that's there. Wahlberg is a flat front-man. Edward Norton makes for a surprising bad guy, annoying and outsmarting Croker (Wahlberg) and his team left, right and centre. The other cast members struggle due to a lackluster script and and its inability to succeed our expectations. You'll be least disappointed in this film if you get the chance to watch this before the 1969 classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern technical version of original film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Paramount film is a remake of the 1969 movie of the same name that was a very good comedy caper. This 2003 version of "The Italian Job" doesn't measure up to the first film, but it is entertaining in its own right. This film is sans the comedy, and in place of that with the clever scheming in the original, this second rendition is all modern. That means lots of technical, electronic, mechanical, scientific caper stuff. I do enjoy these films, but find that they tend to be awful formulaic absent a good and different plot. The highly technical aspects of some films render them almost sci-fi movies. This one is an example. While the final plan of this plot may be technically feasible (very doubtful at that), it's so implausible that it is more sci-fi than crime caper. Of course, that makes it more of an action thriller as well. The cast are a quite good. Donald Sutherland isn't on screen very long. Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron play their roles very well. The rest of the cast fit their roles to a T. The film location scenes in Venice and the Alps are beautiful, and reminiscent of having been to those places. The crowded Los Angeles streets and scenes are ? Los Angeles. This is an enjoyable action film to watch, but there's not much suspense to it. Be sure to watch the 1969 film that stars Michael Caine, Noel Coward, Benny Hill and Raf Valone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, decent caper remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original 1968 caper film starring Michael Caine so I can't compare at all but this was a pretty good time. Mark Whalberg takes the lead here as a master thief out to retake the gold stolen from his gang after they pilfered it from a palazzo in Venice.The entire cast is of course fantastic and works well together, playing off each other and I enjoyed the non-romance between Wahlberg and (a very beautiful) Charlize Theron.The opening heist that takes place in Venice, including speed boat chases through the canals, safes falling through multiple floors of buildings and underwater shenanigans is thrilling and super well done as is the ensuing double cross (poor Donald Sutherland) and escape.I also liked the (I guess iconic) Mini Cooper chase scene towards the end, on train tracks, down stairs etc. Very cool.Ultimately this was an okay movie for me, not fantastic as it dragged a bit in the middle but one of those classic (remakes) that you just have to see. 12/26/14</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, well acted and strongly executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well executed is the phrase that comes to mind with this movie. This applies to both the execution of the film itself and the crime it depicts. The acting is solid all around and there are a few moments of remarkable performance. The crime is also done in a very professional and practiced way. The crime is the first major element I will address. It is done with a motive of vengeance, but I will get into that later. The object of the robbery is $27 million worth of gold. The style in which the crime is performed is very different from Ocean's Eleven, especially since it's not a casino setting, but that's just something for any prospective viewers to be conscious of. It is pretty technologically based, though I saw it eleven years after it came out so I was relatively unfazed by this. There isn't really any time in the robbery where something goes seriously wrong which may or may not appeal to any given crime fan. We see a lot of the planning that goes into the heist, another striking difference from Ocean's in which we are kept in the dark as to the master plan until the end. The second element to discuss, since I have already brought it forward, is the filmmaking execution. The script is written well and flows naturally. The lines are not quite as dramatic or deliberate as in many movies. The conversations between Steve and Charlie are the most deliberately scripted and even these scenes aren't too bad as they go. John Powell's score has the usual crime movie feel with some light guitars mixed with some horns and drums like in Ocean's and Tower Heist. As stated above, the acting is very good, but I will address that in context with the characters. We have a pretty brief look at Donald Sutherland's character, John Bridger, since he gets killed pretty early on (this becomes the stimulus for the crime). He is the well established the leader of the original team most likely because of his experience, though I don't really like his little quote about why the team should steal. The quote's interesting, but I don't quite agree with it. Charlie Croker is a natural crook who seems to steal for the thrill of it and is solidly played by Mark Wahlberg. He is given a little more personality than some lead roles, but not as much as he probably should have gotten. However, it is clear that he cared strongly for John and feels justified in robbing Steve in retribution. Edward Norton does a great job playing the villainous jerk, Steve. I hated Steve's character from very early on, which was good. He all but admits that he had no good reason for stealing the gold and killing John. His one big problem is that he doesn't adapt to the circumstances. Even after he finds out that his old team is still alive and out for his blood, he does nothing to throw them off. In short, the team is able to easily predict his movements and it comes back to bite him. The rest of the characters lie in the team. Stella Bridger, John's daughter is a safe cracker who at first is averse to Charlie and the idea of stealing the gold. But eventually, she joins the others in a quest for vengeance of her father. Charlize Theron portrays her as a confident woman who asserts herself as a leader of the crime. Plus, she does a pretty good job driving her Mini Coopers, which adds a nice touch. Left Ear, played by Mos Def, is the pyrotechnics guy of the bunch and we see a few of his techniques interspersed throughout. He has a mild personality, best exemplified in his encounter with Skinny Pete. Handsome Rob is the team street racer and is played pretty well by Jason Statham. He's more than a little cocky and doesn't mind showing off. Lastly is Lyle the hacker (but of course we have to refer to him as the Napster). He's kind of jealous of the rest of the group because his one big accomplishment got stolen from him by his college roommate. Nonetheless, he contributes a key piece of the crime in his traffic light algorithm that allows the team to get away with the gold. His best scene is the one where he mimics Handsome Rob talking to the cable lady. This leads nicely into the sub-element of comedy, of which there is a little. There are a few pretty good one-liners ("Surprised Steve?") and a couple of fully comical scenes. The most prominent of these, and my personal favorite, is the scene where Charlie tells Stella about the criminal histories of the rest of the team. Skinny Pete and the one Hispanic guy are also both introduced mainly for comical elements since they play pretty small roles in the crime. So basically, it's a good flick to pick when you're looking for decent crime or decent comedy. If you're somewhat interested in either element, it should satisfy since it's well executed. Again, it is distinctly different from Ocean's Eleven so it won't necessarily appeal to Ocean's fans. But overall it's fun and smooth. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ordinary Heist Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a watchable one. But the story it possesses is very much undistinguished. The characters are quite similar to that of other heist movies, to be precise: Leader of the group, his sidekick, a computer hacker, a car specialist, etc. Secondly, it's about revenge and robbery, which again is trivial. Otherwise, the movie is spectacular, especially the car chases and other action scenes, they are very finely exhibited.The cast did a splendid job. The choice for the leader of the group was justified enough. Mark Wahlberg's performance was quite up to his standards. The roles of other members, to be specific, Jason Statham as 'Rob' delivered a satisfactory performance, Seth Green as 'Lyle' and Donald Sutherland as 'John Bridger' were glaring in spite of getting short screen time. Charlize Theron, who played the female lead, too was remarkable. Edward Norton played the loser-villain role, which was surprising. In my opinion, I thought he is a bit over qualified for to play roles like these. His standard is way above than this. Ignoring this, there was no problem with the casting.The direction was appreciable. Screenplay was mediocre. It could have been better if the story was a little disparate. Music, editing and other departments too were quite moderate in their work.In other words, the movie was commonplace yet refreshing. You can give it a watch if you have developed interest in the genres of heist and robbery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Italian Job Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Italian Job" is nothing like a real "job". This on the edge of your seat movie, makes you wanting the job of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg). The Italian Job is a great action packed movie which keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next and gives you everything you want in a movie, from comedy and romance, to high intensity action that is joined by superb acting. Charlie Croker, his mentor, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and six man team assemble to steal millions of dollars of gold in Italy. Charlie and John plan and execute this mission to a tee. However, after the mission is over their planning can not help them with what happens. The aftermath of losing the money affects all of the men on the mission team in a different ways, and they all go their separate ways. However fate brings them back together for a once in a life time opportunity to get back what is rightly theirs. A new member is added on to the team as a safecracker, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron). She is not only bringing her expertise but also revenge. The team assembles and new bonds are connected between people especially Charlie and Stella. A past leaves these two with mixed emotions and tension towards each other, but their chemistry is undeniable. They were connected because of Stella's father, who was Charlie's mentor and more of a father figure to him then Stella. This creates the chemistry and tension between the two and leaves them caring for one another more than either one of them could expect.After careful planning by the entire team. It is time to take down Steve (Edward Norton). The mission has its ups and downs and in the process the action keeps you on your toes along with some laughs such as Left Ear's (Mos Def) hearing problem from a childhood mishap.From driving cars through Los Angles's busy streets to making deals with mobsters. Director, F. Gary Gray, uses Los Angles along with Italy to provide a setting that makes space tight and the action ten time more suspenseful because of these places restrictions in ways to escape. This adds suspense to the film because of the populous places they are in.Mark Wahlberg along with Charlize Theron and Edward Norton are captivating in this movie. The casting was phenomenal because of how each character worked with each other in the movie. Norton portrays the enemy so well by making the audience despise him. His careless and less than remorseful attitude toward Wahlberg and Theron, when realizing he has fallen for the man's daughter that he killed, makes you want to get up and punch him as Theron does in a restaurant scene. Theron's no B.S attitude makes the viewers give her respect, especially when she fights through working with the people that ultimately costed her her father. Walhberg on the other hand steals the hearts of the audience by caring for Theron's character and wanting to steal back the money from Norton to, in a way, avenge Theron's fathers death.The action packed movie will leave you cheering for the team of cons and feeling connected to the all-star cast. This movie has everything you would want to see in an action movie, car chases, guns, fist fights, and even some under and above water chases. Even if that is not enough for an audience the clever acting, comedy, and romance that are intertwined will leave any viewers happy, and asking yourself why no other action movie has ever kept you on the edge of your seat like this.</fullReview>

The "old pro" who's doing "one last job" (guaranteed to die), deception (one team member turns on the others and takes the money), post-heist-conflict (crooks turning on each other), revenge (going after the team member who turned on them), recruiting a past crook who's "gone straight," ragtag Rogues Gallery of characters, etc.Then, there's the now-usual "clever" Guy-Ritchie-fashioned-humorous flashbacks, boring mechanical film "score," etc.The movie is competently made, but unimaginative and rote. The only reason to watch is for the Mini Coopers, which are cool, but that's it.Marky Mark has actually acted once, and that was in "Boogie Nights." Ever since then, he's been coasting, to put it mildly. Charlize Theron is the same, acting once, and just playing the same bitchy or cold character time after time.***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting And Gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who likes fast paced films with an a-list cast and non sop thrills, then the Italian job is for you. It had all great actors who could act, it was funny and had a gripping storyline with vehicle chases, heists, stunts and loads of high tech espionage and twists. The film was fast paced and had you on the edge from start to end with suspense and thrills. It's a family friendly action adventure film and is not violent or bloody well there is but it's infrequent and brief. John Powell also composed a great soundtrack which was as memorable as the film. Truly one for a fun night in, a classic adrenaline fuelled, high tech popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You shouldn't look for big philosophical reflections or a deep plot, we are facing here an action oriented movie that gets straight to the point, very entertaining, and in this sense we can say The Italian Job is effective. The script gets quickly to the heart of the matter and manages to keep a sustained rhythm until the end, with no real time out.Obviously, the flaws are the ones inherent to this kind of movie. The story and characters are superficial and lack depth. Some technological aspects are also a a bit convenient which discredits the script. Finally, and more specifically, the plot struggles a bit towards the end, and one can deplore the choice of Mark Wahlberg, as often not bad but not good either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this a few years back and i remember being really critical about this film because at the time i was more into heart wrenching drama, stellar acting etc. and that caused me to be a bit of a tight ass when it came to enjoying a mindless fun caper flick like this. Maybe some of the negative reviews are from people stuck in that frame of mind but luckily i've grown beyond it enough to appreciate this film for what it is: 100% pure entertainment. The acting is solid all around which is not the case for a lot of films; the pace is blistering hot and never lags; there are some innovative scenes that will blow your mind just trying to figure out- How'd they do that!!??; the characters are well drawn while avoiding sentimentality; and all the ingredients are whipped into a fine recipe for a tasty movie dish!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't honestly say I had an expectation for this sort of film. The trailer made me sit with my left arm on the chin. It just looked clichéd, recycled, and last but not least same kind of film you see nowadays..But I watched it, and I have to say, the film was better than I thought it would be.Firstly, the cast was my favorite part. It had a lot of great actors, especially unexpected ones, that made this a much better experience. I mean, we have Mark Wahlburg, great actor with lots of diversity. Jason Statham, which was perfectly fitting for this sort of film. He's the king of action films. Seth Green. I couldn't believe he was cast, but I loved him in this film. He added comic relief (although there was much more comedic things going on) and a sense of style that made the cast all fit together. Mos Def? That was another unexpected actor. He pushed aside what people would call 'racism' but then added his little role to add to the team. Then Edward Norton. Great actor, who played a great villain. He seemed a bit too serious about what was going on in the screen, but nevertheless he added a great part to the film. The greatest charismatic team of all time. So with all that cast going on, what more could add to the film? I love heist movies. This one adds to the list of good ones, but never competes to the classics. But the plans were clever and new, and never stopped twisting and turning with action and intensity.But the film is just so forgettable. Even with the great cast, and the great action scenes, nothing makes up for it's clichéd doings. I will look back sometimes, and wonder why the critics liked it more than the audience, but I wasn't too fond of how forgettable I will see this film was. But looking for a little entertaining fun? Recommended.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a remake is a total dud, but this remake of the Michael Caine classic does a pretty good job. "The Italian Job" has a group of thieves seeking to take revenge on a former partner-in-crime who double-crossed them. In a way, the whole movie is a giant car chase, but it's clever enough so that it never gets ridiculous or idiotic.Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Donald Sutherland all do a great job. I know that these stunts are all really dangerous, but I still wish to assert that it would be neat to experience this movie, especially the whole scene in the metro. To paraphrase a famous quote: "It's all in the cars." As for the sexual act to which I believed that the title referred, I think that you know which one I mean (I'm probably not allowed to say it here).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Mark Wahlberg Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job is a fast action, crime/revenge film, which is not a remake of the original as some believe. There has been much discussion about this, but all one has to do is see the cast from the original to know that that film was more of a comedy."Job" puts the attention on the heists themselves, the planning, and the cat and mouse anticipatory skills one needs when committing such acts. The acting is satisfactory from a group of top flight actors: Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, etc. , but no more than that. The material is beneath Norton, and he's really not on screen enough to warrant an actor of his caliber. Theron seems an odd fit in the film, but has one of the best scenes with Norton in a restaurant. There are several terrific action scenes involving boat and car chases and great location filming. An interesting trivia note: there's a glimpse of the recently renovated Roosevelt Hotel, the site of the very first academy awards ceremony. It was brand new at that time. The script doesn't allow for a lot of character development, and this is the type of film where the characters exist to serve the plot. The film is still enjoyable and better than average for its type. 7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Snap and Polish of a fie Topkapi-type Caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE Italian JOB has style and a grand sense of speed and action in one of the better caper films of recent years. Where other heist-based films push the button for unremitting tension, THE Italian JOB combines sleekly written dialogue and character interaction which makes all of the tension scenes (and there are plenty) all the more credible. The photography of the inevitable car chases and 'inside shots' of the capers is terrific, with the scenes set in Venice, Italy among the best. The cast is electrically charged without that all too familiar over-the-top push. Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron (father/daughter team) are superb, and Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G establish a camaraderie that is destined to overcome their betraying partner Edward Norton. With a cast like this you almost don't need a script, but the writing has a fine balance of bite and wit. For sheer explosive entertainment by a crew of winners this movie is among the best in this genre. Grady Harp, January 12</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blisteringly Fast Caper Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies in which a car rarely starts from a standing position without burning rubber. And, as far as I could tell, there wasn't a single U turn in it. If the driver wants to reverse his direction, he (or she) simply spins it around in a sort of pivot. Not to give the driving team too much credit. The three principal cars are souped-up Mini Coopers of different colors and must be easier to pivot than, say, a greyhound bus or an earth mover.There's no need to spell out plot details. A team of half a dozen or so "professionals" pull off a spectacular heist of some 35 million dollars in gold bullion in Venice, Italy. I believe Venice was chosen as the location because it gives the film makers a chance to shoot sizable speedboat violating all the traffic rules on the narrow canals of the city. The boats chase one another at high speed, upsetting gondolas, smashing fishing docks, shooting through the air over obstacles, sinking battleships, and whatnot. Except for the police boats that seem to run in circles, I couldn't figure out who was chasing whom or why. It hardly matters. The point is the chase per se.The professionals meet on some Alpine mountain top to savor their success, with their mentor, Donald Sutherland, presiding over the proceedings. The young leader is Mark Wahlberg. Lamentably, there is a traitor in their midst, the freaky looking, mustachioed Edward Norton. He kills Sutherland and does his best to knock off everyone else.But they outwit him and survive, tracking this new multimillionaire back to his sumptuous lair in Southern California, home to many sumptuous lairs. They recruit Charlize Theron, Sutherland's daughter and now a security expert, in their attempt to steal the gold back.Norton, being nobody's fool, twigs to the arrangement and tries to foil their plan. The plan, by the way, involves a good deal of that impossible high tech stuff that appears only in movies like this. Their computer expert hijacks -- is that the word? -- hijacks the entire traffic light system of Greater Los Angeles as well as the subway system. Not only didn't I realize that these things could be hacked, I didn't even know Los Angeles now has a subway system for the little people. All of this leads to another, even more monumental chase, with the Mini Coopers zipping around on streets, sidewalks, subway tracks, and the ever-popular Los Angeles River like three cockroaches, pursued by a black helicopter and some expendable motorcycles.The acting, what there is of it, isn't objectionable, except that when the good guys finally corner the villainous Edward Norton and confront him with their victory, they smirk abominably. That's the director's fault, not the actors'. And certainly not the actress's. Charlize Theron, former ballerina, is seen drilling a particularly difficult safe. She should feel at liberty to drill any of the many safes in my possession. I love ballerinas. Charlize, O moon of my delight, I'm easy to reach. I'm a dancer too. I was once seen doing the froog. And I'm deliciously witty and gay, especially drunk. And my Mom and Pop have been known to kvell over my impression of Kirk Douglas.I will happily grovel before you and will ask only this in return: Try in the future to appear in movies in which the pattern exhaustion isn't so evident. Thank you, dear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great heist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those are just a few to grace this cast. I don't know what it is about heist film always having all-star casts but gotta love it. On to the movie, its about a group of thieves who steal $35 million in gold only to have a member of their crew (Norton) double-cross them to take the gold for himself and leave the crew for dead. Well don't you know it the crew survives (minus one) and want payback. Thus introduce car chases, neat gizmos, cool cars, and lots of humour, while attempting to be serious.I didn't have high expectations for this film because by the trailer it looked rather cheesy, but that doesn't mean that I didn't want to see it. I have to say that I like most of Mark Wahlberg's films, but I don't like him as an actor. He was mostly mono-tone throughout the whole film, even when trying to be saddened or mad. He showed virtually no personality, no charisma. The rest of the cast was a joy to watch, fitting their characters perfectly. I have to highlight Seth Green and Jason Statham. All of Seth Green's films are just so great because he comes off so slick and smooth in his character. Edward Norton is a great villain and really worked by the response of the audience at my theatre, I heard one person calling him an asshole after killing someone (won't say who).The car chase scene was worth the wait, nothing really special but pulled off well. Its a change of pace from SUV's or Ferraris. The one thing that might happen is throughout the film you will either say "yeah right, like thats possible" or you will be enjoying the film and not care. I enjoyed this film with a few exceptions, I would of liked to see a lead with more personality but it didn't hinder the film. There is actually a pretty good back plot (won't tell what), and great side characters. I will say one thing, "skinny Pete", you will know what I mean when you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal action, Somewhat generic story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that you absolutely MUST see before you die (Shawshank Redemption, Good Bad and Ugly, etc). There are movies that are very good, but one little factor kept them from being classics (The Bourne Trilogy). And then there are movies that you kick back and watch on Friday night. Italian Job is the latter.This was a very fun movie to watch, and the action in it was very well choreographed, no doubt. This had some of the best chase scenes I think I have ever scene. The acting was good as well. How could it not be? Modern greats like Wahlberg, Theron, Statham, and others were all cast in this movie in ideal roles for their style. But the thing that keeps this movie from being something truly special is the most important element in a good film- the storyline.Let's be honest. How many times have we seen movies that revolve around a group of criminals that go after someone else that in most cases double-crossed them? This storyline simply does not have anything unique in it that sets it apart from any other action/crime film.Reservoir Dogs had the unique characters and unpredictable story. Godfather was sheerly epic. Italian Job was......just a fun little movie.This was one of those movies. We've all seen them. They have so much potential to be something great, but they don't have anything truly original in them, and they end up becoming nothing more than a standard action flick. I'm not saying this is bad, because it's a very fun movie to watch. I'm just saying if you are looking for something special that will leave you in awe, this isn't it.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't The Italian Job (1966). That was a great film and stands on its own, no question.But this also isn't a remake. Sure, it uses some of the same elements -some characters with the same names, 3 minis, a carefully planned heist, a robbery/chase where they drive through all sorts of unexpected places, traffic chaos arising from overriding the official system etc. But all those elements are used in a completely different story to the original with completely different character dynamics.I liked it. Importantly, there was so much that was different in the story that I never felt the need to compare it to the original.Mark Wahlberg, low-rent action protagonist, was marginally less inexpressive than usual, and the rest of the cast gave reliable performances. A special mention must go to Seth Green, occupying the Benny Hill slot as official bollixer of traffic lights - a quite different character (no big ladies for a start off!) but still a very funny performance.The original is still out there, folks, and it's still great, but this version has a lot going for it - don't discount it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed this wild adventure from Italy, Philadelphia, Hollywood with plenty of car chases, comedy, drama and a small amount of romance. Charlize Theron, (Stella Bridger) was the good looking gal throughout the entire picture wearing a French Twist as her hairdo and being a fantastic safe cracker. Stella took a liking to Charlie Croker, (Mark Wahlberg) put kept him at a distance because she had a great deal of revenge against a certain man who harmed her family. John Bridger, (Donald Sutherland) played the father to Stella, however, she was a very young girl at the time and he had other endeavors to keep him busy. This is a very entertaining film with a OH-6 Observation Helicopter from the Viet-Nam era chasing down Hollywood Blvd after a car and causing major traffic jams. If you like action this is a great film, but rather drawn out and the ending disappointed me, I guess the producer ran out of ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italian whatnow?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. This is a remake. And I usually try to judge remakes on their own merits. I usually end up failing, often because the remake HAS no merits (eg. Get Carter, Planet o' the Apes). This movie, however, DOES have quite a bit going for it, it's just that the original Italian Job happens to be one of my all-time favourite movies. So I found it pretty difficult not to think of it while watching this.In theory, this movie should have been crap. First of all, it's set in America. I'm not going into buy into the argument between the English and American film types...English: You're butchering a classic, a film which defined 60's Britain, blahdy blahdy blah!American: Yeah, but you're just jealous 'cos we're better 'an you....for the simple reason that I don't belong to either nationality, and am therefore unqualified. Not that I have any allegiance either way. Honest.Come on, people! There are plenty of other frivolous reasons to fight wars. You don't need to start one over a Mark Wahlberg movie.My problem with it being set in America is that the movie is called "The Italian Job", and not "The American Job". Yes, I know the job at the start of the movie is pulled in Venice, in BOATS ("Boats?" I hear you ask? "In Venice?"), but that's not really the focus, is it? I suppose, at least, they HAVE chosen to set the main job in a city (LA) where not much effort is needed to create gridlock. But planning to leave themselves a thoroughfare in the chaos kind of defeats the purpose of using Minis, which were used in the original due to their ability to fit through tight spaces in shopping malls, drive through narrow drains and turn on the proverbial "dime". Bloody yanks. Sorry. Oh, yes, now I get it! They needed to clear a path because the new Minis are FRICKIN' GIGANTIC, and wouldn't FIT through the narrow spaces in Turin. So they moved it to LA, where everything's BIGGER! Even the DRAINS! IT ALL MAKES SENSE!! Kind of!! Um, maybe!!I seem to remember saying something about merits. Um...oh yeah. The fact that this story isn't a duplicate of the original kind of makes it work like a sequel, if you forget the 30-year gap and the whole England-America thing, and think of Michael Caine and Benny Hill whizzing through Venice in a boat (well, I DID say "kind of").The script is also pretty funny, and the team have good chemistry. Marky does fine as the straight-man, and his funky bunch of cronies work well as a team. Jason Statham (who would have made an excellent Charlie in a more faithful remake or sequel) is great as the driver and ladies' man, Handsome Rob. Seth Green is funny as Lyle, the computer hacker geek (an obvious update of Benny Hill's Professor Peach). Mos Def, one of the better rapper-turned-actors around, does a good job as Left Ear, the demolitions guy. Edward Norton is okay, but below his usual standard, as the slimy Steve. The big surprise for me, though, was Charlize Theron. I've seen her in quite a few movies, but never thought much of her. I found her kind of wooden, dull, and not even very attractive. But I thought she was great in this. Funny, cool, and very sexy. Maybe it was because she was the only one who got to drive a "real" Mini, her red Cooper S making a meal out of rush hour traffic. That scene, while entertaining, actually detracts from the rest of the movie, because it just heightens the absurdity of them opting for the NEW "brick" to pull their job. It's just product placement, I guess.And where was Alan Cumming as Camp Freddie? Talk about a missed opportunity!Anyway, It's a serviceable enough crime caper movie, but with logical holes big enough to drive three armoured cars through. It's no Ocean's Eleven, and it's not a patch on the original Italian Job. But it's good fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I was surprised how enjoyable and just light this film was. It seemed like it could have almost been rated PG with a risky enough ratings board. I mean, think about it: no shootings in the climactic minutes, no sex scenes, not all that much obscenity, and no scandalous or heavy concepts to take in. The Italian Job seems weirdly almost a family film... The Italian Job is like some of the great caper/action flicks (Sneakers, The Firm) in that there's a smart villain who can anticipate the movements of his opponent, and the good guys do have to work as a team to meet the challenge. There're some brilliant moves in this game, and the players are obviously having a great time. I mean, even in the REHEARSAL of driving the Mini-Coops through the train tunnels, you can tell how charged these guys are. And the chemistry between all of them, given what a strange hodgepodge they are, reminds me a lot of what made Sneakers so great. However, Sneakers also had THE BOX. And THE BOX has a lot of symbolic things going for it, like the prelude to the information superhighway, the meaning of spying in the post-Cold War world, ideas about media control, and perception of reality mattering more than reality. Here, we've got the same charm, but all we're talking about is gold. So, this is a fun movie, but it won't stick in popular memory like Sneakers has for me and many others. It's a great night out, and this summer, that's all I'm looking to get. ***.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I entered the theater in the company of a grumbling 12 year old. He was complaining for a reason that my generation (I'm 26) has difficulty understanding. The movie was Pg-13, he said. If it's not rated R, how can it possibly be good? Well, I told him, helping myself to his huge bag of skittles, let's see.One empty skittles bag later (about 10 minutes into the movie), he was a convert. A true believer. The Italian Job is one of those movies that just works. It's a combination of good scripting, fine acting, and perfect pacing. Granted, it's fairly predictable and ultimately ends the way any hollywood movie should. But we are taken for a fun ride along the way, and it's hard not to feel the energy and commitment from the cast. Everyone is having a wonderful time making this movie. The car chases left my hands sweaty; the capers were well thought out and clever.Although every movie requires that the lead have a love interest, the directors here handle it brilliantly, with a noticeable freshness. The well put together Charlize Theron plays the part of the love interest, and she does it quite well. She is cast as a reserved safecracker opposite the usually doltish Mark Wahlberg, who fails to make an ass of himself in this film, which is a genuine step up. But these two attracted leads never sleep together, they never even kiss. The culmination of their clear desire for each other resides in a warm, consoling hug. And this is typical of the entire movie. They leave things up to your imagination.The Italian Job pulls its punches, but delivers quite well. It is subtle, endearing, and very PG-13. The gratuitous violence, needless profanity, and pointless sex are all missing. It is a step into the past, but i believe it to be a step in the right direction. Even my young companion admitted his approval, as he jammed another brightly colored candy into his mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate this one better than the Matrix Reloaded. This one wasn't as complicated and it simply gave me what I wanted. I thorougly enjoyed this Summer film. Even as I anticipated it and watched it, I never compared it to other heist movies. I took it for what it was. And since the summary's been told about this film, I'll mention the pros and con of this movie. I didn't want to compare but it shares some of Ocean's ll features. Now like Ocean's 11, its a remake, it had its all-star cast,individual querks of the characters, its comical moments, a heist to accomplish and a girl. But instead of pushing clothing fashion, the IJ pushes fashionable Mini Coopers. I wanted to buy one as the ending credits rolled. Memorable characters that stood out was Seth Green's character. I thought the Napster element added great comic relief along with Mos Def's character Left Ear. Even Stratham's character as Handsome Rob left a favorable impression. I just don't get how everyone has dogged E. Norton's acting ability. He is highly underrated. Anyone who dogs this guy has never seen American History X or Primal Fear. He gives awesome performances.I like how they didn't make Marky Mark and Charlize fall in love and kiss all over each other. No time for that. The pacing was succinct and I wasn't bored because sometimes movies can stall on you.Okay a con, well...I could wait till it came out on video. I mean an excellent movie is one I could see over and over. One viewing is adequate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like heist movies, and The Italian Job was a pretty fun one with a great ensemble cast. It had more humor than I expected, much of which came from Seth Green's character, who kept insisting he was the original inventor of Napster. I enjoyed seeing Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, whose skills included driving cars and wooing women. I would have liked to see him do some fighting like he did in The Transporter, but this isn't that kind of movie. And of course, Edward Norton always rocks. But he apparently said his participation is a result of contractual obligation, not choice. The Italian Job might not be as deep as some of his other films, but it's nothing to be ashamed of. Anyway, I did feel like a lot of the action scenes and surprises are given away in the trailer. So you can probably guess where it is going, but it's still fun to be along for the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good afternoon romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty good movie, not summer block-buster material, but entertaining enough to keep me interested through the film. I thought the car chase at the end had been overly hyped compared to what I saw on the screen, it was NOT some amazing blowing you away chase scene as we had been led to believe. But as I said, overall, a pretty good movie, good enough for the Saturday matinee screening, but nothing to write home to mom about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun heist flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another lightweight heist flick, but still a lot of fun watching the Minis slide slickly through the motions. Given how badly I wanted a Mini after watching this movie, it makes you wonder if BMW didn't have a hand in producing this puppy. The cars--more than the characters-- are really the centerpiece of this flick.Ed Norton is nearly reprising his role from the unknown Deniro movie called, not surprisingly, "The Heist." In that movie he also plays a double-crossing thief. Norton was far better in that flick than this one though where, as mentioned, he really feels like he's reluctantly reciting the lines off a cue card in front of him. Norton doesn't quite make it for me as a villain anyway. He fully has the confidence and, arguably, the screen presence, but his looks can't carry him all the way, no matter how buff he gets or how many buxom Mexican actresses he beds. Doesn't he still look like a high school band geek to you? And tell the makeup crew who put that mustache on him to look for a new line of work.None of the other characters are really developed in this flick either, with the possible exception of Charlize Theron's, who strives to give it some depth. Marky Mark is pretty stiff as the head thief and the romantic chemistry between he and Theron has all the excitement of a root canal. At least there were no gratuitous sex scenes where we get to see Marky Mark's underwear yet again. The neatly tied-up final scene where he and Theron are on a romantic gondola ride is baffling, given the lack of development of their relationship.I liked Seth Green as the geek and the Handsome Rob character--a British accent always soups up the screen. And the guy who played the mountain of a thief -- literally -- made for a pleasant grotesque sideshow touch. It makes you wonder how a guy that fat could make it in the crime business - by sitting on people perhaps? They certainly can't jump through windows and would get winded if they had to stand on a corner dealing dope.All in all, this movie centers around the Minis. If you want to see these cars in action, this movie is definitely an extended Mini Cooper advertisement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ITALIAN JOB- *** A band of highly trained criminals are on one of the biggest heists ever trying to steal 22 million dollars in gold. John(Donald Sutherland) who is the leader of the group. The robbery is a success but Steve ( Edward Norton) double-crosses the group for quite alittle profit of his own. Escapes with the money. Charlie ( Mark Whalberg) promises revenge to the daughter of John who is played by Charlize Theron. Comical performances came from Seth Green who announces to all that he wants to be acclaimed as the "Napster". A dose of car chases, quick-witted plots, and a series of break-out laughing moments gives the right amount of medicine to give this movie a just action-comedy to start the summer off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Caper flick that is a genuine Homage to the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, maybe I'm prejudiced, I Loved the movie - highly recommend it to Mini enthusiasts and Feel good Movie buffs. I went to the Cincy premiere of IJ with 150 other Mini Cooper owners (and 7 very nicely kept classics)! WE took up a large chunk of parking spaces oh'ed and ahh'ed over each other's motors and were feted with free Italian Job Mini posters and other promo material courtesy of CincyMini. We then filled the whole theatre, and proceeded to cheer madly whenever there was MINI action on screen. Early on Charize Theron side kicks a Classic Red Mini into a space just vacated by a motorcycle and the whole audience erupted into applause. It is definitely a genuine homage to the Michael Caine classic, but holds its own as a cleverly worked out retelling of the story. The soundtrack was well done and moved the action and story along. Too little of Donald Sutherland was augmented by a fine performance from the rest of the ensemble crew. The story was believable and well laid out. It was most refreshing to have real bright COLOUR production instead of the dark and dingy sets provided by the Matrix redo and the interminable RingsForever sagas. Anyone who doesn't have a giant screen TV will hate those films when they go to DVD. The one wish that lingers with this Italian Job is if somehow they could have resolved the incredible "Cliff Hanger" ending of the original as an introductory act for the new one. Oh, and it goes without saying, the MINIS were fabulous. I can't wait to see them nominated for the Golden Wheels, Oscars, and Happy Motoring Awards.Cheers Jacques</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i recently saw the original Italian Job, and liked it, I rented it because I am a fan of the video game and plus the new movie was about to be released. This film was far better than the first, higher budget, clever , well thought out heists that make you say the word WOW, over and over again. The car/boat chase scenes were really good , and man those Mini Coopers (both the new and old model) can help get you through traffic in a flash. Hmmm...makes me think NYC traffic is tough, I'm thinkin about buying one! but to sum it up, Acting was great in this movie, Mos Def is handling his business in hollywood, Wahlberg and Theron team up again in this one, I cant beleive how long it takes him to put a move on her already!! She is #1 on my list as far as beautiful actresses go. Great movie, awesome settings, direction and originality. *** 3 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard gadget-ridden heist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie and the original 1969 version with Michael Caine and Noel Coward and both were disappointments, but for different reasons. The new version is your standard gadget-ridden heist film right down to the computer geek controlling everything from his laptop. The use of Mini-Coopers, which were admittedly fun to watch, coincides suspiciously with their recent re-introduction into the consumer market. I personally enjoy Edward Norton in just about anything he does. His characterization of the bad guy was about as good as it gets given that the focus of this movie was on the caper.In contrast, the old version should have been better based on the era it was made in and the cast, but I believe it suffered from poor direction and probably a poor script. There was no tension or feeling of rising climax, no witty dialogue and not enough 1960s campy fashion. The best part is the opening scene with Rossano Brazzi driving his Ferari through the hills of Italy. It promises another 1960s era sleeper, but does not deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much fun as a Mini!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last night-what a treat! I went with an open mind, being a fan of the original. In fact, I wasn't going to see it, because I am a fan of the original. But the previews, the publicity-it all got to me.It was good! It was more than good-it was enjoyable. Heck, if it hadn't been a discounted matinee, I would have paid full price! (Something I cannot say about some other recent films...)Yes, it's not a LBF (Little British Film) even though there are LBCs. No, it's not the same plot-just a few things borrowed from the original and a couple of names carried over. And yes, Mark Wahlberg is not the most charismatic of actors-but, compared to Keanu Reeves-he emotes nicely.Speaking of Reeves, the last movie I went to see was "The Matrix Reloaded" and I have see several reviews for "The Italian Job" comparing it unfairly with "Reloaded". I think they're entirely different types of movies and how can the two be compared except to say that "The Italian Job" was enjoyable and the audience reacted during it and APPLAUDED at the end, whilst "The Matrix Reloaded" had the double whammy of Mr. Reeves terrible acting and an indecipherable story. THe audience left that one looking stunned and exhausted.So, comparisions to "The Matirx Reloaded" aside, and forgetting about the original movie, as I loved the old "Italian Job", this one stands on it's own-wonderful locales (hey, some of us really do love L.A.); car chases that actually seem to be for a reason; clever thievery; a fun cast-and a spirit that seemed to carry the (mostly over 30 year old) audience that I saw it with all the way through-I'd give this one two thumbs way up for a fun time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh how I loved this movie! There's so much I want to say about it, but I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it, because you really must see it yourself, preferably as soon as possible!So, rather than write a full review, I'll just say that this movie is as great for what it is NOT as for what it is. This is a movie that does not rely on video-game special effects, gratuitous violence, sex or contrived romantic entanglements for its excitement and drama.The Italian Job is just a great story with live action, genuine love and affection-- between male friends as well as a man and a woman, plot twists that are unpredictable, dialogue that is witty and contemporary, without being cliched, and, above all, well acted by a credibly eclectic ensemble cast.It's also the best and most fun use of a car as a character I've ever seen. If this movie doesn't have you coveting a Mini Cooper halfway through, you're either in a coma or over seven feet tall.With the Italian Job, someone sat down and wrote, directed and produced a movie that respects the intelligence, sense of humor and taste of the American movie-going public. It's about time!Go see it, and send these people a message of thanks, and maybe they'll do it again (and again, and again, etc...).</fullReview>

Mark Wahlberg is ok, Charlize Theron appeals to the guys, but Seth Green is AWESOME in this movie. I thought Edward Norton did a very good job playing a dirtbag, although a lot of people disagree.

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies. But she enjoyed it. I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself. Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him. It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through. One of my top movies of the Summer so far.A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green. I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor. He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him. He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.The only problem is that it is very predictable. Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair. The thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake.</fullReview>

One thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as Edward Norton(who i last saw in 26th hour, which i enjoyed also), Jason Statham(transporter, enjoyed that also) and Seth Green who i think is great, his role as Shawn Fanning's roommate dubbed "The Napster" is hilarious and his hacking skills play a great part in the main heist which centres around a large traffic jam in LA. The car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive. I haven't seen the original so i can't really compare the too but i liked this a lot and would highly recommend this film to everyone, it isn't a film where you need to like that specific genre, it will suit everyone, i felt good after this movie, it had a really good ending and was overall really fun to watch.

		<fullReview>I do. This is not a good heist flick. This is not a bad heist flick. A mediocre movie with mediocre acting. Actually, the two leads (Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron) were the only two actors that I had problems warming up to. Performances by Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def were all very well done, although it seems that the last three films that I have seen with Jason Statham he has played a wheelman of sorts, typecasting? I don't know. Some of the jokes were lame (i.e. The pseudo-subplot of Seth Green's character) and the moustache on Edward Norton's face kept distracting me but that didn't keep me from having a good time. Hey, free movie, even bad movies are good when they're free. Poor Edward Norton, he could have been off making a better movie yet was bound to this. Again, this isn't a bad movie, simply mediocre. Seriously, what was with that moustache! It was like, lopsided and looked utterly ackward on Norton. This piles amongst other annoyances like acting ability and speakers blowing women's clothes off. The plot was predictible, but what can you expect? Charlize Theron was hot, but what can you expect? It had some decent action too. End.</fullReview>

The supposed "key nerd", he plays the part in his usual way, which is all wrong here. The nerd part is supposed to make you say "cool" a lot -- instead I kept saying, over and over again "this guy is not in the slightest bit believable".This was my last attempt at tolerating Seth Green. If I see his name in the credits of any future film I will automatically avoid that movie. I don't need a total downer when I watch a movie.As to the movie itself, it has an ok plot, some good casting but suffers in the realism department -- SMALL SPOILER -- for example, how *did* they lift a ton of "stuff" away in the opening scenes? If they had equipment for that, I missed it. -- END SMALL SPOILER --Summary: This movie doesn't decide what it is supposed to be. Mostly a "caper" movie, it lacks realism. Having lots of character development, yet Seth Green's presences says "Austin Powers 33 1/3". Watchable moments but ultimately disappointing. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heist Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it was a fairly typical heist movie, this film was more in the adventure category to me than action. Its lack of cursing, violence, and sex in some ways was refreshing, but on the other hand it did lose some of the grittiness of a movie about lowlifes. I'm not saying that there needs to be another movie in which everyone betrays each other and ends up dead, but rather that the honor among thieves theme may have been pushed too far in this movie.The energetic and enjoyable score and the cool but entirely unartistic camera work help to give the movie some of its character. The acting was fine, with nobody particularly memorable and without much opportunity for good acting; despite this, the characters' individual talents were fun throughout the film. Two static but still entertaining characters are "Napster" (who's funny) and Handsome Rob (who's just sweet). The plot is utterly predictable in every way; they made no attempt to disguise Steve's betrayal at the beginning (even though I'm informed that the previews showed this--never watch TV). Neither was there any doubt over whether Stella would help them. As a result many of the early scenes were dry and cliché.The action scenes are typical, but typically entertaining. I was impressed by the fact that they made those stupid looking minicoopers semi-cool, and the final elaborate plan unfolds rather well. If you're into heists or cool non-violent action but you don't mind a Deus ex Machina, a trite plot, and an unmemorable cast, this is one for you. I should mention that for reasons entirely unfathomable to me, my female friends seem to be of the ludicrous consensus that Ed Norton and Mark Wahlberg are hot (never mentioning Jason Statham whose coolness boosts him far above them IMO), so if you're one of those kind of people that might make the film better for you.

		<fullReview>Here's another pleasant surprise. Whenever I hear a movie is being remade, I cringe. Movies such as Gone in Sixty Seconds, and The Day of the Jackal, get remade and the results are less than stellar. So, when I heard that "the Italian Job" was getting remade, I expected it to be bad.Well, I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews, and finally see the movie, and was proven wrong. Granted, it's not original, and predictable, but it's sure fun. From beginning to end, you are taken on one very fun ride. The scenes with the Minis are great, and the characters actually enjoy themselves.So, even if there are some flaws, who cares as long as it's fun?Overall, 8 out of 10. The only points lost are, maybe, the a few details and a slight lack of realism. But, you'll be having so much fun you won't even be given a chance to stop and notice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Especially after watching THE MATRIX RELOADED!! *SPOILERS*After seeing the Matrix with all it's ridiculous fantasy make-believe-robotic characters with their super powers, it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk! I cared about these people, and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much, it still left me feeling like "it's possible" verses "what a stupid video game" (like the Matrix)This movie isn't brain surgery, it's very straight forward. Some things are predictable- like knowing that someone is going to be a back-stabber and that someone early on is going to die. Pretty obvious, but SO WHAT? The first 15 minutes sets up our reason, our motive, our main objective.I like that Theron and Walhberg didn't have any make-out scenes. I am glad that they didn't go there. They kept it about funny dialogue ESPECIALLY SETH GREENE. That guy IS FUNNY!This is a movie that I would buy when it comes out on DVD. It's fun, fast and entertaining. The only thing (and I guess it's a big thing) is that we are really - rooting for the bad guys. This group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law.

Edward Norton is always a great actor when it comes to being the "bad guy"--for example in the movie The Score. Charlize Theron can become really well-known from this movie; I didn't know anything about her before I saw it, but I am now anxious for the sequel. This movie can be very much compared to Ocean's Eleven, but it also includes an action-packed car chase--with Mini Coopers!! I can't say enough about how great it was. It's up to you if you would rather spend your money on an action-movie such as 2F2F or a love story such as Alex &amp; Emma, but I guarantee you that all of the movie genres are collected in The Italian Job.

		<shortDescription>Bland acting and plot interspersed with heist scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They borrowed the minis and the traffic jams and that's all that's left of the original. They even stayed clear of the tightwire ending. So why not just call it the "Hollywood Heist"?The scenery in Italy is nice and keeps one interested for that part of the movie. Once it moves to L.A., it becomes just another heist movie, with none of the characters holding one's interest. Ed Norton is losing his initially interesting "bad guy looks like a wimp" persona. Mark Wahlberg is flat. Charlize is as usual adorable to look at but unexciting.The holes in the plot are elephantine, so leave your brain at the door if you want to relax and be entertained. For example how does Ed Norton afford a house that costs more than the gold he stole while he still holds on to 3/4 of it? Or, why would the Italian police think that a 7 ton safe could be carted off on a 1 ton speed boat doing 90 degree turns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They kept using the phrase "lacks imagination" and that really about sums up this film. This is a typical Hollywood affair: lots flashy stunts and technology, the good guys win, and above all predictable. Rather unsatisfying.Oh why oh why does Hollywood insist on remaking films that do not need remaking? Doesn't anyone have an original idea today?I advise you to see the original, it is a much better film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italian Job requires daylight hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job requires daylight hours and no experience is required. This is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies. The plot is good, but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process. It's car chases, explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating "the bad guy" played by Edward Norton. For Norton, it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as "The Score". Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Warning: If you've seen the trailer, then you have seen the movie. If you're looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need The Italian Job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT!! PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED!!*I was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. So me &amp; my friend made plans to see it after school today. Boy, are we glad we did. The movie starts off in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], &amp; John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. Fast foward to a year later, where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that they've found Steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets back together, along with getting the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as "Napster". There's even a funny line in the movie by Seth, who goes "He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Damn Good Car Commercial! (ok movie)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie, THE ITALIAN JOB is ok at best; good (not great) acting,nice visuals and pacing, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enoughto walk out on. But as a car commercial for the new breed of MINICoopers, this film is spectacular!*SPOILERS*Ok, it's a typical heist film with the odd twist (the underwater safe- cracking was nice, if not improbable), and the cast was fairly solid(with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg), but when it all camedown to it, the real "stars" of this picture were the three MINICoopers, in all their high-flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping,bullet-taking, gold-lugging, shiny new glory. The audience I wassitting amongst actually "ooed" and "aahed" when Theron's littlered number first hit the screen (strangely enough, neither she norWahlberg garnered the same reaction).The film starts out promising. Mos Def, Seth Green, DonaldSutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham all begin as aninteresting and humourous band of characters, with the only realuninspired performance being that of the usually good MarkWahlberg. Why he claims this is his best film I can't imagine; hischaracter is completely one-note, and he plays him so blandly itwas as if Mr. Rogers came back from the dead and was inhabitinghis body. Charlize is fine as Sutherland's daughter, thoughnothing magical. Seth Green's character is perfect and therunning Napster jokes (including a cameo by Napster founder,Shawn Fanning) are hilarious; he and some of Mos Def's earlylines add some much needed sparks of humour. Unfortunately,Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland don't get near enoughscreen time.You can see most of the plot coming from a mile away, and thedialogue is rife with bad one-liners and give-aways, but I doubt thefilmmakers were out to re-invent the wheel here, so taken as atypical action/suspense flick it comes out alright. Worth seeing oncheap night I'd recommend.7/10. Not worth it's weight in gold, but makes for nice fillings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good summer flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning! Slight Plot Spoilers Ahead!**"The Italian Job" is not the best movie you'll see all year, or probably even this summer. But it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines, knowing its limits and not attempting to exceed them.What carries the movie is the work of the cast. In a movie about a crew of thieves, the individuals must have a good rapport with each other. Without that cohesive feel, the audience doesn't believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the movie never has a chance. But from the first scenes, in which the men joke around and rag on each other while infiltrating a Venetian palace, the proper chemistry is in place.The characters themselves aren't anything novel; they're your basic gang of criminals, containing about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining skill. But each actor brings the proper goods to the table for his or her part. Mark Wahlberg's understated acting and humor fits well with his part as the mastermind planner. Edward Norton provides attitude and twirls his mustache well in his dark role. Donald Sutherland is the father figure of the crew, and he looks the part of the suave and old-fashioned thief, who is still mentally spry. Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def don't do much beyond their character's abilities, but they each nail those parts. Statham as the smooth-operating driver; Green as the tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder; and Def as the demolitions man. Charlize Theron slides in well in a part that doesn't ask too much of her. She is primarily asked to to drive fast and look good. That she does. None of the characters are that deep or three-dimensional, but in this familiar sort of movie, two dimensions are all that is required. As the title implies, the movie has a European feel to it, a la "The Bourne Identity," in part because it was shot on location in Venice, along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Also contributing to the Euro flair is the rhythmic, bouncy music, which adds to the upbeat nature of the flick and complements the rapport of the cast. The look of the movie is also a perfect match. The bright colors of all locales enhance the mood and add to the attitude. The Minis not only provide a fun variation on the car chase, but also work as a necessary plot device. The plot is more or less straight-forward. There are a few surprises, but they are more of the swift-and-smooth-turn variety, as opposed to the drop-your-jaw hairpin curve. Even with those, the movie speeds along. Once the foundation is laid by the first act, everything continuously progresses. Thankfully there are no breaks in the action for a romance, something the movie wisely avoided. There aren't even any breaks for 'real life.' The story has its purpose and runs that course without distractions. The lack of character depth prevents "The Italian Job" from being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of the heist-planning, such superfluities would have dragged down the pace and quality of the flick.There are a number of implausibilities that I thought of both during and after viewing. But the movie is so enjoyable that I didn't and don't care. In the real world, most of the movie probably couldn't have gone off that cleanly. But "The Italian Job" doesn't take place in the real world. It occurs in a stylish and light-hearted criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us. "The Italian Job" is a movie, in the true sense of the word. It has no pretenses of Oscar and contains no deep moral message. It provides pure escapism entertainment and does so quite well.Bottom Line: Maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far. 7 of 10.</fullReview>

Although the material is rehashed and average, the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfyingly good. The tone could easily have been much heavier, considering the murder-revenge plotline but F. Gary Gray keeps the tone light by good humor, snappy dialogs and pulsating music. It is a pleasure to see these would-be-bad guys form a great bond and stick to eachother through deceit and murder, while never forgetting to have fun. This one is 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good (bad) guys to root for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years, it has been commonplace for movies to have many twists and turns, and/or the big shocker at the end. The Italian Job, from director F. Gary Gray, proves that neither are necessary. A gold heist turns sour after Edward Norton, who plays Steve, has his own plans for the gold, and makes sure of that once the team reaches the Italy-Austria border. A year later, the leader of the team, Charlie (Mark Walhberg) recruits Stella (Charlize Theron) to join the remainder of his team to steal back the gold.The Italian Job, free from fancy visual effects, feature actors who are perfectly suited for their roles. Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, Mos Def as the demolitions guy who "had a bad experience" with dogs, and Seth Green, who claims the idea for Napster was stolen from him.Simply put, The Italian Job is fun to watch from beginning to end, the boat chase in Venice, Italy to the Mini-Coopers in L.A., the sneaky but simple-minded bad guy played by Norton. It is far from perfect, but it deserves to be a box-office success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A car chase in L.A. How Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty good movie. Well-plotted and directed, good infusion of humor, yet it falls flat. First, the one sheet gives you no clue what kind of movie it is, with the cast all standing around. Unless you remembered the original 1969 film, you were clueless. Second, I have rarely seen such an interchangeable cast in any film. Other than Seth Green, any of the men could have been playing any of the male roles.But my huge objection to this film was the car chase in L.A. There's not a foot of interesting tarmac or any surface that we have not seen cars racing over in a hundred films or on the nightly news. This movie is about a car chase. The original did it on wonderful European locations. So did the Bourne Identity. Not a single surprise in L.A. Of course the Minis went over the Sepulveda Dam. Of course they drove on sidewalks. Of course they drove the flood control channels and the LA River. But even the thoroughly ordinary Metrorail tunnels couldn't make this chase scene interesting. Made me want to shoot the neighbors for having that party. How much better it would have been if the chase had been in the mansion (which is why they chose the Minis in the first place).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An opposite-field single. Gray keeps from overswinging a la Bay &amp; Bruckheimer, going with the pitch he's served up. This incarnation of `The Italian Job' doesn't have the cache, wit, or style of the latest `Ocean's 11', but then again it doesn't have delusions of grandeur either. There's nary a scrap of fat on its bones, and the characters are drawn expressively and efficiently enough to keep it from being a soulless exercise. But an exercise it is.It's an especially nice change to see Mr. Wahlberg appearing to have so good a time, looking so pleasant a guy; this is the wrong kind of movie to be gritting your teeth in, so he's smart to be playing it cool. More 'Judy, Judy' here than he was in `The Truth About Charlie'- which is not to say that `The Italian Job', or his role or performance within, is worthy of Cary Grant. For one, his biceps betray his effortlessness- at least fit the forearms into the regimen too, Marky. Sheesh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics these days seem to give good reviews if only part of a movie is entertaining instead of the whole picture. This seems to be the case with this. This picture is rewarded for half-working and it reveals the terrible state of movie-making today. The first 45 minutes are entertaining but then we are insulted with the most ludicrous and unbelieveable plot twists you can think of. It is time for people to say that is simply not good enough.This movie insults you with the most banal wrap-up in memory- cliches are thrown at you at a dizzy pace because the writers are just too lazy or don't care enough to think of something more plausible. At the end of the picture, you are not even sure what planet this caper takes place on. It is certainly not Earth. Sorry, someone needs to tell the writers you cannot control traffic or subways from a computer hacker. You would think the writers had never even been to Los Angeles by the way they portray it.This had potential, but it was washed away by an impossible ending that destroys the entire picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see "The Italian Job" on the recommendations of people I know. I no longer consider these people to be my friends.This film stars Charlize Theron and three Mini-Coopers. Seth Green is good in a supporting role. Donald Sutherland is fine in a cameo. Also in the cast is Edward Norton, who delivers an undistinguished performance as the bad guy, and Mark Walberg. He is nominally the star, or at least, he gets top billing. He plays the head of the heist mob. Unfortunately for Mr. Walberg, every one of the members of his mob has a life and a personality, except him. His character is so underwritten that it would take a James Cagney or a Cary Grant to bring it to life. Not being blessed with their personalities, Mr. Walberg simply soldiers on along reciting his lines competently, but having virtually no impact on the screen. Had he dropped out half way through the picture, you would not have missed him. But again, he was given precious little to work with.The story is a remake of a 1969 Michael Caine film about a complex heist in Venus, Italy, and after the crooks have their booty stolen from them, and even more complex heist in Los Angeles to get the swag back. Not much more needs to be said. We have all seen it before. The whole film is in reality one long build up to another big car chase, this one involving the Mini-Coopers and taking place in the tunnels of the LA subway system, which we are informed is after all, under utilized.Forget that not a single one of the male characters is in any way believable. They really don't matter. This is a movie for people who want to kill a couple of hours and nothing more. Actually, Miss Theron's personalty throughout most of the film is probably the strongest of the lot and she does a pretty good job with her role.She's worth seeing. So are the Minis. Are they worth $8.50 even at matinee prices? Not really. Well, maybe Charlize is. I can see the Minis at a showroom any time I want.</fullReview>

If you liked the chase in "The Bourne Identity," you'll like these.

My wife loves Norton and she agrees that he was just going through the motions. Maybe because he knew that the character was pathetically written.

Like many heist films of late, the thieves are so smart, that they seem to have little trouble pulling off these ever so complex schemes. I thought the car chase that I saw in the trailer was going to be spectacular, but it was only so-so. Why can't movies make car chases like 'The Seven-Ups' anymore, or 'Bullitt?'As for the performances, Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron dutifully performed their roles, while the supporting cast stole the movie from them. Seth Green always brings a little extra flair to the characters he plays. Check out his scene-stealing role in 'Can't Buy Me Love.' Mos Def really impresses me every time I see him. He has a cool presence that will undoubtedly bring him into leading roles in the near future.I can't really see any huge flaws with this film. The plot flows. It kept my attention. So if you like heist movies, then this one will satisfy. But if you want to be blown away, this ain't the film for you. My grade - C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`The Italian Job' is a very subtle heavily encased heist film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One part `The Score', two parts `Ocean's Eleven', a twist of `The Heist' and shake then serve chilled at a European locale. This is the almost recipe for `The Italian Job'.`The Italian Job' is a film loosely inspired by the cult British film of the same name. In the way that `Ocean's Eleven' was a remake of the Rat Pack classic of the same name, `The Italian Job' borrows a couple elements but never tries to clone the original.In this version of `The Italian Job', Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, a protégé to the infamous retiring thief master, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). It's John's last heist and he hopes to bring in a haul worth $35 million dollars in gold. All John wants is to hug his now grown daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron) and retire into the shadows. But all goes to hell when a vindictive and jealous member of the gang, Steve (Edward Norton), decides to double-cross the team. John's last mission ends in blood-shed and the team loses their 35 million dollar prize. Now it's up to Charlie and the rest of his gang to take out Steve in one giant heist.`The Italian Job' is a very subtle heavily encased heist film. There is a lot more talking and planning in this film then the actual action sequences. Because the film is laid out that way it makes sense to have assembled such a colorful cast.In some ways the casting choices are great but the film also has some hang-ups. In the scenes with Edward Norton, you can definitely see his lack of enthusiasm with the role. There could have been so much more tension and poisoned-filled vengeance if Norton would have put more into the role.The other casting hang-up is the romantic chemistry between Wahlberg and Theron. I really do like each actor a lot but I found it very hard to believe that there was anything more than a brother-sister or colleague kind of relationship. Did I miss something?The great casting choices actually are in the film's supporting cast. The chemistry between Seth Green's techno-whiz, Napster and Jason Statham's Handsome Rob were pure magic. These two really are the hi-lights of the movie. I really want to see more of both in the future. How about a Handsome Rob and Napster flick?I really did enjoy the stunts and action sequences of the film. I especially enjoyed the new version of the Mini. To bad those cars weren't in the `The Fast &amp; the Furious'. `Italian Job' could have been in the same league as `The Fast &amp; the Furious' if it would have relaxed a bit. I can just imagine what this film would have been like if it would have been revved up some. (3 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing like a heist film. The gadgets are cool. The stakes are high. Everybody is a snappy dresser. And the thieves are eminently likeable characters exhibiting Zen calm or comedic sarcasm toward their tense profession. If you've come to play, The Italian Job, a remake of the 1969 film by the same name staring Michael Caine, will be a good time. However, if you're looking for the surprise movie to upset the summer clogged with superheroes or make a timeless entry in the crime catalogue, you won't quite find your contender here.Starting out in Venice, the characters are introduced as they boost $35 million in gold bars from some rather ugly and shady characters guarding a safe in a smoke-filled apartment. It's just enough exposition to let you know who everyone is and that the thieves function as more of a well-bonded fraternity than a group of criminals. John (Donald Sutherland) is father to Stella (Charlize Theron) and plays master-heistman and father figure to Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) just long enough for Steve (Edward Norton, who is rumored to be part of the cast only under the duress of a lingering studio contract) to betray the group - setting up everyone's motivation for the remainder of the film.Burning through a cliché-riddled script is often the task at hand for summer movie fare, and the cast is largely up to the challenge. Ed Norton goes for the throat in a Snidely Whiplash mustache and goatee making Steve remorseless in his pursuit of luxury. Charlize Theron is the film's most compelling character who has the greatest motivation for revenge, but not convinced that the second heist attempt is the best way to go about putting her personal tragedy behind her. She also takes flat lines that could come from any action film and does her best to make her Stella stand out. Mos Def, and Franky G have fun breathing brains into their back-up muscle. Jason Stratham has the best career move here as Handsome Rob, the getaway driver and smooth-talker. Every time Seth Green comes on screen, you're just waiting to see how he'll steal the scene with a flourish of his jaded GenX programmer's pent up itch for attention.The weak part of the group is Wahlberg. It isn't that he fails to fill the leading man role with a wild twinkle in his eye and provide a protagonist for the audience to jump into the ride with. There just isn't enough for him to distinguish this Charlie from a plethora of other leading heist men. He's the guy who's going to get the girl. You are certain of it. From the moment John mentions his daughter and all his regrets, you are positive that he isn't going to make it out of the first act alive and that Charlie will be carrying his professional and personal torches the rest of the way. The script just doesn't make out the specifics, and Wahlberg lacks the unspoken charisma that made George Clooney's con man in "Ocean's Eleven" both likeable and distinct among movie heroes.The script shows its seams most during the second act when the characters are supposed to be driving the story. The suspension of disbelief has kicked in enough to let the audience hang in until the 3rd act heist, which is really what everyone came for. Director F. Gary Gray takes the opportunity to make one of the most memorable moments in his movie a quiet one of suspense that interrupts the heist and challenges Stella in particular.Then it is off and running and a solidly fashioned and special-effect-free race through the streets, subways and reservoirs of Los Angeles. Without giving things away, it is a romp that makes the city of LA more of a character than it usually is by making traffic a real factor in the theft and ensuing chase. There is something about the danger of genuinely crafted stunts that makes the expected face-off between the thieves and Steve more satisfying than it has a right to beSo if you like the thrill of a con game or a good chase, go for the ride but if you're in it for character, take your friends because they will be the ones who will provide the evening's best conversation.A 5 out of 10 from this movie-goer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I cannot compare the new Italian Job to the Caine original, I found the new version to be an enjoyable heist flick. It's no Ocean's 11, but it's still entertaining. Wahlberg is good, although I've liked him better in other films (Three Kings), Theron is wonderful, Norton is as sleazy as he should be and Wahlberg's crew, complete with their funny quirks, are an entertaining group. It won't win any Oscars, but it's a great popcorn movie for the summer. An interesting and amusing ride with a happy ending, it's a good movie for a hot summer night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see this movie as part of a premiere in SF, so my opinion hadn't been jaded by reading any reviews in advance. Admittedly, half the fun of the evening was riding around in a Mini before the show started :-)I enjoyed "The Italian Job", even knowing it was a remake. I haven't seen the original, so perhaps I was lucky, not having anything to compare it with. The acting was good but not great, the dialog was a little on the weak side but I've heard worse, the plot was a tad thin and predictable, but even with these minus points, the movie overall was enjoyable. And you do get to see some great stunts with the Minis!If you're looking for something to escape to this summer, you could do a lot worse than "The Italian Job".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seth Green + Shawn Fanning + Spider-Man = Good Movie Made Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it wasn't anything original or never seen before, but it was a lot of fun. I was worried the Napster joke was going to get old quick, but it stayed fresh, and it was nice to see Shawn Fanning again. Seth Green's Lyle (The Napster) is the greatest character in the movie, and his VO of Handsome Rob and Becky from the car is the funniest scene in the movie. He steals every scene he is in. Also...there's a quick cameo from Spider-Man! Blink and you'll miss it! Right when the guys are blowing up the ground to get the truck, there's a quick shot of him. Good stuff, enjoyable popcorn that is most definitely worth seeing. My only complaint is that the most talented actor in the cast (Edward Norton) is given the least interesting character, made especially disappointing since the villain is usually supposed to be more interesting than the hero. Unfortunately, Mark Wahlberg's "hero" also falls somewhat flat, but you'll be having too much fun to really notice until later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MILD SPOILERS. I didn't see the original, so I had nothing to compare it to. I actually saw this film twice at a sneak preview. I liked it so much I had to go back and be thrilled all over again. It is intelligently written and acted. You are actually given clues throughout the movie that tell you what, exactly, will happen. BUT, do you figure it out, or just go with the flow? The first time, I went along for the ride. The second time, the clues just about knocked me in the head like a sledgehammer! I can favorably compare this film to classic episodes of the vintgage television series Mission: Impossible of the 1960's and 1970's. Mark Wahlberg is an intelligent but affable master planner. Edward Norton is made to look like Sean Penn, so he plays out at the perfect sleazeball. Charlize Theron is an ethical, moral, pleasant-looking locksmith/safecracker whose character involvement moves the plot forward without distracting from the flow of events. If you are familiar with the old Mission: Impossible series, look for the similarities, like the choosing of the team, the brief outlining of the plot when all are together, and even the confrontation with the "bad guy" when he realizes he has been beaten by a superior intellect. Very entertaining and stimulating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As action thrillers go, The Italian Job is first rate. This film unfolds in a predictable but interesting way. We have all of the usual characters, the tough guy (Jason Statham, the smart guy (Mark Wahlberg), the nerd (Seth Green), and the quirky guy (Mos Def). All of whom bring their characters expertise to the plot and have their screen moments ala every team film ever made since Mission Impossible. Edward Norton proved that he can play a character the way it's written and still put his own individual stamp on it. While the characters are interesting, the story and the special effects moments it presents are what drives his film. While I'm sure there is some computer manipulation going on, this film does not make its FX as blatant The Matrix. For me there are only a couple of problems. I couldn't figure out why, Handsome Rob didn't make a hit on Stella (His character would have) , why the characters didn't all freeze to death in the mountain lake (except the movie would have been over in twenty minutes) and I never can figure out why Mark Whalberg keeps getting starring roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to attend a sneak preview of this movie, and I am happy to report that it is quite worth your money. This film is very fun and entertaining. It is also quite funny, and doesn't take itself too seriously.Edward Norton essentially reprises his previous character from "The Score", another partner-in-crime-turned-traitor. His on-screen presence is perfect for his character. Charlize Theron turns in what, IMHO, is the most convincing piece of acting I have seen from her, playing the vengeful daughter of a slain man. There are no weak spots in the casting -- Wahlberg and the rest were quite good.My only complaint about this movie was that the plot was bit too predictable. Had I been in charge of the script, I would have tried to include another surprise or two during the last half hour, ala "The Game" or "Malice."Some may see this movie as a cheap cross between "Ocean's 11" and "The Score." But I think it makes for a great time, and I plan to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the local radio stations hosted a special premiere of "The Italian Job". I'm currently at a loss as to what to write. I really enjoyed the movie, but don't want to say too much and spoil it for others.I would full on spend $7 for a matinee at the 1000 Van Ness AMC (I can't think of many movies I would pay the full price of $9.00 to watch [$9.75, at the Metreon]). Seth Green was adorable and totally awesome. The guy from "The Transporter" also starred, and I feel his character was aptly named. Marky Mark had me sympathetic, Charlize Theron was endearing, and Donald Sutherland made me think, "Awww..." Edward Norton was a prick - but, I think that's how I was supposed to feel.I laughed. I like humour that doesn't try too hard. I'm a smart girl, see? I don't need a joke whipped across my collarbone, and an imaginary stalwart figure nicknamed Guido glaring at me to make me laugh.I feel the suspense was good. While I don't deal well with the tension, I did want to stick around and see how everything went down. Succintly, I feel that the events were cleverly done.Overall, this is a movie I wouldn't mind having on DVD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another (remake) caper movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler!! A couple of weeks ago I got a pass to see a screening of this movie.The title sounded familiar, so I checked the imdb and found that it was a remake of a movie Michael Caine had done in 1969. I went down to my favorite mom-and-pop video store to check it out.What I found was a so-so caper movie about a robbery of a vanload of gold on the streets of Turin (hence The Italian Job). Caine was the leader who was using the plan of one man (killed in the opening minutes of the movie) and the money and material provided by a criminal boss (Noel Coward) who doesn't let being in prison interfere with his activities.The central set-piece was the robbery, followed by a crazy chase scene through the streets, walkways and stairs (!) of Turin. The plan called for using the city's computerized traffic control system to tie up traffic (and the police) while they use the only unjammed corridor to escape with the loot.This is the central part of the new movie as well. The twist is that they steal the gold and then have it stolen from them. It is only in the stealing it back that they return to the original.This time Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, the Michael Caine part and the computer expert (a hacker, of course) is played by Seth Green (Benny Hill in the original). Seth plays a computer whiz who claims to have created the Napster software, but it was stolen from him while he was dozing (while napping, get it!).I can imagine what you're saying: "Benny Hill! The original version must've been a real funny one". Sorry. Benny and Seth both are left with little to do. Seth has a couple of good scenes but that's it.What you're left with is unsatisfying. It's not a split-second gosh-wow caper movie like the remake of "Ocean's Eleven" nor is it a comedy of errors like the classic "The Hot Rock" (AKA "The Four Masterminds"). The best part, as in the original, is the big chase scene: three small cars darting in and out of traffic and generally driving where you shouldn't. (The chase scene in the original is IMHO one of the best I've ever seen)This is one to wait for it to get to the video store. Meanwhile, visit your local mom-and-pop video store and rent "The Hot Rock". You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I got to see an advanced screening of The Italian Job and I must say I was impressed. I expected less from this movie than it delivered. It's definitely a summer movie worth checking out. The plot is your basic heist flick. Guy has gold. Team wants to get gold. I won't give anything away, but you can probably guess what the motive is from the trailers. The plot is simple but that's okay because the movie goes along at a fast pace with some humor sprinkled in here and there. One scene to note is when handsome Rob picks up the cable girl to which Seth Green does some really good comedy. I'd liken the movie to Ocean's 11. I think it ranks just below, but it definitely stands on its own as a decent heist flick. Overall it's one to check out. It's fun and fast paced, and that's all I ask from a summer flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch if female under 16---Amtrak pours cold water on anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mindless car chase heist thriller apparently a remake of a much better film. The early film is of course not available on Netflix streaming.Cost 60 million grossed 176 million...Had a black director...so won all kinds of prizes...it was not taut and the filming below average so it gets a 5. Usually in this price range Hollywood can crank out tight beautifully crafted camera work....The idea of repeating the tactics of having the 1 ton safe crash through 2 floors into a canal with a 20 ton armored truck was clever and had a nice touch of covering up the hole made with a sheet of steel...why not make it asphalt covered that would have been even more funny. Having them escape on an Amtrak train made me scratch my head as probably the worst idea they could possibly come up with if this was a real heist. I have yet to take an Amtrak train that was not at least 6 hours late.They must have consumed all their money on the stunts which were quasi believable plus car chases all of which are kind of ho hum any more...controlling traffic lights yawn...Amtrak??? pours cold water on any thing.Add better writers. Tight Hollywood film craft for hard to do angles etc...then it would have got a 6 or even a 7 as normal fareI like this kind of genre but there needs to be some suspense this takes skill and subtlety not dollars...this thing has the twists but they are not scary nor suspenseful---it also has sort of corny humor feel good 50s squareness to it (one gang member dreaming of how he would spend his money wanted a stereo that would blow women's clothes off)--added half a star for that oddity though others might subtract half a star.Read some of the 1 star reviews they are entertaining...this thing doesn't exactly bore but I looked at the time left several times....Recommend? if you have time to kill or a female under 16 apparently the largest audience group...(they thought the male stars hot ????--and I am gay they did zero for me--except maybe the 500 pound guy or the Ukrainians--joke) This is your review, you may delete or edit it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give them credit for making an original plot and not falling back on a remake of some tire 1960's film. However the plot was transparent from my point of view. There are no big moments of jaw dropping "Wow! I didn't know that was going to happen.".The Italian job starts in Venice Italy and thus the name. After that the remainder and majority of this film is in sunny California. It is your basic revenge action robbery without police interference. Personally I think it was a wise idea to not show police, in this "style" of film, where you are cheering for the criminal to win.Good cast and acting, along with great stunts and effects. While this was my very first viewing of the movie on Netflix, I quickly noticed that many scenes have been duplicated in the video game "GTA V" right down to the buildings. I was sitting there and looked at my brother, "Hey! We played this on GTA.". So you know the movie is cool when people plagiarize it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Was I . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>for the last 111 minutes? I seem to remember watching The Italian Job, a remake of a heist movie from the late 60s, now set in Los Angeles, and starring a bunch of pleasingly vacant actors and cute little cars. But that's not possible because I have so little memory of it already (last night, was it?). I do recollect having a pleasing sensation of seeing Charlize Theron, bra-less in a tank top, but they make mannequins with nipples, and I was in a clothing store a few days ago. Mark Wahlberg was there, all angry, wounded puppy-dog handsome. Donald Sutherland popped up, then popped out after crossing paths with ferret-faced baddie, Edward Norton. Venice, Italy and Hollywood, California both looked nice. There were millions of dollars in gold bars, some scuba gear, laptops that could do things I don't think can be done even 11 years after the movie came out, a couple of bullet holes, a number of giant Samoans, cusswords looped out with non- cusswords, and a feeling that this was all just so much fun for a bunch of popular actors and their action-movie-addicted audience.Yet, I can't be sure. I think The Italian Job was an equally pleasant and vacant bit of duck fluff for summer consumption. I know Wahlberg has so much animal magnetism that if he screwed a light bulb in his ear, the damn thing would light off instantly. Theron exudes such a dangerously sexy vibe that, even though she has nothing to do here but act as if she's happy to be invited to work with the boys, we don't mind because there's something primal in her provocativeness. Norton could narrate a documentary on Pope Francis, and the viewer might want to clean his ears out with Lysol, all because he's so . . . um . . . icky.I just don't know for sure if I saw this movie. It's gone. It faded away. I'm not disturbed by my confusion, just confused about where the time went.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is on my "Bucket List" of best movies ever. When my kids are old enough to handle it, this movie will be required viewing. Every time it pops up on the movie guide, I can't resist watching it. I should share the fact that I enjoy movies that provide entertainment. Do I notice some goofs and factual errors, absolutely! Do I care? No! Here are the facts about this movie from my perspective.Rock solid character development and story line. Story is simplistic, characters have fairly 2 dimensional development and it all requires some suspension of disbelief. If you don't like this, watch a *&amp;%$#@&amp; documentary.This plot offers classic characters from Greek tragedies and Shakespeare. The thief with a heart, the thief with a heart who is going straight after this last job, the heart breaker thief, the geek thief, the brilliant thief with a chip, the scum thief who betrays everything and everyone. Then, as added spice you have the straight laced daughter who goes rogue to avenge her father. Lastly, this is the story that illustrates the edict of "Honor among thieves." All these thieves band together to pursue the thief who has violated this sacrosanct honor.I LOVE the relationships in this movie. That is what makes me watch the film time and time again. All these characters are so attractive and conflicted. I love how they interact with each other. Naturally, they complement each other, but the beauty of this screenplay is how they enrich each other in the one-on-one interactions. There is good natured teasing between Charlie, Rob, Left Ear, and Lyle. Gradually, Stella is allowed into this "boys club", but with respect for her skills and contribution not because she is just a pretty face.Honestly, this is the movie that makes me want to embark on a life of crime. If I could find partners like Charlie, Stella, Rob, Left Ear and Lyle, I would be willing to consider high stakes theft! Please, people, this is movie making at its summit. If you love deliberate suspension of disbelief, watch this movie. Just enjoy the artistry of the story/character development and the craftsmanship of the actors and directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job was very entertaining to me, and I think that's what counts! Some people on here criticize every movie they see! Ed Norton played an excellent villain who said in the movie, right or wrong, I don't care, it's about what I want. His character had no morals which explained why he was able to turn on his follow thieves. The director left no stone unturned. Every word and action was accounted for and in my opinion, that's a huge contributor to what makes a good flick. While nothing new was introduced, the movie had some of the best car chases I've seen in a while. The plot was good and the actors were excellent. I thought The Italian job was well cast and the story was well acted and well told.The action was endless and I had such satisfaction because the ending was soooo... sweet. It's okay to just sit back and be entertained by a movie. You don't have to pick it apart for casting, intellect and it's special effects. I guarantee anyone who sees this movie will walk away quite satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes remakes are a good thing, sometimes they're not. This one is very loosely based on the film of the same name in the 1960's starring Michael Caine and Noel Coward with Benny Hill as the comedy relief. That film was a so-so farce, but this one is a runaway hit. The action starts at the beginning and keeps the pace throughout the film. Mos Def and Seth Green are our comics in this film, but their abilities to shift from comic to dramatic are well played. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are well suited to their roles and come off with a very reserved but appropriate sexual tension to add interest to the already interesting hi-tech portions of the film. Sutherland's role, while brief, is the perfect set up for the remainder of the film. Statham does what he does best, and his character is a mix between The Transporter and The Mechanic, with a splash of smooth to balance it out. As always, whether good guy or bad guy, Ed Norton's presence is perfect to create the correct tension in the movie. Good plot, great scenery, and exceptional photography make this a film the entire family can enjoy together, despite the PG-13 rating. Collectible if you like action adventure, although you will probably pull it out as an afterthought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If like me, you were expecting a mediocre remake of the Michael Caine film, then this film should come as a pleasant surprise. Aside from a brief shot of 1960's Michael Caine on a TV in one shot, most connections are nominal and the only logical explanation for any attempt to tie-in to the first film must be to do with financial support from BMW for the inclusion of their "new" Mini. In fact I found this about the only bit of the film that never really rang true, it's explained away because of the width of a corridor the gang need to drive down. However, unlike the first film where the original Mini was a quintessential element in the 'swinging London' British theme of the film and where its presence seemed logical with the England football team playing in Italy. In the new film any car of a similar size would have done the trick and using brand new red, white and blue Minis could only make the gang stand out like a sore thumb. Still, the pace is good, the actions flowing and the speedboat and helicopter stunt work are particularly notable. Whatever it's merits or otherwise, this film couldn't have anything like the impact the original Italian Job had when it was first shown, but if you watch the original now it does seem very dated. If you enjoyed Ocean's Eleven, then you'll enjoy this as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those summer films that the only intention is to please the audience, not win any Oscars. Of course, there were many negative reviews but being an avid movie watcher, I don't base my reviews off those. I enjoyed this film because it's just one of those films that I can watch and easily like.This is about a group of thieves preparing for one last heist. Unfortunately, they were double-crossed by one of their own and were left for dead. Now it's a time for vengeance and payback.The acting is pretty good. There are a bunch of A-list actors that were great. I don't care what people say about Mark Wahlberg, but he's a good actor. Charlize Theron is very good to look at. I love all of Jason Statham's action movies including this one. But the star is Edward Norton. He makes a great villain.Overall, this movie is a good adrenaline rush. I loved the mini cars in the film. Better than those hotshot cars in the Fast and the Furious movies. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

The cast isn't as renowned and neither is the director. Then why, somebody please explain, why this is a much, much better movie. Perhaps, better chemistry, perhaps a girl with with beauty out of this world, perhaps it's simply those charming mini-coopers that end up stealing the movie.

The film stars Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker a brilliant thief who's team pull off the perfect heist and get's away with one of the biggest stashes in film history. But after Charlie and his boys get away with the loot somethings goes terribly wrong and now Charlie and his gang are off to L.A. to settle the score. The Italian Job is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and never get bored of it, it's an enthralling and pulse-pounding heist film that will have doubling over with laughter at the same time keeping you on the edge of your seat. I very, very highly recommend this amazing heist film. I hope my review helps ~ C.R. Lopez.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK heist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a heist movie The Italian Job is neither a noir heist, but could have been, nor a really suspenseful heist, but might have been. Instead they played along the line of the source material, the 1969 flick, and set up a movie about a cool bunch (minus the swinging sixties style).Hey, there's the rub. As a cool actioneer it works pretty well, much better than the original indeed since action then was thought as a big farandole joke in line with the rest of the movie. But they added other stuff around the heist in it: above all there is not one single big heist, it's more about a setup for the original idea of having minis speeding in narrow subway tunnels; then things that are not sparklingly cool also clutter up without adding much.To make it short without giving away plot points there's a line that says fine for a thief means "Freaked-out Insecure Neurotic Emotional". These are precisely the points that never come to fruition along the story although there's supposed to be a strong emotional background.Bottom line: OK movie that could have been much better paced (quite a few lull ends in it between the expected action, comic strip characterization), hence entirely forgotten the next day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Italian Job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting this remake of a British classic to be a pretty boring or rubbish film, but it actually was okay. It may have the three minis (red, blue and white coloured), and it may still be a robbery of gold in Italy, but it is a completely different story. Basically Charlie Croker (Planet of the Apes' Mark Wahlberg) leads a team of expert thieves pull off a daring heist of 35 million dollars in gold, but Steve (Edward Norton, as an agreeably one dimensional villain) betrays the team and gets away with it. A year later, Charlie reunites the team to pull off a bigger job in Venice, Italy, this time obviously using the three minis, some traffic light access, and some explosives. Starring Charlize Theron as Stella Bridger, Seth Green as Lyle, The Transporter's Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, Mos Def as Left Ear, Saw II's Franky G as Wrench, Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Mashkov and a very brief Donald Sutherland as John Bridger. To be honest, it is only interesting for the cast of well known stars, the opening and concluding robberies, the big chase, and that's it, and it didn't have a cliffhanger ending, literally, at all, but it is still quite a fun film. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Heist/Theft Film Outshines Its Competitor Oceans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as heist films goes, The Italian Job was a fun popcorn flick. I liked this film better than its competitor, the Ocean's 11-12-13 series, since there is more action and a better plot.You can sympathize with the main characters in this film, unlike in the Ocean's films. Who cares if Clooney wins back Julia Roberts? The guy is a stud anyway and could get any girl. But, you hate to see Donald Sutherland die and you can sympathize with Charlie (Wahlberg) who was like a son to Sutherland and Theron who is Sutherland's daughter.Edward Norton puts in another brilliant performance as the bad guy. It is truly a pleasure seeing this guy on screen; he can play anything! Norton is one of the best actors in the business today.If you want to see a typical popcorn flick with a decent story, fun characters, and a little action then check out The Italian Job. A sequel is due out next year. Rating 7 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a different version instead of a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Italian Job' (2003) is really not a remake of the 1969 film, as such. It's basically the same concept involving chase scenes with Mini Coopers, but this film has a lot more to it than that. It's completely modernized, and it involves the use of technology in the criminal mastermind as well as romance and revenge. The character story is more in-depth in this version, and the characters have a sense of reasoning for their actions. There is also a lot more action throughout the film in this version than there is in the 1969 version, and there is a different story and subplot and ending. I don't think the two versions can be compared, and I do not call this a remake.Although it contains a lot of action and good characterisation, I found that the action got old quickly. It's still a good film, but it felt too ordinary and unoriginal in some places. It just feels like a typical 1990s/2000s movie following the certain mold of character scenarios and stereotypes.The Mini Cooper chase scenes are done well, and I guess it helped Mini sell their cars in America, although I've always loved the Mini Cooper and now everyone else seems to. Anyway, this is a good action film and a good film to watch to liven up the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed at least 10 minutes of the beginning of "The Italian Job" due to wrong times in the listings, but I seem to have gotten there just in time for any of the key plot points that were referred to later in the movie.This is a breezy robbers vs. robbers movie with none of the character gravitas nor noir sexual tension of "The Good Thief" or even the cute interplays and dialog of a similarly re-made "Ocean's 11."The chase scenes are very entertaining in neat surroundings, but with little of the life-and-death suspense of "Ronin" or "French Connection," maybe because all that's involved is money, ho hum, whether it's $35 million or $27 million.Maybe because Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are just too light-weight here. Edward Norton is wasted as a one-dimensional villain; even Wahlberg's character disparages him as lacking imagination. At least for once a distinction is made between Ukrainian and Russian criminals.There's a fun cover version of Pink Floyd's "Money" by Scott Weiland, Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum (last 3 are ex-members of Guns 'N' Roses) in the movie twice at least, but is NOT on the soundtrack CD.It is nice to see that the robbers' goal is to catch an Amtrak train; public and freight transportation could use the plug.

		<shortDescription>acceptable caper film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of those that gets such a slow start that I considered giving up on it. In spite of the presence of Donald Sutherland, the first half hour is a rather dull setup for what follows.Fortunately, the movie picks up as planning starts for the caper that is the centerpiece of the film. I developed some hope for the movie during a series of vignettes introducing members of the gang. From then on things were pretty good, and the extended caper sequence itself was quite entertaining.Still, the movie feels hollow. Theron is unconvincing, simply because she looks like she just stepped out of a shampoo commercial. The cars in the movie all have that shiny look of something in a car commercial. It's not that I object to glossy caper films; the 1960s was very good at those, but this movie lacks the overall polish so the glossy slick elements don't feel integrated into the whole. Generating little feeling for its protagonists, the film is somewhat entertaining for the most part but completely insubstantial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Wahlberg, not satisfied with ruining Planet of the Apes and Charade, tries to act in this American update of The Italian Job (1969). Cary Grant, Charelton Heston, and now Michael Caine have been trod upon by Marky Mark. The Funky Bunch, Mos Def, Seth Green, Jason Stratham, and briefly Donald Sutherland are the reason to watch as is the much anticipated demise of the a**hole Edward Norton plays. The romance between Charlie and Stella is tacked on with little emotion. The ending is not as fun as the original, although the gang has more flavor in this version. Too much like other heist movies to be highly regarded, but too fun to be disregarded. A better lead could have made all the difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has some fun characters and some nice moments. A really entertaining movie but also a forgettable one.What makes "The Italian Job" a forgettable movie? Well, most likely it's the story which makes it forgettable, it's quite standard and not handled in the best way. With so many great and fun characters you would expect a better movie.The action sequences are nicely done, you can tell F. Gary Gray is a real action director. The movie has a good fast start and ending and nicely done car chases involving Mini's. I have a friend who drives a mini-cooper which now makes him officially a cool guy in my book.This movie shows that Seth Green is actually a good actor. Too bad that Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton were not the two best casting choices from the movie, an extra shame because they were the two main characters in the movie.The movie has some nice musical moments by John Powell and a good pace and atmosphere but overall that can't help it that this movie is a forgettable one. I don't think it's a good idea that they are making "The Italian Job II" right now, a pointless sequel to a forgettable movie, even though I will probably still watch it when it arrives on DVD.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The characters are portrayed by a well-rounded ensemble cast who usually resist chewing the scenery. The directing is competent and abetted by a great soundtrack.

		<fullReview>The best way to describe this movie is "fun". It's a quality heist flick with a very nice cast...and the mini coopers! You might say there's nothing really new here, but it's all done well. I've easily seen a dozen heist movies in the past few years, but this one is one of the best of the bunch. All of the actors played their characters well and really brought them to life with their little quirks. And the stunt work was phenomenal. From the minis to the boat chase in the canals of Venice, it was all very believable with the actors doing most of their own stunt work. This movie is a remake and I've been a little down on the large quantity of remakes in recent years. But the term remake is pretty loose here. The only real similarities are that it's a heist film that uses mini coopers for the getaway cars. The story is very different. With all due respect to the 1969 original, which I also enjoyed, this movie stands on it's own.*** (Out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with an open mind. I had lost the bitterness about the yanks taking a classic and well known Brit flick and turning it into there own. I could write a lot about comparing it with the original bit on every account the original would win. So ill just comment on the film as if it is not a remake or sequel.The Good and BadGOOD - Characters (apart from Charlie, Stella and John). Lyle, Left Ear and Handsome Rob are great characters. I could really she those three having a lot of fun and they had a little in the film. But Charlie and Stella where so serious all the time. You cannot be serious sitting in a mini even if they r quite big like the new ones. [u]The cars are all about cheekiness and fun[/u]. But Rob, Left Ear and Kyle fitted them.BAD - Car Chase at the end. I was expecting a big finale that would completely over through the original films car chase at the ending. But it didn't happen. All that happened was what happened in the original exactly and a bit less at that.BAD - Music- Like I said before the minis are cheeky cars and not serious. The music was more fitting for an epic chase not a fun ride through pipes and on the pavements. They should of has "Self Preservation Society" playing.GOOD - Action scenes. The boat chase and the car chases where un-original but still good to watch.THE ITALIAN JOB (2003) out of 10 - 8/10THE ITALIAN JOB (1969) out of 10 - 9 and a half/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film with some awesome chases. Chases are extended to include speedboats around Venice, and even a helicopter. The face off between Norton's Helicopter and Wahlberg's Mini Cooper underneath a roadway is amazingly cool.Theron's hair is immaculate, but what's with Norton's dodgy moustache, and Wahlberg's tan??A great film, with many (sometimes obvious) twists and turns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this remake, I was sure it was going to be awful, and that it would never live up to the Michael Caine original.As it happens, there's not much living up to do, since it bears so little resemblance to the original that directly comparing the two would make no sense. There are one or two points which can be compared (and I will get to them), but other than that, this film can quite easily be considered by itself.The first comparable point (which is quite minor, really), is the characters. Yes, Mr. Bridger and Charlie Croker have the same names as the original characters, but that is where their similarities end. Please, if you're doing a film with the same title and same character names, make the characters at least similar.The bulk of the film is very enjoyable- a heist is pulled off rather successfully, one partner double crosses the others, and things kick off when the cheated partners go out for revenge.It has casing jobs, safe-cracking, breaking in and a couple of great getaways- all the ingredients of a good heist film.Unfortunately, it has one thing that heist movies do not need- emotional ties. What is it with Hollywood these days, that means that every film needs to have some kind of personal reason for things happening? Why couldn't they just make a heist film about a group of thieves trying to steal gold because it's there, rather than because it was taken by someone who killed your dad / friend / brother / favourite poodle?So... the ties are set up, the heist is planned and pulled off, and they make their getaway. This is where the second comparison comes in. The original film featured a very long race through underground shopping centres, down church steps, over roofs, all to avoid a traffic jam. Whilst this new film features cars racing down steps, and through tunnels, it's very obviously a case of "fans will expect this, so we'll put it in", as there's very little of it, and it does to some extent seem tacked on.Admittedly, this section of the film did please me a little bit, in that Croker says "let's do it like The Italian Job". Although his reference to the characters is referring to the job pulled in the film's opening, it also seemed to be a nod to the original as this section did bear the most similarity to its namesake.Overall, I quite liked The Italian Job. It did have some flaws, but then it had some great moments. I found it very enjoyable to watch, and would advise others to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I went into the cinema determined to forget that it was a "remake" of a damn fine film. I was going to judge it on it's own merits. I chose to do this I already knew it had little to do with the original or even Italy as the title suggests.Even if I look at it as a film on it's own, it fails on every level. The script is stunned, the delivery of these poor lines is also lacking, there is NO character depth and it is amazingly slow. After the gang pull the job in Venice and are discussing spending the cash in the Alps, the conversation is so stilted, it's like an awkward moment at a dinner party, no one seemed to know what to say. That's just a small example. The lines were standard pap and predictable in every way. When the film moved to USA it totally slowed down, big long discusion and recon of the baddies lair, convulted explainations on how they could involve the minis. A pointless subplot with ukranians that suggested it might get interesting but totally failed. Wooden acting from Mark Whalberg and Edward Norton just looking unhappy to be even involved in the film. All this without even thinking about the original.Just to compare briefly, the original was a fun crime caper, it was all about the hiest with a minor sub plot of the Mafia to keep Caine on his toes. It was excellently paced too, the development of the job, the set up and the actually heast and mini chase, all evenly spread through the film. The mini chase lasted for quite a while and used them to maximum effect. Whereas this remake uses the mini for about 15 mins at the end (the only decent bit) and spends too long on the setup.All in all, it just seems a waste on all levels to me but it might improve mini sales.</fullReview>

What I was served with was a 70s like robbery movie, without the humor and the good story telling of the 70s. Mark Wahlberg seems to spoil every film he plays in, and Charleze Theron will put completely her career on a dead end if she continues to pick scripts like this. The rest of the characters are just cartoons. About the director I can just say that he accomplishes the almost impossible - spending producers money to make an expensive action film that looks just boring! 5/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

It was just a fun film that everyone could enjoy. The cast were great in thei roles. There are few movies that can actually "suck you in", but this one did it. And it wasn't a huge special effects blockbuster. The stunts performed in it were great, and the driving in the finale was surperb.

		<fullReview>8.5/10Movies that have no true 'surprises' require something else: something that makes the audience sit back and just enjoy themselves. This one did it just fine, for me anyway; as well as for anybody I went with, who were mostly female, ranging from 21 to 50+.The Italian Job is probably going to join a list of others on my have-at-home DVD list that I'll probably just watch again and again _because_ it's so basically unproblematic and simple, but fun. No guns in the hands of the protagonists, a nice low-key love story almost from another age of film, a bunch of distinctly drawn characters (even the secondary ones, and who cares if they are 'types': was anybody looking for anything else?), nifty car chases, and...AND!...a very impressive helicopter scene (in the garage: was that flying or WHAT?? - God, I love helicopters!), plus lots of quotable lines that you can anticipate on the next watching and have quizzes about with your friends.And, what is it with guys complaining about Wahlberg? He's not an 'actor' per se, but I , for one, am not sure that's such a bad thing. I also like his low-key way of coming across. As long as he's not pushed to having to express profound depths of emotion he's just fine- and, to be perfectly honest, I'll watch a movie with him in preference to anything from the go-through-every-emotion Tom Cruise, or, say, the self-important Vin Diesel.The Italian Job wasn't a 'character piece', and if it had been, it probably would have been considerably less enjoyable.A popcorn flick?Yeah, sure.

		<shortDescription>Surprise! It's not pants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original Italian Job, I feared the worst. What friends and I got tonight, on its first night down here, was a well-paced Hollywood film that's a nice throwback to actioners that aren't disgustingly violent, with lighter moments and a distinctive flavour. For once I agree with Mark Wahlberg when he described this third classic-remake starring him as a 'reimagining'. While it's clearly based on the original 1969 film, director F. Gary Gray (to whom I take off my hat) moves the proceedings along at such a pace that during its viewing, you aren't thinking of Michael Caine's Charlie Croker and Noël Coward's Mr Bridger. In fact, you like, but not sympathize with, the new characters of Handsome Rob, Left Ear and Lyle ? a.k.a. Napster.To show how different, there are very brief flashback sequences to the childhoods of Left Ear and Charlie Croker, appropriately accompanied by period pop music ? and fortunately these aren't as bad as they sound.Gray allows his performers room to move. Therefore, their own characters emerge, in particular Seth Green's unscripted imitation of Jason Statham's voice and accent in one scene. Gray places the camera inside the cars with the actors to get some great shots of Charlize Theron (in particular), Wahlberg and Statham driving. It's apparent to the audience that they enjoyed making this film, with the exception of Norton, whose real-life lack of interest probably suited his role of double-crosser quite well.But these aren't substantial characters. They are caricatures. You root for them because it's part of going to a movie for entertainment value and enjoying yourself. There is no additional reason: Wahlberg pales in scenes with Donald Sutherland because there is a too-evident comparison against a great actor. And thank God he drives so much because he sure as heck cannot walk like a man.But Wahlberg, while lacking presence, is acceptable at all other times, as are the others. While we know she can act and act well from her earlier movies, Theron has her great beauty on her side, but largely goes through the motions.Green is the only exception, turning in an excellent performance as a frustrated hacker who claims to be the inventor of Napster.The entertainment value continues with far less blood than modern actioners and the ending ? which I won't reveal ? is less controversial than Troy Kennedy Martin's original.In fact, don't expect any of the layers of meaning of the Kennedy Martin script, the commentary on a declining British national pride and economy and the idealism of "Britain with her back to the wall". Don't expect the interplay of the soccer game between England and Italy and its parallel against the Croker gang and the Mafia in the "job". There is a single track here, no extra meaning.And don't expect memorable Quincy Jones melodies such as 'On Days Like These' or 'Self-preservation Society'. John Powell's score is standard, early-2000s Hollywood fare that will seem very period in five years' time.Despite some moments, this film is largely predictable. The trailer lets most things out of the bag and the involvement of a separate Mafia ? this time Ukrainian ? is minimal. Still, it's a mainstream audience-pleaser that can stand strongly on its own merits. It's a 9 on the entertainment scale (a point off for a naff ending) ? so let that be your motive when seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."The Italian Job" stars Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron as Charlie and Stella, a pair of thieves trying to get back at Stella's father's killer (Edward Norton) by stealing his gold. Helping them are Lyle "The Napster" (Seth Green), "Handsome Rob" (Jason Statham) and "Left Ear" (Mos Def).You can be sure that the producers remade this film after "Ocean's Eleven"'s success, but unfortunately, "The Italian Job" lacks the style of the 2001 remake. Sure, the writers give their characters 'cool' nicknames that are explained in brief flashback sequences. Lyle claims he invented Napster, but it was stolen from him. Left Ear lost the hearing in his right ear because he set off too many explosions as a child. Handsome Rob is, well, handsome. Unfortunately the nicknames just don't cut it. Everything from the wardrobe to the background music in "Ocean's Eleven" was cool, but "The Italian Job" tried too hard.Still, it managed to be a very fun and funny movie. The wisecracks from Left Ear and Handsome Rob are hilarious at times, and every word that comes out of Seth Green's mouth is amusing (as always). The action is good too, involving tiny cars known as Mini Coopers racing through streets and subways.The acting is probably the low point, but nothing as bad as "Gigli" or "From Justin to Kelly". The best performances probably come from the three side characters played by Green, Statham and Def. Unfortunately, Edward Norton's character is both annoying and boring, something you wouldn't expect from such a great actor.All in all, "The Italian Job" was an exceptionally fun movie, but nothing more, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared to the first? Why bother. This one stands on its own twelve wheels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersThis is my favorite genre, a gang of players with different talents joining together to crack a big one. I wouldn't try to go through the array of these movies since the first Italian Job (1969), or even further back. The most recent is Oceans Eleven (another remake) which is quite good. The relationship of the people there however is more casual and transient. What I like about Italian Job (the new one) is the closer bond of comradeship which makes the bonanza that much sweeter. But then, the caper doesn't even have to be a success either. In League of Gentlemen (1959) when Jack Hawkins was napped and brought to the police prison van, the sight of his seven buddies already sitting in the van waiting for him brought a wave of joy to the audience that it could be called nothing other than a happy ending.The only thing I remember of the old Italian Job is the Mini Cooper chase scene, which has to be what 99.9 per cent of the audience will remember most. That doesn't really matter, and I believe that stories are entirely different anyway, as with other remakes such as Ocean's Eleven and Thomas Crown Affair, where the title and main characters are probably the only things kept. Here, at least we still have the mini Coopers. But let's forget about comparisons and see what this Italian Job has to offer.Having seen comments that the movie is too long and too bland, I have different thoughts. I believe that this done by intention, packaging the movie into something that is quite different from movies we see today, that are continuing to try to top one another by pushing onto the audience characters with edges, angles and exaggerations that that are meant to draw attention (but often fails). The Italian Job offers something that is quite different, indeed opposite. In Stella Bridges (Charlize Theron), there is a sweet coyness which haven't been around for a long time, reminiscing of adolescent romances back in the fifties and sixties. Charlie Croker (Mark Wahberg), the self-assured hero, the determined mastermind, is also presented as a well-contained understatement. Neither the lady-killing flamboyant adventurer (Jason Statham) nor the IT wiz guy (Seth Green) have the exaggeration usually seen in their counterparts in other movies, and the black explosive expert (Mos Def) is almost unnoticeable. Even the villain is uninteresting, not particularly smart and sometime verges on being comical, especially towards the end. Norton achieved this objective first and foremost of course through his acting ability, but is helped considerably by the moustache and goatee. His use of a high pitch, nasal voice does the rest. The end result is something quite surprising. Blending together these low-key characters creates a movie that goes down as smoothly as spring water, quite refreshing from all the highly charged emotional conflicts we see in a majority of movies today, most of which, unfortunately, are not that well done.Many complain that the movie is too long and I beg to differ. For a movie of this style and intention, the length (of close to two hours) is a good match, even perhaps not a complete necessity. The details lend credibility to the story and the waiting makes the finale that much more enjoyable. In addition to the title and the name of the main character, what absolutely must be kept for The Italian Job is of course the Mini Cooper chase. Teleported to L.A., this sequence is repackaged with some delightful originality, such as the three vehicles squeezing in succession into the subway track in front of the approaching train, with only split-seconds to spare. Remake or not, The Italian Job is worth watching.</fullReview>

I don't think that we saw the bad guy get what he deserved for what he did. It seemed like the whole thing was a game. It just frustrates me because, why wouldn't they just kill him? If they want real revenge, why take all his money? He still had some of it left anyway. The whole climax seemed pointless to me. *SPOILERS* I know he dies anyway, but they didn't even plan on killing him until the friends of the guy Norton killed came into the picture. So, I give this movie a 4.5/10 because the ending was unsatifying, seemed abrupt, and I think the point of the movie was, well, pointless.</fullReview>

The cast isn't as upmarket for the re-make ? we have to make do with Mark Wahlberg and Jason Statham ? but they do seem to be having a good time. Palindromically named director Gary Gray keeps the pace in high gear, staging an elaborate (and unlikely) robbery, a nasty double-cross and a sweet revenge story. Couple those elements with a wild Austin Mini (yes, I said Austin Mini) chase through the streets and subways of Los Angeles and you have the makings of a good lightweight summer heist film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I saw this movie with a basically neutral attitude going into it. I was pleasantly surprised...it had good action scenes, a GREAT cast, and a script/plot that did not suck so much that it diverted attention away from the action. (I'm a firm believer that the most common way an action movie shoots itself in the foot is by having a script that is bad AND that directs too much attention.) This movie wasn't Shakespeare but it got the job done.Seth Green is hilarious, he speaks to my generation like few others can. (Yes, I'm one of those "idiots" who liked Idle Hands. Shoot me.)My one complaint about this movie is Jason Statham, or whatever his name is. He's cocky with an annoying accent, and he's unnecessarily condescending. This would not bother me if the characters to whom he was condescending were supposed to be disliked by the audience. But the Italian Job is full of character's that I personally liked (Norton is a God and I love him. He was able to play the villain and still retain his charisthsthmthsma..(spelling uncertain)) Yeah, he can to stunts, yeah, he can drive. He's a good action actor with good potential, and I hope that he develops a sense of humility.If he does, he can be a great movie star.Anyway, yes, go everyone! Go action movie remakes! Go entertainment! Go Seth Green! Statham take a running jump. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward NortonThose are just a few to grace this cast. I don't know what it is about heist film always having all-star casts but gotta love it. On to the movie, its about a group of theives who steal $35 million in gold only to have a member of their crew (Norton) double-cross them to take the gold for himself and leave the crew for dead. Well don't you know it the crew survives (minus one) and want payback. Thus introduce car chases, neat gizmos, cool cars, and lots of humour, while attempting to be serious.I didn't have high expectations for this film because by the trailer it looked rather cheesy, but that doesn't mean that I didn't want to see it. I have to say that I like most of Mark Wahlberg's films, but I don't like him as an actor. He was mostly mono-tone throughout the whole film, even when trying to be saddened or mad. He showed virtualy no personality, no charisma. The rest of the cast was a joy to watch, fitting their characters perfectly. I have to highlight Seth Green and Jason Statham. All of Seth Green's films are just so great because he comes off so slick and smooth in his character. Edward Norton is a great villain and really worked by the response of the audiance at my theatre, I heard one person calling him an asshole after killing someone (won't say who).The car chase scene was worth the wait, nothing really special but pulled off well. Its a change of pace from SUV's or Ferraris. The one thing that might happen is througout the film you will either say "yeah right, like thats possible" or you will be enjoying the film and not care. I enjoyed this film with a few exceptions, I would of liked to see a lead with more personality but it didn't hinder the film. There is actually a pretty good back plot (won't tell what), and great side characters. I will say one thing, "skinny Pete", you will know what I mean when you see it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in with high expectations on this one, and found myself chortling (not laughing mind you, chortling) a few times; let's just say the dialogue left something to be desired. It just got to the point that I was trying really hard to like this one, given the awesome ensemble cast and what I thought we be a solid plot line.Alas, this one was as predictable as could be. The only things that were more disturbing than the plot line were the SHAMELESS commercial tie-ins. I mean really. It's fine to tie-in products; I'm not against the concept. But the Italian Job really lacked the subtlety required, as the ads just took away from any of this movie's respectability.When this film ended I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. And do you know what could get rid of that bad taste? You guessed it! A cool, refreshing Pepsi Blue. I'm not a conspiracy theorist or anything, but since the Mini Cooper was such a central part of this movie, do you think that BMW had a hand in the script? Duh-Dum-Dah-Da!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Today's giant movie screens and earth rumbling sound systems make action films an exhilarating experience. Throw in a nice story and some eye candy and it is truly a blast. OK the story is just a reshaping of the original with Michael Caine, but the added humor - mostly supplied by Seth Green ("Austin Powers" and "Knockaround Guys") and the super cool guys - Jason Statham, Marky Mark and veteran Donald Sutherland add a punch to this one. Who am I kidding? The big difference here is the eye candy! The mini-Coopers and Charlize Theron add a touch of Bond. Whether the stunner is driving the fun cars or cracking a safe in her hotel room, she is captivating. The films weak link is the usually dependable Edward Norton who seems to be sleep walking through his role. Maybe he has reached the point where he feels he deserves more screen time. His role is important, but his lackluster performance doesn't ruin the film at all. Would have enjoyed seeing what a meatier performance could have added to the film, though. Anyway, enjoy the ride and the view!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sharp, snappish, this robbery thriller has good techno-gadgets balanced with the good old fashion safe cracker mentality. There's humor, there's double crosses, and there's the nice frenzied tension. While the script isn't completely tight with some obvious flaws in logic that appear here and there, the script is compelling with juicy intelligent twists...predictable, but enjoyable summer fun. This above average thriller has all the elements for keeping the audience engaged and adds its own brand of pushing the envelope of sophistication.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfyingly entertaining re-make with a techno-approach, with equal suspenseful fun and humor of a heist with mini-coopers and traffic jam in L.A.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Italian Job" 1969 I fondly remember - those three red, white and blue mini FIATs scooting around dodging the Italian police - high and low, whizzing up onto the top of a dome or splashing down by the waters, a 15 minutes worth of quite a caper of chase through Turin. It was a British-Italian production from Paramount, then "A Gulf + Western Company," directed by Peter Collinson with Michael Caine as Charlie Crocker, and Noël Coward as Mr. Bridger, a figure in prison well-respected - there lies the British humor to the plot. The opening and ending frames were also memorable: Rossano Brazzi driving a cool red sports car while Matt Monroe singing "On Days Like These" (music by Quincy Jones, lyrics by Don Black), and pardon the pun, a cliff-hanger of a bus with the essential glistening load and Caine uttering, "hang on a minute, lads, I got a great idea?" ending with a rallying chorus singing the catchy tune "The Self-Preservation Society"...amusing, indeed."The Italian Job" 2003, also produced by Paramount Pictures, directed by F. Gary Gray ("Set It Off" 1996, "The Negotiator" 1998) with refreshed screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers of Troy Kennedy-Martin's original script, successfully delivered matching fun and humor with a smaller concentrated team of six - well, it's Mark Wahlberg as Charlie with three essential partners: Seth Green the computer whiz "Napster" Lyle, Jason Statham (of "Transporter" 2002) as Handsome Rob the car expert, Mos Def as Left Ear the explosive expert (that 'don't do dogs' as the trailer suggested). Also there's Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron, as father and daughter John and Stella Bridger - both expert safe crackers, and from the trailer, we know already, Ed Norton as Steve the betraying nemesis. We actually get double scoops of action thrills of two heist setups in this version. An exciting start and the pacing throughout keeps audience going, rooting for Charlie and co. Here we also have three mini-coopers in blue, red and white. They also gave f?tes of acrobatic agility: speeding down subway steps, flying high jumps, swirling through splashing cylindrical tunnel, down to the "open the door" routine that finishes off a pursuant on bike. The Powers' script had fun with the key players, giving each specific characteristics that provided chuckling amusement. The plot may be nothing new to a heist story, but it's tight and just as suspenseful with its modern day techno approaches. The father and daughter drama gave Theron a more substantial woman's role than Angelina Jolie's in "Gone in Sixty Seconds" (2000). All in all, this is an entertaining Hollywood caper with satisfying ending guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slick Re-make, Fun, Great for Techno Buffs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original of "The Italian Job" was good. Director F. Gary Gray's re-make is better, a real winner.Don't look for depth in this caper flick. The story has been done a number of times before but not often with such crisp acting, great stunts and the infusion of up-to-date cyber-technology gone amuck (or gone in the service of crooks).John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is the substitute dad for a young fellow safecracker, Charlie (Mark Wahlberg). Dispensing sharp advice on pulling off a huge gold bar heist in Venice, he also counsels his protege on the true meaning of life. Steal, he exhorts the worshipful younger thief, not just for wealth but to be able to savor a rich (no pun intended) life.Bridger has been a largely absent dad (because of long tenure in correctional facilities) to his locksmith daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron). Before embarking on the big Venice job he calls her to say a present is on the way. She's worried that's he's skipped out on his parole officer but is remarkably sanguine about his resumption of career opportunities. They seem to have a great relationship - no mention is ever made of mom.It's no spoiler to report that the larceny is successful but runs into a problem when confederate Steve (Edward Norton) and his thugs decide splitting the $37M loot isn't the way to go. So they kill poor John and think they've also wiped out Charlie and his oddball associates, an explosives expert, a computer nerd and a master of the wheel. Well, we know they haven't and the movie follows their complex scheme for revenge. Steve's the target and, of course, an eager and alternately vulnerable and steely Stella is the key to the program.From high speed chases along Venice's canals to near mayhem on L.A.'s freeways, the action comes fast. Lile the Geek (Seth Green) runs through techie madcap tweakingethat my kid thought not impossible. Edward Norton is deliciously evil - a role that requires little depth becomes entertaining to watch.Fans of road action will see the hottest cars since "Q" outfitted James Bond go through wild maneuvers.Charlize Theron is appealing as a quick-witted, super-skillful locksmith temporarily putting aside her successful and legitimate career to use her talents to avenge dad's murder.The outcome: c'mon, what director or screenwriter could leave Stella's broken heart unmended?John Powell's score works very well.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable Thriller film not on a par with the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film, per se, is not bad, but what I object to is its title. The Italian Job was a superb crime caper made in the sixties and took place, as its name suggests, in Italy. Here we have a film that starts out, true, in Venice, Italy but for the most part takes place in Los Angeles. There are some elements from the original, the three minis of course ( but which were much more of a showcase in the original ) plus the name Croker / Bridger which where a throwback to M Caine / N Coward.The original Italian Job was a "highly funny and original" film, it had a comedy element in it ( notably with Benny Hill as the Computer Geek ). That was lacking here. This film could not be "remade" as it has a unique stamp to it. Even its ending was highly original, plus the theme tune "Self-PReservation Society".The remake is devoid of any originality and just seems like normal crime thriller film with some good action scenes. There is no comedy and some of the action scenes are overblown with too much noise and also appear highly improbable. And it does not take place in Italy.Basically, I have no objection to the existence of this film, but a different title should have been used, and certainly nothing hinting at the original. It's not a film that I will remember in future years unlike the original, which is a true "facet" of English culture of the Sixties. I'm seriously not one of these "systematically anti-remake" people but the case in point here is one that could have been dispensed with !!</fullReview>

This movie was rather boring with the best part being the robbery of the gold and the neat idea of getting it out underwater. Also, the scene where Charlie slugs Steve at the table was good. But, I didn't think much of the Mini-Cooper chase. It wasn't that great or original. And there wasn't that twist at the end where someone you thought was good or bad is exactly the opposite.FINAL VERDICT: I like smart, somewhat funny, last robbery job movies. But, this one wasn't that good, so I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly enjoyable to watch, but basically a stupid movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand how so many people could give this movie positive reviews. It was basically a stupid movie. I'll break it down into pros and cons (Caution: possibly some spoilers, not that it matters -- you can see where this movie is going from Pluto):Pros* Good music (I agree with some of the other reviewers on that one)* Charlize is hot.* Some funny bits, especially with Seth Green.* Some neat-o, whiz-bang tricky/clever james-bondian heist stuff* Slightly less stupid than the last James Bond movie, Die Another Day.Cons* Good music does not a good movie make.* A hot chick does not a good movie make (but it doesn't hurt)* The funny bits were actually tiresome and stupid after a while (e.g. the epilogue where Seth's character finally gets the stereo he wants. Just plain stupid scene).* Some *semblance* of reality would be nice, here! I mean, I realize that this is a hollywood movie, but at least please don't act like the audience is a bunch of idiots! (although judging from how many people liked this movie...well...you never know).Examples of stupid stuff: -- There is no way Charlize could have opened that safe with the "glass panel" lock the way she tried to open it (by "touch"). Especially after the glass panel was broken! I mean they *explained* how hard this thing was to open because of that glass panel and then she breaks it and then she can open it anyways??? -- The motorcyclists chasing them in the subway. How on earth could they possibly have known (A) where they were, (B) that they escaped through the passage that they did and (3) how could they have gotten there in the first place? The traffic was all backed up! -- There is no way that the *entire* team would have survived being in ice water for as long as they did, wether or not they had a scuba tank. -- $37 Million is not nearly enough money, the way Ed Norton appeared to be spending it! That Aston Martin alone is over a quarter million!Etc. etc.Practically every scene had some major departure from reality, which, in my opinion, makes a movie stupid. And a stupid movie is a bad movie.However, since this particular group of actors are enjoyable and charismatic, and since it did have a pretty cool chase with a bunch of Minis, a car with which I am particularly obsessed, this movie gets aC-or**** (4 Stars out of ten)If Charlize had appeared nude in any scene (See Reindeer Games (another stupid movie) or The Cider House Rules (a decent movie)), I would have added one star automatically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindnumbing fun but what's with Norton's Moustache?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSI've always viewed myself as quite a patriotic Englishman who adored Wembley (although Twickenham is a better ground), knows the first verse of "God Save The Queen" (which is all you need really. It's such a slow anthem, someone would have to be mad to even consider attempting to sing the other two verses) and loves his Chippy as often as possible. I do however have one vice with regard to this patriotism. I'm not an enourmous fan of the original Italian Job. Don't get me wrong, there are some classic lines in it, the ending is superb, and Michael Caine is a genius, but I know people who seem to adore it, whilst simultaneously never actually watching it. The original film is a slow moving piece of cinema which is actually very weak up until the final half hour. Anyway, I'm not supposed to be talking about the original, but the American's views on how the film could be done.So here am I, it's Thursday night, I've just seen the film (and told a friend what he missed, but then he's still being closed minded as it isn't Michael Caine) and I'm trying to work out how good this film really is. Well let me tell you, it isn't half bad.The acting by certain people is wooden (Ed Norton is possibly the greatest actor of his generation, and he just walks through this without needing much effort at all. Perhaps his fee is the real robbery of this film as he sure as hell doesn't try hard enough to earn it), the cars scenes are good but nothing special, and the ending is the corniest ending I've seen in a film for quite some time. Despite these though, the plot goes along well, theres a few hilarious jokes, and it's just a good film to sit down and watch without thinking.Truth be told, there are only three negative things I can say about this film. Firstly, it's so blatantly a marketing ploy as the "Italian Job" name and occasional tribute are completely unnecessary. Secondly, I wish that in Britain they'd get rid of this stupid 12a certificate as I'm fed up with parents bringing noisey brats who blatantly don't care about the film with them to watch it. Leave the kids at home with a babysitter or wait till video you infuriating people. Thirdly and finally, my remaining gripe about this film is that the final editors must have seen all the mistakes and thought "we might not make a fortune, but at least we'll get onto that mistakes website". There appear during the course of this movie, millions of little errors. At one point the camera shows a side on shot of the Holywood sign and the "h" and the "o" are back to front. I mean, who misses something like that when they're editing a film! Then, in a restaurant scene, it's hard to focus too much on the plot or on the acting, when Ed Norton's moustache is so bent, that a black marker pen would have been more realistic.So yeah, ultimately, if your an enourmous fan of the original, don't be closed minded, go see this just for the experience as ultimately, it's not as bad as it could be, but be warned, Ed Norton's Moustache is so terrible, you'll be laughing at it for days to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The Italian Job" is a stylish heist film beginning in Venice with exciting photography of St. Mark's and canal boat chases. As a `re-interpretation' of the 1969 Michael Caine caper film, it stands up well with fast pace, fashion consciousness, and unique score. Its modernization is primarily in technology: Computers can program all the stoplights in LA and graphically reproduce all the dimensions of a heist location.Mark Wahlberg has taken Steve McQueen's place behind the "Bullitt" wheel in a cute-as-hell mini Cooper, racing under LA streets as McQueen did above-ground in San Francisco. McQueen is a better actor; in fact, Wahlberg has a smile as his only defining emotion, but still better than his tepid recent roles in `The Truth about Charlie' and `Planet of the Apes.' (`Rock Star' is an exception, possibly because of his music experience). Donald Sutherland's cameo as the grizzled veteran is worth the admission price, and director F. Gary Gray (`A Man Apart') shows he can pace a film with the best of them. Edward Norton would like you to forget his traitor turn, and I find that easy to do.Adding to the updated success is location shooting in Venice, LA, and Philadelphia by Wally Pfister, whose `Memento' cinematography is memorable. John Powell's (`Bourne Identity') musical score is modern without being intrusive. Additionally, some supporting roles are strong in concept and performance: a computer nerd (Seth Green) claiming to be the original creator of `Napster,' a half deaf thief (too many M-80's at one time in a toilet bowl) called `Half' Ear (Mos Def), a tough crook called `Handsome Rob' (Jason Statham), and a lithe blonde (Charlize Theron) described as a "professional vault &amp; safe technician."The two major heists are carried with the watchful eye of an accountant and the spirit of `Ocean's 11.' I laughed heartily at the outrageous but believable mechanics of removing huge safes but then remembered the equal true grace under pressure in `Rififi.' I also reflected that this is just summer (`The Hulk' is still to come), and I relaxed with my brain at rest and my sensibility tuned into just enjoying slick films which don't need to impress critics with lofty themes and remorseful protagonists. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't just a senseless bash at America or its movies, like many other comments. (For example, I agree that the musicals of the 'golden age' was Hollywood at its finest). However, modern Hollywood has once again proved itself to be a shadow of its former self, with this feeble remake of The Italian Job. Virtually every movie now HAS to have Americans recast as the heroes and the backdrop of 'downtown LA' a must for nearly every action thriller on the market. What a yawn! The excuse that it would have more global appeal is nonsense. What's London if its not one of the largest, most famous cities in the world (twice the size of LA), not to mention being the centre of the largest former empire on earth. How's that for global appeal? They talk about 'box office', but being British never did James Bond any harm! The new mini looks great, but the chase is not a patch on the original, despite being 34 years on. However, my biggest problem with the remake, which no critics on TV have mentioned, is the lack of humour and irony. The original had it in spades. It's a typical British thing that we can laugh at ourselves, hence the gang's quirky misfit nature (Professor Peach, Camp Freddy, etc.) and yet while they were massively outgunned by the Mafia on their own turf, they still 'took 'em to the cleaners!' The original was also typical of our 'lads, pints and pubs' culture that fitted the film perfectly, especially as we had recently won the World Cup in 1966. Paramount made both movies. It allowed the original characters to be English, so why the change now? Despite modern communication (like here), America seems more insular than ever! However, while this movie may be annoying, it's still based on fiction. Surely, more sinister is the new American habit of rewriting real history. Their plans to remake The Battle of Britain, provisionally entitled 'The Few' with - you've guessed it - an American in the title role, is not only scandalous, but dishonours the memory of those brave pilots of the RAF, who fell (outnumbered 3-1 against) whilst fighting off the Luftwaffe bomber offensive in 1940. Britain stood alone in the world then, as it was a full year before Pearl Harbour, when America officially joined the war! (There were only a handful of Americans on unofficial attachment during the Battle of Britain). Other movies have also had the Hollywood treatment. (The Enigma machine on a U-Boat was discovered by the Royal Navy, not the Americans. The list goes on...) This surely sets a dangerous precedent. Most American kids probably view the sugar-coated gloss of Hollywood when it comes to history, as fact. Now more than ever before, I think it has a responsibility to tell the truth and forget 'box office' when dealing with such massive issues ..... or alternatively, just stick to the Sci-fi and Bruce Willis in a vest!!By the way, the spelling above IS correct ... REAL English (something else they've nicked!)</fullReview>

To me it was an utter failure on every level, with Edward Norton reduced to a taunting brat and Donald Sutherland playing the all-knowing "father figure" for maybe the zillionth time in his career. I cant believe standards have fallen so that people can walk out of films as dumb, formulaic and shallow as this and tell themselves they've been entertained. Since watching The Italian Job, I've revisited recent heist pics like Ronin, Mission: Impossible and The Score, and saw what the Italian Job could have been. This film cant even fall back on mindless action, since it's much-hyped chase scene with the mini coopers felt like a slight tremor after experiencing the earth-shattering action sequences offered by films like "The Matrix Reloaded", or to a much lesser extent "The Fast and the Furious" or "Bad Boys 2". Those films may have been many things, but at least they tried to up the ante instead of retiring to formula and copying everybody else. Believe me, people, I am not a film elitist to say the least...I enjoy trash as long as it's good trash, and The Italian Job is not that. Even Triple X, which I thoroughly loathed after leaving the theater, tried to do it's own thing...The Italian Job doesnt have any balls, in addition to wit, skill or exctitement.</fullReview>

The direction, acting and all that are pretty ordinary, as is the actual story and it tested very poorly. So - the story goes - the concerned producers brought in a giant in the editing profession to reshape the film. He tightened it up and did some other normal things, but he also focused on transitions between scenes.This film spends a lot of time on elaborate entries and exits of scenes, and is the second film this year to do so. The `Matrix 2' was the other one. But Matrix used the transitions as tools to subliminally remind the viewer of the `difference' between reality and illusion.Here, the transitions are less obvious but no less complex. They stylishly underscore the `get in, get out' tagline in a particularly graphic way while adding style and generating a little excitement.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

It seems like science fiction, you cannot drive those ****ing cars in that way, in those places and nobody is going to die in a smash up, are you Schumacher?!?!? PS: By the way, they use English cars for this "kind" of film, not italian car and there is just an italian person in the film, why do not change title?!?!? I think this one would be fine: "1000 THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO WITH A MINI"Save your time, do not watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the obvious joy of having to look at the lovely Ms. Theron's face and form, this movie just doesnt pull it off. The "Ocean's 11" remake is sassy and has immense Star power, and makes you forget all the holes and improbables in the story. In this case, Wahlberg doesn't have the leading man magnetism of Clooney, and the likes of Seth Green and Mos Def don't play the supporting roles like, say, Brad Pitt and Carl reiner do. This remake just falls short.Ed Norton seems wasted here - I actually think the movie would have worked better with Norton and Wahlberg switching roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From its shallow plot to its "Scooby-doo" ending, this film was a major disappointment. (And I wasn't expecting much to begin with.) I found the chase scene which promoters claimed to be one of the most exciting ever to be about as thrilling as Sunday drive to church. At least the forced, awkward dialog felt right coming out of the mouths of the underdeveloped, unbelievable characters. Edward Norton and Seth Green can't help but let their talent show, but the rest of the cast's performances were forgettable at best.This film remained in my local theater for the nearly 4 months, which proves I live in a rather tasteless community. Over all, the film is mildly entertaining but lacks the tension and excitement films of this genre require to be memorable. 4 / 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know what it is about movies like "The Italian Job", but I just love to sit and watch them. A couple of years ago was like a dream with "Sexy Beast", "Heist", "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Score". Admittedly I do not like "The Italian Job" as much as any of those four aforementioned productions, but I still enjoyed this film very much. Old-time master thief Donald Sutherland has hatched an elaborate plan to steal $35 million in gold bars in Italy. He has assembled a dream-team of criminals (Edward Norton, Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Mos Def and Jason Statham) to pull off the complicated heist. Naturally the robbery goes off without a hitch and it appears the six will get away free as birds. However Norton turns on his partners, kills Sutherland and takes all the money for himself. Fast-forward a bit and Norton is in Los Angeles living high, but revenge is still wanted by Wahlberg and the others who were double-crossed. Master safe cracker Charlize Theron (also Sutherland's only child) also seeks vengence on the man who took her father from her. Thus the five plan to take the remainder of Norton's money and take care of their enemy for good. "The Italian Job" suffers through sometimes with an often silly and cliched story, but the production saves itself late with an outstanding final act that will leave your heart pounding and your pulse racing. The cast is all right and Theron is just one of those actresses you can't take your eyes off of. Norton is not really utilized as much as I would have liked. He ended up stealing the show from DeNiro in "The Score" but he becomes willing to share the spotlight here with lesser performers. When all is said and done "The Italian Job" offers just what it advertises: a couple of hours of fun without much thinking at the theater. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The content: fast cars, helicopters, pretty women, evil villains, gold and riches, a robber gang with its super plot and specialists. But the movie plot and also the typical dialogue between the people has no interesting content whatsoever, it is meant to be "cool" but you've seen it all a million times in other better movies already. In other words: this is modern Hollywood movie art at its most typical.Artistic innovation? The people making these kind of movies probably don't even know what artistic innovation means. They probably just laugh all the way to the bank when armies of idiots go buy their endless and brainless variations of a typifal commercial actions flick.The action? It is speedy, endless and rather OK, but the major impression you get might not be entertainment but a dejavu feeling: hey, I must have seen this before somewhere...Like everyone knows there are 13 movies of this sort in a dozen. Once you've seen a couple of them, you've actually seen all of them. Besides, the plot of this movie is hardly a mediocre one. If you really want to see a movie of this genre, why not give some of the other 13 movies of the dozen a try?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slight but moderately entertaining caper film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Urbanites who spend half their waking hours stuck in non-stop traffic jams may get a kick out of `The Italian Job,' in which one of the characters finds a way to bring almost the entire metropolitan LA area to a gridlocked standstill. The film, a remake of a 1969 vehicle starring Michael Caine, is an entertaining caper tale that provides all the elements we expect to find in a film of this sort: the elaborate heists, the high tech gadgetry, the inevitable double crosses and the benevolent thieves who would give Mother Teresa a run for her money in the pure-of-heart sweepstakes. The story begins in Venice, Italy, where a cadre of thieving buddies, under the tutelage of one Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg), pulls off an amazing heist of some gold bars valued at $35 million. But before any of the guys have had a chance to even cash in and enjoy their stake, they are betrayed by one of their own ? Steve, played by Edward Norton ? who kills their mentor, the beloved John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and leaves the rest of the gang for dead in a near-frozen river in the snowy Alps. A year later, thawed out and not a little peeved at the turn of events, Charlie and the rest of the crew discover Steve's whereabouts in Los Angeles and plot out an enormously complicated scheme to exact their revenge - more for their slain buddy, of course, than for the gold itself.The plotting is never really as compelling as it could be, but `The Italian Job' boasts enough finesse and skill in its execution to make the film fun for most of its running time. The biggest flaw in the screenplay is that it doesn't take full advantage of the tension and conflict inherent in the narrative setup. We want to see more confrontation scenes between the `good' thieves and the one `bad' one, but Steve rarely spends any screen time confronting his pursuers. That's why the best scene by far is one that occurs in a restaurant when the antagonists DO actually square off against each other fact to face. The overall lack of interaction between these two forces might have been less noticeable and detrimental had the filmmakers come up with any internecine conflicts among Charlie and the other members of his brigade. Instead, these guys all get along so swimmingly with one another that all we are really able to do is watch the mechanics of the storyline as they play themselves out. The men have no disagreements, no differences of opinion and no conflicts of interest within their happy little group, a defect in the screenplay which robs the film of some of the tension it might otherwise have had.Still, `The Italian Job' is a smooth, fairly standard, fairly enjoyable little time waster with a few good chases both on land and sea, some deft acting and a smattering of amusing one-liners to keep us from walking out of the theater. That one forgets the movie the minute one leaves the theatre is pretty much par for the course for this genre anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crafted with all of the style and grace of a 70's TV movie, this smelly turd of bowl flotsam might be an interesting movie in about 100 years, as the movie that first featured the new (current) Mini. I urge you to wait.Besides time capsule value, there is nothing else to recommend it.Perhaps the producers thought Donald Sutherland and Ed Norton would give their movie gravitas; boy were they wrong. I hope they got paid well, cos this is something they are sure to leave off the C.V.Perhaps the producers were tasked with making the car the star, but in heavily edited scenes which defy credulity, it does more to make a joke out of a vehicle that since this was released has quickly lost much of its luster- and I put it to you that this movie is responsible.Marky Mark breathes really convincingly, but doesn't have more than one sentence of dialogue in any scene, leaving one to wonder if his lines were cut back- cos he's barely in the movie. Conspicuous by his presence, he _appears_ in most of the scenes, but you start to notice he adds nothing, and lets the others around him carry the weight. Since he is male lead, top-billed, it is odd when you, as a viewer, notice he simply does not pull his weight and decides to sleep walk through his ordeal and get that paycheck. One cannot help but wonder 'what is the deal?' Based on his 'work' here, I can't see much of a future for him as an actor in movies.Nobody plays a weasel like Norton plays a weasel, and he is at his weaselly best here. Marky Mark's anonymity is such that you want Ed to be the victor and smash him to pieces. It would have been a lot more enjoyable- and interesting- had they seen to that. I'd pay $1 to see that.So to sum it up, see something else, don't waste your hard earned $4 to rent this, you'll regret it, and wind up breaking either the teevee or the dvd, or angering your mate. Or both. Play it safe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film should never have been made as a remake, maybe a follow up or a homage but not a remake. The film itself is pretty cool, good acting cool lines delivered by a cool cast, but like most people going to see this movie, I was there to see one thing only, the mini chase. The original film really built up to the getaway at the end of the movie and had one of the best climaxes to any film, but if you're going to be holding your breath for an updated version you will be most dissapointed. The mini chase to honest was rubbish, over way too quickly with no where near as much fun and excitment as the original, and the ending of the film.............well it just ends, with no suspense or anything coming close to the originals cliffhanger, it just turns out all nice and Hollywood.My advice is, if you haven't seen the original, watch it, if you have, watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gutless, hollow remake - 40%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're probably expecting a review dripping with venom. After all, what can be more galling to an Englishman than an American remake of an iconic picture celebrating Little Britain from the swinging Sixties? In all honesty, I didn't want to watch this film at all. The only reason I did was because it came free with the original 1969 picture that I bought the other day on DVD. Shouldn't that tell you enough?Although sharing the same name (and the same cars), this film places a fresh-faced Mark Wahlberg as a new Charlie Croker. After being betrayed by colleague Edward Norton after a gold heist in Venice (not Turin), Wahlberg returns to America with revenge on his mind. Reuniting the original gang together with expert safe-cracker Charlize Theron, the gang set about reclaiming their ill-gotten gains. But as in the original, getting the gold is easy. Getting away with it proves a little trickier...Once I'd finally forgotten about the Self-Preservation Society, this film became a little easier to watch without spitting up bile. The whole thing is undeniably stylish, screaming coolness in your face. But the effect was lost on me and the film was just an over-long heist flick. Away from the action, the film badly slows down and almost becomes "Mission Impossible" as computer hacking and spying became the order of the day. The acting is passable, though Edward Norton cannot be taken seriously with that facial hair. Maybe he needs a white cat to stroke but he just felt like someone trying too hard to be evil. Wahlberg seems as blank as a sheet of paper, hardly befitting of a hero in any film except "Robocop".The second half, like the original, is much better but this is down almost purely to the cars. It's fantastic to watch those Minis thrash about in downtown LA like nothing else, although I can't imagine people ignoring them when they're parking in the street - correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think Mini Coopers are that common across the Atlantic. The ending, so good in the original, is just dull and slightly confusing as Ukranian gangsters get involved for some reason. And all the time, I kept thinking about Michael Caine saying "Hold on lads... I've got an idea..."Everything that made the original a classic has been taken away. It's not just about the cars or the chase. The original had real humour, a sense of what it meant to be British at that time. It had probably the greatest cliff-hanger (literally) of all time. It had a charismatic lead and a strong supporting cast. This "Italian Job" insults the memory of the original and really shouldn't be using the name. It is to the original what "Simba's Pride" is to "The Lion King" - a cheap and easy rip-off of a great original. Americans will view this film as an enjoyable and fast-paced action thriller. Brits like myself will cry real tears at this travesty. Sorry but this film did not exactly blow my bloody doors off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 1969 film offered something different. Set mostly in Turin-Italy the film is about a group of clumsy English villains who set out to grab a stash of gold bullion during transit. They find themselves up against it with both the Mafia and the Italian authorities. Much of the film is very typically British from the cast and their accents to the Austin Mini cars (red, white and blue with GB stickers on the back!).This is one of the few films I can think of that doesn't have a happy ending but it does have the feel good factor and an excellent cliff hanger to boot. When viewed today it obviously lacks some of the refinements we have come to expect from the typical Hollywood blockbuster, some of the acting and camera shots are laughable. However 35 years on it still hold it's own and has many merits including...Good music Lovely cars 60's Fashion Stunning backdrops Good stunts Original and plausible plot Memorable cliff hangerA very British film with plenty of character 8/10The new film is very different to the original movie. In fact most of the good features that the original had going for it were lost. In it's place is a blatant marketing exercise for the new BMW mini mixed in with some good but uninspiring action sequences. The new film starts in Italy but then moves to the U.S. which for me misses the point slightly. I found that the plot involving the traffic light control method used in the new film to be rather geeky and unbelievable at best (another feature that worked better in the old film).Despite it's faults the film contains some nice action sequences and is watchable (although one viewing is more than enough).If I hadn't already seen it all before, by itself this might be a great film. However I have and this isn't. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well,I got what I was hoping for. First the good stuff about movie. Story was quite satisfying to me.. I really like the section of movie up to part where Steve betrays his comrades (maybe even to the point where Charlie presents his crew to Stella),it was really promising,it was dead serious,and thats how I like my thrillers and action movies,there was no too much silliness about it,which was great. Movie kept my attention,plot was constant,there were no points in movie where I was asking myself why these scenes exist.. First robbery was interesting,quite original. I was kind of sad that it was Norton who played the bad guy,I was hoping he'd stay in the crew as one of good guys because I wanted to see more of him,but ironically,I did see more of him because he was the villain. Liked the dialog between Steve and Charlie when they meet for first time after sell out.And now,for bad stuff. The movie didn't keep its seriousness.. The scene where Mark talks to Stella on how his crew member got their nicks I understood what is the top reach of this movie. Some scenes were accompanied with music that also gave them a cheesy tone,one of them when Stella is trying out the mini,there were more.. Also,one blunder plot-wise.. Robbing your fathers murderer for revenge,seriously ? Thats kind of weak.. Whatever happened to characters like Neil from Heat,who chooses to kill the snitch instead of going to airport with his sweetheart and starting new life in New Zealand.. Did we lose edge compare to 90s ? I think so. Oh yeah,almost forgot,the Napster anecdote gets old after a third time.. Also,the ending is also cheesy.. Botom line is,if you want to make a good action movie,don't try to be too funny and silly about it,if people are looking the movie for laughs,they'll watch comedy instead,be serious,thats what most of new movies are missing.Anyway,movie deserves 7.5,it was interesting,it was a bit better than average but not for 8 thats for sure,entertaining,actors did their thing,none of them failed,even the Mark Wahlberg who I cant stand was quite bearable,its a cool flick,but nothing thats gonna mark a cinema history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as heist/crime/action films go, this one isn't bad and is worth a watch on a Sunday evening, after tea. It's full of action and enough silliness to keep it entertaining.What does suck though is the title. This movie should have never, ever been called the Italian Job. It's practically sacrilege to the original, to give it this moniker and to give the lead character the name of Charlie Croker.Anyone for 'The life of Brian 2' starring Jim Carrey and set in downtown New Yoik? Thought not...The only other gripe, and it's a personal, picky crime, (that not only this movie is guilty of), is when will movie makers get the sound right on motorbikes? IT'S A TWIN CYLINDER DUCATI FFS! I don't expect the exact replica sound to come ringing through my TV, but for crying out loud, a twin engined bike should sound like a twin, not a bloody R1. It's like removing the sound of an elephant and replacing it with a lion. Slap-dash sound editing.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Remake Of A Heist Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job is a heist film directed by F. Gary Gray. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Donald Sutherland. It is a remake of the 1969 film of the same title and it is about a team of thieves who plan to steal gold from a former associate who double-crossed them.Charlie is the mastermind of a daring Venice heist and overseen by John, a lifelong criminal who plans to retire from the fold with the earnings from his most recent take. Basking in the glow of a job well done at a secluded retreat in the Alps, the thieves -- including the aptly-named Handsome Rob, tech-geek Lyle, and hearing-impaired quipster Left Ear are ruthlessly double-crossed by one of their own, the taciturn, calculating Steve Frezelli. Time passes and each member of the group finds himself pursuing other opportunities in the States, until Charlie rallies them together for a revenge-motivated scheme designed to bilk Steve of all his misbegotten earnings. In order to cinch the deal, he even enlists John's reluctant safecracking-prodigy daughter, Stella, for an elaborate, incognito Los Angeles heist. But the paranoid Steve proves himself to be one step ahead of them at just about every turn, and Charlie finds that he'll have to make some daring last-minute changes to their plan if the team is to succeed.F. Gary Gray has crafted a fun summer film packed with action, comedy, and a talented ensemble cast.Also,it offers some agreeably mindless fun in which the villains are truly villainous, the payback is satisfying in a purely infantile way, and the familiarity of everything is oddly comforting.Overall,it was an entertaining film thanks mainly to the charismatic cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm, the Italian Job makes an exciting start....and...and...and...sigh! Can't think of anything else.What really hit me about this movie is how they wasted talent of actors like Charlize Theron &amp; Edward Norton. Even presence of action stars like Mark Wahlberg &amp; Jason Statham. What a casting coup! Looks like their a** was kicked in a bloodless coup :pIt's a heist story, expectedly you've our daring thieves doing whatever it takes to steal millions of dollars worth gold bricks. Although the entire movie is shot in a racy way, there's nothing really adrenaline-rushing about the action. Mark's character mocks at Norton's character for no imagination. Let me add to that. I felt the entire flick was devoid of much imagination. Everything our thieves did looked unconvincingly easy, like Seth Green's character Lyle changing traffic signals for his buddies as &amp; when he wants.All the performances were fine. But like I said, it was cringing to see all that talent not utilised to full potential. Charlize Theron just looks hurt all the time, Norton keeps a slightly cocky look always, Wahlberg has hardly any action except to smirk at Norton's plans and our Jason Statham is utterly wasted with no opportunity for a punch or a kick. He's just a good driver for the gang. Sheesh!I'd still give points because although Italian Job is not a creatively done action story, it's still good. And also, thanks to the charisma of all our actors, it is watchable.Verdict: Sexy thieves but a boring Italian job :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are remakes and then there are remakes. At one extreme is Gus Van Sant's recent shot-for-shot version of Hitchcock's "Psycho", not so much a remake as a carbon copy. At the other extreme you would have something like the Robert de Niro/Sean Penn "We're No Angels", officially a remake of a Humphrey Bogart comedy from the fifties but having virtually nothing in common with it beyond the title and a storyline about escaped convicts.The 2003 "Italian Job" comes somewhere in the middle, although perhaps nearer to the "We're No Angels" end of the scale. Like its British namesake from 1969 it is a heist film about a bullion robbery. It keeps the names of some of the characters and part of it is set in Italy. It features a complicated plot to steal the gold involving the modern version of the Mini Cooper, a piece of product placement quite as blatant as that in the original film. The plot, however, is quite different; there is, for example, no equivalent of the famous "cliff-hanging" ending.In this version Charlie Croker and most of his gang are American rather than British, although there is one Englishman among them, played by Jason Statham. This is perhaps unsurprising; the film was, after all, made by an American studio, Paramount Pictures, although given that the original was never a great success in the States I am surprised that Hollywood showed any interest in remaking it. There are in fact two robberies featured in the film, the first taking place in Venice where Croker and his gang succeed in stealing a large amount of gold and making their getaway in speedboats in a sequence doubtless inspired by a similar one in the James Bond film "Moonraker". Unfortunately, one of the gang, Steve, betrays his colleagues, shooting one, John Bridger, dead and making off with the gold himself. (Bridger, older and more experienced than the rest of the gang, is the rough equivalent of his namesake played by Noel Coward in the 1969 film, although unlike that character he is not currently serving a jail sentence).Croker and his surviving comrades swear to get revenge by stealing the gold back from Steve. In this they have the assistance of Bridger's beautiful daughter Stella, a character with no equivalent on the original film, which had no major female characters. Stella has inherited her father's skills as a safe cracker, although unlike him she has hitherto only used those skills for lawful purposes, using them to assist the police. Her desire for revenge on her father's murderer, however, leads her to throw her lot in with Croker. (Inevitably, the two fall in love). The rest of the film tells how the team manage to double-cross Steve, retrieve the loot and make their getaway through the streets of Los Angeles in a trio of Mini Coopers.As in the original, the three cars are red, white and blue, but here no patriotic significance attaches to those colours. The original film was markedly nationalistic in tone- the message seemed to be "We Brits may no longer have an empire, but we are still better at stealing things than Johnny Foreigner"- but, fortunately, the remake does make similarly jingoistic claims on behalf of the American criminal fraternity. Nor does it replace "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" on the soundtrack with "America the Beautiful" or "The Star-Spangled Banner".Because the two films are so different in terms of plot, it is difficult trying to compare them. In the end I gave both the same average mark because I did not enjoy either very much, although I disliked them for different reasons. The 1969 version is marked by a certain amount of originality, and has two charismatic stars in Coward and Michael Caine, although I dislike the nasty xenophobia which lurks just below the surface veneer of smug patriotism.The 2003 version is at least free of xenophobic tendencies (something one cannot say about all recent American films), but has little except its connection to its famous predecessor to distinguish it from a morass of similar movies. Apart from Donald Sutherland who gets killed early on, none of the cast displays any charisma, least of all Mark Wahlberg who replaces Caine as Croker. As usual, Charlize Theron looks better than she acts, and I was surprised to see Edward Norton, an actor I normally associate with more intellectual fare than this, as Steve. (Apparently he was obliged to take the part for contractual reasons). As with the original, most of the interest lies in the action sequences, especially the getaway, but overall but this is little more than a standard-issue heist movie. 5/10</fullReview>

But i do admit that it was better than expected i will give the producers and writers a pat on the back because mainly when Hollywood remake a classic British film it is awful but this beats the average remake, I liked the cast even though i'm usually not to fond of most of them though like Mark Whalberg even though he seems like a nice guy i just think he makes to many poor choices and he same for Charlize Theron i think she's talented and very pretty i think a she has quite a long list of bad choices but i liked them both in this.Overall-I found it better the than expected i taught the acting and writing were very good and the way they make the truck "Disappear" gives two thumps up from me. But it lacks the humour and action of the original.I am relieved they didn't ruin "You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off" none of the cast could have pulled it off better than Sir Michael Caine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Italian Job" nails down all the elements of a fun, modern heist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Italian Job" is a great getaway film and we're not just talking about robbery getaways. This movie never bores and is solely focused on action, technology and crime strategy lore, moving along at a brisk pace and giving the bare amount of drama to provide fuel for its characters and story line. It's a 110 minute vacation that has all its bases covered, delivering a smooth ride with little to no chinks. While it may be a remake that doesn't really improve on the original, it successfully defines itself in a modern context as a fun heist flick.The film takes us straight to Italy for a job being done by well-acquainted accomplices. There's the mastermind John (Donald Sutherland), his protégé Charlie (Mark Wahlberg), the odd explosives expert named Left Ear (Mos Def), the trying-to-be-cool hacker (Seth Green), the lady's man driving expert Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) and the inside guy (Edward Norton). This is a pretty good ensemble with a wide array of talents. Wahlberg doesn't carry this film and that's how it should be. It's a very "Ocean's Eleven" style formula, but director F. Gary Gray gives this film its own more relaxed vibe, limiting the comparisons.The job is successful, but after the getaway, Norton's character goes rogue and takes the loot for himself. He retreats to California and the guys plan to get it back, with the help of Charlize Theron. The rest of the film they devise their plans and execute them, with the script incorporating character development into those scenes. Still, it's not particularly dialogue heavy and no moments ever lag.This is not a very flashy heist film like "Ocean's Eleven." The action and car chases are much more subdued, with little gunfire and no extravagant crashes or explosions. It's not going to wow you, unless you're a 30-year-old single woman who loves Mini Coopers, but it's definitely creative. The elements of the heist will interest you if you're into that whole crime strategy stuff, though there's no unforeseeable twists. Best of all, the drama is minimal and not distracting from the film's objective of pure entertainment.So "Italian Job" doesn't exactly raise the bar with action/heist films, but it understands the genre and knows how to deliver it the right way, providing exactly the kind of entertainment one would expect watching this kind of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TIJ carries the stigma of being a remake. Well, anyone who has seen the original and carries fond memories, would sit thru the movie comparing the two and usually there is only one loser in such a comparison.If someone would look at this movie in isolation. This movie has done a fantastic "job" in completing this remake.Ed Norton is a bit ordinary in this movie - which was the only surprise for me. An actor of his caliber had opportunity and capability to add more depth or shades to this role. Fine.. ignore Ed Norton the actor.. it's still an entertaining movie.I'll give it 8/10 for sheer entertainment, pace and updating the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Plot than 1960's version - And shows off Minis Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it that the film starts off at a modern pace, establishes characters, and gets moving right away. The story unfolds at a friendly speed with a few interesting features thrown in, including meaningful dialogue between a man and a woman that is not a lame seduction scene. Sometimes, an all-star cast becomes frustrated by the inability of big stars to work unselfishly as an ensemble, but this film provides a satisfying exception and example of how it can be done right. The 1969 Caine version has little to offer in the way of complications and subplots, which this update rectifies with flair, while maintaining an excellent standard in unique car chase elements. It is an action flick, however, and does play a little loose with scientific verities, such as how long a person can survive at a low body temperature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Norton's worst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although we have a couple of overrated idiot actors as stars in this promising film, I was sure that it could be made up for with the brilliance of Ed Norton. I was a little bit wrong. Although Norton is a great actor, it seems that he half-assed his way through this movie. It just seemed that he didn't put in full emotion for his character in the ways that he has always done with his previous work. So, now we have a great actor half-assing his way through a movie with a few overacting imbeciles. That doesn't look good.This movie isn't great by any means, but it's not horrible. Although good acting wasn't primarily on this movie's side, it had a few intriguing scenes. Seeing these guys come up with a plan for thieving gold and following through with the robbery and getaway was really cool. The action, although rarely seen, was pretty good.However, lame and overused comic relief helped bring the enjoyment factor down quite a bit. I kid you not when I tell you that Seth Green used the same joke about a hundred or so times throughout the course of the movie. It wasn't really that funny the first time, and the more I heard it, the more I wanted to burst through the wall behind me and strangle the guy sitting behind the projector for showing me such garbage. I was just like 'Okay. Yeah, you said that. Okay. Hey, you used that one already. Okay, I get it. I get it now. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Stop. No, stop. Please, Seth, stop! SETH! SETH!!! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!' Needless to say, towards the end of the movie my sanity was nearly lost because of how repetitive it was to hear the same joke over and over as if it's really supposed to be funny or something.It doesn't really stop there, either. It seemed that there were more attempts at comedy than there actually were action scenes. Rarely was it actually funny. Comic relief is a necessity in any type of movie, but there are certain limits that the writer of this film was not aware of. This included lame segments like each of the characters having childhood flashbacks of them doing something mischievous and cartoonish as a kid. I felt that it just made the movie satirical.If I were the director, I would have removed some of the boring, unnecessary dialogue scenes and comic relief as well as re-casted. Aside from those flaws, the movie is actually decent. It's worth your time to watch if you are interested in seeing people perform such extravagant heists. However, I think that if I'm walking through the video store in the future looking for something to watch, this movie's tag shall remain on the shelf. One time was enough for me.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They are greedy pricks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the car chase and boat chase was interesting, it doesn't keep the story tight.Now I'm all for action, and car chases too...but in order to justify their anger, they put thousands of lives at risk just to get even.In order for this team to complete their goal, they had to cause major destruction and heartache to thousands of people that have no involvement into their personal lives.Do the other folks who are hindered in traffic due to car accidents and traffic pileups and road constrictions share any of the gold? NO! Do the people injured in the vehicle accidents have to deal with problems resulting from the accident? YES! Now people's lives are thrown of course, their insurance rates go up. Their personal problems are increased and they just wanted to carry on with their simple lives that had nothing to do with anybody else's gold or murder.Do people going late to work have to deal with problems due to being held up in the subway or traffic? Yes, they do...but how are they to know why all this trouble for them came about? They don't...but it affects many many people who should not be affected due to greed...and that is what is was all about.If the team wanted to get even with this guy...there are thousands of ways to do so without disrupting the entire traffic flow and emergency system of the city.They were selfish and greedy and stupid...all while trying to look cool.So with Charlize at the wheel and some few chases which were pretty awesome...the rest of the story is pathetic.The moral? It's OK to screw somebody over as long as you disrupt everybody else's life in order to get what you want.This story got lost after 25 minutes and somehow the writer thought that to make it interesting, he had to cause major havoc and destruction.You'll make your own judgment...My votes are for Charlize and the cars...the plot is thin...Now there is to be a second film made...why? They got away with 27 million dollars. Is that not good enough? Whya re they so greedy? I found this repulsive overdone Hollywood mentality garbage with pretty scenery blended in to make it easy to swallow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job was a really good movie. I liked how there was action with a little bit of comedy here and there. Mark Wahlberg is a really good actor and Seth Green and Charlize Theron. The plot was very original and really interesting. I was nearly jumping up and down at the end of the movie because of the suspense in the end. Everything was done really well. I am excited to see The Brazilian Job which is coming out in 2006. I will definitely watch it. It is probably going to be just as good as The Italian Job or maybe even better. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I was really impressed when I saw the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really dislike re-makes, I can't think of many which are any good and any which are better than the originals, so I have to admit I avoided seeing this at the cinema and rented it out with at least a partial expectation of being able to write a cutting review. I thought it would be a doubly cutting review because I could minutely (and dis-favourably) compare it to the "original" which I think is an excellent film.Here's the problem: I thoroughly enjoyed the film.Within minutes I realised that the film is not a "re-make" but a different take on a basic idea of a clever robbery using cars to make a getaway.I've even got to the stage where I think I understand why it's called the Italian Job. To make the same film with a different name would lead to cries of plagiarism for the use of the basic getaway idea. Using the same name freely acknowledges the origin of the idea but lets the story be told differently.So OK, enough with the theorising; Why is it a good film? Well, like the original it's fast paced, clever and witty, there are good lines for all the characters. The characters have motivation which makes their actions logical and enough emotion that you care what happens to them and want them to succeed. I think I'd have to be honest and say that I felt the relationships between the characters were more enjoyable than the original, but this is simply a reflection of the fact that Michael Caine was such a huge star that he dominated the original. Mark Wahlberg may not be the greatest actor but for the purposes of this film he works well, allowing the rest of the cast to create the idea that it is a team effort, and it's a good team, Charlize Theron is smart and good looking, Mos Def and Seth Green generate some good laughs and Jason Statham is ? well he's an actor that can make a success out of "Transporter", yes he really does have that much presence.As for the robberies? In my mind they are every bit as clever as that of the original. I found myself on the edge of my seat during both, not only that but you get two robberies not one!So I'm disappointed to have to say that I enjoyed this, it may not be a "great" movie but it's good entertainment, it's totally different to the original (which I do feel is a better, but different film), it's out on DVD and well worth the rental and it's made me eat my words.Bah Humbug.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original or anything but I have seen this and I got to say ? it is more interesting than I thought. Really, I thought it going to be just another heist movie like Ocean Eleven or something.Anyway this is interesting and better casting (as: they all really suit for their role). The characters are very well distributed and there no left out make you feel very assuring watching it. Seth Green was hilarious and very convincing, also Charlize look at her best.The good thing was this movie has very believable action scenes ? like the car chase, helicopter chase, boats chase and best of all it not overly done. Maybe also the changes of different places make this movie more interesting.So next time if you have doubt what heist movie to rent from the video store, I say this is it. Unless you were looking for rated R type with all bullets flying around and people kicking and screaming, this isn't it.Recommendation: Good Heist Movie, Overall.Rating: 6.5/ 10 (Grade: C+) Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It - Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second version of the 1969 classic with similar race cars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture narrates as a motley thieves group whose mastermind(Donald Sutherland and Mark Wahlberg)are gathering specialists(Seth Green,Mos Def,Jason Statham,Edward Norton) to pull off and execute a caper in Venice attempting to rob gold bullion's ;but they are betrayed by one member.Then they contract to a safe cracker expert(Charlize Theron).Posteriorly there's a second caper developed in US where the bunch tries steal the gold bars of the former.The film blends tense,action packed,comedy,emotion,suspense and is pretty entertained and bemused. The original movie was majority developed in Italy(Turin) and here the setting is in Venice and US (L.A.). There are wild chases galore with impressive velocities pursuits cars and with the famous cars copied of previous movie making varied and spectaculars bounds and leaps by the streets,undergrounds and canals. There's a clever twist ending as happen generally in those films about perfects heists. Interpretation actors is nice. Mark Wahlberg is cool,Charlize Theron's delightful performance plus of enticing and attractive.The humor moments are in charge of Seth Green. The film will like to the winner Oscar Charlize Theron fans and hold up genre enthusiastic. Rating:Highly recommended.Worthwhile seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a patch on the original, but not bad entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was biased to this movie from the announcement of production. I mean a film that is touted not as a remake, but as being influenced by the original and truly wonderful Italian Job, immediately struck me as another idiotic Hollywood idea. My feelings were twisted even more when I heard that the heist in the new movie was happening in LA, so what was with the title? You've pretty much guessed that at this point I thought very little of the movie, had I known Donald Sutherland was in it then some of my respect may have been won back, but I didn't.In the interests of my movie reviews, I was determined to see it, after all even if it was awful it needed to be seen. So I rented the DVD and began to watch. I was surprised. To be fair Sutherland carries all of the movie he's in, and Mark Wahlberg struggles to get anything near acting while he's on screen with him, his mumbling monotone voice fumbling embarrassingly through their scenes. It's only until Sutherland is off screen that Wahlberg begins to gather some acting talent back.However most of the cast still seem like they're walking through it. Even Edward Norton seems to tackle this with a half hearted gesture. To be honest there are two people who really stand out in this movie, and that's Jason Statham and, believe it or not, Seth Green. They're both lively and watchable characters. The others appear flat and emotionless.That's not to say it's an enjoyable movie, in the entertainment sense it's quite fun. Some of the heist moves are set up well, and the stunts are particularly good, mainly because of the effort put in by the behind the scenes team to make them all as real as possible and try to avoid any special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The motion picture is rather entertaining; your credibility standards mustn't be so high if you wanna appreciate it and you gotta expect something equivalent to a light novel, but on the whole I would say it's nice and enjoyable. There are many fast-paced action sequences in a gracious plot; less commercials, especially all those Mini ads, would have made this robber's film distinguish itself from others of the same genre, but due to its engaging characters and to its light humor, it gets to be quite riveting. Mark Wahlberg demonstrates its ability in the role whereas I did find Edward Norton wasted in that role. Lastly, Charlize Theron is even more beautiful than anybody imagined she would be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>F. Gary Gray directs this rehash of a 1969 Michael Caine project of the same name. A group of expert criminal nice-guys led by career crooks Charlie Croker(Mark Wahlberg)and John Bridger(Donald Sutherland)successfully pull off the heist of $35 million in gold bricks in Venice. A crooked partner Steve Frezelli(Edward Norton)gets greedy and swindles the others out of their shares by hijacking the heist and leaving them for dead. They actually survive except for Bridger who is murdered in cold blood.A year later Frezelli is living in a Los Angeles mansion whole heartedly believing that money damn sure talks. Charlie convinces John's safe-cracker expert daughter Stella(Charlize Theron)to help the crew steal the gold back. The movie seems to get better and really picks up the pace with mini Coopers racing through an engineered Los Angeles monster traffic jam. A clever finale is avenging and brings redemption.Wahlberg is lost in his own definition of cool. Norton could have phoned in his part. Mos Def could use a diction tutor. And for the beautiful Theron...my heart somersaults in my chest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The all star cast include Mark Wahlberg who stars as Charlie Croker. His crew of thieves are made up of Donald Sutherland, Jason Statham, Seth Green and Edward Norton. Sutherland stars as John Bridger, released from prison but still on parole. It used to be him in charge of whatever robberies were planned but now he has handed the baton to Charlie. Charlie has planned this heist to perfection, which is shown in action for us all to see. Using the talents of each member of his team to their best, the team take home the $35 million of gold bullion they were after with Bridger cracking the safe, Steve (Norton) providing access to it, Lyle (Green) using his computer skills to map the building perfectly, Left Ear ? blowing up what is necessary and Handsome Rob (Statham) being a brilliant getaway driver.The job goes perfectly but with one flaw ? someone on the team decides that 35 million divided one way is a lot more and therefore at the earliest opportunity before everyone goes their separate ways they take the lot, killing Bridger in the process. One year later and we see Bridger's daughter Stella (South African stunner Charlize Theron) breaking into a safe for the police. She is self employed as a safe cracker, for legitimate businesses instead of the less than legitimate people her father did business with. She also drives an original Mini, like an insane rally driver. Croker meets with her after finding the person that stole the gold and killed her father and convinces her to join their team to get the money back.It's an enjoyable Capper flick and is well worth checking out. Not in the same league as Oceans Elleven, or The Whole Nine Yards!</fullReview>

I have seen to many heist films in the states, not to mention Los Angelas heist. "Heat", which I consider a classic heist movie was about the last great heist film for the U.S. Oceans Eleven was good too but not like HEAT. No offense to Seth Green fans, but he got really annoying. Other than this, the film was good. The cinematography could have been better too, but what do you do? I giver it a 7 rating. The film is good for racing fans and Mark Whalberg people but if you don't like these people than I suggest a different movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a successful theft of 35 million dollars in gold, Wahlberg's team is betrayed by one of their own, who tries to kill them and take the gold for himself. They must then try and steal the gold back and get revenge.The Italian Job (haven't seen the original) is a slick, and entertaining action comedy. Of course, it's not so much of a thinking man's movie, but pure popcorn entertainment. Thankfully it's not quite as dumb as most of those films are. There are little things throughout the film that gives a little bit of extra spice.The cast is good, having fun with their likable, albeit rather clichéd, characters. The biggest dud, however, is Wahlberg who simply can't bring any life or interesting features to the screen. A more charismatic lead would have been better.At two hours, the film is a bit too long. Especially the middle part that drags on for some time without really getting anywhere. Of course, the main reason for this film being made is the car chases (or blatant product placement). If you're really in to cars doing impossible stuff at high speeds, then you'll probably like it more than me (car chases are one of the most boring things you can put in a film), although these scenes are a bit less annoying than usual.The film looks great and technically there's not much to complain of. The biggest problem comes towards the end, when all that better-than-average writing is ditched in favour of stupid action and gaping plot holes. This happens in so many films that I'm starting to wonder if there's some secret organization out there, stealing the final reels of big budget films and messing them up on purpose... Anyway, it's a decent film that could have been better, so give it a try if you want. [5/10]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catharsis with a wrecking ball ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched The Italian Job (2003). It was a fun kind of movie which featured 2 brutal murders and promised a gruesome finale for Edward Norton in the bowels of an automobile crushing machine ... Whilst he's being carted off by angry Ukranians, the music swells and our heroes laugh merrily. We even get to see them enjoying their money as the end credits roll, in amusing vignettes.The good guys (and girl) triumph and the villain gets his comeuppance. But does the prospect of an horrific death really offer catharsis in a 'caper' film where car chases visibly result in nothing more than a few cuts and bruises? I'm willing to concede I might have missed the point but still feel that when attractive characters are required to act cool and appear witty in the name of revenge, it makes 'switching off' much harder to enjoy? Thanks for an 'entertaining' film nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest aberration of this re-make was the glaring omission of the 1969 'computer expert' Professor Peach, played by the late great Benjamin Hill. One of Hill's greatest cinematic roles, he fleshes out this Jekyll and Hyde character with masterful aplomb. Peach, the egg-headed pederast with an unhealthy penchant for the clinically obese female is a perfect counterbalance to Noel Coward's pompous and aloof Mr Bridger. To prepare for the role, Hill travelled to Turin six months ahead of filming in 1969 and narrowly escaped prosecution on a number of occasions thanks to Italy's then rather lax laws on gross indecency. I often wonder who would have best filled Benjamin's filthy boots in the 2003 remake: Marlon Brando? Orlando Bloom in a fat suit? Perhaps Garry Shandling? My own choice would have been the British comic and satirist Stephen Fry. Surely one of cinematic history's greatest what-ifs?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but pretty adolescent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a heist movie. I am fine with heist movies but they have to be ironic (like Ocean's Eleven). After all we watch thieves and in the case of The Italian Job we watch pretty adolescent thieves taking what they do much too serious. Heist movies are to be about stealing something in a very elaborate and cool way, not about very deep emotional problems. So this film here mixes cool, state-of-the-art technological stealing and a revenge story. And Edward Norton's villain is much too mean, he destroys the ironic heist story. It is the same problem with the James Bond movies: it is pretty tasteless to see Bond tortured. Bond is supposed to be a comic strip hero, not really serious. Because if you take the characters in this movie serious you want to sink them all in prisons to teach them a lesson how to behave in the world of adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've yet to see the original film, so I don't know if this is an improvement on or detriment to it...but this was an okay movie unto itself. The capers were quick and a bit ridiculous, but not so much so that they weren't involving. F. Gary Gray kept the action going fast enough to where you could ignore the plot-holes and occasional stupidity of the characters. It sure did LOOK good and had that technical polish we've come to expect of modern American chase movies.But...I don't know how to say this, but the film was like...I dunno, like a helium balloon that's four days old. It still floats, but hasn't got the happiness a fresh balloon has. And I can't really fault the director, this time; he did better than journeyman work and had some really flashy moments. And the writers...well...they didn't try to get away with all that much dumb or irritating stuff, unlike some other thrillers have tried. It's mainly the performances.Oh, Donald Sutherland was letter perfect, as usual, and Seth Green can do no wrong in my eyes. But while Mark Wahlberg handled his lines well enough, he seemed like a kid. Edward Norton, who has done some powerful work in the past, seemed even more like a kid. Mos Def seemed like a kid. Charlize Theron seemed like she was only there to make sure the guys came across as straight. But not one of them had any heft or danger or threat to their actions, despite the punches and doublecrosses and threats and gunplay. Even at the end, when Edward Norton is facing his inevitable end, he seemed more peeved than anything else. The fact is, aside from Sutherland and Green -- who carried more weight when he was mimicking "Handsome Rob" than when Jason Statham was mimicking himself -- the most convincing performances were turned in by the Minis. And that is sad.Compare this film to "The Bourne Identity" or even "Speed" and you can see how lightweight the acting in it is. That's not to say it's not a fun movie...it's just nothing more. And that's what makes it forgettable. Too bad; them Minis deserved better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The Italian Job' is not based on the documentary of my favorite restaurant Pauloluigi. Hey Paulo! Free plug there! What about sponsoring my weekly movie review show? Anyway, `The Italian Job' stars Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker, a renegade brigand who is on a vengeance journey against a former colleague who violently betrayed him. We have experienced this plot development before numerous times, so that is why I feel they should have changed the title of this film to `The Battalion Job'. Yes, the same old redundant premise of a protagonist seeking revenge to a former friend who is now a present foe. Charlize Theron co-stars as Stella Bridger, the safe breaker who joins up the Marky Mark `Steeler' team. Even though it is a safe bet to say that Charlize looks hot, her work here was a dull &amp; unchallenging one. Obviously, unlike her daring Oscar-winning performance in `Monster'. Edward Norton disappoints here as Steve, the bad boy nemesis. However, I must state that `The Italian Job' does present a marvelous exhibition of product placement. Which product you ask? As if you did not know; let's just say, we will call it: `Mini-Cooper'. These stylish transports will drive you crazy to purchase one. `The Italian Job' had plenty of pasta but was a bit cheesy.

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much from this film when I settled down to watch it.Hey, come on. It was a modern remake of one of the most famous British crime films of all time which STARRED one of the most famous British crime actors of all time; Michael Caine. However, I was proved wrong and I'm glad that I was.The ball is set in motion very impressively in the city of Venice when the gang and main actors attempt to rob some gold. One of the actors in this case was Jason Statham who played the character of 'Handsome Rob' I enjoyed his performances in two other great films of 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock' and he gives another great performance here as well. Each character has a certain uniqueness about them and we really seem to 'get to know them' as the film wears on.Impressive stunts and chases, madcap ideas in the form of manipulating L.A's traffic light system AND quite a few moments where you just can't work out what'll happen next or what'll happen now that a certain event HAS just happened. Each scene there is something new and unique about it that was different to the last scene. Something happens that moves the plot along. Something is either said or done by one of the characters that will make you either chuckle or continue watching with interest, something that I can only praise the scriptwriters for.I thought this new version of The Italian Job was well worth the money and the time spent watching it. It was an enjoyable film with some good acting, good action and a good, strong plot. Nothing better than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised to see Donald Sutherland make his appearance. It was even better when I realized they were high tech scoundrels. Being a high tech geek, I can really relate. The "Italian Job" was just to wet your taste buds and the movie just got better as it went on. High speed chases, ingenious plans, minimal violence make this movie enjoyable from the get go.Donald Sutherland does a great job as the father figure. His maturity and knowledge show through. Mark Wahlberg does a wonderful job in playing the up and coming new leader of the gang. The supporting characters are wonderful in the respect that they show their young leader. Each one of the "gang" has their own expertise. They do their jobs well. The plot has a wonderful mix of action, humor and intrigue. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Caper Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of the 1969 movie The Italian Job has something in it for everyone. Very unique for a caper flick such as this. A gang of thieves who start a heist in the Italian alps get sidetracked by a rival gang and it's a race to the finish! This film has action, humor, romance, drama, filmed in exotic locations, and an awesome car chase! The Italian Job is sure to keep anyone on the edge of their seat! The best characters were played by Seth Green and Charlize Theron.  I would suggest this remake to the original. It's not very often that remakes are better than the original, and The Italian Job takes the cake. Highly recommended! You'll root, laugh, and cheer thoughout the whole movie! Great to watch with friends and family on a Friday Night. Great acting and a powerful script. Best movie of 2003! Rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An explosive expert, a computer genius, a premier wheelman and a guy with a plan. All with only one ultimate goal: get the gold from the guy who killed their (spiritual) father.The movie starts in beautiful Venice, where someone package a silver necklace to send it to America. John Bridger calls with his daughter Stella and after that I fell in love. Mark Wahlberg, as Charlie Croker, comes on stage, naive, contented and with a little smile on his face. Charlie, John and their cast going to steal a safe with many, many gold bar's in it. They don't use weapon's, but that won't be necessary, cause Mark made their plan. Nothing can go wrong, and practically nothing goes wrong.Up in the mountains the gangsters celebrate their victory with for everyone a bottle champagne and beautiful dreams about women and the perfect live. On the way back home - listen here careful to the music - they laugh about what they did, but they get stopped by guys who knew what the gang was doing. It ends totally wrong. Their gold gets stolen and John gets killed. They end up with nothing but wet clothes and tears...One year later - PhiladelphiaStella Bridger works as a safe technician. She's happy and contented, but that Charlie Croker comes by to tell her they found the guy who killed her father. Charlie is planning to rob that guy, called Steve Frezelli now, and to steal all his left gold bar's. First Stella doesn't want to help him, but that night, when Charlie and his wheelman-friend Handsome Rob are playing basketball, she calls Charlie to tell him she's in.Not only Stella and Charlie are in, but also Lyle, a computer genius who really invented Napster, Left-Ear, an explosive expert and Handsome Rob, a premier wheelman are part of the gang. With the newest technology our hero's can do anything they want. They open safe's without a key, making every traffic-light turn red or green and drive with mini-coopers through little subway's.The Italian Job has got everything a perfect movie needs; a good story, action, humour, great music and good looking, great actors who bring this movie to a good end. The only thing missing is a thrilling love-scene and maybe some real romance, but a little Mark Wahlberg, some Charlize Theron and a few imagination can do miracle's..!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This piece is absolutely splendid! For the very first time I actually enjoyed the role that Mark Wahlberg was playing! And with the crew of Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def and with the beautiful Charlize Theron, this just makes it all awesome! The whole piece was based on the movie with the same title from 1969, and this proves that old pieces does not have to be bad pieces (as I'm afraid too many of you out there still claims) - with some new effects and some up to date characters this could be the actual hit in the world of movies in 2003. If you like speed, quick and intelligent comments (conversations), beautiful girls and some speedy chasing, this is the piece to look at. It reminds pretty much of a Luc Besson movie, the touch and the climax of it, but with more quick comments used in movies such as "Snatch". Action! Lets go!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood loves making movies about con artists and thieves. It's a tradition, and it sure has its own place in all the movie categories. This one seems a very typical thief movie, although I have to admit I did enjoy it. The plot is well laid out and executed, though mostly predictable. Two scenes are worth mentioning, one is the "original" Italian job at the opening, the way they got the gold out of the safe under water right beneath the "job" spot; another one is the mini coupe chasing scene. The performance of all characters (including Charlize Theron who just won Ocsar for her role in "Monster") are just flat, which does not bother me at all. Keep in mind that both producers and viewers are looking for FUN here, not gripping performance. In these kind of movies, there are really not much to it towards building up characters as to telling a story.Overall, it's a movie worth watching for a good time.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** Here be spoilers **The last big heist. A former master-thief returns from retirement when the opportunity to steal a lot (and I mean a lot) of gold appears. The heist is highly successful but the group is betrayed, the gold taken and the old master-thief shot dead. Now it is time for revenge. However, the group that originally did the heist need help from the daughter of the dead thief.Unfortunately, the movie in itself fails to produce any major surprises. One can sense some possibilities for plot-twists but they are never realized. In addition, the actors do not make any award-winning performances. None is bad, in my opinion, but they do not make anything extra out of it either. This doesn't mean the movie is bad. It is really entertaining to see the spectacular solutions the have to make their heist work. The stunts is good any the plot is entertaining even if it as mentioned fails to surprise. In addition, there are at least a few nice cinematic touches (or did I invent them for myself?) one might enjoy.So, if you like heist-movies, or action in general this is a movie for you. If you really don't this is not the movie to start with to discover the genre.Personally, I enjoyed it very much...7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies about large-scale heists are just so fun to watch. After George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia thrilled with a casino heist in Ocean's Eleven, Donald Sutherland, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def steal back hundreds of bars of gold from a double-crosser in The Italian Job.Like Ocean's Eleven, The Italian Job involves extremely ambitious plans to steal. The movie starts off with an Italian job of stealing gold bars. Unfortunately one man within the team double-crosses them and makes away with the gold. John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is killed. The team enlists the help of his daughter, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), an expert safe cracker, to help them steal back the gold.The movie builds up tempo pretty well, although much of the main plot happens in the later part of the movie. The action sequences were well executed, and how they got the van into the subway was an eye-opener. The getaway seemed to easy, and the two security guards on the motorcycles were very quickly gotten rid off. Unlike Ocean's Eleven, which sprung a surprise getaway method, the rest of The Italian Job's getaway was predictable and was almost on the verge of being boring.I would say I enjoyed Ocean's Eleven more than The Italian Job. But honestly, The Italian Job is still a pretty good movie. If you haven't watched it, you should give it a try.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it was because Michael Caine turned 70 or maybe it was because there was a ?remake' of The Italian Job in cinema's around the world, but halfway the August of 2003 the BBC aired this film. That gave me a somewhat unique chance to go and see this version of The Italian Job before seeing the ?remake', since the 1969 version was not for rent or buy anyplace I could think of. Now there were basically two reasons for me to see this film, first of all because I think Michael Caine is a good actor and second of all because it is rumored to be a classic. Well I did not find this film to be a classic. Sure the car chases were well filmed (and probably spectacular for 1969), but they didn't do much for me. Neither did any of the acting or the story. Also I found the music to be quite irritating at times (especially in the applauding scene near the ending, which dragged on and on and? well you get the idea!). Nevertheless, this is not a total stinker, it just isn't anything special. If I were you I'd skip this one and see the ?remake', something I did a while after seeing the 1969 version.The thing with the ?remake' is that is actually not a remake. The only things these films have in common are the heist, the Mini's and the title. That's is. The underlying story in the 2003 is a lot better and more elaborate than the story in the 1969 version. It also leaves much more room for character development and all of that adds to the excitement of the film. Also the actors are a lot better in this film, than they were in the original. No offense to Michael Caine, but the average actor in this film, was much better than the average actor in the 1969 film of the same name, even when Edward Norton made a somewhat ?pale' performance. I hate to say it, but his character in this film, was about the worst I've seen him portray yet (which does not mean that he was bad though). Charlize Theron on the other hand surprised me a bit, with the depth and emotion she brought to her character.The action scenes were good as well and the heist(s) were very well planned, executed and filmed as well, but despite all of these good things I did not feel that this was a great film. It just lacked that extra edge and excitement at times. That extra edge, ironically is originality. Whereas this film succeeds in portraying a very original story and original heist(s), some of the characters missed a bit of originality, as did some of the dialog and a twist or two. In conclusion I'd have to say that the 2003 version of The Italian Job is not a classic, but definitely worth a look, since it is better than it's predecessor carrying the same name.The Italian Job (1969): 5 out of 10The Italian Job (2003): 7,25 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Italian Job" is a slickly made heist movie that exceeds expectations with its cleverness.The movie contains a well-proportioned amount of action and comedy. It is almost self-aware that it is a remake, but doesn't worry because it knows it has a killer cast with some strongly conceived action scenes and decent dialogue to drive along the witty plot.Edward Norton adds a lot to the entertainment with an oddly mixed muted yet over the top performance, while Mark Whalberg and the rest of the men in the gang fill out the movie nicely. In alot of action movies, these "gangs" don't work, but each actor in "Italian Job" performs their purpose well. Charlize Theron stands out as the daughter of Donald Sutherland, in an excellent casting choice.Director F. Gary Gray knows exactly what he's doing, and in many ways, this is the movie that Bruckheimer's "Gone In 60 Seconds" remake should have been.The verdict: a Hollywood heist movie the way it should be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie - Too bad Mark Wahlberg was so distracting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene at the beginning of The Italian Job that let me know I was seeing something different from the average action, heist caper. During the opening chase sequence, a boat goes flying in the air and lands aground without exploding into a great ball of Hollywood pyrotechnic fire. This may seem obscure or insignificant to most, but after viewing such biennial action films as Bad Boys II and Terminator 3 this past year, where everything including a kitchen sink was blown to pieces, it was refreshing to see an explosive opportunity passed on by such a young up-coming director. That director by the way is hit and miss F. Gary Grey who had success in 1996 and 1998 with Set It Off and The Negotiator, but came back to earth pretty hard with the gawd-awful Vin Disel vehicle, A Man Apart in 2002. To his credit, the fact that Paramount would hand the reins to such a young director to bring to the screen a remake of a Michael Caine 1969 film that is still revered by many today, is an indication of the talent he must contain. And the result, is a fun heist yarn that gives you your monies worth for two hours. The similarities to the original film are minimal. Mark Wahlberg takes over the role by Michael Caine as Charlie Croker, a thief who has assembled a team to help steal a shipment of gold stolen from them years earlier. The assembled crew all come with new cool 21st century names and talents. Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron) is the daughter of former slain crewmember John Bridger and is an expert at cracking safes. Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) is the getaway driver, Lyle (Seth Green) is the computer expert and Left Ear (Mos Def) is the explosives expert that got his name due to a botched explosion in his youth. Together, they conspire against Steve (played by Edward Norton) who assisted in the original heist then turned on his team and confiscated the gold leaving the others for dead in the frozen waters of the Italian mountains. As caper films go, The Italian Job zips along at a fast pace and keeps us entertained with its thought process on how to pull of the perfect crime. In homage to the original, there is an extended chase scene by three mini-Coopers through the Los Angeles subway system and into rush hour traffic that might not make the best of list that contains such classics as Bullit and To Live and Die in L.A., but does offer an entertainment value of exceeded expectations. All this culminates in a concluding chapter that is both enjoyable if not foreseen. The Italian Job's biggest drawback however is the incredible cardboard acting of its lead, Mark Wahlberg. Consistently the weakest link in better than average films (Three Kings, Boogie Nights), Mark falls this side of Ben Affleck as one of the worst actors that get plumb roles in new-Hollywood. On subsequent viewings of his filmography, I can't help but think of the lack of talent presently being exploited on screen to moderate success. Ashton Kutcher, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are just three more examples of why we still stand in line to see Jack Nicholson play himself over and over again in films like Something's Gotta Give. But I digress. The review in hand is The Italian Job and despite its inferior lead actor, the movie does deliver on many levels and if it's domestic box office is any indication (over $100 million), audiences tend to agree. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My son Greg gave me the deluxe Widescreen Edition DVD of 'The Italian Job.' Until I watched the extras after seeing the movie, I didn't know that an original movie of this same title was made in the 1960s. However, it was more of a comedy, and the new version is quite different. The movie starts with a job in Italy, followed by a double-cross, followed by a heist of the loot in Los Angeles. Very creative, very exciting. No lasting value, but an entertaining way to spend almost 2 hours, for Charlize Theron, if nothing else! The DVD is a very nice one, especially for those who enjoy seeing various 'making of' extras.SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, stop reading, OK!?The first heist in Venice has them creating several blasts that allow a safe with gold to fall through several floors and into the water, where the gold was extracted while a boat chase with fake safe was used as a decoy. Edward Norton plays the group member who double-crosses the others at an Austrian pass, wants the $35Million in gold bars all for himself, kills Donald Sutherland, but the others get away by driving off the bridge into the frozen lake and using breathing gear. They track the gold to L.A. where they enlist Sutherland's daughter (Theron) a legal safecracker to help them. Wise to the plot, Norton arranges three armored trucks to leave his house, one with gold, which they figure by remote measuring of rear tire compression, take control of L.A. traffic lights, cause the truck to go a certain route, a blast causes the truck to fall into the train tunnel, where with the help of red, white, and blue Cooper Minis they get the gold to a freight car and leave town, Norton is taken away by Russian friends for 'disposal.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amusing, well-made piece of fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 7.2 (out of 10)No bones about it: `The Italian Job' is through and through a studio assembled, Hollywood action movie constructed for the purpose of getting a cool trailer out and getting people to put down their hard-earned cash to see. And it's a remake no less! That transports the action to non-other than?can you guess? Hollywood, of course. Where the sun rises and sets. The difference here, however, is the modest, clear, classically styled approach to the film taken by director F. Gary Gray. His action scenes are crisp and fun - and it is all done without kung-fu fist fights, slow-motion shoot-outs, bullet-time effects, a music video director's ADHD editing-style and every other gimmick usually used to pitch this stuff. Quite a breath of fresh air. In true old-fashioned style, Gray assembles a hot all-star cast of talent, but ironically that's where the movie falters the most. The ensemble is comprised of 3 types of people: 1) Mark Wahlberg as the peak of this iceberg, exercising his wooden Keanu Reeves School of Acting abilities, 2) the stock `eccentric' sub-characters (including Jason Statham, Mos Def &amp; Seth Green) who have with some shading to them, but what development we are given is so cutesy and bubble gum I would rather have Wahlberg's style than hear Green babble about being the creator of Napster one more time. 3) usually reliable actors like hot Charlize Theron and hot Edward Norton mare the film unmercifully by sleepwalking through the entire production, only managing enough strength to keep their noses in the air the entire running time so that everyone knows they think they are better than his kind of thing. Well, that's how it looks. Honestly, what I like most about this movie is the way it takes the usual heist movie conventions out of the claustrophobic air ducts and quiet, isolated rooms and overlays them onto city streets utilizing traffic, subways, mini-coopers and crowds of screaming pedestrians. Gray plays it like a poker game with each side making their move and the events winding around so that our big hero and big villain wind up face-to-face before it's over. The ultimate effect is rather satisfying, although the movie?s payoff is weak. `The Italian Job' doesn't really thrill and Charlize doesn't wear those jeans she does on the poster, but it is light-weight, diverting entertainment fluff - and, hey, if it's well made that's not always a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made 're-invention' of the 1969 British classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn this re-working of Peter Collinson's late 60s original,the premise now has Mark Whalberg as career criminal Charlie Croker who is approached by crime boss John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) to mastermind a heist involving gold bullion.Everything goes swimmingly,until surveillance expert Steve (Edward Norton) suddenly disrupts proceedings and,as if to add truth to the old aidage that there is no honour among thieves,kills Bridger,attempts to kill the rest of the crooks and makes off with the loot for himself.One year later,and Charlie approaches John's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron,adding the real vroom-vroom factor to the movie) who has forged a successful career for herself as a security specialist,deciding not to follow in her father's footsteps as a criminal.She says she wants no part of his latest plan,until she learns of the possibility of getting her hands on a lot of gold and settling the score with Steve.At first glance,this would seem like yet another cynical,manipulative and ultimately exploitative effort by the Hollywood cookie-cutter to take a great British classic and re-make it for their own money making ends.Director F Gary Gray,however,assures us that this is in no way a remake,but a 're-invention' of the British hit.And he's telling the truth.Gray,the man behind another enjoyable hit of this year by the name of A Man Apart,has crafted a slick,stylish and fairly mesmerizing little flick,with an absorbing soundtrack and some riveting action scenes.And,like any film nowaday so it would seem,how could it go wrong with Edward Norton among the credited cast members,effortlessly stealing the show as the slimy,back-stabbing villain,oozing menace and charisma at every turn?Oh yeah,the plot kind of lacks coherence and seems to get a bit lost with itself at certain stages.And it always feels like no matter what bag of tricks it throws at us,it will never manage to be entirely the sum of it's parts.But to any devotees of one of our finest films ever,believe me,you are being in no way mislead and what could so easily have been just another derivative piece if nothing,emerges as something you will feel slightly more rewarded for having watched.***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning has style, but that does not help the rest of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: ** out of ****. The Italian Job was one of those summer movies I did not see but I heard it was good. So tonight I decided to give it a try. The result was a mediocre movie. The Italian Job opens with very stylish opening credits. It features nice cinmatography of Venice and has a clever constructed heist scene. Then it moves into snowy mountains which are also beautiful. Unfortunately, from then on it was mostly down hill. After the sylish beginning, the characters come on and we have to accept them. This is something that never happens. Why? Because the characters are not likable in the slightest. You do not care if they die. As a caper movie, Oceans Eleven was much better because the characters were all likable and had some very clever dialogue. The Italian Job occasionally has some clever dialogue but it is much less successful than Ocean's Eleven.The performances do not help either. Mark Wahlberg is stiff throughout the movie. Charlize Theron is looking beautiful and is convincing but again her character is not likable. Jason Stratham is fine, but his character is so arrogant that you can not stand him. Seth Green has his moments but hes not entirely likable either. Mos Def is good and he is pretty much the only likable character in the gang. Edward Norton is no better than ok as the villain. Donald Sutherland is good but really wasted. He is only around for a few scenes. The Italian Job is too long. It really is too long when you dont like these characters. The chase scene with the minis was overlong and not exciting. Even though I was not interested in the characters I felt the movie was hard to follow. The DVD I rented did skip(only for two minutes) but I feel it was more than that. If I was a little more interested maybe I would not have noticed. Overall, The Italian Job was not quite a failure. It is a good example of style over substance. It has some good moments but not enough for an hour and forty-five minute movie. If fifteen minutes were cut it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It combines all the worst elements of previous pointless air-head blockbuster movies (Ocean's Eleven, Gone in 60 seconds etc): 2-dimensional characters, laughable dialogue boring (but clearly expensive) stunts.I wasn't a fan of the original, but at least that film (and its cars) HAD SOME SOUL. this film is nothing more than an extended version of those BMW Mini commercials (which were far more entertaining). And what's with the obligatory stereotypical geek character changing his name to Napster halfway through the film? And what about the claim he makes about being the 'real' inventor of Napster. It's clearly nothing more than the MPAA trying to get their revenge for all then mp3s people downloaded from Napster, but it's going to backfire. Napster is now back online in legitimate form, and I think they should sue.I watched this for free on an airplane from Paris to Mexico City last month and it didn't even pass the time.</fullReview>

Actually to bad to waste such a great actor as Edvard Norton for this one. In this case not that dull movie.

You don't buy the 'remote control traffic lights' scam or the idiotic level of thinking Norton displays-and why is he alone like this, no retinue, no bodyguards, etc?-but for the time being as you watch the film, it's alright.Best parts are the trucks falling thru the streets, the racing in the tunnels, etc. It was fun seeing the Ukrainians go after Norton too. He clearly mails in his performance(contractually obligated as he was) and it shows.You will still enjoy this, a decent rental if nothing else.**1/2 outta ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing The Italian Job, we understand why Ed Norton distanced himself from this Hollywood whore, saying it was nothing more than contractual obligation that made him take part in this film.The Italian Job has the attitude, clothes, and hairstyles for a decent Mini Cooper commercial, but the this same approach stinks up a motion picture. And there is so little else here that the movie teeters on tedium at timesHollywood sure knows how to make gloss, and this picture has buckets of it. Trouble is, that gloss in large amounts becomes rancid goo. The Italian Job is sickeningly sweet from the the first scene, and pours on the glucose all through the film.Trouble is also that modern movie audiences don't seem to tell a good film from a jelly doughnut. I fear we will see more of this sort of drivel in the future.The wimpy sensitive new age relationship between the criminals is the excess that puts this movie over the top,successfully pushing it from merely mediocre, into shamefully shallow.

		<shortDescription>Average Heist Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a relatively entertaining heist movie abound with the commercial slick of Hollywood. The set pieces are suitably expensive, and the action sequences, although largely uninspired, are adequate. We don't expect great acting for a tongue-in-cheek film such as this but there are no real sparks in the interplay of the characters. The script doesn't sizzle and there really is no memorable dialogue to speak of. Edward Norton, who plays the villain, is on auto-pilot. Mark Wahlberg's performance is as charismatic as a 4 by 4 plank. The only character in the film I found entertaining was Lyle, played by Seth Green. Donald Sutherland, always a welcome sight, played little more than a cameo role?shame.The final sequences with the Minis as they career around Los Angeles was a huge disappointment and a wasted opportunity to have a car chase sequence that could've been amongst the best in the annals of cinema history. It's not like the budget wasn't there, just the creative vision and inventive impetus.On the plus side though the music was great. Graham Revell really injected some chic into the movie with his cool tunes. The film was expertly paced and managed to keep my interest from start to finish, but then that is the least we can hope for from the director of The Negotiator.All in all not bad, but not good either. Worth watching if you're stuck for something to see but I wouldn't go out of your way to catch it.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the 1969 caper film (I haven't seen the original) is the kind of movie you watch on a night by yourself when nothing else is on TV. You know you could watch better, or pop in a DVD, but since it's on you might as well see it through till it's pre-ordained climax. If anything, it has its moments, notably from a A-list cast.After a successful heist in Venice, Sutherland's character wants to call it quits, or at least take a break. But when Norton's character sets the crew up (which includes Wahlberg, Green, Def, and Statham) and kills off Sutherland, it puts the old crew into a shattered state. Cut ahead months later and Wahlberg and Theron decide to get back at the conniving Norton, who has his own bit of wealth in Los Angeles, and assemble the old crew.Despite the obvious story, there are aspects of the Italian Job that kept me entertained, if not entirely excited or enthralled at the turns of the film. The supporting work from Green and Statham gets some laughs, and Norton delivers some fine work as well (though another heist film he co-starred in, The Score, is much better), and the action set-pieces remind the audience that Gray is a competent director. Bottom line, this is one of those blockbuster-typos that came out during last summer and gave a just enough of a squeeze of popcorn-fun to compete with the other blockbusters. Grade: B-</fullReview>

I read the preview of this film (before knowing who was in it) about how Wahlberg works in a gang of 5 thieves. I knew immediately then, exactly who would make up the group: An Englishman, a black man, a nerdy computer geek, a gorgeous woman &amp; a back stabber who does the dirty on them. What do you know? The token Englishman, black man, computer geek, woman &amp; Grass are the 5. They could have been really daring and had all 5 in the one category for novelty, but still that's Hollywood. But credit where it's due, all the lead characters are exceptionally well written &amp; good value.I've know idea why this film was called the Italian Job. It seemed to bear as many similarities to Zulu or Ghostbusters as it did the original Italian Job, but put that aside &amp; (and bearing mind I can't stand action films generally) you'll enjoy a terrific film, well worth a watch.A low 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Job well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: *** (out of *****)1969's The Italian Job has earned a massive cult following among many. It's a film I hold quite a high opinion of (although personally I don't see it as a real classic), so my initial reaction to this supposed remake was that it was a `bad idea'.So I guess we should be grateful that director F. Gary Gray and his talented cast have decided against religiously remaking the original. Rather, they have just borrowed the title, the minis and the basic `heist' premise. And maybe some other little details as well, if you care to look for them (such as Donald Sutherland's character sharing the same surname as Noel Coward's - but that's all the two characters really have in common). The mafia involvement and humour have been replaced by family &amp; revenge issues, plus a few more surprises. Oh, and memorable musical numbers are pushed aside in favour of a typical modern soundtrack. As was the case in the original, a gang of thieves have a `job' to do, although the main job takes place in America, not Italy. This gang consists of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg reprising the role originated by Michael Caine), Lyle (Seth Green), John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Half Ear (rapper Mos Def) and Steve (Ed Norton). After a successful gold grabbing heist in Venice, the gang meet to discuss what they'll do with this money. Unfortunately, Steve has ideas of his own and suddenly turns on the gang, killing Bridger and taking the gold for himself. The rest of the gang somehow escape his clutches and set out to regain the gold with the services of Bridger's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron).In some ways this is a more ambitious film than the original, but that isn't necessarily a plus point. The Italian heist is a little bit dull and confusing, but the majority of the American heist (the true centrepiece of the film) provides thrills aplenty, including the most memorable car chase of recent years. Like the original, several coloured minis are involved, but the pacing is upped to another level altogether.Perhaps, however, the script was written too lightly. There are some true surprises, but also many plot holes. We are thankfully spared a heavy-handed love subplot (which you nearly feel you can see coming from a mile away). Unfortunately we are not spared some trite character building scenes, but the actors do manage to make them work. A more serious issue, in my opinion anyway, is that the sound quality isn't the best. In the early stages, the average filmgoer may find it difficult to keep track of what is going on, and may just decide to go with the flow. Come to think of it, `going with the flow' might be the best idea, as the part of the film where the main plan is explained very nearly falls flat.Up against Michael Caine, Mark Wahlberg does look rather inferior. Yet it must be stated that he isn't trying to follow the example of the famous British actor, and, for what it's worth, he does an above adequate job. Everyone else slides easily enough into their parts, and Charlize Theron has rarely looked better as a smart safe-cracker. Much of the original's subtlety and humour has been lost at the expense of modernising the film. I wonder if this film would have been more successful had the tone been less politically correct. It sometimes feels like this version was deliberately dumbed down for teenagers. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, and luckily the 2003 Italian Job doesn't cross the line into stupidity. In fact, there are quite a few smart lines, and viewers will generally feel comfortable and involved while watching, even if the majority of this involvement is relegated to the film's second half. The action in general is handled pretty well, building up to a rewarding climax (albeit one with an overused plot device for an epilogue). The new Italian Job is a satisfying enough package, even if it is full of holes. Just don't be comparing it too much to the original, because ? as I stated earlier ? it's not an actual remake.</fullReview>

It's way worse than a lot of the straight-to-cable Cinemax actioners. Marky's becoming the king of remakes; not a good career move, since most remakes tend to stink like this one. The fact that they released Michael Caine's charming original version on DVD the same day only enhances this remake's blunders.</fullReview>

But, there is major suspension of disbelief in a few places -- just how much DOES $27 million worth of gold bars weigh? And they could FLOAT it UNDERWATER on two rafts? Or the ability to override the cable connection quickly. The last time the cable guy came to my house it took forever to figure out which one of those connections was for MY house.

Statham is quite a good (untrained) actor who can pull off a fast-talking chancer role very well (check out Lock, Stock and Snatch), so why waste him such a such small role?And for all the talk of Norton's unhappiness with the project (contracts, no publicity blah blah blah) I thought he gave one of the sleaziest performances I've ever seen. He acted the Funky Bunch reject off the screen without even trying!To my fellow Brits... don't be scared. It doesn't sully the rep of the original.

		<fullReview>I went into this with a fond memory of the original, being the first film I ever saw and all that. And I left with that fondness still intact.The Italian Job 2003 isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. The main problem has to come down to the plot or lack of it. Its too simple. There's never a moment in the film where something happens you don't expect, it's as if the writers just joined the dots to come up with their story.Starting off in Venice, where a motley crew of characters in Charlie Croker, Left Ear (He's deaf in one ear) Lyle (Who swears he invented Napster) Handsome Rob, who's well handsome and John Bridger, an aging mastermind who's determined to pull of "one last job".After an exciting and rather original Venice waterfront chase its into the Alps, except there's trouble in store. If you've seen the trailer you'll know what happens next.Back to L.A. and its up to Charlie (Wahlberg) to recruit Bridger's Daughter Stella who crumbles like a biscuit and succumbs to the revenge plot of Charlie and his crew. See, the plots simplistic. It tries to flesh out the story by introducing Russian gangsters and a huge Asian bloke, but really everything builds to the climatic job and subsequent escape.Sure, it's cool and stylish but its really a disappointment. Apart from a cool moment where a chopper and a Mini tangle, it's textbook stuff, much like the rest of the film really. Despite all these flaws its still fun. Seth Green and Jason Statham play their parts for laughs and there's plenty of little jokes (The actor learning his lines in a L.A. traffic jam then stealing Statham's accent once he yells at him) and cool moments (At one point it looks like they'll take the Mini's into the house, maybe for the sequel.Apart from the plot though, the biggest problem has to do with the script. It unravels incredibly simply and everything that could happen does happen. It's also hampered by uneasy switch from comedy to drama, one minute we have short, entertaining vignettes introducing the characters lives then the next we see Theron, all crying and vengeful. It's an uncomfortable mix and Theron plays her role way too seriously.If you like heist movies, see this. If you like car chases, see this. If you like Mini's, definately see this (I want one!) but don't expect to come out of the cinema and know anything new or feel like you've watched something extraordinary. This is just a bit better than average, due to its style.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job is an ultra slick crime/revenge film, which is not a remake of the original as some believe. There has been much discussion about this, but all one has to do is see the cast from the original to know that that film was more of a comedy. This film focuses on the heists themselves, the planning, and the cat and mouse anticipatory skills one needs when committing such acts. The acting is satisfactory from a group of top flight actors: Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, etc. , but no more than that. The material is beneath Norton, and he's really not on screen enough to warrant an actor of his caliber. Theron seems an odd fit in the film, but has one of the best scenes with Norton in a restaurant. There are several terrific action scenes involving boat and car chases and great location filming. An interesting trivia note: there's a glimpse of the recently renovated Roosevelt Hotel, the site of the very first academy awards ceremony. It was brand new at that time. The script doesn't allow for a lot of character development, and this is the type of film where the characters exist to serve the plot. The film is still enjoyable and better than average for its type. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People have been waiting to criticize this film since it was first announced. Everyone ready to pounce at the opportunity to say how it is `no-where near as good as the original,' and that `the original was a classic and shouldn't be remade!' (although when you look at the original now, it isn't really a classic! Yes, there is THAT mini scene, and the `bloody doors' quote, but aside from that it was a slow film. Good, but not classic.)Anyway, here is the chance for all you naysayers to pounce, and then find that you are really disappointed..'cos Italian Job is a pretty good film. Heck, I'd even go so far as to say it is a damned enjoyable film!The film doesn't remake the first film, and a recent interview with the director revealed that the intention was never to remake, but to homage. Indeed it does pay homage. A bullion heist in Venice is successful, until one of the gang of thieves betrays the rest and leaves them for dead. Months later, they all seek to steal the gold back, and get their revenge.One of the things that makes this film so much fun (aside from the mini scenes, which I won't go into detail about, suffice to say they are 'cool') is the caliber of actors on display, and the likeability of the 'good guys' (if indeed a thief can be a good guy). Much in the same way Oceans 11 seemed perfect in the casting, so does this. Mark Wahlberg is the smooth mastermind behind the scams, and with Ed Norton as the bad guy, adding Seth Green, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, and Donald Sutherland into the mix is pure genius. The personalities bounce off each other well, creating a group of players that you do care about. Norton is as good as ever, but seems to be just playing by numbers. He has been vocal about how he didn't really want to do this film, and now I understand why. He is an actor who likes to take on different roles..this was just a repeat of his performance in the Score. Nontheless, still a good actor.Direction is pacey, and the story keeps moving throughout, with the initial heist being a work of genius, to the introduction of the players (with amusing flashbacks), then the set up for the new heist. Witty dialogue is scattered throughout, giving that extra character to each of the stars.So, feel free to criticize this film, and compare it to the first..but make sure you watch it first before you make an ass of yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job: 6.5/10Although the concept of "The Italian Job" only appealed to me mildly, the inclusion of one of my favourite actors, Edward Norton, made me decide to check it out. I was reluctant even with Norton involved, as he was forced to take this role to break out of a contract. The plot is based around a theft in Venice that goes perfectly, only for one of the team members (Norton) to betray the others, killing the mentor of the lead character (played by Mark Wahlberg). Said mentor just happened to be Donald Sutherland, who was excellent and underused in the movie. The movie followed a basic plot of revenge, and was fun to watch, if not perfect. Charlize Theron was very good as the daughter of Sutherland's character, who hesitantly joins the team for revenge on Norton's character. However, Mark Wahlberg is a very "blah" actor, who often fails to distinguish himself and make himself worthy of a leading role. Although he wasn't bad, I felt that many others could have worked the role better. Now as for Norton's role, it was one of his worst ever. It was very run-of-the-mill by Norton, who didn't work too well as the main villain, although had his moments. Many of the things that make Norton such a great actor were missing, and you could tell this wasn't exactly a role he wanted. Overall, a good movie that is worth watching once, maybe twice for the awesome heist at the start, that is worked so well.</fullReview>

Anyway, it's a fun film, with a great boat chase in Venice. And an even greater chase in L.A. involving three Mini Coopers and a helicopter! Somehow I don't think three Minis are inconspicuous, but nevertheless, it was a wild ride. BTW, watch for a snippet of Michael Caine in Alfie.

		<shortDescription>Follows the formula, but at least does it with style and creativity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoiler The first thing I heard about The Italian Job was that it had a car chase in it that was supposed to be better than the one in The Matrix Reloaded. I'm not sure I would go that far, but there is no denying that there is some great action in this movie. It is, admittedly, an hour and forty minute Mini Cooper commercial, and it definitely follows the typical formula of a heist movie, but there are subtle differences that make it more than worth watching.Seth Green plays the part of Lyle, who I'll just describe as exactly the same character that he played in Enemy of the State to save time, but he provides some of the most entertaining scenes in the film. The creation of the `Los Angeles' largest traffic jam ever' (although I'm SURE I've been stuck in worse than that in that place) is the movies main attraction, and Lyle creates it with suck geeky style that he makes it cool to be a computer nerd again.(spoilers) Charlize Theron plays Stella Bridger, the daughter of John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), whose vicious murder provides much of the drive for the conflict of the entire film. Stella plays the beautiful blonde with a whole world of possibilities open to her because she's so intelligent and strong, and then she is sent into an emotional turmoil for most of the film. So basically exactly the same character she played in The Devil's Advocate, Reindeer Games, The Astronaut's Wife, Mighty Joe Young, The Legend of Bagger Vance, Men of Honor, 15 Minutes, etc.Donald Sutherland is, of course, his usual badass self, with a calm and collected cool that is rivaled only by such greats as Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood. He is an actor who naturally portrays characters who have plans that go just a little beyond what is spoken aloud (except, of course, for the character he played in Backdraft). In a movie that's populated almost entirely by stereotyped characters, it's nice that at least one of the caricatures is not routine and boring.Mark Wahlberg is another caricature, but he is also not boring just because it's so much fun to watch him be p***ed off and seeking revenge. I've always thought that he had a tiny bit of a hard time playing anything other than a former-musician-turned-actor, but he definitely has his own style which fits perfectly with his role in The Italian Job.And then there is Edward Norton, one of today's few young actors who promises to ultimately obtain as much skill in portraying diverse characters as people like Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman, who are so good at what they do that they can literally play any role in the world should the need arise. One of the only things that I was a little apprehensive about when I went to see The Italian Job was that I knew Norton was going to play the bad guy, and I have always been so staggered by his performances in movies like Primal Fear and American History X that I was a little bummed that I would have to watch him caught and probably killed in this movie (thankfully I was spared the latter, which is more than can be said of movies in similar situations, like Training Day).Despite my opinion that Edward Norton's role as the bad guy was initially a little disappointing to me, it also turned out to be one of the best parts of the movie, and not only because Norton is such a spectacularly talented actor, some credit also goes to the writers in this category. As a whole, The Italian Job doesn't stray too far from the typical heist movie formula, but the thing that really makes it interesting as we're led to the ending that we always knew we would see is that the villain, Norton, is not a complete moron, as villains quite often are.When the rest of the team finds him, a year after he betrayed them to steal the $35 million worth of gold that they stole together (in an opening sequence that rivals any one in any James Bond movie ever made), we get some pleasant surprises in a movie that never really promised to have many. Stella goes to his house as the cable-repair technician and ends up on a date with him, and when they're out to dinner, she doesn't easily deceive him with her beauty as long as she needs to, giving him wildly revealing death looks all the while as you would see in the typical heist movie, but he has caught on to her and tricks her into revealing her identity as well. Norton plays a villain that is aware of his surroundings, he's not reckless and ignorant and protected only by the mistakes of his pursuers, as would normally be the case.This intelligence goes on into the thrilling final action sequence, where he places his gold in one of three armored trucks in order to confuse his pursuers, who he knows are watching every move he makes. I was a little disappointed that the movie took the nosedive at the end where it is explained that every character took his share of the gold and went and bought exactly what they wanted (they did everything here but include the phrase Happily Ever After), but I guess that's the price you pay for getting to have an interesting and entertaining ride to the ending that you already knew you would see. As a whole the movie is about as predictable as they come, but at least they came up with some new things along the way. Given the amount of movies of all genres these days that don't even bother to do that much, this one is a breath of fresh air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok- so they spent the money on some hip, pretty, and talented actors.They hyped the movie as an action flick minus any over-indulgent computer special effects . However, the info they didn't provide us was that in the film's making, they failed miserably in providing the audience with any original plot, concept, or character. I understand that this is a remake... but if one is going to attempt a remake, shouldn't it be based on a tale worth telling??? This tale has been retold in hundreds of theft/caper flicks already. Nothing new to see here. No one you end up really caring about or finding compelling, quirky, interesting in the least. The chase scenes weren't even cool enough to justify marketing them in the trailers. So they souped up a coupla Minis... great. I personally am more entertained by the Mazda commercials... "zoom zoom zoom"...at least they have a catchy jingle!spoiler: The catch phrase heard in the film a few times is ultimately an ironic one that sums up the entire film: "no imagination"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one can play a slimy character as well as Edward Norton and he pulls this heist off better than ever before ? he is able to make the viewer admire him and even envy him, yet be utterly happy that they are NOT him.This re-make of the 1969 film of the same name with Michael Caine and Noel Coward is far superior to the original ? rare in this day of endless copies and re-makes. Mark Wahlberg plays the character that Michael Caine originally acted ? and while Wahlberg is certainly not an actor of the same ilk as Caine is he is certainly more entertaining in this role than Mr. Caine was. He is written as intelligent, witty, charming and, even though Michael Caine epitomizes class, far more elegant and sophisticated than Mr. Caine was able to achieve in the initial film; kudos to Mr. Wahlberg.Charlize Theron is what I would want Cameron Diaz to be if I were ever lucky enough to wake up next to her ? sexy, intelligent and just immoral enough to make her a truly fun romp. I totally approve.The supporting cast of crooks (Mos Def, Seth Green (!), Jason Statham and a woefully brief appearance by Donald Sutherland) is just delightfully fiendish enough to completely inveigle and entice the viewer to be completely caught up in their wicked, wicked ways.Whenever a film starts with a catchy and compelling opening sequence I am always wary ? all too often it is a way of hiding the woefully inadequate film that is to come. Fortunately, even though `The Italian Job' started out on a high note, this time it did not let me down. It started cleverly and did not disappoint.The sound track was an absolute delight ? hitting all the right elemental notes in all the right places ? with themes that the viewer will recognize (in all the proper spots) mixed with new music that was completely appropriate to the action on the screen.Action is the key word. This was a film full of encounters and excitement ? with never a slow moment or a let down.The use of the Minis as get away cars was a stroke of genius ? where many screen writers or directors would have used a car a la James Bond the utilization of the not-so-exciting Minis gave an enormous sense of fun and exhilaration to the chase scenes.`The Italian Job' is the best time I have had at the movies so far this year and I highly recommend it to any and everyone that is looking for a good time replete with action, humour, romance and wit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9 on a scale of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I pretty much love heist movies. I love good action movies too. So, that gives this film a big jump on getting a good rating from me. But, of course, they have to deliver and The Italian Job does just that.I really have almost no objections to this movie. It is great fun and I hated to see it end.The only two extremely minor objections were 1) I prefer Ed Norton as a good guy. 2) The only ridiculously ridiculous issue was their parking right in front of the gate. Of course, almost everything in a movie like this is ridiculous. That's a given. But, the staking out the gate so visibly was over the line.Still those are so minor that they almost are irrelevant. And, I would have given it a 9 even if Norton were a good guy and there was no gate issue. That's about as good as I can give any movie that isn't some type of brilliant production.Better than Ocean's Eleven IMHO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Italian Job: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Move over, Sharon Stone! Somebody who was once at the top of their game is now reduced to this. Yes, I'm talking to you, Charlize Theron. Of course, it isn't as bad as an amorous night with the little AOL man, but when you're second billed to MARK WAHLBERG, your career's in hock. Although when other actors such as Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, and Jason Statham, you can look and see that it's not all bad.What I'm talking about it The Italian Job, F. Gary Gray's addition to the ever-popular genre of heist movies. In fact, Gray is a big fan of these type of movies, naming Snatch the greatest heist flick ever. Unlike straight heist films like Heist, The Italian Job has humor and takes itself more humorously. Of course we don't understand everything that the computer whiz/geek Lyle says, but neither do the people in the movie, adding to the mocking tone of the movie. It's not exactly a parody of crime movies, just an homage.Donald Sutherland must have been aching for a paycheck. He stars as John Bridger, an aging thief who is doing.guess.one last job! Clich?s run high, but so does fun (I'll get to that later). He's with his team doing a job in Italy, and they successfully steal about $35 million. One of the team, Steve (Edward Norton) turns against them, shoots and kills John, and runs off with the gold. The rest of the crew plan to steal the gold from Steve because of revenge, including Stella, John's daughter.PT Cruisers used to be the fad car, but now Mini Coopers are becoming steadily more popular. Thanks to The Italian Job, where everyone drives one, that is. The car chases weren't that many, but the culminating one was great. When three Minis were driving on the subway tracks, it was just amazing, I really loved it. Of course, there was a lot of advertising. It's basically a two-hour car commercial, with a few Pepsi adds added in.However, there's an interesting note I found. Wahlberg, who plays Charlie, the ringleader, said that The Italian Job had some of the most amazing special effects he had ever seen, while Norton repeated several times that he joined this movie only because of contractual agreements. Wahlberg is most definitely not a leading man.his acting's like a log on a stream. It starts off high but then falls down. Theron, who plays a beautiful safecracker, also isn't that great of an actress. When the high point of your career is a RECENT Woody Allen film, you're in trouble. Norton, my second favorite actor, heaps on the camp, but still doesn't come off that well. Other actors, including Mos Def, Stathem, and Green, were all funny, especially Green.The Italian Job is very fun and entertaining, but can't stay away from clichés. Sutherland does one last move, Norton has a moustache, Green is geeky, Theron is beautiful, there's a token African-American. Also, the ending is more predictable than, well, a Disney movie. Overall, The Italian Job is a fun two hours. If you're looking for more than that, stay away.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gang of career criminals, led by young mastermind Charlie Croker (Wahlberg), pull off the heist of a lifetime in Venice, Italy when they successfully steal a cache of gold bullion. The one thing they didn't count on however was that they'd be double-crossed by one of their own. Roughly a year later?with the help of an accomplished safe cracker?they track him down in Los Angeles and attempt to settle the score. Slick, hip, often funny heist film has a first-rate cast and provides lots of fun from start to finish. The film's nifty action scenes are a pure rush of adrenaline, and the plot manages to be involving every step of the way, making this a worthy addition to the genre. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Heist Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really do like heist movies and this one was no disappointment--in fact, it's essentially three heists for the price of one, and they were jam-packed with style and clever energy. I'm glad I hadn't seen the trailer until afterwards (which I saw on this site), I think it gives too much of the good stuff away--so please, skip the trailer and just go see the movie! I saw the movie based on its Venice location, but I ended up liking even better the L.A. location, thanks to clever use of such features as the Metro, the empty concrete river, and the killer traffic. If, along with the new GPS systems, cars offered a small handful of us a device like what "The Napster" put together, L.A. really would be a paradise!There was great chemistry and humor among the interesting and sometimes peculiar characters. I guess Seth Green was probably the best (everytime the word "Napster" was spoken, the audience in the theater laughed, clapped, or cheered), but Mark Wahlberg was effective, as always, Charlize Theron, well, she just looks good and acts with such style, and I had a particular liking for Mos Def's character (although I half expected him to break out in a cockney accent like Don Cheadle's character in "Ocean's 11"! Fortunately, he didn't). Also, I really happened to like a lot the golf-practicing explosives supplier, what a unique character and you know what, this is L.A. and we've really got people like you've never seen before!All in all, this movie was great fun, a kick to watch, and a great advertisement for Mini Coopers. Who wouldn't crave to have one after seeing this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a heist takes place based after the 1969 film, has a group of extraordinary guys each with a talent groups together to get their share of the gold! With an ultimate cast of characters and an ultimate plot you are bound to love this movie! I went into this movie without seeing the original film, "The Italian Job" (which was released in 1969), so I am not sure if this movie remained faithful to the original film.I view the fact that I have not seen the original as an opportunity for a non biased review. I am rating this film on how good it is by itself, not how good it is compared to the original!I saw this movie and it had an excellent cast (Seth Green, Mark Whalberg, Ed Norton, and Charlize Theron) but I had my eye on one person the whole movie, Seth Greene, all the films performances were great but Seth Green stole the whole movie with his claim to fame being stolen by his room-mate. He claims he originally made the hit site (until it was shut down by the government) Napster, as he was sleeping at his computer his room-mate steals the floppy/zip disk with the Napster information. He says his room-mate made the name Napster supposedly by his nappy head but He is convinced it is because he was napping when it was stolen from him.He also was hilarious from his experience by hacking into the phone company and listening in on his ex-girlfriend the phone to the final heist and the line "Whooooooo.....I got the Holy Spirit....it's really a train bus, you should get on it!'This movie was worth all of the money I spent and it was better than any other heist film (Gone in 60 seconds, Oceans 11).I recommend this movie to all guys and girls with a taste for adventure (And even if you're not a girlfriend with a taste for action, I am sure your boyfriend will drag you to it anyway).I give this movie: Four Gold Bars out of Five Gold Bars (it's a joke if you've seen the movie). ****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: teeny-tiny little spoilers!It's nice to know that every once in awhile, Hollywood puts a little effort into making a good movie. Sure, they don't always make it, but effort counts for a lot.Take `The Italian Job' for example, a remake of the 1969 film. Effort was put forth to give us a little bit of everything in the hopes that it all added up to a great movie, and they did their best to make the pieces work together. They even got around to following a half-decent plot, even though they had to go all the way back to 1969 to dig one up.`The Italian Job' is about a group of nice-guy thieves who steal $32 Million worth of gold from a nameless place in Venice, Italy. One clever caper and a boat chase later, and our boys are on their way. Of course, 'Steve' (Edward Norton) betrays them, takes the gold for himself, and tries to kill the rest of the group. Unfortunately for him, he only manages to kill the most loveable father-figurely (yes I know its not a real word) character, inciting the rest of the group to hunt Steve down a year later in Los Angeles and try to steal his gold just to annoy him.Mix all of this in with a love interest (Stella Bridger), the all-American hero/thief (Mark Whalberg), the gigolo car-guy (Jason Statham), the computer geek loser (Seth Green), the token black guy (Mos Def), some explosions, some car chases, and some Minis, and you have `The Italian Job'.So, does it all add up?The answer is a definite resounding `sort of'!The movie was fun to watch, it's worth going to the theatre for, and it will be a fun rental. That having been said, I'm not buying myself a copy. While the acting was good, the action was good, and even the plot was good, none of it was great.I'm saying this for a pretty simple reason: international thieves probably aren't all a bunch of super nice people. Trying to portray it any other way means that the actors have to portray slightly unrealistic characters (Oh I don't want to see Steve dead, I just want to see the look on his face!), the plot gets a little watered down to accommodate that (Our plan is simple: we'll wing it!), and the action sequences are limited to scenes where nobody gets hurt (Ok folks, in this scene you drive down the sidewalk, down the stairs, along the subway platform and then in front of the train. Don't hit anybody.).So basically, it makes for a movie that has it all, and ends up just ok.If it helps you make up your mind about whether to see it, Edward Norton made it clear he only agreed to do the movie because of contractual obligations. That can be good or bad, depending on how you feel about Edward Norton.3.5 of 5 Wuffies. Nice try guys, see you next summer.</fullReview>

The plot was incredible, the characters were dynamic, and the movie combined just the right amounts of humor, action, suspense, and Charlize Theron. Mark Wahlberg, although wooden at times, was good as the leader; Edward Norton made for a fairly passable bad guy (gay mustache included); Jason Statham was great as Handsome Rob (the scene explaining his past is especially entertaining); Seth Green and Mos Def were constantly getting laughs out of the crowd; and Charlize Theron was rediculously hot. The best part of the movie undoubtedly was the car chase involving three Mini Coopers and a helicopter. Whoa. Mad props to Gary Gray and whoever did the casting, because this one's defnitely a keeper. First I couldn't wait for it to get into theaters so I could see it, now I can't wait for it to get out of theaters so I can buy the DVD. Oh, and Norton, lose the mustache for the sequel.P.S.- The only bad thing was the editing of a few curses here and there (to keep the film in the PG-13 category).

		<fullReview>I haven't yet read all the other comments for this movie, but I find it hard to believe that people could see it as a fantastic movie. This is one of the silliest films I have seen in quite some time.SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONThis movie starts off fine, the opening sequence is interesting and action packed. From there, however, it drifts into a silly Mission Impossible wannabe sort of atmosphere, with way too much fast paced techno music and way too little plot. After the opening sequence, it is as though the next 30 minutes were completely unnecessary, as all those plans were thrown out the window and a new plan developed? This seems a bit silly to me. The final sequence is then very similar to the opening one in that they use nearly the same methods...not very creative.Wahlberg is very average, if not below average. Theron is surprisingly decent. Seth Green is very good, as is the rest of the supporting cast. Norton is good but not great in a limited role. Searching for positives, this is a fun and fast paced thrill ride, if those sort of things make your say. The story, however, is contrived and silly, and too much of the obvious ends up taking place with Wahlberg and Theron.I give it 4/10</fullReview>

At first they annoyed me, but it ended up being almost as much fun watching them enjoy themselves as watching the movie. I give it 9 out of 10. (P.S.

		<shortDescription>An agreeable romp and a nifty heist flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ITALIAN JOB is a good entertainment. You won't learn any deep truths about the human condition, you won't really see any oscar winning performances, but you will be entertained. Which really is what most movies should try to do.Okay, I've never seen the original Michael Caine ITALIAN JOB (I keep missing it on BBCAmerica), so I cannot compare the two. What I can compare it to are recent heist flicks, like CONFIDENCE, THE HEIST, THE SCORE, the OCEANS ELEVEN remake, and (as my Dad pointed out) THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. It compares quite favorably. You know the gang is going to get screwed by a confederate (thanks to the trailer, grrrr!) and that they are going to get their revenge. The fun is watching how the intricate plot they plan is going to be carried out. And the greater fun is watching how, when the first plan falls through, they improvise the second plan.I am especially impressed that the film is a true heist flick, like THE SCORE and THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, rather than a shoot-em-up like THE HEIST. When John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) says "We pulled it off without drawing a single gun", he sets the ground rules for the gang's later revenge plan. Any dumb crook can shoot people; it takes brains to pull off a nonviolent heist.One interesting little cameo-by-proxy. Watch closely when Steve Frezelli (Ed Norton) turns on his giant TV. The image on the screen is a closeup of Michael Caine (I'm assuming from the original ITALIAN JOB).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, clean fun!! Love the Mini Cooper!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to chance upon a sneak preview of "The Italian Job", and walked away feeling thoroughly entertained and glad that I decided to give it a try. The original, with Michael Caine was a nice caper film with a fairly simple plot and good characters. This remake is no different, expect a lightweight action-adventure film that is well worth the price of admission. The clever plot addresses all the motivations and angles for the characters, and has just enough plot twists to keep you interested without bogging you down in the minutiae. The heist and chase scenes are first rate and made the crowd buzz with excitement. Of course, the Mini-Cooper is the star! While Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton give good performances as good guy vs. bad guy, the two leads seemed very one-dimensional. The supporting cast is top notch and very frequently steals the scene with funny, clever one-liners that drew big laughs. Charlize Theron, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Jason Statham all put in believable performances.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it to all of my friends as good, clean fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard that Marky Mark was going to be in this, I started to have my doubts - I never bothered to see the remake of my favorite old movie, Charade, "The Truth About Charlie". However, the rest of the cast did sound fantastic - Edward Norton, Jason Strathan, Seth Green, etc. I was able to catch this movie in a sneak preview, and I was very impressed with the film. It was immensely entertaining, the cast was fantastic - Marky Mark wasn't bad, and the rest of the cast really helped the movie shine. The music by John Powell (who also scored "The Bourne Identity") was equally fantastic. An excellent film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thoughts on the Italian Job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>hey just watched the Italian Job on Friday. It was actually pretty good,B+. Yes there are minicars not vw bugs, and they are so cool. And yes part of it does take place in Italy. The rest does take place in the US, but to explain how they will get the gold back,Charlie(Mark Walberg) says they will do it like the Italian Job,that way Movie audiences know whats coming to some degree.The Job that they pull is in venice which meant lots of water to work with it was a pretty cool idea.Of coarse I've read a lot of the other postings and all I have to say is I've only seen a few of Mark Walbergs movies, but those have nothing to do with this movie which is a very ensemble piece, so ignore him if you don't like him. Definitely never saw the original(don't like Michael Caine or Benny Hill),but doubt I would have enjoyed it from what has been described, Think of it as a new film, just some same charecter names. And finally if you haven't seen it don't knock it, once you've seen it than you can make all of the opinions you want. I may even watch the original just to see, with an open mind of coarse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton were the two badly casting actors. Wahlberg was too short for this role, his crab-like walking also looked so bad. Norton's flat and narrow speaking tone was also very unconvincing; his voice was way too thin, not like a fully grown adult, albeit a stone cold killer and traitor. The other supporting of the heist team member roles were also way too clown-like bad cast. This is a very badly scripted and cast movie. The way to promote mini cooper was just disgusting too. It ended this movie up very uncomfortable to watch. The only two characters/actors looked quite convincing were the mentor/D.Sutherland and the mentor's daughter/Charlize Theron. The whole heist team was a joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One last heist for Donald Sutherland ends in death when one of the group grabs the $35 million in gold and puts a bullet in him. Miraculously, Mark Wahlberg and the rest of the gang survive and the film then becomes devoted to Wahlberg planning a heist against Edward Norton, the culprit, to recapture the gold. The film just proves that there is no honor among thieves.Charlize Theron, as beautiful as ever, portrays Sutherland's daughter. She joins in the plot to avenge her father.The film is full of exciting chase scenes. In fact, the last 20 minutes or so are all devoted to this.Evidently, the writer(s) was (were) Republicans. They talk about the stolen election of JFK in 1960. The film was in 2003. How about talking about the election from 3 years before this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't get to see this movie in theaters, but as soon as I bought it on DVD, I was engaged with every bit and piece of the story. This is a fun film. Fun, fun, and fun to watch. Probably my favorite heist film to date.The acting is all well done, especially from an A-list cast, with Mark Wahlberg, Donald Sutherland, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron -- all expectations are met, and their performances are the ones we cheer and boo for.The action has great placement in the film. The pace is enjoyable, as we get scenes where they make the elements needed to get a job done, and scenes of very nicely filmed car chases.There's a lot of laughs to be had. The comedy works well, from the backstory of Seth Green's character -- who was the "self-proclaimed" original inventor of Napster, only to have his room-mate steal his plans while he was napping -- as well as Handsome Rob's freeway chases. All funny.All in all, The Italian Job is a movie I watch without any feeling of boredom or impatience, which is why I give it a 10-star review. It's just a fun movie, with good comedy relief, nice drama and action, as well as some very entertaining heists. I definitely recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie! Suspense-Action Packed-Awesome Car Chases</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie starts out in Venice, Italy. Picturesque, lovely, and we see the water in the canals, houses all seem to have boat houses underneath their homes. How convenient! A team of thieves committing the ultimate heist planned down to the minutest detail. I was totally in awe at how precise the caper was. Everything went like clock work. Everything seemed so perfect. This was a great film! It held my attention and I watched it actually twice. It kind of reminded me of Oceans Eleven because every detail, no matter how small was covered. And each person was hand picked because of their expertise. I just love those kinds of movies. It is so interesting how they plan it all out and get in and get out without anyone being the wiser. It had a fantastic plot.Wonderful cast! Mark Walberg was great as the Master Mind. Donald Sutherland was the old Pro. What a twist on the plot. If you like suspense and car chases you will love this. Action packed story line not just the same old thing. Mystery, and suspense, and some really intense moments make this a great film for your library. I loved the movie. Bad guys taking advantage of the bad guys!! You think you know how it is going to end then they turn the tables. It just was so fun to watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not really like this movie. I thought it was very predictable. The acting performances were weak, in my opinion. I thought the whole idea about Napster was so corny. The characters barely say more than two sentences at a time. It might just be me, but I like movies that throw some curves at you; this one doesn't, except at the very beginning, which you then know there is going to be some retaliation and you can figure out how it from there how it is going to happen. This movie reminded me more of Fast and Furious, just more on an international scale. I thought XXX was better. I did not find the characters to be believable in their roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood ruin another classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Competent acting, a brisk plot and some spectacular set-pieces do little to satisfy me. Having recently watched the outstanding original once more, I am reminded of exactly how little charm this movie possesses. Where the original had a captivating personality, this has just another white-washed Hollywood sheen to it. The new minis are quite nice, but have none of the cheeky character of the old ones and with Micheal Cain replaced by the competent, if frankly uninspiring Wahlberg, this movie disappointed me in almost every way possible. Don't even get me started on the happy go-lucky ending either. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not simply worshipping the original because it was there first. I worship the original because it's a classic, and quite rightfully so. Admittedly, this film had a hell of a lot to live up to, but with such a cast and even the original scriptwriter, Troy Kennedy-Martin, the fact that it didn't made me hate it even more. To even associate this film with the original is to do Peter Collinson's masterpiece a huge injustice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to watch the original a couple of hours before I watched this 'remake' or rather a tribute. The story is not really strongly related to the original's, but for the use of three minis in red blue and white. Besides the fact Charlize looks as cute as ever (I'd sure like her for a birthday present) the film shows uninspired acting, a haphazardly put together storyline and no real turn-ons whatsoever. It's a shame really, the concept of this type of flick has proved to be fruitful on many occasions, of which Ocean's eleven is the best in years imho. Just another meager crime-heroes-flick we could well do without. 4/10</fullReview>

No charm, nothing memorable, and many have "cool" or "amusing" names to make them stand out. The acting is okay, but Edward Norton looks just plain to embarassed to be in such a cartoon-character role after starring in such brilliant films as "Fight Club" and "American History X".The film picks up towards the end, in terms of entertainment, but not enough to save this movie from being a rather pointless affair.It must be compared with Ocean's 11, but in that film I liked the characters and cared about the outcome. In The Italian Job -- simply, I did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Using the title "The Italian Job" suggests that this film is, in some way, a remake of the original film. It isn't. The only similarities are gold, Minis (and even then it's the new Mini) and the name of one character (Charlie Croker). The screenplay doesn't have the quality of the original and the acting is lack-lustre to say the least. The film lacks the sparkle of the original, which is a classic. This film just about scrapes 'OK' as a stand-alone caper. By trading on the title, it sinks about as low as it can get.</fullReview>

The plot was very "Americanised". There had to be someone who betrayed them. Overall, a 4 out of 10, not great, not bad.</fullReview>

Do not disturb mother-in law, mother nature or the Ukranian mafia is funny but is not in well put in the movie. This movie is hollow because the actors how good they might be to save the movie cannot give the impression that this is a serious thing. Even when somebody is killed it all looks too funny.

		<fullReview>Like many fans of the original Italian Job, i had been lookingforward to and dreading a revamp. The idea of a gold bullion heist in Turin at rush hour was deliciousand thanks to a screenplay by the excellent Troy Kennedy Martin,the Michael Caine classic has lost little of its charm over the years.There was little point in refilming the screenplay the way Gus VanSant had done with Psycho. Instead, director F Gary Gray and thescreenwriters have done a fine job taking the best elements fromthe original movie, then changing them to suit a new story.The result is a delicious mix of action, suspense and humour thatleft this fan hungry for more. The finale does feel like something of a let down but having seen itafter the woeful Underworld, i was willing to forgive any littleniggles. Full marks all round.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie I want in my summer. It's not brain surgery, but it's just plain fun. A true ensemble piece, everyone shines in this movie. Mark Wahlberg reprises his "stoic leader" role from The Big Hit, and does fabulous things for your average white dress shirt. Seth Green looks like he had a great time making this movie, and has some of the best lines. Jason Statham makes me more of a fan every time I see him, and it was nice to see him play a more humorous character than those he's done in the past. And I'd never seen Mos Def before, but he was hysterical. Charlize Theron didn't have a whole lot to work with - her character seemed to be the least fleshed out - but I still enjoyed her performance. She's one of the few "It" actresses out there these days that I can stomach.The action sequences were great, and the Mini Cooper chase made me want to take a trip to the local BMW dealer (which I'm sure was half the point). Those little things certainly took a beating in this film.All in all, good summer fun. When you've had your fill of Charlie's Angels' camp, and don't want to put the brain power into something dramatic and serious, go see The Italian Job. It's fun!</fullReview>

It sure as hell felt like it with this film, as everyone involved went through their scenes with tongue-in-cheek dialogue and virtually expressionless looks of pain on their faces. Norton had a reason for blowing off this movie due to a contractual obligation, but what was everyone else's excuse.

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*There's a scene early on in this flick that has the camera panning over the L.A. landscape. It lingers for a sec on a billboard for the "Curb your Enthusiasm" TV show. That title captures the energy of this flat tire of a movie. "The Italian Job" is the kind of movie Hollywood does really well. It's a slick, ensemble heist flick with chivalrous thieves to root for. Unfortunately it's also the kind of flick the audience has seen a hundred trillion times. The boredom was infectious because the cast acted like it was drifting into a coma.Edward Norton was the worst offender. He also starred in "The Snore". Ooops. I mean "The Score". He is playing the exact same character in this flick minus the retarded guy disguise. Maybe he should have whipped that routine out. He needed something to jumpstart him. Wahlberg plays a thief who wants to rip-off Norton because Norton betrayed him. Wahlberg truly earns the title "Chief Blank Slate". Whether he was upset, sad, happy or angry, he gave the same facial expression: Blank stare. Stoic or constipated? I couldn't tell. Theron is the hot blond girl they rope into the gang in order to give it a hot blonde girl. She was also bereft of emotions. She said this was a "personal job" for her but she looked like she couldn't care less. "It's a safe, (Yawn) I can crack it, I can't wait to see the look on his...zzzz....."In fairness, there were some cool scenes during the final heist in L.A. But that's about it. There's one point in the movie where the thieves say this job is not about stealing the gold. It's not? What the heck is it about? Revenge? Then why not just kill Norton? Why go through this elaborate heist if it's not about the gold? Actually it is all about the gold but Hollywood needs to hold onto its myth of the noble thief. It would be hard for the audience to root for money grubbing lowlifes if the thieves didn't have some altruistic motive for stealing. See, they're like modern day Robin Hoods stealing from an even worse thief and whatever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put it quite simply, I saw the trailer for this movie and said to myself "I like the new Mini Cooper, I enjoy Edward Norton; you know, I think I might just like this movie." WRONG. I would have rather gone to see Daddy Day Care than this movie. It was an absolute travesty - completely over saturated with product placements and ripped off visual effects from movies directed by individuals with no less than an ounce of creative blood in their body. I have no idea who is responsible for this mess, but I submit that F. Gary Gray has absolutely no creative ability whatsoever. If you have to rip off other directors' ideas just to make an interesting scene then you don't belong in the business. I realize that sometimes this is acceptable, as it has become with Matrix rip offs, but the way Gray rips off David Fincher's "fly through walls" trick is completely out of line. It is almost as if they just lifted the shot directly out of Panic Room. The product placement was just unbearable - a gigantic Sean John sign on the side of a Hyatt hotel, the countless number of times Napster is mentioned (as well as an appearance by Shawn Fanning himself), the relatively new Aston Martin Vanquish gets a mention (directly, they actually say "Aston Martin Vanquish") about 5 times (like anyone seeing the movie is thinking, "wow I really need one of those" and then goes out and tries to buy one until they realize there were only 300 made and they can't f**king EVER afford one), and who can forget the Pepsi Blue sign. I think the Pepsi Blue sign deserves a credit, it plays such a vital role in the film, more than I can say for some of the actors. Hats off to you Pepsi Blue sign, your brilliant performance in this movie is going to make you Hollywood's next "it-sign." And I realize that the inclusion of the Mini Cooper in this particular movie is absolutely justified, but when the car actually becomes more interesting than the actors, there is a huge problem. I found that the only scenes I was actually amused by were ones where the Mini Cooper is front and center. If I had known ahead of time that half the Mini Cooper chase scene was shown in the trailer then I would never have gone to see it. You know what, just watch the trailer and then go to the Mini Cooper website, that's the movie in a nutshell. I give this a solid 3/10.</fullReview>

Why does Edward Norton, not to mention his stupidities before, spoil his helicopter and change it for a van? If you like to enjoy commercials for DELL, NAPSTER, BMW embedded in a technically nice, but originality lacking remake, then watch it ... better switch to something else after the movie leaves the European plot. and ... Why did the Ukrainians not investigate their observation camera? - pro: Charlize Theron, nice Venice chase, contra: stupid Edward Norton, stupid L.A. chase, too much commercials</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italian Job 2003 - too much garlic and no base</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the other comments on on this page regarding this film and most, if not all, praise it. Yet, throughout the entirety of these(inane) 'reviews' no one compares it to or even mentions the fact that it is a remake of the vastly superior 1969 Michael Caine vehicle. I have to admit I had low expectations of this new film, and they were not disappointed, it was actually even worse than I anticipated. All performer presence, witty dialogue, and the action of one of the best car chases on celluloid (perhaps the best) has been removed to be substituted with blinding teeth, slicked back hair and constant, unimaginative, intrusive cutting. Even if the director wished to have a car chase to match the earlier set piece (he does not) he could not accomplish it because the demands of the ludicrously short takes in mainstream modern American cinema (to suit short attention spans) mean the stunt drivers cannot drive more than a few metres before 'CUT' must be called. The performers of the first film have, as with so many modern examples, been replaced by young, vacuous, uncharismatic and ineffectual model types. On the strength of the first film I went against my better judgement and gave part of my life to this trash: its enough to make me now hate the first film too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst directing jobs I've seen in years. Heist movies, even the weak ones, generally convey a sense of fun. Almost as if the performers were enjoying themselves as much as the audience. Here, the actors perform like they're in a hostage video and their first born child is in danger. With a good cast, cool cars and exotic locations you'd think it'd be hard to screw up but every element of this is bad. Anytime people speak it's like watching a high school play. There's no pacing, no humor, no tension, and zero chemistry. This film should be Exhibit A in illustrating exactly what a director does. F. Gary Gray is a completely talentless hack and if you don't believe me go watch 'Be Cool'. It makes one pine for the studio system, when, at least, you were guaranteed a level of professional competence.</fullReview>

When he's confronted with higher caliber actors like Norton and Theron, he looks like he can't wait to hear 'cut' so he can check his account and make sure his salary has been direct deposited. This movie is ridiculous. The crew should have been dead of hypothermia after their ridiculous meeting w/ bottles of Dom in the Austrian Alps. Every seen is less believable than the last. Watch the original and don't waste your time with yet another remake by an industry that is so out of ideas, it has to remake classics and can't even come up with a more original idea of heisting the gold the second time than using the same method as the Venice heist.I give this 2 out of 10 for the efforts of Theron and Norton having to deal with bad material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shame on Hollywood for thinking it can improve on the original. Apparently the screen writers only saw the original once and then I guess it was a bit too sophisticated for them. The characters are cardboard and provide none of the charisma of the original. The only similarity is the use of mini cars (left hand drive) but even this is a tentative link and not really enough to allow this film to have the same title. Now if they had given it a different title then maybe I could have accepted it as a standard Hollywood action movie or the sort of film to watch when hungover.</fullReview>

My only question is - what is he doing in the 2 hrs long ad for Mini Cooper I just watched? This movie is not bad - it's horrible. It could have been a parody, if only they didn't take themselves so seriously. As to Mark Wahlberg - well done mate! You just keep getting lower and lower, from one disaster to another. "Three Kings" --&gt; "The Perfect Storm" --&gt; "Planet of the Apes" --&gt; "The Italian Job". Nothing to be proud of, to say the least. Jason Statham - mate, Guy Ritchie gave you a chance in "Lock, Stock..." and in "Snatch" and you are blowing it. What a shame.

		<shortDescription>Really Really shoddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the original Italian Job with Michael Caine, and that was a classic action/comedy. This version shifted its action to L.A., and its theme from action/comedy to action/drama. Unfortunately, it delivers very little of either. The acting is listless and the story, lacklustre.I'm a fan of Jason Statham, but he's not enough to save this movie. Seth Green plays a computer whiz who claims he invented napster (another annoying and pointless schtick). And somehow he's got enough remote hardware power to wirelessly hack into the L.A. traffic system from a baggage claim cart to throw the whole city into logjam.The mini-cooper car chase scenes are hardly reminiscent of the car chase scene from the original movie, which still remains a classic.The relationships between the characters are poorly developed for a pseudo-drama, which they try to toss in between Donald Sutherland, as Mark Wahlberg's mentor and father figure; and his romantic interest, Charlize Theron. The worst part had to be the abrupt end to the movie, which culminated with Charlize and Mark living happily ever after without every developing a history in front of the viewing audience. Another major disappointment is Edward Norton's character as a greedy, ruthless villain, who apparently is not smart enough to avoid transporting his gold putting it at the greatest risk possible for looters like Mark's crew.</fullReview>

Lame.Not only that, they've change the original script to be cheesier and also suit their purposes. To bring the story partly to the concept of the original they've even included completely non-sensical situations. For example, in the first half of the movie, why on earth is there so much preparation, equipment, hacking, etc. when it could have been a simple heist on the guys house? Why do they need getaway cars when there's no idea of anyone to be chasing them? My points are only for having concepts of the original film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER ALERT for a piece of DRECK!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This soulless piece of drivel ranks amongst the worst of American excesses. Apart from a very clever opening this film has none of the lightness of touch, ingenuity or charm of the original. In this way the film is a paragon of Hollywood film-making in the 21st century ? all beginning, no middle, no end.Compare this to the less than clever opening of the original, which is ostensibly some guy driving around Turin till he hits the bulldozer planted in a tunnel by a waiting mafia. We the audience have no idea who the man is, or the significance of the whole scene. This flies in the face of what we are now told is good screen writing ? firstly, the man in the car is NOT the main character, and secondly we haven't actually established what's going on. We only find out who he is about half an hour into the film?and yet it works, and wow, the whole of the film is really great.Which begs the question 'is it salient to compare this to the original?' Salience notwithstanding this is a remake, or rather one of those films that both seeks to define itself from the original and separate itself from the original. The original was a caper film, and consequently had the requisite hallmarks of that genre. Things such as wit, clever writing, clever characters, and so on.This remake is a revenge film - Mark Wahlberg seeks to exact revenge upon Edward Norton because he killed Michael Caine ? an act so symbolic it's meaning becomes ironic to the extreme. It says we're killing the original, make way Michael Caine, your day has ended. Unfortunately for the makers of this insipid piece of garbage they spake too soon, because even with the passage of time Collinson's film remains impressive in its wit, style and execution.I once had a discussion with a film guru about 'From Here To Eternity' in which I asked why if great films aren't about dialogue they're about 'showing', that FHTE remains one of the truly great films of all time. His conclusion, which I think is correct, was that nobody these days has the ability to write films like From Here to Eternity. It's obvious that no-one can make films like the original 'The Italian Job' either.I took the trouble of hiring out the original, just to see if I had been romancing the past. I hadn't. The original should go down as one of the great British films of all time, the remake will go down in the vast pool of mediocrity that has become American film-making.Awful. Just awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's got Mini Coopers. Yes, it's got a character called Charlie Croker, Yes, it's got someone called Mr Bridger, Yes, it's got gold stolen from an armoured car. Yes, it's got bits of the film shot in Italy.Sadly, that's where the similarities with The Italian Job (1969) end, and this becomes an entirely different film not deserving of the title "The Italian Job". They should have, and could have, given this film it's own title, because it's an entirely different plot. For the rest of my comments, I shall refer to this film as IJ2003, and the original as The Italian Job.There's a cameo role from a single Rover Mini Cooper, but the real action is BMW Mini Coopers; IJ2003 has far more violence and unnecessary killings, maybe this is a sign of the times. In 1969 very few criminals used 'shooters'.In my opinion, if you have seen The Italian Job, and feel like watching IJ2003, because you liked the original film, don't bother. If you haven't seen The Italian Job, go and see the original first, admire it, then go and watch IJ2003, a totally different film without any preconceptions as to what it should be like. You might like some of the sequences. You'll probably come out of it realising that Paramount only made this film because they messed up on the American marketing on the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonsense; but somewhat entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started off okay: the Italian heist scene; But when one of the thief crew, (Edward Norton), decides to take the gold for himself, the situation resulted into the rest of the crew ending up in freezing water, for several minutes - the death time exposure would kill anybody, but the crew lived through it. There must have been some heavy doses of vitamin intake by those guys in preparation for unusual events, because, not only did they live through that, they sat around on the rocks beside the water, in that freezing cold, pondering their next move, which of course, was revenge. And then, the double-crossing 'Norton' ended up in Los Angeles, of all places. Shamefully the movie reverted to a lower class atmosphere. With the 35 million in gold, Norton then buys a house that looks to be worth 30 million. Doesn't figure? To which then all he does, and is concerned about, is to watch TV. Mark Wahlberg gets Charlize Theron, (the daughter of the only crew member to die), to help with the revenge plan; she's a safe-cracking specialist with an idiot passion for driving outrageously. Some hype dung there. Matter of fact there's hype dung everywhere. You've got your typical computer geek--nothing new there. But you don't have your typical ladies man--this guy looks like a street fighter losing his hair, and he's used to seduce a TV cable woman for the purpose of arranging, (wouldn't you know), the look-alike Charlize into getting inside Norton's house: a house that Charlize scans for a safe that might have the gold. Okay, continuing in short: getting to that safe is complex and watchable--street traffic scenes highlight the obtaining of the truck containing the safe. But . . . Man O Man . . . With those dinky cars that they used to transport the gold: one scene--get this, they went into a subway rail system by driving along the platform and then take a right turn to get onto those tracks (ten feet below)! Man, that's just so damn undoable: in actuality they would have nose-dived . . . Crashed and piled up. And that's this movie; it's full of the undoable! --Made because Hollywood only cares about entertainment, not quality. Edward Norton had been getting some respect from me, but now I've lowered him a notch or two. As for the rest of the crew (other than Sutherland): give them pink slips and directions to the Salvation Army.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was the point of making this movie? I went to see it with friends thinking the stunts might be good, but they were nowhere near as impressive as in the original. The stunt with the helicopter was original, but the rest were yawn-inducing. The script is appalling and the resolution of the relationship between Theron and Wallberg at the end was laughable (I dropped my Coke container in the cinema in shock). It was so obviously tacked on to fit the traditional Hollywood hero-gets-the-girl ending. Jason Steatham had some awful lines to deliver. Whereas the original is very tongue-in-cheek, this was too serious and the little humour in it was weak. What is it with screenwriters today? They think they can fill a script with weak one-liners and we'll all be so happy? Mark Walberg is a terrible actor. He ruined Planet of the Apes too (another poor remake). There was no chemistry between Theron and Walberg at all and them getting together at the end was clumsy and contrived. Donald Sutherland had the right idea by dying early on. He didn't need to suffer the rest of it like we did.One of the worst films this year and possibly the worst remake of all time.</fullReview>

My college was presenting a free preview screening of The Italian Job, and I STILL left feeling ripped off. The film is utterly absurd. The dialogue is among the most atrocious that I've ever seen. "You can do it" serves as inspiration. A single moment together is supposed to make the "subplot" of a love story believable. Even the car chases, which I'm told are what made the original stand out, are completely cookie-cutter and uninteresting. I haven't fallen asleep in a movie since I was a little kid, but it took several pokes from a friend to stop it from happening this time. Overall, the plot was ludicrous on all counts, there was absolutely no character development, and even the action scenes were mediocre at best. Hearing the praise that some have chosen to give this movie boggles my mind. It is perhaps one of the worst movies that will be released in 2003. Save your money.

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this movie. I like slick heist movies (Ocean's 11, Good Thief, etc) and i think this is a great cast. But be warned -- there's a reason that Ed Norton didn't want to do this movie and it is very obvious about 2 minutes in.First off, the dialog is terrible. very few "funny" interactions are actually interesting (Seth Green imitating Jason Statham is a notable exception). The director (who has done nothing noteworthy since Friday) clearly didn't care if there was any chemistry on screen or if the words coming out of the actor's mouths actually fit their characters. He just wanted all the words in there. At one point, a Ukrainian does a whole routine about how the CIA rigged the 2000 election -- why even keep that in there?most of the characters have cute nicknames, which just makes the whole script seem even more forced. in the first 20 minutes, you are hit over the head repeatedly about the relationship between Marky Mark and Donald Sutherland so that you know he'll be dead before the second act. obviously there is a romantic relationship that suddenly blossom's between Sutherland's daughter (Theron) and Marky Mark. Like you couldn't see that coming before you even walked into the theater.Speaking of which, Theron clearly filled in for Angelina Jolie, playing exactly the same role that Jolie played in Gone in 60 seconds. there are several points in the movie where she is vulnerable (maybe trying to show more range than Jolie?), and in each of those scenes, when Wahlberg comforts her or says "you can do it", i thought i was going to puke.worst offender of all is Norton who sleepwalks thru one of the least complex characters he has ever played.there are all sorts of continuity problems with the movie and several characters are introduced and then grossly underused (there's a 400 lb somoan looking dude who may have been an interesting character if we saw him for more than 2 minutes).every plot twist is predictable 30 minutes ahead of time, every "funny part" is given away in the trailers (except some of seth green's screen time), and everyone is dragged down by the poor script and direction.

		<fullReview>skip to the end to see the full action climax of car chases.Mark Whalberg &amp; Chalrize Theron starts in the film as robbers who will do anything to steal the gold from Steve(Edward Norton) who early in the film betrayed them.its like this this film was a remake of a old film of the same name but despite the action &amp; plot the film failed to entertain me.i don't know about critics cause they are stupid people also they lie too much.but this film is still worth a watch but only for climax you cannot sit through this the entire time.&amp; what was the villains henchman doing on the bike circling around the streets going up &amp; down the shopping malls. the camera was focused on him all the time.there is also a bollywood remake of this film called players 2012 starting abhishek bachan,which was a flop BTW.heist films like fast &amp; furious work because the involve racing &amp; awesome cars.anyway the Italian job should have been called the L.A job because the setting was in L.A .my rating is 3/10 see Charlize Theron Kicking Butts</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FilmCreature Reviews 'The Italian Job' (2003)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from 'The Italian Job;' and I didn't get much. But what I did get was good: an entertaining, generally well-acted action film with all the right stars. Two Academy-Award nominees, and one Academy Award-winning Charlize Theron.The film starts with a heist worth $35 million. Then, of course, something goes awry. A member of the thieving team betrays everyone else by stealing the money and killing their oldest member, John Bridger. With revenge in mind, Mark Wahlberg and the gang decide to steal that money back. They manage to hire Charlize Theron to work for them (she plays Bridger's daughter, Stella).So, that's the plot. You can guess what happens; good guys win, bad guys lose. What's new? Well, how some really great chase scenes, and a terrifically satisfying ending? Good enough for me.7 Mini Coopers out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old Joke ? .. A Rat Race ? .. Well .. It's The American Job !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon time there was a nice crazy movie named (The Italian Job) from the good old 1960s, and it was just pure fun. As the years passed by it became a classic. To the extent that some of the simple lines of it last as the most memorable ones in the history of cinema ! Actually NO ONE on the plant earth nor the history of mankind would ever know the secret of success; that great ultimate formula to make an immortal movie. But as for the new (Italian Job) I can tell you why it isn't as unique as the original, why despite its fine funny work it hadn't the smash success of the oldest or why it wouldn't have THAT immortality.Firstly consider it as one of the usual events in the early 2000s when Hollywood declared bankrupt (or just about to) with very few original screenplays for the commercial movies ! So you'll have just about all the time : a remake of an old movie ? part 2 and 3 ..etc of that remake of the old movie ! ? sequels for another movie which have nothing to do with it except for the utilization of its popularity ! ? and some movies which are coming from previous ideas : comics, computer games, old TV series, old American movies, old non-American movies.. and so on and on and on ! Like the producers say (To Hell With The New Ideas) ! They go deep for secure formulas from another old ones whether it's American, French, British or Japanese ! As for the first British one, with its new style, joyful atmosphere, witty details and its unfinished ending was a big explosive cinematic Joke ! And when you repeat an old joke what you'll have exactly is : unfunny one ! So maybe this Italian Job's makers realized that early, therefore made totally another thing. It is entertaining as an action flick of 2003. But it's not that good in itself before comparing it to the real Italian Job ! For one reason the pale cast, or perhaps they're good stars whom were so pale in here ! : (Mark Wahlberg) with a face had no features to act !, and who was playing the same character before ?! OOOH.. an insignificant guy named MICHAEL CAINE !!, noticing also that this movie is a bit more complicated as a drama than the first merry adventure, so the poor Wahlberg was in a real deadlock, especially with his genuine icy performance as the cool (Charlie Croker) who was this time cool as inanimate or lifeless ! (Edward Norton) said once that he hated the part and just made it to terminate his contract with the production company. You can watch him here on the brink of mocking at the traditional role and dialogue. One of these times is so obvious at the restaurant scene. And for the love of God aren't both of them, (Wahlberg) and (Norton), so terribly young to be those expert thieves ?!! Also I felt pity for (Charlize Theron). What a fake performance she gave ! Just all of them were cold frozen, not as masterly as the direction of the action parts. But by all means Mr. (F. Gary Gray) was THE responsible. However as always the producers thought that the good action will save the day, forgetting that it won't save EVERY DAY ! As if watching (Theron) doing her driving without stunt will compensate her insipid acting ! There is no deep connection with the original (I should say the inspiration instate !) except for the plan of bold stealing by breakdown the traffic and escaping in mini cars, and that's all !! So it was only a trick to hunt the audience which leads to the other reason that provoked me. Simply this script could make it better as thoroughly another personality for new good action with its own smart paradox between a creative team and narrow-minded evil guy. Though, that had no caring, to make it effective in some way could live after watching ! Moreover they manipulated it in a way which weakened the drama; as you know so well that this intolerant evil guy whose less intelligent sure will going to be vanquished easily by this talented united gang. These "sure" &amp; "easily" once the viewer perceives them, all the weakness will be already there, hitting everything even the general amusing feeling of the whole movie. Because one of the success's holy secrets is mainly in the power of the Script. Technically it's dexterous, all the action is expensively done as the only without-a-doubt-perfect thing in here. But when it comes to the climax I found myself saying (OK OK ! I've seen that before and it had a sprite too !). Well, it's an old joke trying to be new by adding some slight fresh things (a different plot, the plan's technical details) but totally without (The Italian Job - 1969)'s strong impact of surprise or the pristine craze's flavor which made it more naughty, clever and original. Being just another project done with no extraordinary component. I though they shouldn't connect it to the first one in the first place, that wasn't for the sake of anything but deluding us and degrading them! It's like the situation between (It's Mad Mad Mad World) and (Rat Race) 2 years earlier. Which reminds me; when we'll witness the end of this wearisome rat race of remakes as the biggest - most weak - American jobs ever?! Or should I say the end of the American bottleneck ?!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic but Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job is about a robbery done for money and for revenge on a man who betrayed them in an earlier robbery.First off, this is a very entertaining, very cool movie. It glamorizes thievery but also shows a noble side among thieves. Charlize Theron is by far the most attractive woman ever, and in this movie she is just sizzling hot. From every angle she is a work of art.One of the things about this movie that annoyed was the branding. I don't know whether the brands were deliberately there for marketing purposes or whether they were essential for the plot. At the beginning of the film we notice the divers are wearing Casio G-Shocks. One hypothesis is that the film is marketing Casio watches. The other hypothesis is that G-Shocks are normally what divers use anyway because of the brand's shock resistance. There are plenty of references made to Aston Martins, and the film probably help market many new MINIs. Of course, they're not going to use a Ford Suburban for this robbery because of the SUV's size and slowness, so the MINI was probably necessary. The MINI is an icon for many people. Even though MINI is owned by BMW many believe the MINI is a symbol of Britishness. The car's status as a cultural icon is probably what justifies its price premium, as it is about double the price of a Corolla. Probably not worth it for a small car if you were totally utilitarian, but most people don't buy cars just to get from A to B.While watching The Italian Job, I kept thinking to myself how unrealistic the whole plot was. Everything was planned to perfection and only one small thing had to go wrong for everything to fail. For everything to fall into place so perfectly is like flipping a coin twenty times and getting it to land heads up every single time. The film is definitely over-the-top but that was probably what made it so entertaining in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5 1/2 stars, maybe six the first time around. Yes it keeps your attention, yes the visuals, acting and story aren't bad. But there's nothing original, new or amazing here. Its the same "a-team" cookie cutter heist film all over again. But this one comes with lots of bells and whistles and a cute cast. TIJ never is really exciting, it's predictable but in that "you don't really mind cause that's what you expected anyway" kind of way.Mark Wahlberg - not bad here. Sutherland - also not bad here in a small role. Charlize - as always wonderful to watch. She has many better roles. Edward Norton - not top of his game.Good popcorn fun and not a bad film, but overall - average at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well almost! But I enjoyed writing this! Before getting here I read a few comments, I usually do! So I'll follow one of these's advice. I'll light up so, accept I had fun after all. One week ago I hired the 1969 version with M. Caine, for memories sake, I like Michael and did enjoy the return.(I'm over 60)Then the TV screened this one last night. Well I did the unthinkable I kept comparing them with a fairly biased attitude too with lot of knit picking, and almost spoiled it for myself. What really got me is that I actually forgot I had already seen it! Which probably means that I went through a fairly similar experience on the first watch and subconsciously tried to erase it out of my mind, How that for self control! But the minis came on, the bad guy coped it fair and square, the girl looked and drove "good". That's right what more do you want. I was wandering why they did not try to make a new movie on its own right rather than a remake (I understand it's claimed not to be a remake) well without the minis it would not in my way of thinking, and perhaps it would have been a more interesting work. Again without the minis...What would it have been? MB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I somehow thought I had missed something because I hadn't seen the movie until today. I like all the actors (I'm especially a fan of Charlize Theron and Edward Norton) and I like crime movies, and I really liked the trailer. However, I was wrong. Don't get me wrong - it's not a bad movie. But it is just as standard as it gets. It's technically well done, you have a lot of beautiful pictures and pursuits, colors and light are all very nice and the cut is smooth. The script script is 100% writing school style, different characters, a clear objective and plenty of obstacles to overcome, some serious parts but also something to laugh. The acting is just right, because the script is just not courageous enough to call for anything extraordinary. There is even the right amount (which is plenty) of small mistakes to make it just another popcorn movie. The kind you want to see with someone when which movie you watch is not what matters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More like The LA job - that's about the only criticism I have of this movie. Yeah, it does the job, not to complete perfection but it comes pretty close.First I must say though how very little of it resembles the 60's classic - apart from some tuned up minis, fuc*ing up the lights in LA like in Turin and well - getting a load of Gold cause that's their jobs - thieves - albeit very professional.So don't go into it expecting an Italian Job reworking. Its quite a bit different.Lets talk the LA bit. A heist to nick tonnes of gold worth millions takes place in Venice - professionally without any guns. Just explosives and well, they put the modern tech to good use, you know, the laptops and communicative devices like the great mobile phone. Anyway,they probably thought the backdrop of Venice was visually more pleasing than Turin. One of team members involved in the heist double-crosses the rest of them and has his own heist already planned. As a result, the oldest member of the team is shot and dies.The new job - which is a bigger job than the Venice bit is to retrieve the gold - from Los Angeles! So being the bigger job, they really should have called this either the American Job or the Los Angeles Job. Makes sense doesn't it?The film slows down a bit once they get to LA. The gang made up of the old thief who died - his daughter (Charlize Theron), Mark Wahlberg - the leader and some other guys including Seth Green - the PC brains. They go on a, at times, precarious and life-threatening mission to get the gold, using Charlize to their advantage as the bloke who stole the Gold ain't got a clue who she is.So to conclude, a generally nice, well paced action movie with a decent cast and there should be a nice sequel - The Brazilian Job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible heist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job was as greatly thought out as Charlie's detailed plans in the movie. I may not be a Roger Ebert, but I am hoping that my review is respectable in saying that it well-fit the description of a must-see movie. The Italian Job goes along the lines of action and comedy, yet a touch of romance for those type of viewers as well. I was actually amazed that such a male dominated movie did not contain any sex-oriented scenes. Without that being the point, the audience is introduced to a number of interesting and entertaining characters who have nothing in common other than a good heart, great motivation, and immense knowledge in each of his or her trade. As the movie succeeds in putting its viewers mentally in the heist with Charlie and the gang, each chase and heart-racing moment is an adrenaline rush. The Italian Job is a movie for those that admire masterminds filled with imagination and have a love for adventure. Thus allowing those who want to create diversions and act on such genius plans to be taken on that intense ride through the movie and feel accomplished. It is just that type of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlize Theron is a knockout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donald Sutherland plays a notorious safecracker who is in for one last job. Mark Wahlberg (as Charlie Croker) and Edward Norton are two of his accomplices. Charlize Theron plays Sutherland's daughter. She's also a safecracker having learned everything from her father. Seth Green (from Austin Powers), Mos Def and Jason Statham round out the gang. Because of plot twists you can't say much more about the plot of this movie. It does have its surprises. This is basically a fun movie although there is some PG13 violence in the beginning. The planning of the heist and car chases with the mini Coopers are fun. This is a solid action movie and worth spending your time watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the greatest picture, but an enjoyable enough movie.POSSIBLE SPOILERS I like Mark Wahlberg's character. He plays Charlie, the tough, but easygoing leader of a gang of thieves. He is the heir apparent, and takes over leadership of the crew from retiring thief legend and father figure, played by Donald Sutherland. The crew pulls off a successful "Italian Job", a gold heist, but are ripped off by a slimy crewmember, played by Ed Norton. During the rip-off, Sutherland is killed.The majority of the movie takes place a year later, as the crew forms once again to take revenge, and get the gold back.The director keeps the action and the plot moving along pretty well, and the cast are likable, and seem to be having a good time.Not an award winner, and there might be plot holes, but it is an enjoyable, decently made movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect a whole lot from this film but was pleasantly surprised. Mark Walhberg was fantastic in the role of Charlie Croker and was the most original character of the bunch. But with Edward Norton once again playing the betraying thief (see The Score) I kept expecting for Robert De Niro to waltz on screen. I love Edward Norton and this sort of roles really suits him. The betrayal of the group was far too predictable, as was the ending. Because honestly, that's just how betraying heist movies are!! It was far more than I expected in the humor area, it gives you a few good laughs, mostly from Seth Green. Even though I had the entire plot and conclusion of the film figured out maybe 5 minutes into the movie, I enjoyed it greatly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the architectural aspect of Venice;set designs of Steve's mansion; the nod to Philadelphia's Logan Square as Stella speeds through it;and even Marlena Shaw's "California Soul" played in the background as the team flies to L.A. in the minute montage. Ed Norton's portrayal as a bad guy is fantastic.Norton can easily play the good guy innocent(like in Fight Club), but they need to go into (in the Italian Job II) 1.)why Steve turned on his partners;2.)do a montage of past heists together. (Remember the 'Who got you the BeeKeepers in Budapest'line,while Steve is pouring the paint-on explosives?)After all,this was not his first heist with them.Can they do movie magic &amp; bring back John Pritchard (Sutherland);delve into how Charlie and John met.Characters like Skinny Pete, Cousin Moscovitz,Left Ear, Handsome Rob, and Lyle -the 'Real Napster'.Wouldn't it be funny, in a montage,to see a Federal Judge rule in favor of Lyle, that he created Napster, then poor Lyle gets socked with a judgment from the record companies for Napster stealing music files in the same proceeding.So Lyle has to go on more heists to pay off all of the Napster's judgments and court fees, due to his old roommate's misfeasance. Just an idea. (Copyrighted Idea by hectora1a@yahoo.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun remake, but could've been better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of 'The Italian Job' is certainly not better than original, but it is actually a fairly easy film to watch. The original was problematic because there was no driving force to the plot- except the crime itself involving those celebrated Mini Coopers, and Caine's charismatic performance. In the remake, the plot is driven by revenge, and that works fairly well. Of course, the trademark minis are featured again and that works well in the climax! Although the location is changed from Italy to America! Mark Whalberg's Charlie Crocker is no Michael Caine's Charlie Crocker in this movie, and he doesn't really add much to it (I know Mark Whalberg has more potential than this). Donald Sutherland is short-lived as the new John Bridger. Charlize Theron is okay, and Edward Norton makes an okay villain (pity, you can tell his disinterest in the movie creeps into his performance every now and then). It was the supporting cast that actually makes this film worthwhile- Seth Green as Lyle, Jason Stratham as Handsome Rob and Mos Def as Left Ear! They all added the much needed humour and kept the story going, and were memorable support- unlike the crew in the original film which only had Crocker and Bridger as memorable faces.F. Gary Gray, director of 'A Man Apart' (2003) and 'Friday' (1995), does well with the chase sequences, and the pacing of this film. Unfortunately, the main performances seem too restrained and lack conviction to make this film surpass the remake. Plot-wise, this version is better structured, but the original Crocker and the original Bridger are far more memorable. I think Gray could have aimed a little higher when remaking this movie! Purists may hate the remake, simply because it is a remake, however, 30 years later is a fairly big gap! It certainly doesn't dishonour the original like the remake of 'Get Carter' did! Like I said, not as good as the original, but easy and fun to watch! *** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Heist Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original film and therefore cannot compare, however, whatever was unique about that one seems to be missing, except for maybe the ending.The acting is flat and uninspired - you've got Wahlberg and Theron as your stars? Yikes. (Apparently Norton made it clear this was a contract and you can tell he hates being here, which maybe helped his performance as a villain). The characters are all clichés from other heist films: explosives guy (also token black guy), computer nerd/comic relief, "crazy" foreign dude/driver, hot girl and way too cool hero. There is not really any character development as this is plot driven and action heavy, not that this is necessarily bad.The technicals (sound, lighting, cinematography) are all great but the real winner here is the editing pumped up by a steady soundtrack. Without giving much away the best part is the ending. This film is not really memorable but it is entertaining Hollywood action and I can't say I disliked it, but it's nothing spectacular.As the title implies, this is just another job for everyone involved (which explains the average acting).OVERALL: 6/10. Fun to rent and watch once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definitely better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw both the original and this re-make and I must say that this is much better than the first. Although, according to the DVD commentary, the writers for this film didn't actually see the original before writing for this one, it really looks as if they did and made a conscious effort to improve on it. Because where the original seemed to meander and drag, this one quickly takes you into the story and continues non-stop until the finish. And while the first lacked emotional punch, the re-make added some via the seeking of revenge for death of the team's father figure. And I liked the way how the mini-cooper was introduced by allowing us to see its usefulness early on in the film so that we could understand the team's choice for it in their heist. In the first film, the mini-coopers were simply arbitrarily chosen with little reason as to why. The heist and getaway plan in this film was more intricate, clever and interesting than the one in the first. In short, this is a fast-paced, exciting and smart film. The original was just too slow and boring. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't hold high hopes when I picked up the VCDs because neither the cover nor the blurb is attractive. However the more my eyes rolls over it, the more earnest my heart grows. Now I am even tempted to see the 1969 Michael Caine production. It remains me a Hong Kong hi-tech stealing movie "Downtown Torpedoes".The death of John Bridger causes his daughter and his "co-workers" to retaliate with a vengeance to cook up an international $35 million Bali dancer gold bar heist carefully. Their plan is perfect, flawless and the car racing-chasing scenes though not stunning, it's well-designed. Bravo to the safecracking skills and the building blasting skills!One mis-cast is Edward Norton. He expressed that doing this project is out of responsibility but not choice. Well, this tells why his face does not match the ambiance. His face is not villain-looking, not cunning even though he wears a mustache. John Travolta, Clive Owen, Tim Roth all can replace him. Strangely, the top-notch team is too gentleman-looking, too soft, craftier faces are wanted.Thank God it's a decent action film of brain-teasing game and rivalry, it doesn't reek of sex, however, it might be due to this spicy void that the box office gave a less satisfactory report, and a re-release was desired. It's a sacred formula of Hollywood movie that: "sex it up and sell it well".If a love or sex scene is to be inserted to vacuum up more money, easy, Charlie and Stella strip, but first kick out Mark Wahlberg, put Ethane Hawke or Brad Pitt or Keanus Reeves instead. And bingo, bingo, money will come.It is evident that cinematography is not the selling point, and so my beloved San Marco Piazza, Venezia water canals are portrayed as drab district, mamma mia. If cinematography is done by Giles Nuttgens, the screen vision should surely be entirely different. The beauty of this world famous scenic city will be exposed to its fullest. Nevertheless, the music team deserves kisses because the music score has compensated the visual flaw, a suspense is successfully created through out the film.</fullReview>

Well basically because it takes the recipe for a classic heist movie and updates to suit a new millennium.You have all the stereotypes in there, the nerd that break into every computer in the world, the explosives expert, the babe, the brains and of course the 'crook that can't be trusted' which in itself is a paradox.You have a big loot, state of the art alarm systems, computers, guards, guard dogs, the police, Russians - and not least 3 tuned Mini Coopers.All in all you have all the ingredients for a classic heist-movie.The good thing about the movie is that it doesn't spend too much time 'assembling the squad' - that is taken care of before we enter the movie, so most of the focus is on the actual heists.The acting is decent, but not overwhelming and the plot does offer some twist and turns, which makes it an enjoyable ride from start to finish.It isn't better than the original - but then again it doesn't try to be either as it changes the premises by changing the plot - and it isn't better than Ocean's 11 either, where I think the acting is better.It is still recommendable, and I have given it a 7 (out of 10 naturally - I follow the standard IMDb scale).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>larger then life exciting heist film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best words to describe The Italion Job are: THRILLING,LARGER THEN LIFE, FUN, ELECTRIC, UNREALISTIC AND EXCITING.WARNING: SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!Who cares if this movie is unrealistic? Man, what a wild ride! This movie reminded me alot of Ocean's 11 and it creates the same effect which is to basically keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the length of the picture. This is a movie where,like Ocean's 11, you can't leave your seat for even 1 minute or you'll miss something important(trust me I did.) It is also a movie with some of the best direction and coolest soundtracks I've heard and seen in awhile. It is a movie to just lose yourself in for 2 hours-no thought on the reality of the story, no thought at all-just sit back and enjoy the ride!I like heist movies and this one was incredibly well done so I liked it ALOT-I could see someone to whom this genre of movies does not appeal NOT liking it but I still thought it was great(8.5) though I still like Ocean's 11 a wee bit better.The direction and cinemotography were excellent-the views of Venice and the Alps were breathtaking-and the whole feel of the pic was larger then life-I would easily recommend this movie as a rental to someone who has not seen it-Norton,Theron, all the stars are at the top of their craft and the ending is suitably satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good flick to watch with parents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER! My parents were in town the last weekend of June, so we caught two movies. We saw Bruce Almighty and Italian Job. I think we all like Italian Job more.It was a good little action flick. Even though I am sick of seeing Mark Walberg in movies, I enjoyed this movie. It starts with a safe heist by a group of hi-tech thieves. The group is double-crossed by a member of the team played by Edward Norton. The team re-groups and decides it is time to take action and get back the stolen gold that should have been theirs in the first place.They scope out the house make a plan to rob the person that double-crossed them. He finds out, so they must change the plan to steal the money during transport. The plan involves blowing out the road and dropping the armored transport onto the subway. It is pretty ingenious and original and the movie stays fast paced with car chases. I love the Mini's in the movie. There is a car chase in the movie motorcycles chase the Mini's throughout the bottom of the subway system, and the Mini's are later chased by helicopter in the air. I think the next car I get will be a Mini. I probably cannot afford the Americanized, high priced model. I would love to get my hands on an original low priced European model, (like Mr. Bean's car). In the end they get the gold and live out their dreams. 8/10, but then again I am the drunken_critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not too bad, good action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the movie was a remake from a 60's film.the actors were good overall. the chase scene ***SPOILER*** when they where setting up the armored trucks from the driveway got a little silly to say the least. the truck falling through the street scene was cheesy at best...if you notice the clip from the drivers seat, as soon as the street started to cave in the truck started falling like it should have ( nose first- because of the weight of the engine) then the lower shot of it falling from the street to the floor, the truck landed perfectly on all 4 wheels... very UN-realistic. the director should have fixed that scene before wrapping up the shooting. another thing i didnt like was the fact that ed norton had millions of dollars in gold in one of those 3 trucks...now who in their right mind would be 300 ft in the air from it, especially if you knew somebody was TRYING to get it , like your old enemy. not to mention the fact norton is a millionaire why only 3 trucks? why not 10? for real confusion...again very UN-realistic. if it was my gold i would be in the truck with it, DARING somebody to touch it. there were some cheesy parts and lame set-ups but overall if you want a pretty good action movie to entertain you for a couple, then its a renter, and a buyer if you can get it used somewhere. oh last complaint after the truck falls through the street, they cover the hole up with a big metal sign from the side of a parked truck. norton loses his view of the truck for just a breif time , so he couldnt see what had happened. well when they finally get around the building that was blocking his view ( in the helicopter) he notices the truck was gone and screams " where the hell did my truck go?" where's it at? what happened? now anybody with any common sense can plainly see the smoke and the sign laying on the road in place of the truck- especially with the gap in the traffic where the truck was...why scream what happened to my truck?...it would have been more realistic for it to have dawned on him (norton) the same way it would have dawned on me...i wouldnt have been whinning wheres my truck...i would have been yelling at the motorcycles to get their asses down below the street. that scene just happened a little to slow and cheesy for me, it could have been better(the scene). but like i said overall a good renter!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'm partial to the odd heist movie from time to time. You generally know what to expect, so the success of the film is measured by how much fun it is. The Italian Job certainly delivers on that account.The gang's all there: the old guy on his last job, his heir apparent, the slightly shifty guy, the nerdy computer guy (Seth Green is excellent!), the muscle guy and the oddjob guy. And away we go - it's good fun watching the original heist, and then we come to the fairly predictable twist (which I won't give away here). After that, the rest of the gang obviously try to get the loot back from the traitor, with their plotting - and therefore the film - occasionally more than slightly reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven.OK, the film might be played by the numbers a bit; Mark Wahlberg will forever remain Marky Mark for me, and not a leading man; the car chases are overlong if good (how much did Mini pay them?) - but the script is fast-paced, happily devoid of soppy love-scenes and basically, any film (except maybe Trapped) that is willing to devote a lot of screen time to the ever delectable Charlize Theron gets two thumbs up from me on general grounds. In short, the film does exactly what it says on the tin - it's one of the better movies I've seen this year. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess I have not recalled having watched any Heist movies before, having missed out on 3 Kings and Ocean's eleven, both George clooney vehicles. The last show i watched resembling something of a heist was Out of Sight. Was it another Clooney show?Hence comparing The Italian job to Out of Sight is a definite no-brainer. I was blown away by the elaborate plot, which was executed with much panache and finesse. The characters unfortunately were too one-dimensional. This was a movie in which the plot was the star and nothing else. Maybe i make an exception for Charlize Theron!Lucily there is no love scene in this movie. Lesser plots would have been saddled with sappy romance, but the director instead chooses to inundate scenes of mark wahlberg and charlize thereon with hints of sexual tension. Maybe I'm unconsciously referring to Out of Sight, but subtlety is simply more effective.I rate this movie the best Hollywood action movie i've watched in a long time, having sweared off hollywood after the disastrous Bad Boyz 2. Unfortunately Edward Norton can do much better I'm sure, having seen what he had achieved in American history X, Fight Club and Red Dragon.Rating : 7.3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And dont forget to book your Mini test drive in the foyer after the movie..!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of Peter Collinson's popular 1969 caper set me thinking about comparisons between the movie's star cars, the Mini Cooper S. In many ways the new film resembles the new car; bigger, better built, competent, yet utterly lacking in character, relevance or the intangible fun factor. Despite a lively start in Venice (providing the only pretext for the film's title), The Italian Job soon showed signs of triteness and thin characterisation. Sutherland's 'Mr Bridger' was played with a sort of fluffy-haired, huggy beneficence that instantly marked him out for a predictable death. King-of-the-remakes Wahlberg once again demonstrated his brilliant future in rap music, and Charlize Theron provided an attractive, if vapid and rather anaemic love interest. Only Edward Norton's character played anything remotely like the clever criminal personalities supposedly involved. For a 'caper' film, the plot was disappointingly linear with none of the intrigue, paranoia or suspenseful setbacks one would have expected in this genre. The Ukrainian mafia was a token nod to the Italians of the original (are Italian gangsters in America thought passe by now?) yet thrown in almost as an afterthought, and serve only to provide the Norton character with his inevitable undoing. The writers obviously felt they needed a handy way of avoiding blood on the hands of our saintly anti-heroes. Even continuity errors don't seem to trouble the producers' pursuit of mediocrity - a motorcycle with rider crashes into the door of one of the Minis during the chase only to cause it no damage in the ensuing scenes. The original Italian Job had eccentricity, wit, colour, the clash of English versus Continental cultures, and above all, class. The remake is nothing but Starbucks coffee in a brightly coloured styrofoam cup. In view of the fact that similar territory has been covered recently (and so much better) anyway, by Ocean's Eleven and The Score makes me wonder why the project was even considered viable. In this age of product placement I have a sneaking suspicion that BMW may have had a hand in the funding somewhere.. 4/10</fullReview>

The issue is, why is Hollywood continuely making these remakes? Most do not make money. It seems that the heads of the studios there have very little up top. Relying on title recognition to sell the tickets! As a film maker with more than a dozen original scripts sitting on my desk, it appears to me that originality is no longer the bye-word in Hollywood. It was Hollywood that led the world in originality. Now every movie has to cost US$50M minimum, lacks originality and is full of talentless or ill fitting stars. Charlie's Angels &amp; Mission Impossible screwed with the original style, Psycho should never have been remade.... the list goes on.... for goodness sake someone in Hollywood go and give the studio heads all a labotomy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job is a complete film with few weak links. The acting is superb - and by extension the casting. Well directed, great camera work, good special effects - but the writing is what I believe set it apart and took it to the next level. The inevitable comparisons to Soderberg's "Oceans 11" are unfair to Italian Job in my opinion. I felt this film was much better written, the acting was better and overall execution a cut above what Oceans 11 accomplished. When watching the latter, I felt like it was more escapist entertainment, whereas Italian Job did a much better job of drawing me in to the story -and- entertaining me.The criticisms that Wahlberg didn't have enough 'charisma' to pull off the leading male role in this film are unfounded. If they came from the same people who gushed over Clooney in Oceans 11, then they obviously value Clooney's 'pretty boy charm' over Wahlberg's more substantive acting talent.If you haven't seen this one, you should. It has a much broader appeal over more audience segments than most films of its type.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that there is some ballot stuffing at work here. This movie does not deserve a 6.9 rating. I think most people who saw this movie thought it was crap. There should be better policing of the responses because there is manipulation at work probably from movie distribution companies to improve the rating.In the movie, in the early scene the team of crooks are double-crossed by the wimpy villain who attempts to murder the rest of the crew after the original heist for reasons that are not shown.In real life, they would have tracked him down, tortured him, took the gold and that would be it. I had to turn it off (saw it on cable) when the villain starts to manhandle Theriz Theron in the restaurant and the others show up to protect her. They just walked away. They should have waited for him outside the restaurant, beat the crap out of him, and wimp that he is, gotten the gold from him, then made him disappear.The whole plot is absurd from start to finish. The whole good guy robbers thing just does not work. Probably the reason why the movie is so bad is that it lacks any kind of passion.Some other reviewer made the point that if these guys were so cool and so "good" why would they disrupt traffic in the middle of the day in a busy city and not stop to think that many innocent people would be killed.Also, Hollywood thinks that anything is possible technologically. One smart guy can hack into the traffic system of a major city and control it for ten minutes. Ridiculous. So much of the slop that comes out of the movie industry just does not make sense.Also, the way the car expert walks up the cable woman who is drop dead grogeous and is a look-alike the Theron is ridiculous. What are the chances of driving up to the cable parking lot and finding the right person. Why even waste time on that part. It seemed so silly and trivial. And what could he have said to her anyway? This scene was totally unnecessary and obviously was just a filler because they had to stretch out the movie.And the acting is atrocious. Theron is like a manikin. Walberg is not convincing as a crook and seems like he is playing the role in his sleep. The rest of the crew is even worse.It is not even worth watching on cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Italian Job" is a remake which pays homage to the original, but creates an enviable legacy of its own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The faithfulness of re-made films to their original material run the gamut from shot-for-shot remakes, like 1998's "Psycho" (starring then little-known Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche), all the way to movies that bear almost no resemblance to the original except for the title and basic concept, like 2013's "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Sean Penn). 2003's "The Italian Job" is somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter. This movie is a remake of the 1969 Michael Caine vehicle of the same name, and known as one of Britain's most popular films. The 2003 version is, according to director F. Gary Gray, "an homage" that is "inspired by the original". The remake changes the location of the story's main caper, but keeps the focus on stealing gold bullion. The homage aspect of the remake can be seen in the names of some of the characters (even though their roles in the plot are different), the part of the plan that involves carefully controlling the escape route, the prominent use of the Mini Coopers, an escape through a small tunnel and a dramatic scene in which a vehicle is perched precariously over a large drop. But I'm getting ahead of myself.2003's "The Italian Job" begins with a creative and daring heist of $35 million worth of gold bullion in Venice, Italy. The gang consists of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg, in the Michael Caine role), Steve (Edward Norton), "Handsome Rob" (Jason Statham), "Napster" (Seth Green), "Left Ear" (Mos Def) and the group's senior member (pulling his final job), John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). After cleverly making off with the gold, the crew is celebrating on a mountain road in the Alps (also a setting from the original film), when John praises Charlie (the group's new leader) for planning the perfect robbery and pulling it off "without even holding a gun." Unfortunately, the group doesn't get much farther than that. One of their own turns on them, leaves them all for dead and makes off with the gold.The story now jumps ahead one year. The original group's traitor is living large in his L.A. mansion, while those he thought were dead are planning to steal back what remains of the gold bars. John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), an expert safecracker like her father, joins the gang. They also take on a mechanic named Wrench (Franky G), who the group needs to customize those Mini Coopers that are essential to the plan ? and so prominent in the story that Gray referred to them as "part of the cast." After dealing with some unexpected challenges and having to completely change their plan, Charlie and his crew go after the gold in a climax that is even more inventive and exciting than the original robbery in Venice."The Italian Job" is exactly what a movie like this should be ? a whole lot of fun! Every cast member is fun and interesting to watch and they have great chemistry between them. The story contains some clichés, but you won't care. The screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers has some very funny moments amidst all the scheming and double-crossing. Gray balances it all perfectly, makes the whole thing entertaining and what comes out is a "Job" definitely worth having.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A First Class Action Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is clearly an action film, however, it is refreshingly different than anything before it. Without giving away the story, these characters are not children... and the film is not geared towards the teen market as so many action films are. The characters are largely the late 20s and early 30s group, they devise several unique and clever plots to steal gold from Italy and to keep it. They also drive speedy little cars.... not because they are fast, but rather because they can weave in and out of narrow spaces. A feature that is totally unique in "chase films".The characters are also on the educated and sophisticated side.... and are clearly not "trendy". The score is interesting and does not rely too heavily on rock or rap music, but has a totally new "chill" score that lends itself to the sophistication in the tone of the film. The photography is first rate and the BIG chase scene is miraculously performed in the packed streets of Los Angeles and Hollywood with all the crowds and traffic totally intact. How they did it, is truly beyond me. A nail biter from beginning to end. This is everything "The Fast and the Furious" should have been, but was not. I place this on a par with "Gone in 60 seconds" and "Speed" for action, story and trills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this on the cable TV last night, and probably would have liked it better in the theater. It really needs to be on a big screen for good impact. The acting is passable to very good, but these are characters we've all seen before with very little beyond stereotypes. The whole story is telegraphed in the first half hour and the only thing to keep interest is how they'll do it. We know they'll go after the gold and get even with Steve, but how will it be done? That's really the only question in any of these gang retaliation type of stories. Basically these are set up so that we have a bunch of bad guys versus a bunch of worse bad guys, so we root for the lesser bad guys. Really typical and not at all original. And the character of Steve by Edward Norton was more like Norton of THE HONEYMOONERS. What an incompetent and weak-kneed crime lord. He looked as though he could have been done in by a minimum wage security guard. Definitely in the running for the puniest criminal in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>even though the whole idea was a played out takeoff on oceans 11, styx, and many other caper movies, with a team of thieves broken down into specialties, the explosives guy, the computer guy, the safe cracking guy, the overall brain of operations, etc, the movie itself was entertaining from start to finish and i can honestly say, that there wasn't a moment when i was bored and despite the copy catting, i enjoyed watching all the different specialists work together to show how an age old job can be pulled off by thives with 21st century technology, even though im not a movie expert and i really dont know the difference between good and bad acting, i think that edward norton, matt damon, mark walberg and company did a really good job this movie really was as good as advertised so i really reccomend it if your in the mood for a good ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was glad to see this movie was as good as it was. I never imagined that it could have been good but it was. And to think that this was expected to be nominated for some Razzies, bah. This movie has humor, action, and a nice heist theme. This is one of the rare heist movies that actually work. Bravo to Gary for his fine directing and a good performance by everyone in the cast. Good summer movie that is highly recommendable. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was good! - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Italian Job", I thought, was a really good movie. It had great action, car chases (which I love), some pretty good eye candy (Edward Norton and Mark Wahlberg), and not too much violence. I just knew that Edward Norton was gonna be the backstabber during the whole heist sequence because they didn't show him that much and when the crew was standing around talking about what they were gonna do with the money the camera kept shooting back to him. And he wasn't saying that much. The Mini Coopers were so cute! I think they were more the stars of the movie than the actual actors themselves. "The Italian Job" is one of the best heist movies. I loved all the action sequences. Especially with the helicopter scene and the part where Mark Wahlberg and his crew blew Edward's truck underground and Ed was like "What the f--k happened to my truck!" Sorry. I loved that part. His character was really evil. He felt absolutely no remorse for killing Donald Sutherland. I also thought the scene where Mark Wahlberg and the crew confronted Steve (Edward Norton) in the restaurant when he was on his date with Stella (Charlize Theron)was pretty slick. This was a great action movie. It was absolute fun to watch and all the actors knew how they were supposed to star in this movie. This is definitely one I'd like to own. For those of you who like great heist movies, this is one you should see. "The Italian Job" rules! Edward Norton should stay far away from mustaches!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but not as `fun' as I'd expected it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a daring gold robbery by stealth and cunning in Venice, a group of criminals celebrate their job. However one of the group, Steve, turns on them, killing John and leaving the rest for dead. The rest survive and one year later they find Steve selling the gold in LA. They recruit John's daughter Stella, an expert safe cracker, in order to steal back his gold and thus get revenge.While I was writing a review of the video game about a year ago I spotted that this remake was in production. I'll admit that my initial thoughts were `sweet Jesus' and `not everything should be remade', but I was still open to seeing it and, by now, those thoughts had subsided a bit. The film opens hesitantly and the early scenes with Charlie and John positively stutter. After the first job the film really picks up and gets enjoyable without every really letting rip. The downside of this is that it never really becomes a feel good spectacle in the same OTT way that the original was. Yes, some moments are funny and the final job is quite exciting and quite clever but it isn't `fun' in the way I'd hoped.Some scenes are really weak and I'm sad to say they are most of the ones that rely on Wahlberg. His scenes (with Theron and Sutherland) are quite dry and he fails to captivate as a leading man. Thank God then, for a pretty good support cast. No, I don't mean Theron, although she is used for her looks quite well, but the male cast. The rest of the gang bring the laughs and the characters, they are not as emotionally important to the story as Charlie and are much better for it. Statham does good work and is cool and funny, Green is as good as you'd hope he'd be ? although his Napster stuff gets a bit tired after a while. The highlight for me again was Mos Def ? this is the second time in a few months he has been in a small support role but has lifted a film (Brown Sugar being the other). All three do good jobs round the edges and help support the very iffy Wahlberg.I enjoyed Edward Norton even if he was clearly slumming it a little bit. I detected a bit of mischief in his eyes when his character is placed second after Charlie by John ? ironic as Wahlberg was favoured to play Charlie over Norton who wanted the role!The mini action is good as it doesn't use effects to a great effect ? almost a good old fashioned car chase ? but to say it compares to some of the other chases this summer is just silly. Overall this is an enjoyable film but is weak at it's core and suffers as a result. The film doesn't flow as freely as it should and it is only the enjoyable car chases and sterling work by the Mighty Mos et al, that lifts it to be better than the sum of it's parts. Not great but enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The Italian Job' was entertaining. The two capers were inventive and exciting and the product placement car scenes were fun. The acting was okay. There wasn't a whole lot you could do with the trite dialogue. It was an action movie. When there wasn't action on the screen the movie lagged. Charlize Theron was sufficiently babish to sustain interest in non-action scenes. The characters were a clichéd lot of movie types. The computer hacker stereotype allows for awkward plot developments to be remedied with five key strokes. Overall the movie did its job of providing good summer entertainment. The pace was, mostly, fast and the characters were appealing. Worth a watch.</fullReview>

The film is a simple storyline with some good characters and the script is quite witty and sharp.Mark Wahlberg takes the lead and does well, he is ably supported by Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland and Seth Green and Ed Norton appears as the bad guy of the picture. The pacing is good as the climactic heist builds up and is planned and there is some intelligence and imagination in how they pull it off.The action is exciting and director F Gary Gray shows some real flair. The chase and heist scenes are very good. Overall this is one of the surprises of the summer, a surprise critical and box office hit. ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now in a summer of bad movies, this one definitely stands out as one of the best films. From start to finish this film is one giant action ride that leaves you wanting more. I really liked Edward Norton in this movie, it could be one of his best, if not his best role. If you are a fan of caper movies than this movie is for you.I'd give this movie a B+It only lacked a better cast. I think Brad Pitt would have been better in the Charlie Croker role that Mark Wahlberg had. Charlize Theron is as good as ever, and Seth Green while a very funny actor, I think overplayed his part as the computer hacker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Little Crime Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no real lead in this film, everyone has their own moment and everyone does a good job. I can't help but be a little cynical as just about every movie is like this one. Every movie is a crime movie almost, but this one has a quirky feel to it, not so ultra cool appeal to it that other movies have. Mark Wahlberg actually does a good job as the films lead, Edward Norton is a good villain as well.The movie is a remake of a 1969 film starring Michael Caine, as of yet I have not seen the original. This movie does have a lot of clever moments and really keeps your interest the whole way through. Every character has something they are good at and their talent helps toward the caper. Mos Def does an excellent job as the explosive expert and Seth Green is pretty good as the computer whiz.I also like this movie because it appeared that there was little if any product placement. There was a very good scene where Handsome Rob sees a sign that shows the amount of smoking deaths and he quite smoking. In an era where cigarette companies are paying celebrities on screen to smoke that is a welcome change. Overall this is a nicely done little film.It's not a great movie though. There is just something missing that leaves a little to be desired. I guess in the end the movie met my standards, it did not exceed what I expected it did not go below what I expected. I guess that is OK in a time when so few movies are good at all and other movies have so much needless blood and gore. This movie actually has an intelligent script and good dialogue.The movie has some funny moments, some sad moments and definitely is at the level. The locations in Venice and Philadelphia are another interesting point of this movie. Donald Sutherland, the veteran actor has a small part in the movie and does a good job in a small part. If you want something a little different and pretty good this is a good movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`The Italian Job' is a movie that won't disappoint, but won't leave you amazed, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone loves a good heist flick. But it's hard today to make an original one-probably the reason why some modern heist flicks have been remakes such as `The Thomas Crown Affair' and `Ocean's Eleven.' Now, we have the remake of the 1969 film, `The Italian Job.' It's easy to conclude that the main reason Hollywood remakes older films is because they are just trying to cash in on a dead movie. However, if they can do it as good as the original or better, than perhaps that does warrant remaking a motion picture. `The Italian Job,' from director F. Gary Gray (`A Man Apart') was a good film, but its one problem may rest in the fact that heist flicks are becoming less intriguing and more of cliché. `The Italian Job' is the story of a group of thieves who while trying to steal gold in Venice are betrayed by one of their members, Steve (Edward Nortin), who kills their boss, John (Donald Sutherland), and takes the gold from the group of thieves. After a period of time, the friends regroup under the leadership of one of the members who felt that John was like a father to him, Charlie (Mark Wahlberg). Under new guidance, they try to steal back the gold from Steve. But they can't do it alone-they need the help of John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron). The film moves towards a revenge scenario, as the group not only tries to get the gold back, but also avenge the death of John. `The Italian Job' has its moments that require a person to suspend disbelief. For example, in the scene where Steve betrays the others, their van crashes off of a bridge and they fall into a frozen mountain lake, as Steve peppers the icy water with bullets. It's amusing that, with the exception of John, all the men survive the frozen water. After they come out of the water, they even have time to grieve a bit over the death of John, regardless of the cold temperatures and that they are still wearing their soaking wet clothes. The film was well made, though. Director Gray did a good job with making some suspenseful moments during a chase scene between a helicopter and three Mini cars. The movie also has its humorous moments, the best of which involve Seth Green who plays Lyle. According to Lyle, he invented the Napster music-sharing phenomenon while his roommate in college, Shawn Fanning, stole the disc with the program on it while Lyle was sleeping. Hence the reason while Lyle refers to himself as the original Napster. Although `The Italian Job' was a good movie that was fun at times, it just didn't feel all that enthralling. The reason rests in the notions that heist films, or confidence scheme movies are becoming more of a cliché where we can predict everything before it happens. Also, the trailers for this film just ruined any surprises that the audience could take away from the film. It would be wiser to download the two and a half-minute trailer online than to pay full theatrical prices to sit through the two-hour movie. However, if you have the time and ambition to do so, `The Italian Job' is a movie that won't disappoint, but won't leave you amazed either. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raises the bar on the Gold standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Italian Job" is carried out by real pros, a delight from beginning to end, with superlative casting, clever dialogue and one beautifully-directed scene after the other. The film, a re-tooling of the earlier Michael Caine movie of the same name, has the simplest of plots: get the gold, lose the gold, get the gold back. It's the way it's done that elevates this one: all the characters are well-written, it's got the perfect amount of tongue-in-cheekedness (is that a word?!), the style AND the substance are there in equal part, and it's supremely easy on the eyes to boot.Particularly outstanding: Charlize Theron (dazzlingly gorgeous as always, with a well-played touch of vulnerability underneath her character's more-than-capable exterior), Donald Sutherland (elegant and cool in his brief appearance), Seth Green (as the self-titled "real" Napster, who gets to play God with the Hollywood traffic grids in his very own "matrix"), and Mark Wahlberg (in a perfectly nuanced performance, controlled and clearly on top of his game). And oh yeah, Edward Norton as the slime-bucket who gets his just desserts is sufficiently and sublimely sleazy. (Think he's been taking Dustin Hoffman lessons in his spare time.) In the movie, "FINE" stands for "freaked-out, Insecure, Neurotic and Emotional". . .but in the case of this review, it just stands for Fine.</fullReview>

Ed Norton played an excellent villain who said in the movie, right or wrong, I don't care, it's about what I want. His character had no morals which explained why he was able to turn on his follow thieves. The director left no stone unturned. Every word and action was accounted for and in my opinion, that's a huge contributor to what makes a good flick. While nothing new was introduced, the movie had some of the best car chases I've seen in a while. The plot was good and the actors were excellent. I thought The Italian job was well cast and the story was well acted and well told.The action was endless and I had such satisfaction because the ending was soooo... sweet.

		<fullReview>On June 27th, I stood outside of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to possibly meet Edward Norton or Mark Wahlberg. The only star I met was Jessica Alba, but I did see Mark and Seth Green arrive in their Mini Coopers. Later, we were handed some tickets and got to see the movie! It was GREAT!!! Seth Green was funny, they were all funny. And Charlize Theron actually kept her clothes on! One of the best heist movies yet!! I think I'll go see it again (with appropriate seating). There was tons of action, great humor, and a creative plot. And it wasn't cheesy; hardly any guns, no ridiculously extreme cars (only a few Mini Coopers) and no obvious, fake computer graphics (ex: Spider-Man). Overall, a wonderful experience! After leaving the theatre, we caught Mark Wahlberg walking to his limo! I got his autograph and he touched my hand! How lucky am I?! I encourage all to see this movie, especially on the big screen to feel the great effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ITALIAN JOB (2003) *** Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Franky G., Donald Sutherland. Entertaining remake of the 1969 Michael Caine flick of the same name, this time with Wahlberg as the leader of a band of thieves who demand revenge when snaky partner Norton double-crossed them on their last gig (a $35 M cache in Venice) with a lot at stake including the daughter of his late mentor wanting vengeance (Theron). Fine action sequences and clever plottings thanks to the husband/wife screenwriting team of Wayne and Donna Powers who wisely add humor (largely to techno-geek Green who steals the show) to the criminal acts at hand. Calibrated direction by F. Gary Gray makes for a better than anticipated testosterone driven caper flick; film's highlight is the climactic heist involving Mini Coopers and LA's subway system against a chopper .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't call it fun, because the movie was too slow paced. It begins good, the opening scene arouses attention, but then talking, talking and talking. It is weird, isn't it? Many people say it is fun, fun and fun and also fast paced. May be, they forget Die Hards, Mission Impossibles etc. at that moment. I believe that comparing original movies and remakes are a bit wrong, so I won't do that, but I want to say that as a note, the original film was excellent and real fun from the beginning till the end. In addition, it was very flowing, because it did not consist of talking like this movie. And its great (and unusual) final had the last word. This remake is not even an action movie, because there is no action except the expected car chase scene which takes place very late. Then, the movie livens up a bit, but that's all. Edward Norton is interesting, there is Jason Statham who is the man of action movies and more, but none of them can save the movie, because as mentioned, not only it is slow paced, but also it is not a stylish picture, just OK in terms of direction. Such movies sell themselves as action movies, thrill rides, but they are not. If you call a scene that they drive a car for test before the heist as action, then it changes. The chase scene was fun, but there are much better car chases, it does not raise the bar. Just a fun car chase, but before, you have to watch the uninteresting conversations between Wahlberg and Theron to see this chase. By the way, they get closer of course later. A soap bubble movie.</fullReview>

I hope that The Barazilian Job will be more interesting than this, and if it would be, we gonna have another GREAT film. I think that this period of time is enough (2003 - 2009) to bring something nice. And I am thinking what kind of car will they drive, maybe Smart For Four, because it seems a little like Mini. Something that i noticed in this film was that, when they 'get' the truck, at the metro, there was a SPIDERMAN running. Does anybody, of you, know more about that? Whare's the point of that??!---lordo---</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always like a good heist movie, and this remake of the Michael Caine classic does a pretty cool job. "The Italian Job" has a group of thieves seeking to take revenge on a former partner-in-crime who double-crossed them. In a way, the whole movie is a giant car chase, but it's clever enough so that it never gets ridiculous or idiotic. Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Donald Sutherland all do a great job. I know that these stunts are all really dangerous, but I still wish to assert that it would be neat to experience this movie, especially the whole scene in the metro. To paraphrase a famous quote: "It's all in the cars." As for the sexual act to which I believed that the title referred, I think that you know which one I mean (I'm probably not allowed to say it here).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated PG-13 for Violence and Some LanguageStarring: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton and Seth GreenGerne: Action/Adventure/Thriller/CrimeStar Rating: ***** out of 5The Italian Job is a remake of the 1969 comic caper with Michael Caine. This movie is about a group of robbers led by Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) who just made a successful robbery with his group my stealing these golden bricks. When they were just about to divide the shares out, one of the members of the group, Steve (Edward Norton) betrays the group and kills John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who is the father of Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron) who is a master at picking locks and getting safes open. So then after Steve killed John, Charlie begins to set up a big plan to take down Steve. So then they create this huge traffic jam in downtown Los Angeles, CA to have them get away with the gold with the traffic light switching with the help of the computer-wiz Lyle (Seth Green). SPOILER WARNING: THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE 1969 VERSION! This movie also had some good funny parts to it like when Lyle was changing the traffic lights in the airport he stands up and yells and then the entire people in the airport look at him and then he says "I got the Holy Spirit." Also another funny part was in the end when they are showing the credits Lyle buys this big stero system that blows women's clothes off! My favorite part of the movie was the entire mini-cooper car chase and the part where Charlie is at the dinner table with Steve and says, "You don't know how hard it is for me to reach across this table and punch you!" and then Steve says "You blew the best thing you had going for you. You blew the element of surprise." and then Charlie punches him and says "Surprised?". This movie was half shot in Los Angeles and Philadelphia.BOTTOM LINE: A FUN MOVIE WITH GREAT THRILLS, ACTION AND HUMOR!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You get a lot out a film that does not use CGI in a action movie. When you use more realistic stuff it keeps you watching it. CGI is pretty good, but it can ruin a film like this. I can see CGI where most people don't in a real film like this.I like this film for a heist that is for the gold, and not just to regain the gold. but for the payback. That makes a story like this more appealing. More people really do like a story like that than some simple heist film.By the way when you say you are 'fine' it sometimes means 'freaked out, insecure, neurotic and emotional' and I have heard 'I trust everyone, I just don't trust the devil inside them'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very plausible action sequences, excellent flow, I loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the movie was very realistic. The only part I thought was a little far fetched was at the beginning when the thieves were loading the gold into their submersible craft. For one, I'd think the weight of the gold would be too heavy for the craft to support. But also they never showed how they actually escaped underwater. The movie cut from the scene when they were loading the gold bars, to all of a sudden they are celebrating on top of the snowy mountain. I'd think it would be hard to drive and steer the craft underwater, afterall, in murky water, even with goggles, it's hard to see 2 feet ahead, so they could have easily crashed into say, a cement pillar of a bridge.Oh, one other thing, near the end of the movie, it was foolish for the backstabbing thief in the helicopter not to think of just lifting the cover off of the hole that Wahlberg order his car remodeler to cover up with the side of a truck, and then lowering down on say, ropes, and then they would be instantly at the location of their armored car full of gold!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2003 Summer movie season keeps getting better and better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job is the thrid best movie I've seen so far this summer which is really suprising. After the below par A Man Apart, F. Gary Gray redeems himself with this slick hesit film. The problem with Gray's last film was the script and given the right material Gray shows his talent as a director , hence his work in his previous films The Negotiator and Set It Off. The Italian Job sharp and witty written by Donna &amp; Wayne Powers is a huge improvement over the previous film Valentine, the Powers duo get great performances out of everyone in the cast from the star Mark Wahlberg to Franky G. Walhberg and his team which consit of Mos Def, Seth Green and Jason Statham decide to reccuit Charlize Theron to bring the evil Ed Norton. The trailer pretty much gives away the plot of the film so I won't ruin it here but the film is a lot of fun and considering the lack of gun battle violence that's really suprising. Seth Green and Mos Def are real scene stealers as always and Wahlberg has great chemistry with everyone in the cast. My advice go see this movie and just have a good time.</fullReview>

However I caught it on TV for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised. It isn't really a remake at all, just borrows some character names and a couple of plot ideas, the minis being used as getaway cars through a computer induced traffic jam being the main one.Quite frankly I think some Hollywood exec or five messed up using The Italian Job title. To my mind they'd have done much better to call it something like 'Another Italian Job', used different character names and then have the central character get the idea for the getaway because he's a movie buff and saw the original film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criminals are betrayed by one of their own and become set on revenge in "The Italian Job,) a 2003 film starring Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Donald Sutherland, Charlize Theron, and directed by F. Gary Gray. Gray never lets the pace up, keeping the viewer hooked all the way.The beginning of the film is really the best, when the thieves pull off an astounding heist of gold bullion in Venice. The scenery alone is worth the whole film. Then the action shifts to Los Angeles some time later. The thrills never really let up. It's reminiscent of "Ocean's Eleven" where, if you stop and think about what the criminals are doing, you realize it's completely impossible, but you go along with it because it's so clever.What made the film especially interesting for me is that the story and execution really depended on the actors not at all. Someone commented that Charlize Theron was doing an Angelina Jolie role - all of the actors, while okay, were doing roles that could easily have been played by someone else. This includes Donald Sutherland's short but sympathetic role. Some films are dependent on special effects; this film is dependent on moving breathlessly from one thrilling car chase or dangerous situation to another. This was particularly true at the end, when every time it looked as if the situation was resolved, there was another roadblock to overcome.I did not see the original film but will seek it out. This "Italian Job" is clever, with some humor thrown in, and very exciting. A highly recommended rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this is one of my favorite heist movies through the ages. At first when I saw the DVD I was a little skeptical about watching "just another heist flick," but I have to admit I only watched it for the cast the first time. But the music combined with the element of a clean heist with no guns pulled by Charlie Croker's crew, with one exception for Steve, is a rare element that is nearly impossible to find anywhere else. If you want to see some decent action, stealing gold, a few laughs, and excellent acting on the behalf of the entire cast, then the Italian Job is a movie that will a movie that you'll be happy to watch when you feel like it again and again and again. "The Italian Job" is a great movie that some of these newer more violent movies could learn from that you don't need an excess of violence to make a movie good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part, I hate thieves. Yet it amazes me how Hollywood can get me to appreciate the skill involved in stealing, even if for a couple of hours. Movies such as "The Heist", "Ocean's Eleven", and "The Italian Job" are just the movies to make me forget about my despise for thieves.Edward Norton plays the familiar weasel role that he played in another burglary movie, "The Score", with Robert DeNiro. In this movie he plays Steve, a member of a gang of master thieves led by John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). After the gang successfully lifts untold millions in gold from Italy, Steve double crosses them all and takes the gold for himself.What makes a movie about stealing good is the creativity that the thieves use in stealing. Even though they are committing a crime, there is a certain level of appreciation for a person doing a craft well. "The Italian Job" was about innovative ways to do the impossible, much like the other theft movies I mentioned. The acting was acceptable from Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Mos Def, and the others, but the focus was never on the actors. All of the movie's stock was in the scheme. The scheme for the embittered gang to take back what was theirs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Readers,Charlie Croker and his team of crack con-men have pulled off the heist of a century: Stealing over 100 million bucks of gold bars. Only one problem. They were betrayed by one of their own. Two months later they decide to go after Steve, the man who betrayed them and killed their boss, John Bridger. Helping them is Stella Bridger, John's safe-cracking daughter. Now in LA, Charlie, Stella, Handsome Rob, Left Ear, and The Napster have to plan an even better heist than the Italian Job and retrieve their gold from Steve before he ships it out of the states.The Italian Job remake is actually not a remake except for the fact there is a character named Charlie Croker and he's planning to steal a large amount of gold bricks and needs to use three Mini-Coopers to do it. The original Italian Job was strange beyond belief while the 'remake' is an action/heist masterpiece. Spiced with rich humor, played by an excellent all-star cast including Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Seth Green, and having a neat score and ruthless villain, played to perfection by Edward Norton, The Italian Job is probably one of the best action movies out there, almost rivaling some of Michael Bay's work.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

The role of the villain was so well-played! You will find yourself rooting for the protagonists as they go about their work. You'll wonder "how is it possible to plan things so well that they just can't go wrong??" Then wonder, "OK, what went wrong??" Oh, wait, things are still OK. No, wait...oh, OK; things are still good...hmmm. It will keep you guessing even as it reveals everything as it goes. Loved it. Bought it. And it was all done in such a way that I let my son see it.

		<fullReview>Very well made, smooth and light action-comedy entertainment. Good actors. This is maybe what Steven Soderberg would do, if he just could. This is not just some brainless buddy-comedy, like the movies of the mentioned (I mean the "Oceans'11,12,13..."). This movie's characters are a little more realistic: They have dreams, pasts, feelings and everything. One problem with movies that have as much (main) characters as this, is that of course the characters cannot be very deep or developed.The money fetish is an interesting issue in these movies. But maybe it's just as good fetish as anything: People must have (or at least they very often want to have) something that gives their life some goals, excitement, hobbies... And like in this case, the money comes connected (after a tragic incident) to everything in these people's lifes, so deeply that they are ready to risk their lifes for it.I would say this movie is very much like the best few of the James Bond movies. The same kind of entertainment. Of course there is nothing political here, like in the Bond movies. It's all about the money...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Italian Job ~ Stolen Idea? or Steals Box office?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: This review might contain spoilers. The 2003 version of "The Italian Job" is a great example of what a modern day action film contains. It has villains, heroes, gun battles, car chases, great camera work, and of course a beautiful woman. This film stands out on any list of action films and is an excellent movie.This movie really has little in common with its 1969 predecessor, other than the fact that gold is stolen with the help of Mini Coopers. However, this more modern version still manages to upend its earlier version. The advancements in technology make the camera angles more impressive and much more interesting, while the idea of high tech tools make the characters the envy of modern males.Seth Green steals every scene. As the geeky computer hacker Lyle, Green manages to create a true geek image and brings a new level to the parody of the geek. As he helps the thieves hack the computer systems necessary for the job, he constantly flashes back to his college days where he claims to be the real maker of Napster.The casting is perfect. Mark Wahlberg plays the leading role of hero Charlie Croker. Edward Norton, who does a great job making his character disliked, takes on the villain role. Charlize Theron plays the role of beautiful woman, Stella Bridger. Charlize does an excellent job with this role and this is the best she has looked in one of her films.In Conclusion, F. Gary Gray's version of "The Italian Job" is superior compared to its predecessor. This movie updates all of the elements from 1969, which are now obsolete. The film is well done and the new twist on a well-known plot is appreciated and creates a new classic.</fullReview>

It was perfect...until one of their own turned against them, steals the gold for himself and shoots John (Donald Sutherland), who is like a father to Charlie and to all of them. After leaving the rest for dead, Steve leaves to go spend his fortune. One year later, Charlie has still not gotten over the death of John, so he re-assembles the team, with the help of John's daughter, Stella, to go take back the gold from Steve and get revenge. It's an awesome movie, and the final scenes bring to life some of the greatest driving stunts in Hollywood history. This is a sweet movie, and the rides based on it (Paramount's Canada's wonderland, Paramount's Kings Island, and Paramount's Kings Dominion) aren't too bad either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Stuff Right Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How great was this movie? I loved it. The ensemble cast was the right choice. You felt as if you were watching an old group of friends, they vibed so well. I thought Norton was a badly cast choice for his role, but qué sera. There "mos def" was some other talent that coulda been used for that role. Seth Green's obsession with being called "Napster" was highly amusing. He lucked out. The fake one got shut down, lol. Charlize still felt like an outsider and her ending up with Mark just seemed like a last minute choice or an obvious choice, because they're the pretty people of the film. They had no chemistry whatsoever and them getting together was like, "Ok...I guess...". I like movies like this because it feeds into certain sociological theories like functionalism: everybody has a role. Movies like this are usually good, unless badly cast, because everyone gets a good amount of screen time because they're needed for the overall result. Jason Statham, hot as ever, was charming and smooth as Handsome Rob. Gotta love this cat. Mos Def really held it down as Left Ear. You could buy that he knew his way around explosives. Humans fascination with fire...lol. The action was a good pace. Made you want to be in the film and apart of the gang. The cinematography was rather lush for an action film, especially in Italy. Venice is a gorgeous city. It was a lot of clean shots that I really liked. Great film because of the energy and chemistry of the actors, save some minor mishaps. Great watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>questions for the director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These questions is for the director of the Italian job F Gary Gray.1.what was the reason for pricking the character of Stella with the name tag of Becky? (you have a pitcher of that seen in your photo gallery.) 2. why is spider-man running in the background of one of the scenes with other people? 3. who picked the names of the main characters and why were those chosen? 4. was the movie altered at all from big screen to video? because i swear that in one seen were hansom rob and Lyle were commenting on that girl Becky, rob says to Lyle "what kind of name is Becky anyway" that one line is not on video. what gives?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whisper this quietly ? this is actually rather good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it was announced that the classic 1960's Michael Caine crime caper The Italian Job was going to be remade ? and set in Los Angeles ? there was a cry of uproar from avid fans of the original possibly including I admit myself.True fans of the original where careful to avoid the new one and quick of the mark to knock it down often without having even seen it.I reserved judgement until the DVD landed in a bargain bin and I picked up a copy. To my utmost horror ? it was actually rather good.Indeed (sacrilege I hear you cry!) it is just a shade better than the original! Strong performances, excellent driving and a well written and directed script all lead to probably one of the best remakes of recent times. Having said that, calling it a remake is a bit wrong really, this is more of a sequel or homage to the original, there is indeed an Italian Job involving the theft of a safe in a daring and original raid in Venice complete with canals.It is the proceeds of this caper that cause all the problems and lead us to the scenario that forms the basis of the film, and all in all it works rather well.There are of course a few areas that don't work, one or two sequences seem a bit slow and unnecessary but overall this is well put together and certainly worth watching although it may not blow everybody's bloody doors off!Just a pity about those naff new type Mini's though??.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was entertaining from beginning to end. Nothing profound, just pure entertainment. The cast was perfect. Edward Norton, who I think is one of the best actors around, was despicable enough to make you hate him. The rest of the cast was very likable, showing "honor among thieves". The chase scenes were exciting and didn't drag on like the interminable highway chase in the Matrix Reloaded. The Mini Coopers were stars in their own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a wonderful movie, lots of action, suspense, twists and turns and scams and stings. The star of the movie is the MINI MINOR automobile. Simply brilliant writing and Charlize, what more can you ask for. Wahlberg was terrific as was the entire supporting cast. A must see movie. You certainly get your monies worth and that is all you can ask for. The critics again are morons. One person's opinion...don't miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What part of "This is not remake" don't you understand?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the so called "original" movie and I really don't care about it. This is a new generation of movie makers and their audience so keep your old grumpy opinions on your dusty bookshelf. Anyone who doesn't understand that Hollywood makings today are nothing else but marketing additions to products, is on the wrong planet. This movie shows life as it is today, short lived entertainment, Computer gurus, fast cars and tricked out sceneries that most people can't afford to visit. The Italian Job is exactly that, a couple of hours for your entertainment to shut off some brain functions and enjoy a wild ride to catch the price. Nothing more, nothing less. The Minis fit right into this picture, todays technology available for your pleasure, just need to buy one. All of these intellectual comparisons with the "original" movie have absolutely no value to me, even more so after the Director's statement that this isn't a remake. Can't we just drop it here and enjoy another little action story? Not sure how often this must be repeated: it's made in Hollywood - if I want something better or slightly intelligent I go visit the library and read Plato. But that is getting boring sometimes.People are reading too much into movies at times; it is like art, politics or personal taste - a matter of opinion and not a subject of judgment, so take it or leave it. But don't downgrade some Directors or actors accomplishments, if they don't match your level - just smile and move on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, when i first went to see this i hadn't seen any trailers and thought it was going to be a bad under-funded film. I had not seen the Original Italian Job before i had seen this, although i have now as i was that impressed with this new version of the film. Firstly, many people say that the film is going to be rubbish as in is set in America where the title of the film suggests that the film takes place in Italy. The film explains this as the story goes on, and it does it well too! Right, now onto the film itself. The story line in my opinion is one of the best out of all films in 2003. The character choices are very good, with Mark Wahlberg playing Charlie Crokers part excellently, and i especially liked Seth Greens part as a computer 'genius', being into computers myself, i particularly liked his role in the movie. THey have kept some of the original things in the new movie from the 1969 version, including starting the movie with a heist in Venice and the inclusion of the new Mini Cooper S's, as the original minis were used in the 1969 version. Overall this is my favourite movie in recent years, and i wouldn't normally give a vote of 10 for any movie, but this film certainly deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Napster", or Seth Green, in this movie is awesome!!! If you're like me, you'll love the scene at the CATV parking lot where Handsome Rob goes to talk to a girl and The Napster just watches him make the moves. He also does a funny-as-all dialog of what the two of them are talking about. Soooo funny! Thumbs up!!! The DELL laptop also made a good impression on me. As far as all the hacks go, they're pretty unbelievable and wouldn't happen in real life. But, the whole story behind "Napster" was definitely believable!I didn't do the research to see if it was true or not, but it was awesome! And, no... Napster was NOT named for the creator's nappy hair, but because the TRUE creator of it was napping :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Breathless Adventure With Nice Thieves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Venice, a very specialized team of thieves, composed of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg), John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Lyle (Seth Green), Left Ear (Mos Def) and Steve (Edward Norton) heist US$ 35,000,000.00 in gold bars in a cerebral plan and without any shooting. However, they are double crossed by Steve, who steals all the gold and kills John. One year later, they find Steve living as a millionaire in a mansion in Hollywood. They invite the straight specialist in safes, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), daughter of John, to join the group and steal the gold from Steve, in a sort of payback. In their plan, they intend to provoke a traffic jam and the Minis have an important participation. This story has many cliches, is totally unbelievable, but what could a viewer expect from an action movie? Exactly what this movie offers to the audience: a breathless adventure, funny, full of action, a great entertainment. Of course, we cheer on the nice and daring thieves against Steve, the real bad guy in the story. The DVD has many extras and shows that practically all the action scenes were performed by the cast, who had a specific training. Charlize Theron is very beautiful in this film (as usual). I liked this movie a lot. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Uma Saída de Mestre' (`An Exit of Master')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very poor Italian job, another poor American big money remake. The whole idea or the Italian job was that it was British, and a Britain against Europe. The new film can't leave Europe quick enough and replaces the minis with German BMWs, thus negating the two founding points of the film. This is an average heist flick at best and calling two characters the same as ones from the original doesn't make it a remake, nor does using a car called a mini make it a mini. In short this should be flushed into room 101 along with the remakes of get carter, taxi, the assassin and ring. - - - save your time and just watch the original. Watch the extras ad let the creators tell you that the whole idea was to keep it British and the idea of a remake was just silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb heist-and-chase movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderful ! Nuff said ! The movie is action packed, it is very hard to choose the best stunt. The bombs, the shooting scenes, the car chase and all blew my mind away! The entire movie is full of actions, and one left the cinema satisfied at how it turns out.This movie is a remake of the original with the same title, made in the year 1969. Staying true to the original, there is only a slight differences in the storyline. However, the movie is very well done in the sense that one can watch both the original and the remake, and still enjoy both. Credits to the producer for sticking to the original, and credits too to the cats for the remarkable actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though this wasn't the level of Master and Commander, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Time went too fast. I love action/adventures and this one was just non stop action. I loved the water chase in Venice but the heist in the city right in front of the idiot's nose was very cool. I love the acting and my hat is off for the directing. Keeping up with those scenes, wow. I had to watch it a second time to get everything in. Sure enough, I saw things the second time that I missed the first. This was like watching the last Rose Bowl between University of Michigan and Texas Longhorns. You are too afraid to move that you would miss something. This is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job is an excellent film that boasts a excellent cast which includes Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, Edward Norton, Franky G, and Gawtti! The acting by all of these actors is pretty good. I liked how Wahlberg and Theron's relationship was. Theron was excellent in this film and she is becoming one of My favorite actresses! It was amazing to see Wahlberg, Stratham, and Franky G all together because they are all very muscular individuals. Gawtti had a really good performance and he reminded Me of the legendary wrestler Yokozuna. The action is really good and the car chases are excellent. The film is very exciting and the music by John Powell is great. F. Gary Gray has directed another good film. This is a great and thrilling film. If you like Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, Jason Statham and the rest of the cast I've mentioned above and exciting non-stop action films then I Strongly recommend this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I've ever seen so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Wahlberg is one of my favorite actors, and especially this is one of his best movies. In fact I've never yet seen any better movie than this one. It was recommended to me by people who saw it earlier than me in a country where it was released earlier than here, so once I could go to a night preview, I took a look, I didn't even wait for the official premiere date. So this recommendation had not misled me in any way as I enjoyed watching it.The gold worth 35000000 Italian euros ended up in quite a mess, as one of the robbers robbed all his crime partners in the Dolomites quite soon after they had taken the gold away from Venice. A year later those who got nothing due to this second crime in chain found out where the gold was and even if the person who had it all lied that it had all gone, there was gold worth 27000000 euros left, so in the end everything is OK. Why I say this (which is a kind of a spoiler) is that I admire the way Mark Wahlberg a.k.a. Charlie Croker takes back from Steve what belongs to the others, and the way that all is well that ends well. I'm eagerly expecting the 2nd episode to come.</fullReview>
