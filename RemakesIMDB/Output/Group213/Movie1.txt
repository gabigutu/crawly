		<shortDescription>"It is a work of genius."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a sense I was disappointed to find that I actually liked The Italian Job. For after decades of imitations and student new-lad pub bores crowbarring "You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!" into conversation, I was all prepared to hate it.Yet The Italian Job is a good film. A very good film in fact. First-class direction, all pans and upshot angles, and slyly political, though its "Cool Britannia" ethos almost seems to parody devotees of the Union Jack. Anyone watching this film for reconfirmation of the Empire is mistaken, though the team's final downfall notably comes from the only non-Caucasian member.The humour is self-conscious, but never so that it goes too far; it's always witty. Michael Caine is the archetype Michael Caine, all pointing finger and raised-voice declarations, the version mimics love to portray. Noël Coward is able support in a straightish role, though the wonderful Benny Hill parodies his own image, thus diluting his already fine (And misunderstood) ironic take on the sexual pervert.Screen realism is not an issue here, with a Mafia cameo who are hardly Don Corleone. Women are also marginalised, with only Maggie Blye getting a largish role as Caine's girlfriend, Lorna. This is the same girlfriend who hires six women to help celebrate his release from prison, and refers to fellow womankind as "birds". Yet while the film is a "boys only" club, it's far from a testosterone-led car chase, as Coward's appearance should attest. And what makes the final climatic chase so rewarding is that it's carefully, and intelligently, set up. The film is metaphorical where you wouldn't expect it to be, and well-acted all round.All of which leaves me struggling for a way to end this review. Hang on a minute, lads, I've got an idea -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job is one of the best-loved British classics ever made. Most people in my home country of Britain have seen the film many times (most of those times spent drinking tea and speaking like the queen, of course), but there's more than enough for audiences from other countries to like about this delightful thriller as well. As you almost certainly already know, The Italian Job stars Michael Caine as the criminal at the centre of the job, dubbed 'The Italian Job' (would you believe). Caine is iconic in this film; his voice and mannerisms are often imitated, and it is this film that is probably most responsible for that. The plot follows Charlie Croker (Caine), a freshly released crook that, with a tip off from a deceased friend, decides to steal ?4 million from Italy. However, it's not an easy job and there are many risks involved, so the job must be astutely planned and flawlessly executed for it to work right - and it is there that the film really takes off.The Italian Job is well remembered for two things, the first of which is the Mini's. This is the film that made Mini's cool, so as you might expect, there is a fair amount of stunt work involving the Mini, a lot of which is truly spectacular - these little cars can be seen driving up stairs, onto and across roofs, through shopping centres, flying over various chasms etc and it's all very exciting. The second thing that it is remembered for is, of course, the line - "you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!", which is one of the most quoted of all time. The film's impact on popular culture has been immense, and that line's impact in particular is legendary; people that don't know the film know that line, and I dare say that a lot of them quote it even. It's up there with 'I'll be back' or 'that' line from Dirty Harry. The film also highlights a lot of British culture, most notably the reaction to something going right. English patriotism is a little different to the American version - while in America, the whole country may be united under the stars and stripes, very apple pie-like; England is much more content to chant a little inside of a prison. I know which version I prefer.I could waffle on all day about this film, but we've both got better things to do, I'm sure so I'll finish by commenting on the ending; which is, simply, sublime and a perfect way to end the film; funny, well executed and absolutely genius. Well played.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So who can NOT like The Italian Job? Well, I can't speak for those who are not Anglophiles, but I suspect everybody who has ever called themselves British will love it. Sure, it has holes the size of Matron's stockings in it's plot and there are any number of errors apparant in the script and screenplay (Well, we all know that Mini's don't have a rear differential) and the true fanatics (such as myself) are all too aware of the continuity on-screen (that was a heavily disguised Lancia Flaminia that went off the cliff- Well, did you really think it was a REAL Aston DB4? See "Hammer House" for where that turned up). I could go on, as I usually do, about inconsitencies and so forth, but, by God, I have seen the Italian Job in just about every format it was ever shown and I love it all the same. There are no slow parts, every bit is important to the plot, the soundtrack is legendary (only available now after many, many years on CD. Got it before it was on CD and cost a lot; typical!) and is so quotable ("You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!") as to haunt Michael Caine forever more. You'll love it, wherever you come from!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the job!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Troy Kennedy Martin, its scriptwriter, has described the central significance of the mini cooper in Peter Collinson's cult heist movie. Perkily speeding through the streets of Turin, it represents the then New Britain: `laddish, self-confident and not taking itself too seriously'. The image of the weaving, dodging, red white and blue cars is the film's abiding one. Outside of their use in the prolonged escape scenes, and several splendid comic moments elsewhere, it remains entertaining, even if surprisingly slight.Often seen as a quintessential sixties' movie, ?The Italian Job' is more precisely a definition (or one definition) of Britishness as an optimistic nation at the height of a chic decade. In this atmosphere, pulling a job ? or a bird ? is practically a national duty. Robbery is considered by Croker and Bridger as a means to `help with the country's balance of payments'. The ultra-patriotic Mr Bridger (a splendidly aristocratic Noel Coward, his cell walls pasted with pictures of royalty) sees the job as much a matter of national pride, a means to demonstrate the efficiency of the British system of work, than a route to amass loot. Characteristically Bridger is more interested in studying balance of payment statistics than examining escape routes for his operatives who appropriately enough travel to their ?work' on the Free Enterprise 1.The reference to football is significant and parallels with the sport are deliberate. Most obviously, the robbery is planned for the time of an England-Italy match maximising confusion and even,(as Bridger suggests at one point), possible help from their compatriots. Croker's men at one point assume the identity of a van full of fans, while the impromptu beer celebration in the back of the coach, after ditching the minis, is the team's victory drink. It is clear that the Italians, whether the police or the Mafia, are as much their opponents as the national team playing in the stadium. Back in prison, upon news of the triumph by his ?team', Bridger descends the stairs, like a penal Alf Ramsey, acknowledging the chants of ?England!' by celebrating fans.Caine's cockney player is very much the main character of the film (a role apparently ? and amazingly ? originally offered to Robert Redford). The actor, who had earlier played the soliliquising womaniser Alfie in the 1966 film of the same name, reprises some elements of that character's optimism and assumptiveness. In the present film he is less of cynical loner, studiously subservient to his criminal employer, though still on the look out for a good thing both professionally and sexually. Like his more famous compatriot, James Bond, he drives an Aston Martin although quickly reduced to a bicycle and then a mini. The Mafia's cliff-side warning dents some of his self assurance, presumably also shaken by the roughing up from Bridger's men (although interestingly the beating is never referred to again, and leaves no physical marks.) Away from his boss he remains very much his own man, although his loyalty is never in doubt: `From now on we work as a team. Which means you all listen to me.' Crocker is always in control, never sentimental, being content to pack his girlfriend off with the minimum of ceremony at the airport. Emotion will slowly filter through Caine's screen persona. His watching of Beckermann's footage early on, to explain the big idea, anticipates Jack Carter's less dispassionate viewing of celluloid in Hodges' gangster film two years later.Before the long, final chase ensues, the gang's Aston and two Jags are ceremoniously wasted by the Mafia. While making a simple point about the threat and power of the Italian underworld, the removal of ?competing' vehicles also reaffirms the status of the remaining minis. Ironically if the film has a weakness, it lies in the mini's prominence, which reduces tension during the last part of the film. The stunts remain eye-catching today (the notable roof top jump being filmed on the roof of the Fiat factory), but very often one is aware of watching a demonstration of the vehicle's versatility rather than any dramatic bid for freedom. In one scene filmed, later deleted from the release print, the minis and their Italian pursuers performed gracefully together on an ice rink choreographed to a waltz, slowing the action even further. That such a scene was considered, and filmed, gives an indication of how taken the makers had been with the car, and with the *means* rather than the *process* of urgent escape.Another less satisfactory element of the plot is the disappearing Mafia. Initially presented as a formidable, organised force (as in their synchronised appearance on the hill side for instance), the Italian hoods are sidelined as events unfold, criminal impotents. Their absence from the finale seems odd. With or without the Cosa Nostra's malign shadow, the existing conclusion of the film has excited much comment. With its famous shot of the coach balanced out over the precipice, the gold sliding towards its back end, and Croker's closing `I've got a great idea..', it is a literal cliff hanger. The original script tailed off with the escape, and another twist in the tail was clearly needed. After some debate a studio executive added the existing close, which could easily have appeared lame, but in the event proves a satisfying conclusion. By leaving the coach ? and the viewer ? hanging, the film has it both ways: the crooks get away with it and yet they don't; a group of white British lads triumph in their cool minis, only to have their plans derailed by a careless black driver of their coach. If the film has been about the state of ?Britishness' at the time then the uncertainty of its conclusion anticipates, perhaps, the doubts and strife of the ensuing decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thing starts moving and doesn't let go of you until the end, at which point you wish you were still on the ride going. We were surprised that we'd never herd of this before, especially since so many scenes are in video games these days (and times past).This isn't one of those movies you spend your time thinking about, just sit down, watch, and let the movie unfold before you. If you're looking for good entertainment, this is it. If you are looking for meaning and some sort of significance, look elsewhere.Good fast fun! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rollicking heist flick with the best car chase ever put on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Italian Job" is a comedic heist film that is mostly renowned for the extended car chase getaway. In it, a thief recently released from prison (Michael Caine) organizes a scheme to steal a shipment of gold bars by creating a massive traffic jam and using a trio of Mini Coopers to escape with the loot.The cast is pretty decent with the always dependable Caine perfectly cast as charismatic thief Charlie Croker, Noel Coward as the incarcerated backer of the titular job and Benny Hill in a small role as a computer expert obsessed with plump women. Besides that there's no-one worth remarking on and not much acting that isn't up to snuff.The script is bold and inventive with much of the humour being understated and unpredictable. The heist itself is clever but the staging of the getaway is a real work of art. Again, there is an inventiveness that is quite refreshing. Nevertheless, I was starting to get a little tired of waiting for the heist to be set in motion. Finally, the ending caps the proceedings in memorable fashion.The direction by Peter Collinson is solid and above average for an action-comedy. The music, handled by Quincy Jones, is memorable but also characteristic of the era, meaning that it is unlikely to appeal to all tastes.If you're looking for a lighthearted crime caper this is just the ticket. I particularly recommend the film since it includes what is, in my opinion, the best car chase ever filmed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great film ? but a classic caper movie that never fails to cheer me up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the behest of Mr Bridger, Charlie Croker puts together a crew to pull of a massive job. The job is to rob an armoured car on the streets of Turin and then get away clean. The plan involves explosives a traffic jam, a football match and a load of mini coopers.I watched this recently on TV ? it was shown the night before England played Argentina in World Cup 2002 (1-0, Argentina then dropped put in the first round!). The reason it was shown was simply that it's strength is that it's a good caper movie where the Brits go over there and put one over on the Italians! It may smack of zenophobia but that's what it is!The criminals even go so far as to use Mini's for the job ? in the most famous scene of the film, making them cool for decades! The reason it was shown before the game was just to feed on the fact that national pride was high. Even if you ignore the British element (the song `self preservation society' is now even a football anthem) then it's still quite fun to watch. The build up to the job is breezy and funny with good lines, while the job itself is fanciful but great fun.The ending must be known to everyone ? but it's still good no matter how many times you see it! The cast are all good ? with a range of British TV faces in there bringing a distinct British comedy. Caine is great, as are Coward and Hill but the real stars are the Mini's and the daring comedic race across Turin.Overall this is not a great film ? but it is a classic caper movie. It's made even better by the fact that it makes you proud to be British in a weird way! Say it with me my friends ? `hang on lads, I've got an idea??..'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So very British</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) has been out of prison for less than five minutes when he begins planning his next heist. This one involves robbing an armored car filled with gold in the streets of Turin, Italy. But, it's not just the police that Croker and Crew must contend with. The Mafia doesn't want some outsider to come into their country and steal gold out from under their noses either. The job becomes similar to the football match the Crew uses as a cover - it's about national pride.- It's amazing that I had never seen this movie before. I understand that in Britain, it's considered nothing short of a national treasure. After watching, I can certainly see why. Everything about The Italian Job just screams Britannia - the Minis, the song with lyrics that are indecipherable to most Americans, Michael Caine, sensibilities, etc. I don't think that the colors selected for the Minis was an accident. About half way through, I felt like stopping the movie to make tea.- The actual theft of the gold is fairly unremarkable. But the chase afterwards is where a lot of the fun in this movies lays. The Minis are characters in their own right. The final third of the movie is the most amazing commercial for an automobile I've ever seen. We see the Minis go down stairs, jump through the air, race across the roofs of buildings, splash through water, swoosh through tunnels, and (if you watch the deleted scenes on the Region 1 DVD) waltz on ice. Sometimes these extended car chase scenes can go on too long for their own good. Not here. I was never bored of watching the Minis race around Turin.- I loved the ending. It is left wide open for you, the viewer, to decide just what happens next. Too many newer movies seem to feel the need to explain everything in the most minute detail. It's nice to use your imagination for a change.- Finally, the music is another highlight of the movie. It seems a little odd that a movie I have described being very British should have the very American Quincy Jones responsible for the score. I defy anyone to watch The Italian Job and not have Getta Bloomin' Move On! stuck in your head for days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) is a lovable, fashionable convict who despite having served five years in prison, is immediately engaged to accepting an "Italian Job" in Italy and in the process, completing the intricate crime of a lifetime. A short but very interesting film about an Italian town called Turin, is sent to him by a good friend and marked man called Beckerman (Rossano Brazzi). The film instructs Croker to take the accumulated plans, get a financial backer and pull off what Beckerman describes as a $4,000,000 gold robbery, through a traffic jam. The minor problems are explained but easily overcome by Bekerman's meticulous plans. However, the main obstacles to the bank heist are no trivial matter. Croker will be up against the highly sophisticated armored convoy with its armed guards, the 'special security' system of the bank, and an entire city in Chaos. Additionally the shipment will be protected by the biggest obstacle of all The Mafia (Raf Vallone). They warn Charlie, if he attempts to steal the gold, he will be sent back to England in a pine box. To his credit, Charlie wins over the confidence of England's version of the Godfather, Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward who is superb.) To further aid Croker, he assembles an odd assortment of characters such as Professor Simon Peach. (Benny Hill who is wonderful) and Stanley Cain as Coco. The entire film is dedicated to the fact that even the most secure treasures can be stolen. However, hanging onto them, crossing the Alps and getting back home is subject to the Law of Gravity. A serious and comic film destined to become a classic, especially with it's haunting theme. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original - There is no comparison.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is unfortunate that the 2003 film was released with the same name as the 1969 film because it clouds the (unsophisticated) mind with subjective judgment. For everyone who compares the two films - stop! The original was filmed in a different time period and the viewer must make a conscious effort to put him/herself in that state of mind to understand it. The film is pure entertainment, and it accomplishes that with humor and some clever stunts. As viewers, we need to be objective and aware of the differences that have arisen on so many levels as the years have passed.For those who complain that the premise of the heist is not realistic, it was never supposed to be. Consider that if it had been intended as a realistic portrayal, the crooks would have killed those in their way and taken the loot without concern for collateral damage. The existing plot kept the mood decidedly "all in good fun."Michael Caine made as good a performance as ever in this film. It is fun for fans of him to see the many different roles he has undertaken in his prolific career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More humor than the re-make.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A year after I saw the remake, I finally got to see the original for the first time. This movie was released during my freshman year in college, but I certainly don't remember it ever being in any local theaters. From a 35-year hindsight perspective, it has an "Austin Powers" feel to it, primarily because of the sound track and the period-attire worn by the players. The 2003 re-make has a more imaginative yet believable plot, while this original has a sly, tongue-in-cheek undertone of humor to it. Benny Hill as the computer-geek obsessed with "large-boned women" is a real hoot! I think that sub-plot could have been played out further in the form of it creating more complications for master planner Michael Caine. Although I like "Marky" Mark Wahlberg and most of his movies, Michael Caine imbued the Charlie Croker role with more personality. The mini-Coopers are still the centerpiece of both movies, though: good chase scenes! This movie has merits that the re-make does not, and vice versa. It's hard not to compare the two, but try watching both again, as individual movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will believe a Mini Cooper can fly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is listed as my favorite movie. 2 reasons, a pretty good story, and some of the best driving and stunts you'll ever see, done in Mini Coopers. The story is a basic "caper plot" with some decent performances from some great talent. but the real stars are the Mini Coopers. Many people do not realize that these cars were not heavily modified, they only had a skid plate/ski added to protect the sump. All the stunts were real (outstanding driving from Reme Julliene's stunt team) and even the traffic jam was real. It's also a fun period piece, complete with score by Quincy Jones. See it, if for no other reason than to find out how the humble Mini won the Monte Carlo 3 times, and was voted European Car of The Century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cut to the Chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is like a blunt, bottom-drawer impression of a John Huston caper (a long way after) with its shaggy-dog ending. The dialogue strains persistently but always falls short - perhaps Martin's screenplay for "Kelly's Heroes" the following year got polished by someone else. I did like his script for "Edge of Darkness" but not this.The fat humor is bankrupt and threadbare, the Italians are cartoons and the sole non-white in the cast is the only one of the team to let the side down, which leaves a bad aftertaste. Peter Collinson directed coarsely with his usual trowel.It's fun to see Noel Coward play the Queen Mum, and Fred Emney is pungent as the aged football fan, but Michael Caine looks more desperate than his character has to, and I don't blame him. Remy Julienne's car team shows more variety of expression.The caper itself is fun enough, but the characters and events leading up to it are thinner than TP.Thrills are easy, comedy is hard. The first 50 minutes of this film are a waste of time.Best bet - skip the setup and cut to the chase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but badly dated and flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know where to begin with this movie. It's full of flaws and weaknesses. I can only barely give it a 6 because Michael Caine is cool, Benny Hill was funny (but pointlessly underused) and the heist and car chase were generally creative and exciting. It was vaguely amusing (and sometimes very funny) the way Caine kept shouting at his team, who really were like a bunch of kids, so immature and selfish. Caine's character's general attitude is so care-free, he has no doubts about who he is or what he does. It's just his thing: attractive women, stealing cars or money and getting into trouble.But then we're left with the countless weaknesses. Some of the editing was very tacky. One bit with a woman complaining was sped up. It didn't work. Most of the comedy misses. Maybe you have to be British. Or live in the 60s. But then I've enjoyed comedy from all over the world, new and old, so it must just be weak. Caine was funnier in Golmember. Just before Caine's famous line about "the bloody doors", which was very funny for the 5 seconds of screen-time it took, the camera keeps zooming in as he counts down. It's completely unnecessary and very typical for the time. The music was also very dated. Actually pretty unpleasant to listen to, it adds nothing, almost anything else would have been better. The point is, it's not timeless or appropriate but is instead strongly attached to the time and place it was made. It was the latest fashion, a fad which now shows decades of age. This applies to multiple aspects of this film and many others.One of the worst mistakes in chase scenes is where they have the camera moving in the opposite direction to the action, as if to create more speed or velocity. It's a terrible idea. It's been used in Transformers, Big Hero 6 and countless other movies. It always looks awful. The best way to capture speed or action is a smooth, loose, long shot that stays with the moving vehicles. You feel the air, the road, everything moving past. Or you hold the camera still and let them whiz past. No sudden movements. No rapid cuts. The camera should always be roughly from someone's point of view. Trust me. Movies which have far better chase scenes include: Nolan's Batman trilogy, the Indiana Jones trilogy, Bullitt, the Star Wars movies (yes, all of them), the first two Terminator movies, most James Bond movies and most Pixar movies. The list goes on. This isn't an exaggeration.The chase here is fun but only mildly so. We don't see the natural flow from one place to another, there's no meaningful sequence, no build- up in tension, no anticipation or exhilaration. Just a random series of stunts. It could be shown in any order and make the same amount of sense. They seem to be getting followed by only one police car at a time. Their tricks are gimmicky and predictable and nothing more than gags. There is sense of danger or risk. Plus, they're dicks. They cause so much destruction and they don't deserve the money. They're not underdogs, just idiots.The cliff hanger ending is cringe-worthy. It's frustrating, not funny. This movie has no morals, no heart. That would be fine if it was hilarious and action-packed. But it is neither. It's tepid. It's like a soft drink that's gone flat. The characters are stupid and arbitrarily succeed or fail based on what the script decides.The Italian Job glorifies theft. These guys are jerks. They're not likable. Ocean's Eleven (2001) was also overrated. It had mild comedy and a convenient heist made possible through the magic of movies, not logic. It placed all its bets on its coolness, of which it had very little. A classic flaw in circular logic - "being cool" doesn't make you cool. This movie is very similar, overly confident and cocky but with little work or detail or depth put into it.They discuss their plans seemingly in public, in front of so many other people. There are no twists or betrayals. This seems highly unrealistic. With that many people, how does the information not leak? The mafia seem completely unnecessary in the movie. Many parts of the movie were difficult to follow. One character gets cheered in jail. So they knew he was behind the crime? Why do they care? Is it a rebellious act against rich people who we all apparently hate? When they get the minis into the bus, why do they keep the bus moving? Stopping would get them all on in seconds after which they can drive as fast as they want.If you watch this movie, have low expectations. This is not a clever crime thriller. Think of it as a silly, immature movie that's trying to be funny which has some nice stunt and chase parts. Maybe it'll help if you're drunk or haven't seen a good movie before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great British crime comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr Beckerman worked hard to plan the perfect crime but unfortunately for him he has an 'accident' in the opening minutes of the film; that isn't the end of the plan though as his widow takes it to Charlie Croker. Charlie has just got out of Wormwood Scrubs but finds himself breaking back in to get permission from Mr Bridger, a suave and patriotic crime boss, to go ahead with the job. Once he has is permission he assembles a team and heads to Italy where they will have to evade the local police and the Mafia, create gridlock in the City of Turin, hold up an armoured car full of gold then drive out of the city along a carefully planned route in three Mini Coopers.This is one of the great caper movies; the plot may be fairly simple but the execution is a delight. After Beckerman's fatal prologue the film shows its true comedy colours as Croker is picked up from outside The Scrubs in the Pakistani Ambassador's car which his girlfriend had stolen. From then on the film is packed with laugh out loud moments that never seem forced. Once the robbery starts things get fairly exciting and the chase involving the crooks in their three Minis being chased by the Italian Police is one of the all time classic chase scenes; they drive through a shopping arcade, down some church steps, across a weir and even through a sewer. Once they are out of the city and transferred the gold to the bus it looks like they are home and dry but the famous ending is literally a cliff-hanger that leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether or not they got away with it.The cast do a fine job; I can't imagine anybody but Michael Caine in the role of Charlie and the supporting cast, which featured some very well known names including Noel Coward, John Le Mesurier and Benny Hill did a fine job too. Obviously if you think about what happens too much you'll spot plot holes but that doesn't matter as it is meant to be a fun caper not a serious drama and without some plot holes it wouldn't work as well as a comedy. The car chase is one of the best I've ever seen; featuring some great stunts that looked genuinely dangerous. If you want a good laugh you could do a lot worse than this; it still feels fresh after over forty years and there is little to offend so it can be enjoyed by all the family... so long as you don't object to having heroes who are crooks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wonder how many folks went out and bought a Mini just because of this film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, this film is in the tradition of such memorable European heist films as "Rififi", "Grand Slam" and "Big Deal on Madonna Street". However, although it's a heist film, HOW it does it is unique and probably make this the best film when it comes to car stunts. Although everything leading up to the car chase is very, very good--once the insane Minis let loose, the film becomes a classic.The film begins with Charlie Crocker (Michael Caine) getting out of prison. He's been handed a gorgeous plan by a dead man to rob a gold shipment in Turin, Italy. Who killed the creator of this brilliant plan? Well, the Mafia apparently didn't like the idea of outsiders coming into their country and committing such crimes. So, when Charlie decides to take on the job, it becomes sort of a UK vs. Italy thing--and coincides with a big football match between the two countries. But, the plan is expensive and complicated, so he needs the help of a super-criminal, Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward) to finance the operation.As I said above, the planning is just fine, but the film becomes an insane bit of eye candy when the plan is enacted--particularly when they load the loot into three Minis. You have to see it to believe it and it makes the wonderful car stunts from films like "Bullit", "Diva" and "Le Balance" look almost pedestrian! Great direction, INSANE stunts and nice acting by Caine all make this one of the best crime films you can possibly see.I wonder how many chumps went out and bought a Mini and then realized they CAN'T do all the insane tricks they did with Minis in the film!!By the way, if you do watch the film, I hope you don't have a heart attack when you see the cars destroyed in the movie. I didn't mind seeing Minis destroyed--but what about those classic European sports cars?! My heart skipped a beat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swinging good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the remake of "The Italian Job" years ago and was underwhelmed at the generic heist movie, and put off seeing the original. Luckily I changed my mind and was pleasantly surprised with the 1969 version. The remake takes character names, the idea of a heist in Italy, a traffic jam and Mini Coopers but that's about it.The original has those elements, of course, but it is a wonderfully zany caper flick steeped in the late 1960s Swinging London, where our hero's natural first stop when getting out of prison is to visit his tailor to catch up on the latest fashions. Fitting in well with this silly depiction of a brief trend in pop culture is the wildly unrealistic, but immensely fun, portrayal of the London crime scene as a surprisingly campy organization.Okay, so the original is no more a realistic depiction of a major robbery than the sequel, but it's a whole lot more fun. Michael Caine, Noel Coward and no less than Benny Hill headline the cast in this movie about fashionable criminals stealing a bunch of shiny stuff from the Italian government, complicated by no less than the mafia. Aside from the breezy campy vibe that seems to have made the movie a cult classic in England, the movie's other signature is its amazing stunt driving scenes in its second half. These are great and to must be seen by anyone who likes a good car chase.Campy and fun, what more could you ask for? This one's worth a rental or (legal) download.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never underestimate the mind of a criminal. In spite of having been jailed, Charlie Crocker seems to come out with new energy to do another heist of grander proportions. Charlie is met at the prison gate by the girlfriend that wants to give him a party in which she has invited a few women to make him realize how much he has been missing. What attracts Crocker's attention is an item in the news that is explained in a film he gets from a Mr. Beckerman about an idea he has conceived. Beckerman dies as a result of a nasty accident caused in a tunnel by his foes. In the plan, Beckerman talks about how the Chinese have given Italy a fortune in gold as both countries enter into an industrial agreement. The treasure is to be sent to Turin, in Northern Italy, where a special aircraft will deliver four million dollars in gold that will be placed in an armored car that will be highly protected by the local police. For that, Charlie has a plan that needs the cooperation of a powerful man still in prison, a Mr. Bridger, an important figure in the English underworld.The heist is planned in England to the most minute detail. It will involve the use of several Mini Cooper cars, plus other vehicles to support the execution. The idea is to create an immense traffic jam in the center of Turin as the armored car is taking the gold to the place where it will be kept. The English criminals will be in Turin disguised as fans of a soccer match that will be played in the city between England and Italy. The plan works as intended in an operation that baffles not only the police, but also the Italian mafia that wanted the gold for themselves. The chase goes all over Turin where the police is outsmarted and outrun by the superiority of the Englishmen. All goes well until they try to take the loot to Switzerland using the dangerous highway between the two countries where the bus they are using suffers an unexpected accident that leaves everything up in the air, literally.This 1969 English film is a minor classic of the genre. Director Peter Collinson's vision of a thriller paid well because of the impeccable way where the chase comes the real star of the movie. Troy Kennedy-Martin's screenplay takes some time in distracting the viewer by presenting the figures of Mr. Bridger, and even Professor Peach, or even the Mafia element that don't add anything to the story. The best thing in "The Italian Job" is Michael Caine. He was making a name for himself in the English cinema and proved he was capable to carrying the film. The supporting cast does a good job, but there are so many that their contribution was the ensemble acting they gave Mr. Collinson.Douglas Slocombe cinematography is still a wonder after forty years since the film was shot. The musical score by Quincy Jones plays perfectly in the background. The title song is by Matt Munro, one of the finest singing voices from England."The Italian Job" is a masterpiece in comparison with the Hollywood 2003 remake of this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes it's a "classic", and iconic for what it is, but it's definitely from the early days of action movies, before there were such concerns as anything resembling plausibility and continuity It's a treat see the Michael Caine in his very younger days, skin all smooth and bright, and just driving around in that world, the buildings, people...machines...is pure candy, but energy-wise it can be a bit of a snooze. It's probably best saved for the wee hours or some lazy afternoon when you have some idle time. I was ready for the Mini chase scenes to end about halfway through. I'd hardly steer you away from seeing it, just come with modest expectations and enjoy as you can. The two chubbies waving to the uniquely adorable Benny Hill from outside, that got a hoot out of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout movie history, there have been so many caper movies that it's easy to forget which is which. "Topkapi" and "The Italian Job" should qualify as the two best ones ever. This one casts Michael Caine as Charlie Crocker, getting involved in a heist in Italy. I swear that pretty much every SECOND of this movie has you on the edge of your seat. And I can't believe that I'd never heard of it until the American remake came out (as it was, the American remake wasn't half bad). But mark my words people, not only is this one of the many movies that affirms Michael Caine as possibly the Union Jack's most dependable actor of the past fifty years, but it shows why the few years surrounding 1970 were truly the golden age of cinema ("The Graduate", "2001", "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie", "The Great White Hope", "The Last Picture Show", "The Godfather").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Job's A Good'n</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job is hailed as one of the great British institutions, and is always guaranteed to pull in the viewers around the football season (though our boys don't always match up to their victorious 1960's equivalents). This film boasts an excellent cast which includes stars such as Benny Hill, Noel Coward and of course the legend that is Michael Caine.The film begins as Charlie Crocker (Caine) is released from prison, and the events that follow show the Mini Cooper filled capers of a bunch of Brits trying to pocket $4,000,000 at the height of the World Cup in Italy. We see Noel Coward as a criminal mastermind who virtually controls the prison he is incarcerated in and Benny Hill as the unforgettable professor with a penchant for the larger lady. This great cult classic has created many of Britain's most prized catchphrases, which can be and are applied to most everyday situations for comedy effect. Not only is this a classic in its own right, but the Italian Job has also had a helping hand in the careers of many of our most loved actors. The whole film is a riot of colour, whether the subject is the Tuscan mountains or the sprawl of the football supporters, as it was produced in the vivid film quality of the 1960's. The stunt work is impressively intricate even to today's standards and the film even comes equipped with its own catchy theme song. The plot is well thought out and has enough 'will they or won't they' moments to keep you on the edge of your seat, while it is still able to pull off that notorious brand of home grown humour that we do so well. The only aspect that would let the Italian Job down in a competition for 'really really good films' would be the standard of acting. Personally, I don't think that Michael Caine acts particularly poorly in this film, (though I know a lot of people who do - opinions on a postcard please) but many of the supporting roles are a bit dodgy, I'll say nothing about Camp Freddie. Another argument that I have had too many times is whether the film is overly dated. As an obvious fan of this film, I feel it has a certain nostalgic charm but this doesn't get in the way of it being one of the best heist movies ever made. Michael Caine as Crocker is one of his best early roles and is proven to be so by the amount of impressions performed by the general public, admittedly most are usually near to closing time down the local. Charlie is a loveable rogue who is able to get you routing for him before the end of the film, with all those cheeky tricks how can it be wrong? The original Italian Job is a must see for all those who like car chases, mafia bosses, pretty girls, football, nice suits, England winning something and quite literally amazing cliff hangers - surely that's everyone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notes on the DVD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent documentary material which, however, is sadly lacking any comment from any of the actors apart from Frank Jarvis (Roger) and Derek Ware (Rozzer - and in fact he was the stunt coordinator in addition). The deleted "Blue Danube" scene is a delight to watch, although I agree with the general consensus of the makers that it would have been out of place in the actual released movie.The commentary is done by Michael Deeley, the producer, and the author of "The Making of The Italian Job" book, Matthew Field. Field, rather sadly, comes across I'm afraid as the worst kind of anorak or Italian Job fanboy. He spends at least half the movie telling Deeley stuff about the movie which Deeley himself has evidently forgotten. At one point he raises a bizarre theory that the production designer Disley Jones was responsible for introducing an orange motif, since the Lambourghini seen during the opening titles, the titles themselves and the bulldozer used by the mafia to destroy Charlie Croker's car are all orange. Then Deeley points out as gently as he can that Jones would not have been responsible for the colour of the credits, and the bulldozer is orange because it would have come in that colour regardless. Later on Field makes a kind of Freudian slip, when he refers to something in filming and uses the phrase, "...and then we...." as if he'd been present on set, when in fact it was made twelve years before he was born!Deeley himself makes a charming comment about another movie he produced, without naming it: "I liked the contrast in another movie I made, which started off in the foundries of Pittsburgh, and the opening scene was a long wedding scene, and then we suddenly cut to Vietnam...." Nicely subtle!The end of the documentary pays a brief tribute to the talent of director Peter Collinson, who tragically died of cancer when he was in his forties. Strangely enough, his widow repeatedly said that he died when he was "not quite 41", whereas the IMDb records his age at death as 44 (April 1936 - December 1980).I'd like to briefly talk about some of the comments made here - I find it deeply sad that anybody could remotely consider the remake superior, and criticising this classic original because elements of it were "impossible" or "implausible" can only have been made by people who have never seen a caper movie before. "I was halfway through the movie before I realized that it was supposed to be a comedy, not a genuine caper flick." Erm, *all* genuine caper flicks are comedies, or should be (ever hear of "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World?), and this one is no less a caper flick than any other that has been made. "I'm still not sure exactly what kind of person Mr. Bridger is supposed to be -- a prisoner who has free run of the prison and is treated like royalty by everyone, including the guards?" Hello, again, *it's* *a* *comedy*. And a prisoner who sees prison as no reason to curtail his activities and has the staff in his pocket is a very old conceit and has been used in films that these guys would praise, like Goodfellas for instance. To say nothing of people who say its a terrible movie because the heisters are shambling incompetents! Actually, this is a joke very much understood and enjoyed by the British and other Europeans which the Americans seem simply not to comprehend - which may explain why The Italian Job (and other similar movies actually made in Hollywood, like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight and the original Ocean's 11) failed in the States.Gregmoroberts, your heart is in the right place, but you posted your comment about the remake on the wrong movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a picture of the Queen in it sir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little startled by some of the reviews on here doing this film down, implying it's some kind of two-bit farce with little to recommend it except a few big names.Startled because, as far as my own opinion goes, The Italian Job is the best British comedy I've ever seen, and certainly in my top 10 of all films. I think some of its critics either just don't get it, or aren't familiar with the whole 'muddling through' kind of humour that was a staple of the post-war UK. The famous Ealing comedies of the 40s and 50s were precursors (albeit rather more prim ones) to The Italian Job, and if you don't like any of them either then you're definitely missing something here too.I don't know if I want to write a huge complex essay preaching about how wonderful The Italian Job is, but I hope that some of these plus-points will help get across why this film was re-released nationwide in the cinema for its 30th anniversary and had normally timid audiences spontaneously joining in with the dialogue:- The whole thing feels really cool and stylish. The opening Matt Monro song is wonderfully mellow, Michael Caine was a young and well-dressed guy in 1969 and the spectacular Italian scenery together with London's 'swinging' status and Noel Coward's urbane charm all make for a convincing package.- It's really really funny! Once you get into it, almost every scene is memorable and the quality holds up right through to the end. There is a reason why all Michael Caine impersonations (except for 'My name is Harry Palmer') are lines from The Italian Job, and that's because they're so witty and so numerous and delivered by Caine so well. Benny Hill is on top form, and as someone who hates his tv series I was pleasantly surprised by what must be the greatest performance of his career. Even Noel Coward gets some of his wittiest-ever screen dialogue, and considering his distinguished career that's really saying something.- It's unique. There's almost nothing out there with a similar balance of adventure and humour, which makes a great combination as you can take the plot as seriously as you want. Sure you'll find car chases elsewhere, sure you'll find bungling thieves and dry remarks, but this kind of balance is very rare. I can only think of perhaps Raiders Of The Lost Ark as being another film so happy with its semi-serious status.- It's British, or perhaps English. Now, I'm not really patriotic at all but it's always nice to see something that feels true to the people who made it. It's very depressing to see British film makers trying to half-heartedly copy Hollywood, and it's also very depressing to see Hollywood feeling somehow scared of being American when it does epics like Gladiator (all performed for some reason in posh English accents). The Italian Job revels in the declining state of the UK instead of ignoring it, and makes a point of showing how ill-prepared and incompetent the crooks are. There's also a wonderful torch-passing moment where former English icon Noel Coward squares up to future English icon Michael Caine in the prison toilet, one face distinguished but elderly and the other full of sparkle and ambition for the future. If you're unaware of who these people are, the scene probably won't mean much to you and that might hold true for a lot of other things in The Italian Job.- It's a non-macho action film. From 'camp' Freddie to Noel 'everybody in the world is bent' Coward, from the gormless crooks with migraine to a cigar-eating Benny Hill, right down to the diminutive Minis themselves, this isn't a film that Schwarzenegger or Stallone would be seen anywhere near. The bullets are non-existent, the violence isn't excessive and the car chase isn't so much an adrenaline rush as a wonderful cinematic spectacle. One of the filmed scenes edited out of the final cut had the Minis and police cars stumbling into an ice rink where they accidentally perform pirouettes round each other to ballet music (the writer felt this looked *too* silly and ordered it cut).As others have pointed out, there's also just a certain something that makes The Italian Job punch far above its theoretical weight. For some inexplicable reason, in a way very much like Star Wars in America, The Italian Job has entered the British public's consciousness to such an extent that people still quote it and recognise quotations from it (Eddie Izzard does an entire routine based around the film), 'self-preservation society' is sung in football grounds by thousands of fans, remixes of the theme and samples from the film regularly appear on the radio, Italian Job pinball machines are a not uncommon sight, and there's even been a hit Playstation game (rather a good one too).If anyone is wondering why there's so much trepidation in the UK over the American remake, imagine if a film company announced they were going to remake the original Star Wars film. It'd be pointless because people don't watch Star Wars for its clever plot or basic concepts. Just like The Italian Job, the charm of Star Wars lies entirely in the finished product, the final combination of actors, music, editing and visuals. Remaking it from scratch would be like completely changing the recipe for Coca-Cola, and no one would be that stupid, would they? Well, okay, they were, but look what happened...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is perhaps one of the greatest heist films of all time. Certainly one of the funniest. The cast is superb lead by Michael Caine, the inimitable Noel Coward, and including such notable British comics as Bennie Hill, Irene Handl and John Le Mesurier. Caine has never been better, as in the role of the flamboyant cockney Charlie, who leads a clever and daring snatch of 4 million dollars of gold in Turin, despite efforts by the local Mafia and Police to foil the attempt at every turn. Highlight of course is the remarkable chase across a traffic congested Turin by the three Minis, beautifully filmed and edited to precision. The later remake never catches up with the pace and timing the original, and certainly not the wry British sense of humour. The late 60's saw the production of some really brilliant cinema, and this is a notable example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Croker, recently released from chokey, is planning a four-million dollar gold bullion heist in Turin. The scam involves deliberately causing a massive traffic jam, knocking off the gold and then escaping with it in three Minis along a complicated back-alley route. But first Charlie must convince the powerful and dismissive Mr Bridger to fund his outlandish scheme.The quintessential British caper flick, this is a great fun film which plasters a smile to your mug right from the start and keeps it there. It has four key ingredients going for it. Firstly, a fantastic script by Troy Kennedy Martin, with a great central idea for the heist, a gallery of lovable lowlifes and lots of funny dialogue ("We all work together as a team, and that means you do everything I say."). Secondly, a terrific performance by Caine, whose unbridled barrow-boy charm permeates almost every scene. Thirdly, an amazing score by Quincy Jones which runs the gamut from easy listening to jazz and traditional orchestra and concludes with a wild toe-tapping cockney singalong number called "Getta Bloomin' Move On !". And finally, incredible stuntwork by Remy Julienne for the zesty classic car-chase finale, with Union Jack Mini Coopers racing through piazzas, arcades and subways. The rest of the cast have a tremendous comic pedigree, and Coward is deft and mannered (in his final film) as the haughty, snobbish, macroeconomically-minded, royalty-adoring Mr Bridger. This is definitely a movie for classic car enthusiasts, featuring Lamborghinis, Aston Martins, Jags and lots of Fiats. Beautifully photographed on location in Turin and the Alps by Douglas Slocombe, handsomely produced by Michael Deeley and stylishly directed by the underrated Collinson, this is one of the most beloved and entertaining British movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie will won't appear in top 100 lists of so called "movie critics" it will appear in mine (at least for the moment). It is very easy to tell why:The acting by Michael Caine is very good in this movie,to me it surpasses his acting in "The Man Who Would Be King".The chase sequence at the end is very well made and to me one of the classic chases in cinema history.(the best being "The French Connection) Still,The Mini Coopers rule!There is a lot of English humor in the film,especially because of Michael Caine but also because of Benny Hill in a very curious yet extremely funny supporting role.I'm not going to talk about the content of the movie,that's not very important and you have to see to believe it.But the final shot is a classic if you ask me and it has been copied by Guy Ritchie in "Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels".It has been remade in Hollywood and although I haven't seen it yet (I don't think I will either) I can't imagine that it surpasses or even comes close to the original.Another point is the English humor that probably isn't the Hollywood version,it just can't be imitated by Americans. (nothing personal,but English humor is English humor)An action classic with a very high comic touch to it. 9/10 (currently number 97 in my all-time top 100 list)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London criminal Charlie Croker inherits an ingeneous plan to steal $4 million in gold from an armoured convoy in Turin by creating a giant traffic jam. This is a film that I never tire of watching. It was one of the first that I posted a review for some 12 months ago, and since then I've bought the DVD when it came out, and was lucky enough to catch a rare screening at the local multiplex a few months ago. It was transmitted a few nights ago on the BBC once again, and I still couldn't resist its charm. The film's pulling power is due to a number of factors:- 1.Good economical direction from Peter Collinson which keeps everything moving along briskly. 2.A breezy, witty script that raises some laughs. 3.Perfect casting in Michael Caine, Noel Coward, Benny Hill, Irene Handl, Raf Vallone and Tony Beckley. 4.Beautiful Italian locations, gorgeously photographed, and 5.The amazing stunt driving through the streets of Turin. If you haven't seen it in its full 2.35:1 aspect ratio on DVD or on the big screen you're really missing out. Also, the DVD contains a lengthy and fascinating documentary on the making of the film. Over the years it has been elevated to classic status here in the UK, and its easy to see why. Quite simply, its good natured harmless fun that's guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thieves plan to pull off the heist of their lives by creating Turin's largest ever traffic jam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture narrates as Charlie (Michael Caine) has just left prison, and now wants to realize a 'big job' , he has plans to rob 4 million dollars worth of gold and being financed by Mr Bridger (Noel Coward) ,a Mafia-type boss, who is in jail. The job is to steal a lots of gold arriving in Italy from China but he needs to get a band together first. The motley thieves gang (formed by Benny Hill, Robert Powell, Tony Beckley, among others) whose mastermind is gathering specialists to pull off and execute a caper in Turin attempting to rob gold bullion's . In Italy, a clever plan is used to distract the authorities, while the raiders make their get-away in their Minis. They get away in their Mini Coopers, which are small enough to drive on sidewalks so they can make a clean get away before the traffic jam clears . This leads an excellent and unforgettable car chase sequence . Contains the legendary Mini Cooper pursuit images through Italian streets, and other dangerous ways as buildings, rivers, and sewers. After Charlie and his crew pull off a picture perfect heist of tens of millions of dollars worth of gold occur several surprises.This is a very amusing film dealing wit a group of robbers, led by career criminal Charlie Croker stunningly performed by Michael Caine who create the largest traffic jam in Turin history, giving them time to pull off a theft of gold bullion. The film blends tension ,action packed ,comedy, emotion, suspense , plot twists and is pretty entertaining and bemusing . There are wild chases galore with impressive velocities pursuits cars making varied and spectacular capers , with bounds and leaps by the streets ,undergrounds , canals, highways and rooftops which lasts for several minutes. Furthermore , there's a clever twist ending as happen generally in those flicks. Actors' interpretation is nice and enjoyable . Michael Caine is cool, Margaret Blye 's delightful performance plus of enticing and attractive . Special mention the veterans Raf Vallone as Italian gangster and Noel Coward as typical British mobster . Very good and colorful cinematography by excellent cameraman Douglas Slocombe . Catching and jolly musical score by Quincy Jones, including emotive song at the beginning by the usual Matt Monro. This moving film is well directed by Peter Collinson. Collinson's royal directorial treatment provides it with action, humor and majestic sweep. He was an expert on thriller (Sell out, Target on assassin), suspense (Spiral staircase, Ten little Indians, Open season), terror(Straight on till morning), Warlike-adventure(You can't win ém all), his biggest hit was this ¨The Italian job¨ , until his early death by cancer at 41 . The film will appeal to Michael Caine fans and hold-up genre enthusiasts. Rating: Highly recommended. It's remade by Italian Job (2003) directed by F. Gary Gray , while the original movie was in most part developed in Italy (Turin) in this remake the setting is in Venice and US (L.A.) , here the masterminds (Donald Sutherland and Mark Wahlberg)are gathering specialists (Seth Green,Mos Def,Jason Statham,Edward Norton) to pull off and execute a caper in Venice and again with the famous and legendary -for vehicle buffs at least- cars copied of previous movie . Worthwhile seeing . Better than average .</fullReview>

While it's not overly absorbing or even that well acted, the CAR CHASE towards the end is the absolute BEST I've ever seen (and that INCLUDES Bullitt!). The yarn is about a thief planning to do a heist by creating a massive traffic jam and escaping using small cars able to navigate through "alternative routes". The job is pulled off and the car chase is on. The thieves use Mini-Coopers and lead the Police on one of the greatest car chases ever filmed. They utilize sewers and other very tight places to elude the police. The car chase alone is worth the film but the rest of it is also pretty fair. Look for Michael Caine doing a fine job in this film. Again, this is one of my all-time favorites!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to describe something which epitomizes true English spirit in less that 1000 words? Argh.I've seen this film over a 100 times, and I never seem to tire of it. It has a style unto its own that just catches you up and pulls you along for the ride. I mean carrying gold in the back of a Mini! It's ludicrous, but it works. There's no denying it.Beneath the late 60's gloss there is a bloody good film under here. A very intricate plot, perfectly delivered lines ("You must have shot an awful lot of tigers. - Yes, I used a machine gun") and above all a great cast.Caine does the business once again, and a solid supporting cast with greats such as John LeMesurier ensures you can't help but believe in the characters.As I say, an intricate plot, which unfortunately dates the film. These days a cinema experience seems to be more of a wham bang thank you mam. But if you feel like watching a proper film, with proper characters and a huge dollop of English patriotism, then this is for you.Get your skates on mate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great locations.Noel Coward has a too brief run played with parody to fine effect.BUTLongfellow would agree with me: when Michael Caine is bad he his horrid. Not that MC had much to work with, I dare say. Dreadful dialogue to the effect of: "listen to me" (repeated throughout the proceedings) or "they're gaining on us."Fans of Bullitt, Gone In 60 Seconds and Smokey And The Bandit will get hard over the tedious, gimmicky car chases.The women in the film are treated with disdain and disrespect.The male sub-characters in the film are so unrecognizable and unlikeable that they make the sub-characters in Reservoir Dogs (another overrated movie) look like Curtin in The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre.Speaking of, the ending is nicked from The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre.The upcoming DVD release is rumoured to feature TWO audio commentary tracks which will undoubtedly contain piles of apologies from the knobs involved.Stick with gold-thieving British caper comedies with Sir Alec Guinness like The Lavender Hill Mob instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must be a generational thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually into submitting reviews on films, however I just had to for this movie. I and a few friends went to see the 2003 version of The Italian Job a few weeks ago, and it was reasonably enjoyable, so we decided to watch the original, which we had been told was absolutely brilliant. After sitting through the entire thing (which took some doing - if it hadn't been for the minis I would have fast forwarded large chunks of it) I've come to the conclusion that it must be a generational thing. It must be understandable to those who watched it when it first came out, and not to others. Even allowing for the 60's fashions and the outdated computers, this is a terrible movie. It goes nowhere, and does nothing. Charlie's offsiders are terribly pathetic - they can't seem to do anything right. And the bus driver - don't get me started!! You mean to tell me that he wouldn't know that swinging a dirty great bus like that, with a whole heap of gold and a dozen men in it, from side to side would get him a tad out of control! What an idiot! And Charlie (Michael Caine) even more so for not telling him to control himself till they're home free! I really don't like movies which have non-endings. So, in my humble, post-1969 opinion, this is a bad movie, and I'm very glad I'm not studying it so I don't have to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hang on lads, I've got a great idea for a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film remembered very much for its quirky ending and amazing car stunts in the middle of Turin, Italy, The Italian Job does a half-decent job to entertain us with light hearted comedy, thrills, spills and average story.However, I rather think the film would've disappeared had it not been for the charismatic weightiness of the relatively new British actor, Michael Caine. Already well known in the UK from previous films such as Zulu &amp; Alfie, and it particular for his portrayal of Harry Palmer in a succession of spy movies (Ipcress File and Funeral In Berlin) Caine was still largely an unknown on the internation circuit, particularly in Hollywood.The Italian Job offered Caine the opportunity to shine across the world and move him into super stardom as the cheeky Cockney with a heart of gold and roguish character. Caine has a very interesting presence on screen, a kind of British version of Robert Redford. He looks very self assured, perhaps a touch arrogant but he has the capabilities of either lifting a poor film into a competent one or dragging a goood film down to an average one based purely on his own strengths &amp; weaknesses.The Italian Job, therefore, is very much an average film even if one includes the stunts &amp; chases. But Caine's marvellous character lifts the movies to a more pleasing one because his character is so large &amp; rounded that even though we know he is very much a dodgy criminal by nature he isn't really a nasty evil man and so we can relate to him and cheer him on all the way through the movie.I didn't really like Noel Coward's role at all as the Mr Bridger, the highly respected prisoner/criminal overlord that even the prison Governor has to respect. To me it was an embarressment and only served to distract the viewer and slow the pace of the film right down. Coward is far too pompous &amp; boorish and added nothing to the movie at all.Some of the supporting characters, Benny Hill, Robert Powell, Irene Handl &amp; John Le Measurier are quite familiar to the great majority of UK tv viewers but don't really do themselves much justice in this film, with the possible exception of Hill and his passion for "large" ladies, which would in future years develop into his own TV show "Benny Hill Show".Although the story is ok it soon becomes bogged down with too many distractions &amp; seems to take for ever to get moving. And of course because this is primarily a British made film with a lot of UK actors the largely Cockney accent from most of the cast does irritate, even to other UK ears.But again Caine's presence makes us forget about these little faults and all of a sudden the film becomes interesting again. But really this film is far too dependent on those car chases and "that" ending to really make for an enjoyable experience.What the 2003 version of this film will look like I have no idea, but I suspect it will fall flat on its face very much in the same way the Hollywood remake of another British classic, Get Carter, died a quiet death two years ago.The Italian Job is ok for a boring Sunday afternoon viewing, but take away Caine and you don't have much to think about.**/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today in film, we are obsessed with heroes. No matter if they are actually superheroes, super spies, or just fast drivers, we love to see high octane action with our leads saving the day. Well we also love to root for the anti-hero. The Italian Job is a great example of a film that definitely had an influence on the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, or just any film that gets us to root for characters who aren't necessarily doing the right thing.It stars Michael Caine, a fresh out of jail criminal who is convinced to do one more job. The ultimate multi-million dollar 'Italian Job'. His character, much like most of Michael Caine's early characters, is a ladies man, and also just about as smooth as any British character can get. He's in charge of putting his team together to perfect the job, and the film turns out to be a pretty fun ride. Now I think most of the goofiness and comedy can be a bit dated if you watch it now, but the action definitely holds up. The stunts are impeccable for a 1960's film. In fact the third act has several stunts that would be considered great if it came out today. I think the film suffers at times from having a lack of a clear and present main villain. It's much like Fast 5, in that it's a really fun film with bold action that just doesn't feel complete because the villain (if you can really call him a villain) just isn't present enough for us to care.But the film is still endlessly entertaining and full of classic quotes and a great Michael Caine performance. I know the ending is a bit controversial for some people but I actually love it. I think it was the perfect ending for a film with this kind of tone. So in all, The Italian Job is a solid heist film that I'm sure was praised during it's time.+Caine is such a ladies man +Stunts &amp; action +Suspenseful towards the end +Perfect ending -Lack of a present villain -Goofy at times 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun caper comedy and British satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having commented on the 2003 remake of this movie, I thought I should also review the original ? after watching it again. I noted that the 2003 version is good as well, but it is all crime without the comedy, and it's almost all "high tech." The plot of this original does rely on technology ? a switched computer tape that runs the city of Turin's traffic system. But, that's taken care of in a few minutes of the film. The rest is a plot of planning, maneuvering and action with interludes of miscues. This is among the earliest films to use a high-tech device in its plot. Before this time, the most commonly used plots with technical devices were security alarm systems in museums and cameras in banks. Humor is interspersed in all this. It's a British movie filmed in Ireland, England, the city of Turin, Italy, and the Italian Alps. Michael Caine is Charlie Croker, a local bad boy who has just finished two years in the slammer. Noel Coward is Mr. Bridger, the imprisoned king of corruption in Great Britain. Croker has to get Bridger's organization to back the biggest heist of all time -- $4 million in gold. Raf Vallone is Altabani, the Italian mafia leader who's out to stop the British heist. Besides being a very good comedy caper film, "The Italian Job" (1969) is one heck of a satire of the British penal system. Every scene back at the prison with Mr. Bridger is hilarious. This is the funniest and best mockery portrayal of a big time criminal living the life of royalty in a prison. The film has a large cast of men involved in the heist, but the vast bulk of dialog, scene time and humor is with the three main characters. The cinematography is excellent and the filming and scripting of the car chase scenes is among the best of that type of action ever filmed. Mr. Bridger's loyalty to Great Britain and the royal family is the cause of some good laughs a few times. Croker saves the lives of his crew when Altabani and his Mafia men intercept them coming into Italy over the Alps. He tells Altabani that if the Mafia kills him and his men, Bridge's organization would come down on the thousands of Italian restaurants and other businesses in Great Britain.The Mafia is protective of Italy's economy, while Bridger also is interested in bolstering England's lagging economy by causing the hit on Italy's economy through the heist. It's all quite funny. There are some instances of innuendo about Croker and his love life, and a few otherwise clean jokes in places that only the older children are likely to get. So, this is a film that the whole family should enjoy. I think one of the very best scenes is the ending. It's the perfect "unending" to leave an audience to wonder if the old adage is true ? that "crime does not pay."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Witty And Intelligent Caper Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job is a British caper film that tells a story of flashy and fast romp that chases a team of career criminals throughout one of the biggest international gold heists in history.It stars Michael Caine together with Noël Coward,Benny Hill,Raf Vallone and Tony Beckley.It was written by Troy Kennedy Martin, produced by Michael Deeley and directed by Peter Collinson. Charlie Croker is a stylish robber and ladies man that just out of prison. He returns to becoming a career criminal upon release by taking over the "The Italian Job" - a complicated plan to hijack gold bullion from Italy during the presence of the Italian Police and the Mafia. It seems that Croker lack the experience for such a big heist and that complicates the situation after the supposed leader got murdered.But Croker turns to the eccentric Mr. Bridger,who provides him with a group of career criminals with certain specialties such as computer hackers,bank robbers, hijackers, and getaway drivers.This was definitely cool film back in the 60's.It was an unpretentious caper comedy.Added to that,the different characters involved and the different type of criminals with different sets of expertise makes it witty and entertaining.No question that the witty dialogues and one-liners adds charm and appeal to it.Finally,it is a smoothly entertaining and slyly intelligent crowd-pleasing type of film that will never go out of style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's probably not a good idea to see a remake first, but in the case of The Italian Job I did see the Mark Wahlberg/Ed Norton/Donald Sutherland version first. That was an interesting enough film with the action on revenge. But this original with Michael Caine playing the ringleader of a daring bullion hijack has a sense of style all its own. And why wouldn't it with Noel Coward giving his farewell screen performance.Caine is the ringleader of a team of crack hijackers who've been given a plan by the late Rossano Brazzi and it's Caine's job to flesh it out and make it all happen. He's given the plan by Brazzi's less than grieving widow Margaret Blye and he takes it to master criminal Noel Coward.Watching Coward running things from his prison cell put me in mind of Goodfellas where the wise guys are all living the good life via bribes of guards, etc. He might be in jail, but no one is going crimp in any way Noel Coward's sense of refinement. Caine has to sell himself and the job to Coward.But once he does the robbery goes off like clockwork. The caper itself is where this version and the Mark Wahlberg version are at the most similar. Who would have thought that Seth Green would be playing a role originated by Benny Hill as a computer mastermind. Of course computers have changed some in the over 30 years between the two films.Only Ocean's 11 (the Sinatra version) has the same sense of irony in its conclusion as The Italian Job has. Talk about unresolved endings.......</fullReview>

But i think his performance here is especially good, hes got the right voice for the lead role. He also has those facial expressions which you can read like a book, which i love! Also the sets and locations were excellent and well chosen! The directing and producing i thought was one of best bits, if i am totally honest i couldn't spot one thing wrong. They done a VERY thorough but a really good job as well.Overall this movie is my favourite film of all time, and certainly one of those films i will NEVER get tired off. So to the people who created this masterpiece in film you didn't just "blow the doors off" you definitely "blew it apart". Very Well Done!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed The Italian Job in general, I don't revere it as a classic but it is entertaining with a great cast, fabulous locations and a brilliant soundtrack. The secondary characters could have been developed much more though, and the direction was a little too flashy. That said, a vast majority of the dialogue is above decent, there are occasions where it could have been better, but it is good enough. It is well paced though, and the cinematography, scenery, set pieces and costumes are fabulous, Turin looks glamorous and the interiors from Twickenham Studios are stunning. Quincy Jones's soundtrack is brilliant, and the cast is first rate, with Michael Caine suave and charismatic, Noel Coward marvellous and Benny Hill great value. Overall, not a classic by all means but very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun heist caper, whose reputation appears to have grown over the years, especially measured against the Hollywood remake - remodel in recent times. The film's notable for two of the more enduring movie catch-phrases (Caine's Charlie Croker admonishing one of his gang who overdoes a tad the opening of a van door with "You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!") and of course that wonderfully enigmatic pay-off line at the finish, Caine again - "Hang on lads, I've got a great idea..." as the gang's future suspends literally in the balance.Caine powers the action along as the gang-master and schemer and is great value here, but even he is overshadowed by the old maestro Noel Coward in a film-stealing role as the overlord, royalty-loving, Mafia-defying Mr Bridger who sees the heist as a contribution to the national deficit and morale-boosting fillip to the country more than anything else. To be fair, no one else in the cast gets a look-in on the acting stakes and quite what lecherous old Benny Hill is doing playing a lecherous old boffin is anyone's guess.The locations are superb, the stunts great (this must be the first movie with a "car-count", so many end up wrecked), with the flotilla of minis (deliberately red white and blue, doubtless, to bolster the nationalist feeling, although the Scot in me would respectfully point out that the English flag doesn't contain any blue!) reminiscent to me of nothing as much as the pursuit of O.J. Simpson. Quincy Jones, oddly enough for this most English of films, gets to deliver a natty soundtrack apart from a god-awful cockney rhyming slang song of zero merit entirely. My only other carp would be, as so often in movies of this era, over the denigrating treatment of women - for example, the widow of the original mastermind, killed off by the Mafia at the outset and whose "Mission Impossible" type message beyond the grave to Caine sets up the story, only has to see Caine before she's bedding him, "and you still in your widow's weeds" as he drolly tells her...Anyway, although slightly dated by this and other facets of the screenplay, this is a fast moving, highly entertaining movie, which keeps you watching throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate In Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very opening sequence set in the Swiss Alps to Matt Monroe's smooth crooning of 'On Days Like These' to the nerve shredding and utterly absorbing ending, The Italian Job is a classic movie that delivers every time and has never been bettered. The first half hour is fairly fluffy yet quintessentially British, and Michael Caine is a joy to watch in one of his most confident career performances. Throw in a host of British comedy legends and the masterstroke of Noel Coward as arch villain Mr Bridger, and it is this gentle opening that makes the frenetic second half of the movie work so well. For Caine is instructed by Coward to assemble a team of lags to travel to Turin and help themselves to a cargo of gold bullion. Whilst the police are inevitably portrayed as bungling and inept, it is, of course, the local mafia who provide the (not insignificant) obstacle to Caine's success. Although the film doesn't take itself seriously at all, Troy Kennedy Martin's script is still totally assured, and the heist itself followed by the audacious getaway attempt in the now-world famous Mini Cooper scenes is riveting. Indeed, the pace of the movie post-heist is breakneck, and as viewers we barely have time to draw breath in what is surely the best car chase sequence in movie history. The ending is also the best there's ever been - it is so thrilling and suspenseful, and you will be reluctant to leave your seat, even after the credits have rolled - convinced something else has yet to happen. It's not difficult to see why this film in particular re-launched Caine's career in the 1990s when it was rediscovered by a new generation of lads mags and became a national football anthem. Accusations of jingoism are missing the point - this movie is unashamedly British and sheer entertainment, and anyone missing that point misses the whole concept of the movie. Utterly terrific, and watchable time and time again, this is cinema's finest hour and a huge achievement from all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 60's classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic 1969 crime caper starring Michael Caine as Charlie Croker, fresh out of prison and planning to steal $4 million of Italian Gold from under the noses of the Mafia.Iconic, much loved movie which has gained in stature as the years have gone by, mainly due to its wonderful cliffhanger ending which keeps everyone guessing and asks the viewer "how are they going to get out of that?" Caine has never been cooler than this and is ably supported by a cast of character actors from the late Noel Coward, Tony (Harrison Chase) Beckley and Benny Hill to a young Robert Powell in one of his first roles.There's little flashy direction to speak of from director Peter Collinson, in fact some would say its almost pedestrian in its pacing, but that doesn't matter when you have a script as good as the one from Troy Kennedy Martin (he would later reuse much of it for the WWII version of this film, Kelly's Heroes, another favourite movie of mine) and a fantastic final reel that features several brilliant chase scenes involving that other icon of the 60's, the Mini Cooper.A film much deserved of its reputation and a true British classic 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Of It's Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the late 1960's Britain was the cultural centre of the universe. We seemed unstoppable. Our fooballers had won the World Cup, stuffing it to Germany in the process. And pop-culture dominated the world. The Beatles were the ultimate supergroup with a host of others like The Rolling Stones, The Kinks - and presently Led Zeppelin would hammer the message home. If you weren't there; you were square.This movie epitomises the sense of swinging feel-good euphoria that was symptomatic of the times. It takes a great idea for a great heist, employing one of the most iconic images of its time - the mini-car. It took a brash young working-class actor - Micheal Caine - at his peak and pitted him against an equally iconic and adored old hand in the form of Noel Coward.After that; the whole thing was pretty much played for laughs. Even in Britain, the skies were blue and the sun shone. And now we were gonna stuff it to the Italians. It's a fun movie, never to be taken seriously. Just enjoyed for what it was; a celebration of national self-belief. Ah - but how short-lived was that?There are wonderful cameos. John LeMesurier as the prison governor getting slated by his celebrity arch crook. Irreplacable Irene Handl doing her wobbly-woman routine. We see some beautiful British cars destroyed without mercy by the mafia. They'll pay for that, all right. Even in its darkest moments the joyous exuberance never relents.And then there's the minutely-choreographed escape that ultimately leaves our crooked heroes hanging by a thread. Crime can't, in the end, be seen to pay. This was, after all, the decade that brought us The Great Train Robbery.I've no time for the critics. This movie is no more to be taken seriously than 'Mary Poppins'. It's a feel-good experience from a time when feeling good about oneself and one's nation was the unalloyed right of every British citizen. The drab realities of the 1970's, manufacturing decline and the 3-day week would soon be upon us, foreshadowed by the doom-laden counterglow of 'Get Carter'.1969 was the year of dreams. And many of us dreamt, only to be woken by reality. Catch this movie, stop bitchin', and join us for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands up well even years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, no, not the new one from four years ago with Seth Green, Jason Statham, and Mos Def (and a couple of lackluster leads), this is the film that inspired that one, although really the only similarities are that both movies feature heists that involve using Mini Coopers as the getaway vehicles.This version is a fun piece of British propaganda and is very heavy on the "us vs. them" bit. Michael Caine stars as Charlie Croker, a ne'er do well who is just getting out of prison and is already involved in setting up his next scheme, the hi-jacking of $4 million in gold from Turin, Italy. Charlie's partially doing it for the money and partly for revenge for the mafia killing one of his friends, who thought up the daring heist in the first place. Unlike the re-make, none of Charlie's cohorts are anything more than filler; even Benny Hill as a computer expert (!!!) is given very little to do. Only Noel Coward stands out as a prison kingpin named Mr. Bridger; actually, he's the best part of the film, an oddball inmate whom even the guards address respectfully, and who has an odd fetish for Queen Elizabeth II (he even has his own butler in jail). Bridger is delightfully funny, in that quirky offbeat English sort of way, and he steals the show. Caine himself is good, full of high spirits, but in a way he comes off like sort of a straight Austin Powers, played too far but not really realizing he's almost a joke.The heist is again complicated and features snarling up traffic, only this time instead of Ed Norton the villain is the mafia, who is dead-set against seeing the English steal their gold. Once again the highly enjoyable and lengthy chase scenes are terrifically well staged (including a jump across buildings that you know they actually did live), and the Mini Coopers create all sorts of mayhem on their escape from the scene of the crime. The movie is light-hearted and fun, moreso than its remake (though again, it isn't weighted down with Walberg and Theron), but its Monty Python and the Holy Grail-esquire non-ending brings the movie to a crashing halt; you can see the writers pen themselves into a corner and then, rather than find a way out, just give up, walk out of the room, and roll the credits, possibly in an attempt to be modern or absurd, but it really, really doesn't work. Which is a shame, because otherwise the movie is a great bit of oddball fun, certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deservedly a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this film gels into place: from the casting to Quincy Jones's score; from the timing to the sheer cleverness and British humour in the screenplay.The Italian Job offers a positive and, to modern viewers, somewhat romantic view of Great Britain: Michael Caine as the "can-do" crim who must get the support of a patriotic crime boss, played by Noël Coward. Jones has inserted new arrangements of Land of Hope and Glory, Rule Britannia and God Save the Queen in appropriate places. Made only a generation after the end of World War II, it touches on ideas of Britain, the nation which performs when its back is against the wall.And how. Caine and company - which includes Benny Hill as Prof Peach, a computer nerd who has a, shall we say, liking, for big women - have to not only get by the Turin police, but the Mafia as well, out to save the pride of Italy by ensuring the British boys don't get away with their plan.Unlike many films which try to emphasize "Britishness" these days (e.g. the James Bond franchise), there is no heavy-handed suggestion of "retro". It may have touched on old ideas about Britain versus Europe, but Troy Kennedy Martin doesn't shunt us back into the past. Remember, Britain was still, in 1969, a nation on the pinnacle of coolness, at the end of a decade which had given the world the Beatles, the Avengers, and Mary Quant. All were forward-looking; there were no sepia tones and Laura Ashley fabrics.Martin also looks into the underworld, making it seem particularly organized (a hoods' meeting is taking place when Caine first proposes the job), patriotic (Coward issues a directive to make sure younger prisoners stand to attention when the National Anthem is played), on occasion clumsy ('You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!'), and that there is honour among thieves ('He's just done a two-year stretch... and he's as honest as the day is long.')The opening sequence is a joy, hearing the Lamborghini Miura's V12 to Matt Munro's delectable performance of Of Days Like These. Rémy Julienne's stunt team does a marvellous job in Turin with the three Mini Coopers. Even the ums and ers in the dialogue contribute something to this film.Perhaps its genius is the attention to detail that is far from apparent on its first viewing. Some films can be remade - but it will be incredibly difficult to maintain the freshness of the original Italian Job, as one hears rumoured, and feature a forward-looking Cool Britannia, indigenously designed British automobiles, and the incorporation of an "old school" of nation-loving gangsters. This film is deservedly a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job - people rant and rave about this film, and we always get told it's the one with the three mini coopers and that infamous line. It's all that, but so much more as well.Noel Coward's performance was amazing, the camera loves him - and he loves it back, oozing camp control at every moment. Caine doing what he does best, shout, get annoyed and generally play the bad boy. The surprise for me was how visually interesting the film was - sweeping shots of the alps, racing movements through Turin...surperb.The minis sequence is all its build up to be and more, I just grinned throughout. I loved the fact that no Italian policeman could drive, in fact the whole comedy anti-European theme was hilarious.A great, entertaining film with a strong supporting cast (Benny Hill!) and a brave, memorable ending. Often copied, never matched. Spoil yourself, go enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made at the end of the swinging sixties, "The Italian Job" is still one of the most perfectly entertaining romps ever committed to film, with no great intention than to provide an audience with pure fun. Michael Caine, fresh out of prison, leads an assortment of fellow crooks in a grand endeavor to liberate a fortune in gold from under the watchful eyes of both the Italian government and the mafia. Bankrolled by criminal kingpin Noel Coward, himself ruling the roost from prison, they disguise themselves as football fans and executive an ingenious, bloodless heist in Turin. Their escape, in a convoy of Austin Minis, is one of the most rollicking chases in cinematic history.Richly made and fun by the truckload, "The Italian Job" is must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Caine leads a band of ragtag crooks in a grandiose caper?masterminded by Rossano Brazzi from the grave (via movie film) and by Noel Coward from his prison cell?that involves creating a stupendous traffic jam in Turin that will allow for the theft of millions in gold bullion.I had a hard time following the story of this comic heist film, which seems to have laid a thin layer of satire over the proceedings in order to cover up wacky implausibilities and gaping holes in the plot. The first hour is a bust, not much livened up by the impish Caine, droll Coward or bawdy Benny Hill (one of the crooks, with an irrelevant lust for fat women); but the last half-hour, in which the caper is pulled off with the help of Minis, is fun. And I loved the ending. People who enjoy seeing things happen to cars would be fools to miss this film, which continually lingers over them crashing, blowing up, falling off cliffs and collapsing under the weight of power shovels.</fullReview>

In the true sixties style, with smart cars and smooth manoeuvring, this film has been pulled off with immense style in parts and is the bread and butter of a truly British film. Michael Caine performs really well among a truly interesting range of actors who come together brilliantly and entertain non stop throughout. A definite must see for a fan of straight forward action, excitement and great story. Enjoyable for Adults and Children alike. Obviously there will be skeptics, but seriously give this film a look in, and if you're not convinced then just watch it again, as it definitely grows on you. Just remember to watch it to enjoy it, rather than pick at, although this is hard to do. Definitely a classic family film that works on all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flick that fits like a comfy shoe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strange really, a flick that was never particularly good, a script to match, the most blatant product-placement in history with the Mini Coopers...pretty underwhelming from go to whoa...yet it is beloved of film buffs (well at least by the over 45 set) and veritably held up even as some revered Brit classic! Closer inspection deepens the mystery! With the exception of Caine, not a solitary half interesting character appears - the majority are grade A morons. A snooze-inducing opening 40 minutes and the famous "car-chase" that in fact is a total fizzer. Absolutely NOTHING happens. Simply the images of the Minis lurching through the sewers of Turin seems to have created an impression of "excitement" that simply isn't there. By far the best things in the movie are the stylish opening scenes and the final-frame denouement!But having said all that - the film HAS something intangible. Perhaps a nostalgic time capsule of life in the 60's (You DID need to be there!) The wholly lovable English humor that ONLY the Brits can possibly identify with. Michael Caine being...well, Michael Caine....GET CARTER in a lighter moment. Speaking of GET CARTER, it saddens me that following the abortion of a remake of THAT classic (for such it WAS) with Sly Stallone two years back, we now have Marky Wahlberg (of all charismaticless actors)as Charlie Croker himself no less, remaking THE ITALIAN JOB as you read this. Due for release next year, one might wonder WHY they have kept up the original title as the setting is now LA..as was that for GET CARTER. Read my LIPS - AMERICANS have the technology to put a man on the moon but they CANNOT successfully remake BRITISH FILMS - and doubtless Caine will be offered another gratuitous cameo. My GOD guys, remakes generally are "iffy" to say the least.....what did they do to PSYCHO, CLEOPATRA, GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, PLANET OF THE APES, ROLLERBALL??? need I go on?I loved this film...the late Fred Emney and Benny Hill's little bit and dammit the whole "englishness" - fancy doing that to an Aston Martin and an E-Type? (no attachment to Ferraris!)As one reviewer suggested however - take Michael Caine out of the equation and what would anyone have ever remembered? What it DID achieve was to sell a truck-load of Mini's throughout Europe that year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Italian Job was a wonderful movie, particularly for Brits who hark back to what we fondly (and probably wrongly) think was a better time.And now a major studio is going to remake it. And the remake will not work. You know it, I know it, everybody knows it. Why? It's not because it will star Wahlberg and Norton, (although two more uncharismatic planks of wood are hard to imagine); and it's not because it will be mostly based in Los Angeles; and it's not because it will be filled with cgi generated car stunts.The reason I fear it won't work, is because, like so many of the recent remakes, it will be literally pointless, in the sense that the makers (re-makers) will completely miss the point of the original.What is the Italian Job fundamentally about? Is it a heist movie? No, even though the heist is the central plot idea. Is it about a car chase? No, even though the speeding minis give us one of the most enjoyable car chases on film. Is it about the politics and attitudes and behaviour of the times? Well we're getting there, and certainly such nuance and subtlety will be beyond our re-makers.OK, yes it is about all of those things; but at its core it is about Charlie Croker, how he lives, how he thinks, how he behaves; his whole philosophy of life. It's Charlie we identify with, it's Charlie we love, it's how Charlie behaves that we want to see.This is a film about a hero.He's irrepressible, he's optimistic, he's quick witted, he's funny and he's resourceful. And it's how he behaves and it's how he reacts that makes and drives the original. IN EVERY SCENE, FROM BEGINNING TO END.And it's why the ending is so perfect. Charlie is completely and utterly (and life threateningly) snookered. But he doesn't give up. Not yet any way. The ending is Charlie's, and it's the culmination of everything we have seen him do throughout the whole film.And what do the re-makers see? A heist movie with a great car chase(which of course they think they will be able to better?.dear oh dear!), and some stupid bits with Benny Hill that they can forget about.And that's why the remake will not work. Because they won't understand what it is they are remaking.And it's this lack of understanding as to why (each in their own special way) the originals worked, that led to such disasters as the remakes of Get Carter, The Thomas Crown Affair and Planet of The Apes.And if that all doesn't worry you, just think, even as we speak Joel Schumacher might right now be thinking about what he could do to The Godfather!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Italian Job" is an enjoyable caper film with fast pacing (there are almost no dead spots), good car stunts, OK performances and a unique, hard-to-forget ending. But many of the scenes involving Noel Coward supposedly planning the whole "job" from inside the jail are laughable (they're just too far-fetched to be accepted as satire of any kind) and the chase goes on perhaps a bit too long. Still, the film is much better than "Dollars" or "How to Steal a Million". (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Everybody In The World Is Bent!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clean, slick, hyperpatriotic and 1960's chic, 'The Job' is an interesting museum piece. The cars sum it all up. The mini cooper was the funky little vehicle that sold a million, and its sports version won a string of international rallies at the end of the 60's. The car rode the wave of 'cool Britannia' confidence that embraced Carnaby Street, The Beatles and the soccer World Cup, and also added to that mood by being successful. The mini cooper proclaims, "we may have lost an empire, but we're a spunky little country with a role to play in the world." Dinky and diminutive, but with plenty of poke under the bonnet, this car was the spirit of Britain 1969.It is clear that this chirpy cockney gold robbery movie was made for the American market. When the Turin police chief reckons the loss to his city, he does so in dollars rather than lire, even though he is talking to fellow Italians. Twee London stereotypes are everywhere, and the weak script is larded with compliments to America, the land which recognizes youth and talent. 'Inside' becomes 'inside of', all for the benefit of "our American cousins".Mister Bridger is a bigshot in the London underworld. He is currently in the slammer, but so important is he that he is able to rule the prison like a decadent Roman emperor. Noel Coward plays Bridger to camp excess. The toilet scene with Charlie resembles a homosexual pick-up, curiously mimicking Coward's meeting with Alec Guinness in "Our Man In Havana". Charlie (Michael Caine) is the lovable cockney wide boy who needs Bridger's approval if The Italian Job is ever to happen.Gold bullion is shipped out of Turin every week at the same hour. British ingenuity can defeat Italian precautions, just as the World Champion English soccer team will be beating the Italian team in the Turin stadium. The robbery is a military operation, drawing on British folk memory and a century of life in uniform. Indeed, the robbers wear a uniform, and if Bridger represents the officer class, with its lofty habit of command and aloofness from anything resembling dirty work, Charlie Croker is the redoubtable NCO who works with the men and controls the operation on the ground.Some things are done well. Quincy Jones's incidental music is great, especially the complex arrangement of "Self-Preservation Society". The mini coopers driving along the pipeline is a splendid visual image, and the accompanying guitar chords resemble Paul Simon's strumming in the almost exactly contemporary "The Graduate". The film's climax is the boarding of the bus by the mini-coopers, the whole thing executed at speed.Other aspects, alas, are not quite as impressive. Charlie and Lorna walk around the airport asphalt while the gold is being unloaded. Even if this were believable, why would they draw attention to themselves so ostentatiously? The film is packed with gaudy racial and cultural stereotypes, the underlying premise being that Italians are pushovers. Charlie and his team escape from the hideout just as the Turin police batter down the front door. Isn't it just conceivable that the cops might have thought about covering the rear exit? The soccer fans' van is ridiculous, and finds it ridiculously easy to work its way through the traffic jam. I didn't like the scene on the parabolic roof - it seemed slow and pointless. And why would cops and robbers race around a velodrome track? What benefit is gained by pushing the cars out on the mountain road, apart from obtaining some nice images to put in the movie?'The Job' is very much a product of its era. Robert Redford turned down the role of Croker in order to play Sundance, and it is interesting to note how this film has dated markedly, while "Butch Cassidy" hasn't at all. Admittedly, part of the ageing process is attributable to the 60's setting - attractive villains live in and among fast cars, swish hotels and pretty girls, and wicker chairs hang from ceiling chains, while apartment walls are festooned with 'pop art' posters. Jokey camera work is a must in this type of film (for example, the zoom-ins on the van during the count-down)."The Italian Job" is like the Turin computer - cumbersome and amusingly quaint, but fascinating to look at, if only in order to marvel at the way things used to be.Verdict - Charming period piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Car Sequence Classics, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to imagine a world where car chases are new and this film was certainly in uncharted territory when this film was shot.But the car chase is really all there is to the film. The set up is slow and the "women as objects" and men as "the cheeky rogue" is just juvenile and tedious. So, the reason why the Austin Powers films are funny - women going crazy over him for no logical reason - is played as serious here. So the whole nymphomaniac fantasy concept just seems lame.The pacing is pretty slow and there's no by-play or sub-plot to help hold interest. It's just one long "and here's how we did what we told you we would do". I am sure fans of the film will say my points are invalid, but I offer them not to negate the popularity of the film, but to warn those that haven't seen it to not expect some kind of "Mission: Impossible!" 60s adventure. It's 13 whining guys stealing gold. Brilliant car chase sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Period British Caper with Holes the Size of Mini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job (1969)Dry TV humor, stretched out to two hoursMichael Caine is adorable, of course, and the movie has a silly caper flair to it, a mix of Goldfinger (with all that baggage, but Sean Connery) and Lavender Hill Mob (which has its laughs, and Alec Guinness), To Catch a Thief (also not the best film, but Cary Grant) and Charade (which has its funny, campy moments and at least a good old romance, with both Cary and Audrey). What I mean to say is, The Italian Job isn't very original, and Michael Caine isn't enough to save it, though he has saved a few movies, for sure. This one drags so often, is sexist so often (even more than a Bond film), and depends on wry little moments for its style and laughs so fully, I wanted to fast forward to the end. I know this isn't a horrible movie, but when it asks me to be patient I quail. Why should I be? So we can watch a bunch of cads pull off a dubious heist (dubious because it's so unlikely, and yet of course, nothing is supposed to really be likely here) and see their little English ironies at work? And those cute little cars slide around like Matchbox toys?Whatever. If you like it you like it. Which is to say, there is a British sensibility here which rubs me wrong. Monty Python I get, the Prisoner I get, Peter Sellers I get (to pick some 1960s British icons). The Beatles I get. It guess there are people, bless their impoverished little souls, who hate American film noir, so there you have it.The cliff-hanger at the end is a perfect summation. There they are, in this comic/ridiculous suspension literally on the edge of a Swiss cliff, and the gold is about to slide into the gorge, and do we really care? Nope. And if we don't care, why are we watching? For the fun of it, the laughs, the jolly good quips that appear, spaced out between sections of filler? Not for me. It's just not comic enough or dramatic enough or surprising enough. It's just not enough, period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ITALIAN JOB is a jolly entertaining movie. With Michael Caine in the leading role as Charlie Croker, a elegant, charming and professional thief that's just been released from prison and is on a big heat. The heat shall take place in Italy in the city of Torino, together with a bunch of other low-time bandits they settle up for a very good heat where it's all about gold coming in to Torino. Three Morris Mini's in red, white and blue is the getaway cars...The movie is very English and very fun all the way, and it can sort of remind of James Bond moods although this is more of a comedy, but on the other hand the movie isn't very funny either. Terrifying filmmaking with the big Italian woman who gets p***ed with fast-motion making her voice sound much more irritating.. The movie offers a lot of entertainment and is easy entertainment! But, the end is something of stupidity. The happy crew of bandits driving in a huge buss suddenly gets to excited and happy over the successed heist that the bussdriver takes a bad turn and the buss is suddenly hanging off a cliff! The bandits standing in the buss, and on the other side the gold are laying, and so Caine starts moving carefully towards the gold, and starts crouching, why? It really doesn't make his weight any easier!Well, anyhow, the movie has got a very fine and very well-known classical car-chase with these three Mini's driving, a very funny scene. The movie has got a lots of splendid entertainment, but as a film, it's a bit low. STARS: 3/5</fullReview>

I think this is the most over-rated film I have ever seen. With one or two exceptions, Raf Vallone and Michael Caine (though far from his best) the acting was disgraceful. The dialogue was laughable and not very funny. Difficult to believe that Troy Kennedy Martin was seriously trying to be funny! Those silly scenes with the doll-like girls who were probably considered the height of sexiness in the 1960's and the whole business of Noel Coward's 'Mr. Big' was ludicrous to the extreme. It was a truly awful film with a waste of not much talent and a whole gaggle of supporting actors who were incapable of rising above the rubbishy lines they were given. I laughed not once, I winced continually. Altogether a pretty poor show! I know that you should not take these plots seriously but this was impossible to even accept as a joke.

One of the stupidest plots ever, with ridiculous situations that made no sense (ie, with all their intricate planning, why was it so hard for them to get away from the police?). Michael Caine was totally wasted- it seemed like the director just said "Act angry the whole time". Plot lines went nowhere- the girlfriend just disappeared halfway through the movie, never to be seen again. What kind of movie were they trying to make? Comedy? Crime drama? Wacky farce? They couldn't seem to decide- there was lighthearted, goofy music at times, other times it was quite violent (ie, the clubbing of the guards). Massive quantities of illogic and/or breaking the laws of physics that were impossible to ignore (ie, the whole bus scene at the end). Even the enjoyment of watching cute little Mini Coopers couldn't make up for all the garbage that this movie contained. Watch the newer one instead- it's vastly better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic British comedy of errors which has, if anything, become even cooler over the years than when it was first released, what with its swinging sixties setting and definitive performance from Michael Caine, which is both deadpan and at the same time hilarious. Indeed, this is the film that gave us one of his classic quotes ("You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!") and for the most part its Caine's film - without him, I don't believe it would work half as well. Made back in a time when the perfect popcorn film was lively, entertaining, well-acted, and immaculately made (like the early Bond films with Sean Connery) instead of the modern vacuous special effects outings we see in cinemas, this is a breath of fresh air and a film impossible to dislike.The comedy comes from the misfortune our unusual leading characters find themselves in, as they attempt to carry out an elaborate robbery and find something going wrong at every turn. Despite this, they still manage to triumph through perseverance and plain luck, which makes their characters admirable despite being thieves. Our classic anti-heroes are made to look good through the intervention of the real bad guys of the film, i.e. the Italian Mafia, who think nothing of murder and destruction to keep the gold in their country. The film perfectly blends thrills with comedy and I was surprised how well it was shot and photographed all the way through; director Peter Collinson deserves recommendation.The finale, which involves literally hundreds of motor vehicles involved in city-wide traffic jams and some classic chases involving three minis (red, white and blue, naturally) and the Italian police, is riveting stuff. The film also boasts the talents of noted British comedians Benny Hill, Irene Handl, and John Le Mesurier, all of whom have rather small roles, as well as Noel Coward in a scene-stealing part late in his career as Mr. Bridger, the big-time gangster who could wipe the floor with any of the would-be hard men of LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS. The actual robbery itself is tense, suspenseful and imaginatively staged. THE Italian JOB is a patriotic pleasure from a more innocent age long since gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic classic British Movie from back in the 60s, I have watched it countless times, so much so I know many of the lines. The cars are great but there is one scene that will make any car guy cry. The story is great the cast fantastic a far better film than the re-make with a better story too and the ending is awesome. I often think it would be great to remake this story true to the original maybe with alternate endings that could be chosen by the viewer would be good. Caine plays a great part as only he could and you can't help but like the guy as do the ladies in the movie. Watch it if you love fun movies, cars, British classics or Caine, you will not be sad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-Preservation indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More impressive the second and third time round, 'The Italian Job' is a film best watched with as few expectations as possible. Its status as one of the greatest crime capers of all time leaves a little to be desired with formulaic characters and none of the buddy-buddy dynamics of 'Ocean's Eleven' and films of its ilk. The fact that we never get to know the characters beyond their basic plot function is less problematic though when one views the film on its own terms. The movie doesn't exactly have a lot to say (other than 'us' against 'them' stuff), but it offers an interesting portrait of the role of automobiles in society, right down to the traffic jam itself, where vehicles that are meant to help one to get around actually prevent folks from getting around. It's a surprisingly funny film too; "this is my toilet!" Coward exclaims after a surprising rendezvous with Caine, and large fluffy toys that will not stop squeaking provide a comical overtone to Caine's fight with his girlfriend. The first hour, which drags on occasional, has nothing on the briskly paced final half-hour which is indeed good enough on its own to make the entire film worth watching. The aerial photography of the three minis driving about like intelligent mice running through a maze is great, and the film's 'Self Preservation' theme song is a delight, perfectly capturing the euphoria of the British criminals. The memorable ending is pitch perfect too and works well even when one knows that it is coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Memorable for its car chase scenes, but otherwise quite poor.A recently-released criminal, Charlie Croker (played by Michael Caine), devises a plan to rob Fiat of a large amount of gold in the city of Turin. He gains the backing of a British crime kingpin, Mr Bridger (played by Noel Coward) and assembles his team. Once in Italy he discovers he now has to contend with the Mafia in order to carry out his plan...Not sure why this is so highly regarded. Yes, the car chase scenes, involving blue, white and red Mini Coopers, are iconic, but that's it. The script is mostly quite silly. Hardly anything is plausible or makes sense and sub-plots are plain random. Far more style than substance, and the style isn't that classy. Michael Caine puts in a solid performance in the lead role. Noel Coward's character provides much of the implausibility. Benny Hill has a supporting role as weird, creepy, fetish-loving, tech professor - an ideal role for him.I enjoyed the 2003 remake far more - action was as good and the script was much more solid. One of the few times I've enjoyed a remake of a movie more than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Fun with a Talented Cast,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's a simple film, the story is very basic and easy to follow, the main thing that makes it watchable is the comedy, the great back and fourth between the cast and the chemistry which is a very important part of any movie, even when you're not necessarily laughing out loud there is always a humorous atmosphere in the film which I really liked. The ending of the film annoys me, I know this is probably a controversial statement as it is quite liked by many moviegoers, but I really didn't like it, it's very anti-climatic, after giving us so much build up, we are taken to the place we were waiting for the characters to go and once we see them in the most danger they've ever been in, the movie ends, we have no idea what comes of the main characters or the gold, and this left me unsatisfied. It is a very funny movie and the comedic dialogue works out very well, but I felt like they could have had more dramatic parts, it was the type of story that required it, and with Michael Caine in the lead role it seemed like an easy thing to do, but the movie never wants to take itself any bit seriously. It definitely has several imperfections, but the Italian Job is worth the watch if you ever see it on television and are looking for a good comedy. A group of men plot to create a traffic jam in order to rob a shipment of gold. Best Performance: Michael Caine</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Italian Job (1969): Dir: Peter Collinson / Cast: Michael Caine, Noel Coward, Maggie Blye, Benny Hill, Raf Vallone: Amusing comic caper about operations. In this case Noel Coward will divert the authorities from inside a prison by causing a massive traffic jam. Michael Caine assembles a team and they will use the traffic jam as a means of stealing $4, 000, 000 in gold. Filled with funny sight jokes mostly involving car chases but the plot is detailed and the ending gives new meaning to the word cliffhanger. Directed by Peter Collinson who tries to detail the operation while capitalizing on humour. The cast is headed by a fantastic performance by Caine as the confident front man who organizes the scheme because he is the best qualified, and his last comment just before the credits roll indicate that his mind is still in motion even despite terrible odds. Coward also holds strong as a confident figure from the confines of prison. Unfortunately supporting roles play too much like a standard roll call that plays much like the structure Ocean's Eleven, and this rarely works out unless detail is given to characters. Maggie Blye plays Caine's underwritten girlfriend, and Benny Hill plays a computer genius who has a thing for overweight women. Raf Vallone plays a mafia boss who is also entangled in the plot. Well crafted film with beautiful locations and an operation that doesn't go as planned. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Each time I watch "The Italian Job", I become increasingly aware of the film's defects. Almost all of the characters are forgettable and sometimes unnecessary. Can anyone tell me why a shrill American girlfriend was required in swinging 60's London? Benny Hill's character seems obvious, forced and just not fun or funny. Even Noel Coward's role lends little to the film. The film also takes way too long to get to the heist. The Mafia intervention conceit is never really integrated into the heist section. And there is some very dodgy camera work even by the standard of the day.So why do I watch the film? Michael Caine, Michael Caine, Michael Caine. He holds the whole film together. Well, him, the cars and the music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Caine headlines this light crime thriller with its underplayed comedy. The movie contains one of the most extended chase scenes with a variety of action stunts as part of a rather convoluted crime caper. While the main story backbone remains intact, a number of the subplots seem to get short shrift and underdeveloped: the involvement of the Mafia, Caine's relational encounters, and the ended seems intriguing, but unsatisfying.The car chase was amazing and yet distracting as the persistent Italian police seem to some how pop up in an unbelievable way that only highlighted how manipulative without thought this sequence was. The movie has a Blue Brothers (1980) feel to it while it doesn't quite have the amazing lighter of say It's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) slapstick fun factor nor the nicely concluded The Great Escape ending (1963).Overall, the original Italian Job was interesting, appealing, but nevertheless, less than stellar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE Italian JOB is a well-made and entertaining caper film with great performances by Michael Caine and Noel Coward. Although there isn't a whole lot of pyrotechnics like the remake, this film makes up for that by being a lot of fun, and quite funny at times. Sure, there's a lack of character development for most of the members of the team, but most of them have a little moment or two here and there. Arguably, the best part of the movie outside of the performances and humor is the climactic Mini Cooper chase through the streets of Turin, followed by a (SPOILER!) literal cliffhanger of an ending, which I think works better than the happy ending in the remake. Each one has their strengths, but I think the original edges the remake out by a small margin. Bottom line: it's a really fun film to pass two hours with.</fullReview>

This slickly made thriller has a lot going on and it's all good. The escape via mini-Coopers is spectacular. Caine is great, though his character is a bit grating, and the supporting cast including Noël Coward and Benny Hill is something to see. Coward is hilarious as a dapper crime lord, in prison but still pulling a lot of strings. Hill steals his scenes as a computer expert/masher who likes "large women."

Britishness humor lifted from Bond movies...in this case the M is an underworld king pin in jail in Britain. You have Michael Caine fresh out of Alfie....doing a bit of tale chasing and leading the pack of cons. The car chases have a couple of fun episodes when they race onto a concrete roof and disappear for a minute.Does it lag or is it too stupid a bit....but the sequel is worse by far... taken in context of 1969 it is decent; not the gem people talk about that is for sure but a good solid 7. The mafia stuff was the stupidest part although I suppose it added tension and the ending is unique.RECOMMEND</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Heist Movie that is Short on Characterization, Long on Car-Chases</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE Italian JOB is one of those movies that can stand repeated viewings. Its principal virtue is that it doesn't take itself at all seriously: we know that Charlie (Michael Caine) and his gang will probably not get away with the money, but it's worthwhile watching the way in which he completes the heist and then tries to get away through the streets of Turin and subsequently through the mountains. As the Mr. Big behind the whole operation, Noel Coward plays himself; by the late Sixties, he had acquired quasi-cult status, reveling in his reputation. This is precisely the kind of character he plays in the film. In historical terms, Peter Collinson's film is an advertisement for the Swinging Sixties, with Britain at the center of new movements in fashion and/or coolness. The iconic Minis - used by the gang to complete their escape - are frequently shown in close-up escaping from the more cumbersome Italian police vehicles. On the soundtrack, the famous theme celebrating "The Self Preservation Society" attests to the virtues of capitalism and individual effort. Anyone can achieve their dreams if they are prepared to work for them. At just over ninety minutes in length, THE Italian JOB has a helter-skelter plot that can be enjoyed for what it's worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Italian Job (1969)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question of why did they not make a sequel, keeps on coming up as discussions on talk radio stations up and down the land (UK). The 2003 version was meant to be for the American market, and in my opinion is not as good as the 1969 version, probably because parts of the 2003 movie were "copied" from the 1969 version, such as the Minis being chased by Italian police cars supplied by Fiat. My opinion is that they should have gone ahead and made a sequel to the 1969 movie, but producer Michael Deeley was unsatisfied with the four endings written and conceived the current ending as a (literal) cliffhanger appropriate to an action film which left an opportunity for a sequel. One concepts of a sequel to the 1969 movie, would have shown how helicopters would have saved the bus seen on the cliff at the end of the first film. The grateful gang would soon discover that it is the Mafia that has saved them, and the sequel would have been about stealing the gold bullion back from them.In interviews in 2003 and 2008, Michael Caine revealed that the ending would have had Croker "crawl up, switch on the engine and stay there for four hours until all the diesel runs out... The (dormobile) van bounces back up so we can all get out, but then the gold goes over."The bus containing the gold would crash at the bottom of the hill where the Mafia would pick it up. The sequel would then have Croker and his men trying to get it back.The coach used in the 1969 movie was used on a school run in Scotland until the mid-1980s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK for the tiny minority who haven't seen this classic, it's a story about a group of London thieves who outwit the Mafia and steal ? 4 million in gold in Turin.Right that's the spoiler over with. What we have is a comedy drama masterpiece from Michael Caine at the peak of his career, two years later he would go one better with Get Carter. Also essential to the film are Noel Coward as the camp gangster, Mr Bridger( all the world is bent, Freddie), who masterminds the robbery from his prison cell, and Benny Hill, also at the height of his career in 1969, as the eccentric Professor Peach, with a liking for women with big bottoms, who causes all the traffic lights to stop working in Turin when the robbery is carried out.While there isn't a single bad moment in The Italian Job, particular stand out moments for me are the chase in Turin with the Mini Coopers, the appearing and disappearing Mafiosi on the banks of a mountain and the brilliant ending with the coach full of gold teetering on the edge of a mountain and Michael Caine's classic line, " I've got a great idea". Also the theme tune, " The Self Preservation Society", is a classic and is a familiar anthem at England football matches( actually an international in Turin is used as a sub plot).One note of caution, avoid the 2003 remake, as like the remake of Get Carter it's an insult to the original.</fullReview>

The escape part of the movie is enjoyable hence should have taken up a larger bulk of the movie. Over half the film is the preparations for the theft, and I found some of it to be dull. Caine trying to keep his somewhat unruly gang under control while barking orders was meant to be funny, but it wasn't. The actors cast for his gang are simply uninteresting. Still, the finale is fun, plus the movie was shot in Italy and 1969, both of which give the film a pleasant look.</fullReview>

All of this stuff combined helps to make this a fun movie to watch, that of course also gets made entertaining by its concept and characters.It has a pretty standard story but the movie still manages to come up with plenty of originality. It actually provides the movie with some very memorable moments as well, of which the scene with the mini-coopers is the most memorable- and best known one of course.The movie still feels a bit underwritten in parts and skips over certain aspects too easily. Seems that the movie preferred a solid and fast pace over a tight script but then again, the movie is more about its moments anyway and not really about telling a good and solid story, from start till finish.Some of the characters also remain a bit underdeveloped, while they definitely had the potential to become some good and fun characters for the movie. This for instance also and especially goes for the Benny Hill character. But then again, when you have Michael Caine as a main lead, you don't really need any other actors to shine.An aspect I also really liked about the movie was its music. It uses an all British score, which really adds to the overall style and tone of this movie and also helps to make this a fun one.These type of old fashioned caper movies always have a great sense of adventure and fun to it. it are simply movies made for entertainment and in that regard this movie also does not fail or disappoint.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>caper film from the '60s is a cut above most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine stars in "The Italian Job," a 1969 film directed by Peter Collinson. This film was remade a few years ago, and I don't think it was nearly as good.In the '60s, period films were all the rage, as were spy flicks and caper films. In the Italian Job, at the behest of Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward) who is living the life of Riley in prison, Charlie Croker (Caine) works out a plan to steal gold bouillon from an armored truck. He runs into interference from the mafia, who is trying to stop him and his team from carrying out their plan. They also go through more than a few cars while testing different explosive devices etc.What Croker comes up with is an ingenious plan that paralyzes the area the truck is in and is the cause of some dandy car chases across Italy.This is very entertaining and a lot of fun, though it does seem to put down the Italians and elevate the British at their expense. I prefer to think this wasn't the intention of the script - rather the intention was to show the brilliance of the plan and the comedy of seeing it played out.Of course, the scenery is beautiful, and the film is packed with action and a lot of excitement.Caine is excellent, as is Coward, and the actors receive able support from the large cast. And the ending is a real cliffhanger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The development and undertaking of a plan to steal $4 million in gold from an armored car in the center of Turin by manipulating a traffic jam, The Italian Job is one of the most devil-may-care of any entertainment I've seen done with such style and production values. Michael Caine plays Charlie Croker, the dapper thief who carries out the plan and prolific renaissance man Noël Coward is an incredibly good sport here, bringing all his composed and assured sense of irony and humor to his role as John Bridger, the nationalistic, businesslike syndicate chief who shepherds the plan from a London prison. What the original Italian Job is is a 1960s male swinger who is very pleased with himself. I should also say a British one: At the heart of the eponymous plot is a feeling among the expansive Cockney team who carries it out that they as Englishmen are superior to the Italian people, who are predominantly comprised of bullying mobsters and cops who couldn't catch a cold. It aspires to exposition in reference to Caine's seemingly implausible sexual promiscuity, shown sidelong in his physical fatigue after myriad off-screen encounters with roomfuls of women at a time.Set in London and Turin and shot with vivid colors in anamorphic format, the film is most significantly a memorial distillation of the youth-oriented fashion and hedonistic, optimistic cultural phenomenon that flourished in the 1960s---after all, Benny Hill is in it playing a guy with a fetish for fat women---although its utopian vision of London's criminal underworld is in marked divergence from even a Hollywood depiction. Less than two years later, Caine took the lead role in Get Carter, which portrays the same underworld with a remorselessly straight face, possibly to exact the exceedingly sentimental portrayal of organized crime painting the town red in this capricious wet dream. Actually, the blithe and amusing interpretation includes some of the more charming elements here: Mr. Bridger's gang is run by an effeminate-seeming fop called Camp Freddie, who heads an office in a professional building with a long meeting table, people answering phones, as if it were a brokerage firm or a trade organization. Bridger is treated like royalty in prison to the extent that he is provided with his own bathroom, escorted there in his silk robe by guards who do everything to accommodate him with a fresh newspaper, holding the door, waiting while he takes his time, chamber music playing over the soundtrack. These are high points, although these characters, Camp Freddie, Frank, Big William, are all mere stick figures.Even discounting the pipe dream sense of time and place and the stick-figure characterizations, the film is certainly notable for its fertile and impressive car chases and stunts. Indeed, the film's cars are more prominent characters than the people, like the doomed Lamborghini Miura in the opening sequence, assorted Aston Martin convertibles, Jaguars, Land Rovers and a cluster of police cars which are not as slick or responsive as the chivalrous MINI Coopers. The Alpine setting through which some of the chases pass is another celebrated feature of the film. I enjoy the Quincy Jones-scored getaway sequence for the sheer spectacle of it, but what I'm more interested in is the heist itself, of which the film chronicles the stylish preparation. The plan is ingenious. The scene itself has a scrappy straightforwardness to it, but it goes so fast, hurrying to cut to the chase.The film on the whole doesn't amount to much. I've seen it various times because I got a kick out of caper films in high school. I saw what I wanted to see, a brilliant scheme, pulled off with enviable audacity and cool. But now I can't help but see it as a movie rather than a daydream. It's a badly paced, male fantasy commercial with some witty enough humor occasionally and a climactic set piece not extensive or absorbing enough to compensate for the snail's measure leading towards it, and ends on what is finally a truly suspenseful, bafflingly unpredictable, "literal cliffhanger" only to crane up and roll credits before anything can be done to resolve the pickle. I know it was done for the sake of a sequel they were too flaky to get off the ground, but I think it can be read as a bunch of hollow people who take the path of least resistance to make a huge score, thanks to a plan that was already mapped out and passed onto them, and when they finally get into a jam where they have to pull scientific reasoning and instinctive knowledge out of their hats, we might as well leave it at that because they probably won't.</fullReview>

So I figured that I would give this Italian Job a look, even though I wasn't as blown away as I was with the remake, I sill had fun watching this classic. It had incredible car chase scenes and that was what really won me over, they were just so well choreographed and kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Charlie has just been released from prison and one of his friends has just died trying to complete a job, to get 4 million dollars that is being transfered to China. Charlie decides to take the job with some help of his friends and also with the help of the mini coopers that will come to good use when they cause the biggest traffic jam in Italian history and wither they make it or not in succeeding in this job, well, you're just going to have to watch the movie.While again, I wasn't too thrilled with the ending, it was good, but it just ended weirdly, this was still a fun movie that I think honestly anyone could enjoy. I would highly recommend it, but I think I will choose the remake if I was going to watch The Italian Job. But go ahead and give this movie a shot, because you'll never know when you'll find your own little treasure.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit plodding for its opening hour, but the final 40 minutes are absolutely terrific.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job is another of the '60s films that established Michael Caine as a British superstar (see also Zulu, The Ipcress File, Alfie and Gambit). It is also a reasonably enjoyable caper movie which has become fondly remembered for its remarkable climactic chase sequence. For the final half an hour, we watch a thrilling, ingenious and meticulous getaway as three Minis - one red, one white and one blue - negotiate an audacious route out of the gridlocked streets of Turin. It is such a classic sequence that, for anyone and everyone who has ever seen the film, it is the first thing they recall when thinking about it. But what many people seem to forget is that for the opening hour or so, The Italian Job is actually a rather plodding, workmanlike movie.... it is only as it enters its second half that it really clicks into a higher gear.Recently released small-time crook Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) inherits the plans for a daring gold bullion heist in Turin from his dead pal Beckerman (Rosanno Brazzi). Charlie seeks approval for the plan from master-criminal Mr Bridger (the fabulous Noel Coward), who masterminds the whole thing from his London prison cell. The scheme involves sabotaging the traffic system in Turin, thus causing a massive traffic jam. Then, with the city in a state of gridlock, Croker and his cronies plan an ingenious escape route for themselves and their gold-laden Minis.The film is helped by Quincy Jones's terrific score, and Caine and Coward's excellent playing of their respective roles. Also enjoyable is Benny Hill's brief but very funny role as Professor Peach, a computer genius with a penchant for large ladies. Peter Collinson directs the film with a surprisingly light touch (his body of work usually consists of violent exploitation entries). The film's famous ending, in which the successful gold thieves find themselves in a coach see-sawing perilously on a mountain side, is a stroke of ingenuity. The film refuses to glamorise the bullion theft by letting them get away with it, yet doesn't dampen the viewer's spirits by showing the capture of the likable thieves. Like I've said, you will have to show tolerance to get through the film's lethargic opening stretch, but if you make it to the halfway mark you're in for a spirited (and very British) treat from that point forth!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good 60s Comic Heist Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE Italian JOB (3 outta 5 stars) Okay, this is the original British version with Michael Caine, not the recent remake (which I have not yet seen at this time). I figured I owed it to the UK to see the original first since the Hollywood remakes of their best films (Get Carter, The Ladykillers) usually turn out so lame (though the US version of this one does look promising). Anyway, as far as "caper movies" go... this one is not necessarily one of the best. The actual heist is not much more than a glorified "smash and grab". The main point of interest is the getaway afterward... after creating a huge traffic jam which ties up the police, the thieves take off with their haul in a trio of modified Mini Coopers. Caine performance is adequate but he has played the same sort of role dozens of times and there is nothing much new here... he's the charming, rogue anti-hero who masterminds the big job. The movie has its moments, though and the final chase scene is fun to watch. The ending is quite odd... I thought it was extremely cool... but I'm sure it will tick some people off. ("What? That's it? What happens next?") But movies took these kinds of chances with endings in the 60s... I very much doubt that the remake ends the same way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the title, a very british film. Warning: no american under the age of 35 should attempt to watch this film. Sorry, you just will not be able to understand it, the world of Charlie Croker is not for you. (Witness previous comparisons with Austin Powers??**!! Okay, they are both brits, so was Jack the Ripper. You might as well compare Bullitt with the Police Academy series)."Just think, Charlie - 4 million dollars, for a traffic jam!" And so the definitive heist movie begins - fasten your seat belt and hold on for the ride. The deal is to cause the world's biggest traffic jam and steal the FIAT company bankroll from the centre of Turin.One of the measures of greatness in films is how often they are imitated. If you see this for the first time you will notice many scenes which you think you have seen before, just remember that this film did them first. However, the driving/chase scenes remain unsurpassed. It all leads to a cliff-hanging ending which actually works with the spirit of the film well.Only two brief caveats: there is an embarrassing scene where Charlie is given a host of girls as a getting-out-of-jail present; this scene doesn't work, but is soon over. Second, the closing song is an anthem to Thatcher/Reganism. Thirty years before it's time, like much else here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Golden Age of caper and heist movies was the late sixties. Topkapi, The Thomas Crown Affair, How to Steal A Million, they all help define one of the most fun genres in filmdom. The Italian Job is a little-known caper from this same era, starring Michael Caine as the debonair thief. In addition to Caine's involved, clever and sinuous scheme to steal hundreds of gold bars, The Italian Job has some amazing car stunts. Three tiny little cars drive over, through, and across the buildings of Rome. The Italian Job is not a perfect caper -- there are some too-convenient coincidences and the ending doesn't quite fit -- but it is very good and it's lots of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film itself is unique, a GOOD British one!!So where do I begin? where they do in the film, Charlie Croker has just come out of prison and is told of a magnificent chance to nab $4 million (?3 million) from the Italian authorities and the Mafia-queue superb one liners, excellent stunts and an all out brilliant film. I LOVE this film as it is somewhat of a gangster film (I also like Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, check 'em out!) but is not too violent and includes a lot of humour. A basically all-star cast, the parts seemingly written for Noel Coward, Michael Caine and Benny Hill, never ceases to amaze me as to how they (the producers) got all of them. Anyway, I digress, "the getaway" (if you have seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about) only ever sets my wow factor above unbelievable and the ending is just too classic....

		<fullReview>What a smash. A whopper even. Fantasticly enjoyable, endlessly quotable and terrifyingly realistic. It's the attention to the little details of this marvelous screenplay that make the movie shine. A film that really can be viewed again and again. Caine's charismatic criminal protagonist, Coward's compelling performance as the magnanimous crime magnate and Hill's hilarious rendition of a computer nerd with a fat fetish compliment each other brilliantly with stunning, near shocking effect. Capturing themes and passions that transcend generations, this film had easily stood the test of time, fending off many challengers for it's elusive title of "funniest British film set in Italy". The dialogue is still razor sharp, the comedy remains ingenious, and the car chases have perhaps only been bettered by "The Blues Brothers".Some viewers did not find this film to their liking the first time, but I can assure you that if you give it some space and take it with an open mind, then it will prove to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.Thank you Martin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen The Italian Job a lot of times and it is one of those movies you can watch over again without tiring of it.Charlie Croker is released from prison and plans to do a large robbery involving gold in Turin in Italy. He has the help from Mr Bridger, who is still in prison. Charlie plans to cause a huge traffic jam in Turin to undertake the robbery. After doing the robbery,we see the famous chase with the Mini Coopers through Turin, which are then put on the coach, the gold unloaded from them and the Minis are disposed of down the mountain side, some of them blowing up in the process. Charlie and the gang then celebrate their success until they are hanging on a cliff...Now to the vehicles in this movie, most of which are wrecked: 2 Jaguars and an Aston Martin are destroyed by Mafia, then you have the 3 Mini Coopers, a Land Rover, a minibus (which Charlie calls a "Doormobile") and the coach, which is a twin front axle Bedford VAL. Not forgetting the van that is destroyed when Charlie says one of the movie's most famous quotes: You're only supposed to blow the bl**** doors off"! Now to the most excellent cast: a brilliant Michael Caine as Charlie, Noel Coward (his last movie) as Mr Bridger, Benny Hill, Dad's Army's John Le Mesurier, Raf Vallone and Maggie Blye.The Italian Job is great fun to watch and is certainly a must see.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic British Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly after being released from prison, conman Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) learns that his partner in a job they were going to pull off has been killed. In order to exact his revenge, Charlie decides that with the help of some colleagues and an elderly prison inmate, Mr Bridger (Noël Coward) he's going to pull off the heist and secure that he and his accomplices find themselves $4 million richer.As The Italian Job opens, we see a beautiful red car glide in and out of the country lanes, elegantly. The grass is green, the sky is blue and Matt Monro is singing on the radio. As the red car enters a dark tunnel everything disappears when suddenly a screeching of the tires is heard and an explosion is seen. In the grimmest scene in the movie, we see the shambled wreckage of the car pushed down a hill and a man in black throws a funeral reef down after it.In strict contrast to this, however, we are introduced to Charlie Croker, happy go lucky inmate being let out of prison. He's a bundle of smiles as he leave, saying goodbye to everyone and generally, just being a happy chappy. Within moments of leaving however, he's quick to realise that he is in a stolen car. This is when you learn most about Charlie. He may be happy, but he's clever.The Italian Job is a unique film because really, it has no depth. It's pretty much the simplest example of sit back and enjoy as there is. Croker is the only character explored at all really, and all we learn is that, despite the quick, clever, British wit is that he's a clever boy who loves his girl. Not that the last part matters at all. You could easily take away Charlie's girlfriend and the plot would be completely unaffected. But that's the beauty of The Italian Job. Rather than follow the old method which is everything happens to get you to the end of the film, there are many things that are thrown in just for fun. Whether it be the scenes with Charlie's girlfriend, or about 90% of the 30 minute job and escape which makes up the final third of the film. Most of the pointless scenes have inspired many remarkable quotes such as:"You wouldn't hit a fella with no trousers on, would ya?""You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!" And of course, the now famous "Self Preservation Society" OK, so the last one was a song, but if you think I'm getting through this review without mentioning that song (Getta Bloomin' Move On) you're wrong.The film, throughout is quite laid back and mellow. Hell, even during the climactic final chase scene, one of the characters actually in the mini is eating. The one thing that I think lets the film down is that the very first scene shows a darkness which isn't exploited throughout the rest of the film. But then again, if I had my way, it'd probably be a completely different film and not one that I'd quote at every available opportunity.Generally, I feel that The Italian Job is an example of Michael Caine standing out in a fun film. And don't get me started on the 16 minute mini chase. Quite simply, what I feel is the greatest example of Car chase choreography in the history of motion pictures.In the end, you'll either love the British wit or you won't. But worth a try if you like cars, Michael Caine or cliff-hangers?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, is better than the new version, according to many people that I have spoken to, I like the famous quote " You are only supposed to Blow the bloody doors off!!!!" says Crocker, of course they forget about the Mafia man who spoils 3 lovely fast cars. I also like Benny Hill's Professor Peach, he however does not know how, to fix the computers, I think that I would of been a better consultant regarding the technical side of things as Mr Bridger put it. I also think that the bus driver should of concentrated on his driving rather than laugh long and loud!! no wonder they crashed. Charlie Croker was a good organiser of the whole job! I also was surprised by john Le messier's role as governor, I think he should of had a bigger part in this well made film. I have this on a DVD, I really enjoy this 1969 version. Finally the 3 mini's are great little cars. The new version is also good! But this 1969 version is an all time classic!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but not a great one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a few quick words on the original 1969 version of 'The Italian Job'! It's better than the 2003 remake- but only slightly! There are some very good moments in this film, particularly the mini coopers, the use of vehicles falling down very large cliff edges in the European mountain-side, and I gotta say, I just loved the ending! However, the film's cult status is probably more because of the final chase sequence involving the minis rather than for great acting, great storytelling or in-depth characters. We hardly got to know Charlie Crocker, the charming rogue thief, who has a passion for money and women- played by Michael Caine, or the big man in Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward) whose character intrigued me! Charlie was running the big heist while Bridger was funding it. However, all the supporting players who are assisting Charlie were just simply a bunch of faces, and the viewer barely gets to know them. Similarly, there is no suspense as we never get to see the intricate details of the planned heist until it unfolds. There is also no real antagonist in this movie, unless you count the mafia- who really don't get thwarted at all or feel like the antagonist. The remake managed to sell a better antagonist, as well as motive for the crime and as well supporting characters, but the remake seemed too formulaic and was let down by the acting and script. In the original, I'm glad there is no contrived motive for Charlie's gang to do this job other than greed I guess. Again, we never really see what is Charlie's driving force (which is related to character depth), and that aspect could have been better established. Regardless, 'The Italian Job' works as heist movie, and has a great ending. It might have been funnier back in 1969, but it's okay as entertainment and it's a better heist film than some recent ones such 'Heist' and 'The Score'! Quite liked the cinematography, and Michael Caine and Noel Howard do quite well. A good movie with a great chase sequence and ending, yet only slightly better than the remake- and not a particularly brilliant film. Like I said, a good movie!***? out of *****!</fullReview>

The plot is pushed into the background in favour of continuous action and a few star names. I'm not aware of many films before this that adopted the principle, but if we look at most of todays blockbusters they virtually all follow suit.For what it's worth the plot sees Mr Bridger(Coward) masterminding a plot to steal gold from the Italians. He hires Charlie Croker (Caine) to lead the heist and mayhem ensues. Unlike some of it's modern day counterparts there's still a few clever twists in this and the ending is a cliffhanger. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without question the greatest film ever made . The dialogue is brilliant, see the scene where they talk to Mrs Peach. The jokes, the clothes and the cars all add to the zest of a very 60s, very British film. You can, and I do, watch this film again and again without tiring of it. You must, because it is a thing of beauty, perfectly pitched between, Action and Comedy. Seamlessly scripted, brilliantly acted, wonderfully cast and with a great soundtrack. Oh and the directing is also great. But to describe it like that is to dismantle and analyse it, It is far beyond the sum of all these things, which come together to create an atmosphere, a feeling and a spirit that can never be re-created, no matter how many times Hollywood tries.This film is fantasy, indulgence, patriotism and entertainment, they don't make them like they used to. They really did create a traffic jam in the piazza in Turin, and all the stunts are real. I recommend the latest version of the video which has a documentary about the making of the car chase on the end and is available as part of the Michael Caine Box set, with Alfie and Zulu. My all time favourite film, many quotes have found there way into my language and I'm not even cockney. &gt;</fullReview>

It's about the assembling of the team, the planning of the operation and the execution of the heist.It's stylishly shot with a nod at the beginning to Italian cinema before settling into classic Sixties British mode which somehow evokes the genuine sense we had then of British gangsters - you expect the Kray twins to emerge at some point.

		<fullReview>Fantastic script, fantastic cast and fantastic cameos - this is more than a film, it's an institution. But there are black clouds on the horizon! I'm so worried about the 2003 remake - Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker? You must be joking! And how can you set the Italian Job in LA? Give it up now and don't waste the money! Some things just can't be bettered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Moving, Boring, and Terrible Ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most seem to love this movie, so maybe it's my age or something else but I hated it. The story was not well told at all, I had to force myself to stay awake just to make it to the ending. To summarize, Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) wants to rip off a security truck carrying 4 mill. in gold bouillon. There were so many characters that were involved in the heist, but we didn't really get to see what they did. We were just expected to take for granted that these people were the best at there jobs and not actually shown it.Benny Hill made a guest appearance, as the computer genius, but at the beginning of the heist he manages to get himself arrested and we don't see him for the rest of the movie. Charlie Croker goes through a lot of trouble to get this guy on the team, and his disappearance isn't even noticed when it happens. That didn't sit well with me at all. It seems Benny Hill was only added for his name, and to add some comedy; but failed miserably to do so.The ending. Oh dear the ending. I get that they were trying to be brilliant with the whole anticlimax thing (Did they succeed or not? We're not going to tell you because that wouldn't be artistic) Personally I think that's just pretentious garbage that even if the rest of the movie was done well I would still hate it. Any movie in this genre needs an ending or else it makes the viewer, at least this viewer, feel as though they just wasted two hours of their life.I normally love movies of this kind, especially those made in the sixties and seventies. And I looovvveee Michael Caine's work. But this one should be left alone. It was terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trip back to the swinging sixties : postcard OK but very feeble caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian Job has all the good humor and buoyancy of the British TV shows of the sixties. Think the Avengers for instance. Except a TV show can play with nonsense and poor action scenes as a trademark, while in a 90-minutes bona fide caper movie it's bound to be a failure.Now you can watch the movie only enjoying the swinging sixties spirit it exhales. In that respect you'll not be disappointed. On the other hand if you're looking for suspense, tempo, a sense of rhythm, nice characterizations... you'll be thoroughly distressed as the movie has nothing interesting in it, save the trip back 40 years.In depth: the movie drags its feet to set up the action, editing in an almost random order scenes where the humor becomes increasingly tired as you get used to it. To put it in a nutshell: cartoon characters with a tilt at spoofing 007 nonchalance make their way in a world where everything is funny and simple. OK that's not a bad thing, but the comedy is fast wooden while the action suffers from it. How can you have a proper caper movie if everything is just fun and no hassle, and eventually not so important? Suspense is never even sidelined, it simply doesn't exist. The story only cashes in on the characters' good time to make things go forward. In the end a very poor movie if you're not a sucker for sixties nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great British Classic - devoid of anything American!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review was written after Hollywood tried to do a remake, they remade it alright and it flopped. I am not going to blather on about the quality of acting, locations, story lines. I just wanted to counter a misconception that the film was slow in places, that some of the actors weren't as good as expected and finally that the Cockney accents grate on even the UK audience.The film start's off slowly because it is building up to the plot. The actors have Cockney accents because, the criminal gang was based in the East End of London. Wouldn't it have seemed odd if they had Welsh accents!?! And no, the Cockney accents don't grate.The Italian Job is a great film and one that can be watched over and over with no loss of enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the ultimates in the action/comedy genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Croker, after only a short time outside of prison, takes over the plans to enact a risky gold heist. Risky, because it must be done during the day, in the city, and right in front of the police and the Mob. Added to that, Charlie's friend was done in by the Mob before could execute the plan. However, that doesn't stop Charlie, nor the film, from hitting the gas pedal and going of the gold.The film is not a typical heist movie in that it is very cartoonish. The American remake from 2003 is a lot more gritty (though not being too gritty at all), which brought it down from the sheer excellence of this film. This is pure entertainment - funny, interesting, and with a great third act: the legendary car chase. Taking from the streets, arcades, stairs, tunnels, beaches, highways, and even roof tops (!!!). All played out with a very enjoyable style.This is an action comedy that deserves place next to Buster Keaton's "The General." The ending is also one of cinema's ultimate cliffhangers. Just not in the way that you might be thinking. 10/10Rated G</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wonderful Mini Cooper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Italian Job' (1969) is a film about a group of criminals who plot to steal gold bars in Italy. The film consists of several chase scenes involving the Mini Cooper. A 'remake' of this film was created in 2003, but they are very different films. This version of the film brings together humour and interesting characters, and it is pretty slow going up until the chase scene with the Minis. And it has that famous cliffhanger ending - no pun intended - which just literally leaves you hanging and wondering what is going to happen next.Although I cannot compare the two, a modern audience is probably going to respond better to the new version of the film. It's got more action and romance and technology. Please don't give the 1969 version a miss, because I think it is a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Italian Job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a British film this is a really good example of quality entertainment, and it is a really good crime like film as well. Sir Michael Caine as Charlie Croker is just the perfect character for the film, he is both confident, easy to annoy and a good leader. Basically he gets an offer to rob a famous gold bank in Italy, and he accepts it. The beginning and near middle of the film is the planning and testing, e.g. explosives. But most of the film is the actual robbery, or "job". It is really cool to see that Mini's can rob a bank, jump over buildings and be thrown off cliffs and explode. The ending is a clever idea as well, that we just see them on the edge of the cliff and we the audience make our own story, this is probably where the phrase 'cliffhanger' came from. Also starring Benny Hill as Professor Simon Peach and Dad's Army's John Le Mesurier as Governor. Sir Michael Caine was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and it was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British nationalism channeled into a heist flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films are all about the plot. Some are all about the acting. Some are nothing more than special effects. And then there are some, like The Italian Job, that are pure attitude.Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) is a professional criminal fresh out of an English prison when plans for a spectacular heist are dropped right in his lap. The government of China is sending 4 million dollars in gold to the Italian auto maker Fiat. An old associate of Charlie's has come up with a scheme to steal that gold from out of the middle of the biggest traffic jam in history. Unfortunately for him, the Mafia is a little territorial about that sort of thing and kills him with a bulldozer. Charlie gets his plans, however, and decides to do the job himself. He can't do it alone, though, so he must ask for the backing of Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward), a British crime lord who rules his kingdom from inside a prison cell. With Bridger's support, Charlie assembles his team and with the help of a computer expert (Benny Hill) and three Mini Coopers, sets out to pull off The Italian Job.When I say this film is all attitude, I don't mean there aren't any legitimately good elements in it. Some of the stunt work in the big heist is quite nice and Noel Coward gives a lovely performance. The explicitly nationalist tone of the story is also intriguing. Charlie Croker and his team are treated less like criminals and more like privateers from over a century and a half ago. Their crime may be about getting rich, but it's also about representing the British Empire. Their opponents really aren't the impartial agents of the law, but mob hit men representing Italy itself. That sort of "us against them" mentality shows up in a lot of American movies, and it's interesting to see it expressed in foreign cinema.But it is the attitude of The Italian Job that is most noteworthy. This story treats everything with a smile and the conviction nothing really that bad will happen. It portrays crime as just another line of work, with both professionals and laborers who aren't any different than anyone doing any sort of job, except they do it as much for the fun and the achievement as the money. The police are usually a major part of this sort of caper movie, but they're almost completely absent from The Italian Job. And when law enforcement is on screen, it's either ineffectual or subverted by the very criminals it's supposed to be controlling. In this story, everything is treated like joyful play, whether it's Charlie having a "just got out of jail" orgy or Charlie getting a good beating for interrupting Mr. Bridger when he's going to the bathroom.Because so much of the film is built on that attitude, it hasn't aged terribly well if you can't get in tune with the story. To modern eyes, The Italian Job might look a little slow, a little obvious and not as clever as the movie thinks it is. But there's a breadth to the story that you won't find in many heist films and watching this in addition to its excellent remake will give you a greater appreciation of both.</fullReview>

Turin is a northern Italian town where people are rather cold and do not shout around like a bunch of monkeys - In Turin the mafia does not exist, at least not in that cartoonish way depicted in the film. The "cosa nostra" going around killing people would be more like something you could find in the south.Finally, I love Michael Caine and always enjoy watching him and the same goes for Noel Coward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 70 minute shell around a great 20 minute movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minis are cool and they can go anywhere if driven with great skill. This is the moral of The Italian Job. An hour of random, illogical filler (admittedly with the odd spectacular car wreck) precedes the famous 20 minutes of watching minis do cool stuff and the final 10 minutes is only there to pad the movie to feature length, but the good 20 minutes is a must see!Where does it go wrong? Characters (at least a dozen of them) are introduced from nowhere, appear for 5 minutes and disappear only to be seen at the end cheering or shaking their fists depending on whether they were good or bad. A lot of these characters seem to have jokes reliant on us knowing their personalities, but we don't! How do you get to know a character that's only got 3 lines (albeit stereotypical lines)? It's a case of quantity over quality. Tragic as most of the actors are fine in the quality department, but don't get a chance to demonstrate it. Even Benny Hill only has about 3 minutes screen time! A fin example of how to turn a great ensemble into a great jumble.The first hour consists of random 5 minute bits that make sense within themselves, but don't have anything to do with one another nor do they logically flow. They do go in a general direction, but so much is touched upon , but never explored.Not wanting to give too much away, I'll simply say that the ending is crap. It's a good idea for an ending, but is executed as though it were in front of a blind firing squad.The cinematography is great, particularly for a 60s movie. When a film looks good today, you know it looked great then. The car wrecks look fantastic - proof that you don't need CGI for great action bits, provided you have the money to burn. Too bad what the were shooting was, for the most part, awful.The best recommendation I could give: Skip the first hour, watch the minis do their stuff, then turn it off.</fullReview>

The jokes, coming in the first part of the film, are an embarrassment. There is no acting of any kind. The plot is a featureless Siberian landscape. Noel Coward shows just how bad an actor he was - he recites. Michael Cane is hardly any better. There are a few mini skirts and dolly birds cavorting about in an attempt to keep alive the image of swinging, trendy Britain. The script is lousy. The director is talentless. The actors are lacklustre. Only Benny Hill shows his talent in his chosen field of dirty old men - cringe worthy to the core.This really is about as bad a film as it's possible to make. First time viewers would be advised to look at the first scene, which is faintly reminiscent of Orson Welles' A Touch of Evil (ha! ha!) and the car chase through Turin. The rest is just a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First prize in the lottery of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To be born English is to win first prize in the lottery of life" said Cecil Rhodes, and during my childhood in the late sixties there were still plenty of people in Britain who believed it. We might no longer have had an Empire, but we could persuade ourselves that we had not lost it but had selflessly transformed it into a noble Commonwealth of self-governing democracies. Our Parliament was a byword for democracy throughout the world. Our Queen was the world's most beloved Head of State. We had the world's best football team after Alf Ramsey's England team won the 1966 World Cup and the world's best rock group (The Beatles). We produced the world's best rich man's car (The Rolls-Royce), the best poor man's car (the Mini) and the best sports car (the Jaguar E-type). As Roger Miller informed us, England swung like a pendulum do, and Carnaby Street was the new international centre of fashion, turning out hip new styles that made the traditional haute couture of Paris and New York look positively square.Of our international rivals, Germany and Japan were still crippled by war guilt. Spain under Franco was a hidebound Fascist dictatorship, Russia under Brezhnev a hidebound Communist one. America was tearing itself apart over Vietnam, China tearing itself apart over the Cultural Revolution and France tearing itself apart over matters quite incomprehensible to the Anglo-Saxon mind known as "the events of '68". The United Kingdom was still Top Nation.This mood of smug national self-congratulation did not survive the economic crises of the mid-seventies (by 1979 we were more inclined to proclaim to the world how awful we were rather than how wonderful), but it was fun while it lasted, and this film is the best-known cinematic expression of that mood. It is a "caper film", a genre becoming increasingly popular in the late sixties. Such films tell the story of a robbery, but differ from the traditional heist movie in that they tell that story in a lighthearted way and from a viewpoint sympathetic to the criminals. The amorality of the genre is evident from its name, the word "caper" suggesting that armed robbery is a jolly escapade rather than a serious crime likely to earn its perpetrators a lengthy jail sentence."The Italian Job" adds something extra- patriotism- to the basic caper movie formula. Its basic message is that British is Best, even when it comes to crime. A gang of British robbers travel to Turin where they pull off a daring gold bullion heist under the noses of the flatfooted Italian cops and of a much more formidable adversary, the Mafia. Their leader, Charlie Croker, becomes a sort of felonious Alf Ramsey, coaching his side to victory in the World Crime Cup; final score England 1 Italy 0. (Is it coincidence that Croker shares his Christian name with two notorious celebrity criminals of the period, Charlie Kray, elder brother of Ronnie and Reggie, and Charlie Richardson, leader of the Krays' South London rivals the Richardson Gang?) There are some good things about the film, especially the well-handled action sequence in which the crooks make their getaway through Turin with the stolen gold in three Mini Coopers. (In line with the film's patriotic theme these cars are coloured red, white and blue; we also see plenty of shots of the Union Jack and the soundtrack incorporates extracts from British patriotic songs, such as "Rule, Britannia!" and the National Anthem). The acting is variable; Michael Caine as Croker is too one-dimensional, and I didn't like Benny Hill's Professor Peach, a seedy sexual predator of the type Hill used to play in his comedy shows. I did, however, like Noël Coward, in his final film, as Mr. Bridger, an aristocratic-sounding gang boss who provides the financial backing for the plot. Although Bridger is currently serving a prison term he maintains control over his gangland empire from his cell, and affects the demeanour of an upper-class gentleman, papering his cell with pictures of the Queen and unfailingly standing to attention whenever the National Anthem comes on the radio. (Bridger's pretensions to gentility are, however, perhaps punctured by his use of the non-U expression "toilet"; any true gentleman of his generation would have said "lavatory")."The Italian Job" has achieved something of the status of a national icon in Britain; it is regularly included on lists of the greatest British movies of all time and all red-blooded Englishmen are supposed to like it. The trouble is that I don't. I don't like caper movies in general, with their amoral assumption that crime is all jolly good fun. At one time the Hollywood Production Code and similar rules enforced by the British Board of Film Censors meant that crime films could never show the villains succeeding in their enterprises. These rules were starting to weaken by the late sixties, but the famous, literally cliffhanging, ending to this film seems like a cynical way of observing their strict letter while totally ignoring their spirit.What I particularly dislike about "The Italian Job" is the way in which this cynical amorality is combined with chauvinistic assumptions about national superiority; a crooked Briton is assumed to be better than any Italian, crooked on honest. One particularly chilling moment in this film when Croker promises a Mafia boss that the entire Italian community in England will suffer if the Mafia do anything to thwart his gang's plans. The cheerful Cockney geezer suddenly becomes a racist bully, threatening to unleash a pogrom against a community a quarter of a million strong. At this moment we get a glimpse of the nasty xenophobic depths lurking below the surface high spirits of this film. 5/10, largely for its technical merits rather than anything else.</fullReview>

I preferred the remake which wasn't the best film in the word, but its a better film than this, the action scene's are better executed maybe because it was made 30 odd years after its predecessor, and the way action sequence's are more doable with CGI and other advances in film making. maybe seeing the remake first clouded my judgement a little even so its still crap, over all my rating is 1 out 10 and that is purely cause there is no Zero score.</fullReview>

It may be that time has dimmed its lustre but it didn't really seem all that good which isn't the same as saying its chopped liver. And Noel Coward is worth the price of admission alone. I had no problem with Rossano Brazzi disappearing right after the credits, that's about all he was worth but Raf Vallone could have had a larger role and/or more screen time. God knows what hold Benny Hill - and Fred Emny if it comes to that - had over the producers to wangle himself a role that is essentially meaningless but that's showbiz.

		<fullReview>I saw the recent 'remake' of the 'Italian Job' first, and was anxious to see the original. My nice son gave the the DVDs or each of them. I can't really call the recent one a 'remake' because the two movies are so different. This one is foremost a typical British comedy, and for me was not anywhere as enjoyable as the more recent 'Italian Job.' Comedy like the scene where they are practicing for the heist, a great explosion destroys a van, 'You're only supposed to blow off the bloody doors.' And many others like that. In fact, the ending (which I discuss below after the SPOILER warning) is straight comedy, and which I thought was a very appropriate and funny ending. It is a very lightweight comedy, enjoyable for what it is, and the DVD has a very nice picture. I hate the 'select a scene' menu, though. You can't go directly to the last scene, for example, without stopping first at every subset of scenes in between the beginning and the end. A minor point overall, but what dunce designed that menu feature??SPOILERS ahead, quit reading, OK!!??I first wondered, why is the value of the heist stated in American monetary units ($4Million) when this is a British movie filmed about an Italian gold heist?? Anyway, a computer geek (did they really have those in 1969??) makes a computer tape which snarls traffic in Turino to allow the crooks to kidnap the armored car, divert it to a safe place, blow the doors off, steal the gold bars, escape via three mini Coopers, through the streets, across a weir of a dam, and through large below-ground drainage tunnels. On the road, the mini Coopers roll up a ramp into the moving travel van, inside the gold is placed in a stack on the floor, and each car is dumped over the rail as the van climbs a mountain road in the Alps. The van skids, ends up balanced, half-way across the rail, over a very steep drop off. Men to the front, gold towards the rear, each time the van would sway a little, the stack of gold bars would slide a little more to the rear. A quandry -- how to get the gold without everyone sliding down the ravine to their deaths?? The movie ends with the theme song, 'This is the self preservation society', as Caine's character says, wait, I have another idea. Very cute and funny ending to an otherwise mediocre movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Italian job is supposed to be campier &amp; funny than the remake. I know some of this is British humor, which tends to be more dry, but I did not chuckle or laugh at all.The plot was good but poorly executed. Cheesy sound effects at the Turin Motor Vehicle control room to help the audience "get" the fact the computer is messed up? Perhaps.The British mobster behind bars but running the prison was too heavy handed.The ending was horrible. I won't give it away.I prefer the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ah yes indeed; what a lovely, nostalgiac and wonderful old brit flick from the days when limey movies at least had a professional polish to them for all their faults. my only complaint is how a character like our dear old queen noel coward would in reality actually manage to last 5 minutes in the slammer let alone be the reigning 'guvnor' but there you go. the unique maurice micklewhite excels in the lead role as the leader of a motley group of cons along with benny hill in a rare screen role and robert powell in an early outing who are all after the big steal. the beautiful italian locations are worth seeing alone without forgetting some breathtaking car stunts which are even more admirable when you consider that they were shot long before the advent of computer graphic imagery. i imagine that shall feature prominently in the presently planned remake with mark 'marky mark' wahlberg. the sadly recently late peter collinson should be remembered fondly for giving us this and his even better 'cromwell' as a brit director of panache and talent. watch out too for the gorgeous valerie leon as a receptionist!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Croker (Michael Cane) and the men of imprisoned gang leader Mr. Bridger try to steal 4 million dollar worth of gold from a truck in Turin. We follow their preparation and the heist itself, including the now famous mini coopers. Meanwhile, they have to get the Italian mob off their backs as well.The idea of a heist movie is that you sympathize with the 'crooks', but in this one I didn't. They weren't likable at all. Add the dreadful pace and the silly carchase at the end (with a policecar re-appearing out of nowhere a couple of times, this wasn't an enjoyable movie. Although the coopers really are sweet.4/10, mainly for presence of Caine and sweet cars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just didn't survive the aging process. Poor acting, a messy story and all too sixties in film quality. I hadn't seen Caine as bad as in this one before, but then again I haven't seen that many flicks with him in them. I was surprised to find this film scores as high as it does, why is beyond me. The film's ending is highly unsatisfactory, like a part is missing. Maybe I need lobotomy to understand the greatness of this film. Not funny, not good. Go do something useful instead! (4/10) (I must also admit the remake/tribute 2003 flick Italian job was not much better. Completely different story, but as shallow as this one)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't, in fact, do the job - nor indeed much of anything, in what is a disappointing crime film that careens towards the lower end of what makes the grade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from anything else, 1969's The Italian Job just isn't a very good heist movie. It is a film inclined to put more effort and attention into sequences such as the long, overly extended and purely spectacle driven chase scene nearer the end focusing on three cars darting through streets and tunnels instead of a screenplay which might have seen a first act twist; a character in the camp we cannot trust or some antagonism rearing up later on to do with rivals additionally after what Caine and co. want. Not for one second do we think that the rag-tag, knock-about bunch of lads of whom eventually forge the motley crew of leering middle aged men; idiotic young adults, of whom are required to be constantly corrected, and 'hardened' criminals whom go by the name of "Cocoa" we eventually follow in 1969's The Italian Job, are grounded enough to truly exist for the kind of mission they attempt.Peter Collinson begins his film with a mountain-side drive as a carefree guy, not deeming these winding hill-top roads dangerous enough to wear a seat belt nor keep his speed below a certain number, races around sharp bends and tarmac badly guarded against accidents. He smokes a cigarette to smooth music ambiguous as to whether it's diegetic, and if it isn't that he has a death wish, we have to assume this is one cool customer. Eentually he does come a cropper, but only to a tactfully placed piece of building site machinery; a vehicle which causes an accident on account of some shifty looking henchmen killing our guy, whom, through what happens next, is revealed to have been a criminal himself.Michael Caine's Charlie Croker is then seen leaving prison, a man receiving several kind send-offs from other inmates therein yet to serve their sentences, thus inferring popularity and an ability to maintain several friendships and relationships at once. Croker does not strike us as much of a criminal and Caine is miscast; his presence and the actual casting decision epitomising the film's languid and often childish depiction of criminality and those involved in it. He's nice, a pleasant man; a man who is picked up from prison by a young, attractive female named Lorna (Blye), whose white clothing stands her out amidst the frame otherwise dominated by black, but is disappointingly cast adrift thereafter for a bunch of blokes at their shenanigans. Croker is unperturbed upon being told that his clothes are all outdated - he likes to stick to the tried and tested, while after arriving at where his car has been situated these past years, he speaks of intricacies and details outlining degrees of expertise within this field of motoring.Through exasperated exposition, Croker is outline via an 8MM movie reel of the opening man's death and that he was involved in an Italian-set heist he therein the recording wishes Croker to now take on. Following a nonsensical infiltrating of his old prison, Croker gets a certain Mr. Bridger (Coward) on board; his being 'in' on the job enabling Croker to address a room full of criminal cohorts of whom are greeted with chorus' of "hello chaps" and sometimes suffer from asthma. Principally, there are too many on the team; a smaller number and a leaner, meaner portrayal of this smaller number may have worked. We do not entrust for second that this knock-about, happy-go-lucky crew of bits 'n' pieces gangsters and cockney criminals have either the capability nor the expertise to take to stealing this gold bullion from an armoured Turin truck. Collinson tries to mask the film's shortcomings by painting an incompetent image of the crew so as to further tension or doubt; they are a far cry from the ominous Italian mobsters, whom dispatched their man in the opening with a sort of brutal clinicalness whole-heartedly missing from Croker's crew and their accidental blowing up of vans and foolish crashing of cars.The film is ultimately one of which enjoys the look of the places therein it is shooting, rather than having us enjoy the places wherein it goes; there are very few surprises and nothing particularly clever nor engaging about the manner in which the film progresses from act to act. The film is too indebted to spectacle and the grandeur nature of the exercise; too in love with its expansive Italian locations, proving that the best films of this ilk unfold in dank and greyed-out cityscapes, than it is delivering on a level of genre; too preoccupied with the idea of having cars dart through sewage tunnels as they make a daring escape. The enemy, initially the Mafia, of whom are constructed as blank antagonists, and then the police, of whom are depicted as blundering buffoons (when a Mini drives onto the roof of a building, why not seal the only entrance/exit? Why chase up after them?), make for relatively poor elements out to challenge or thwart the leads and their plan.Michael Caine's character deserved better; he deserved a better heist movie with fewer and more interesting characters - the only individual, English or otherwise, with more than just a handful of brain cells. The space around him is occupied by cheap and often rotten border-line right wing Union Jack flag waving of the messiest sort, as those dastardly Continental European Spics are foiled and the English, abroad, yet again take on their man and conquer them ? oh, and a black character allowed to take part but is allowed to clean a coach and then drive it a bit at the death. In spite of the romping, pumping attitude the film has to its subject material, we often find our minds wandering; wandering what a better film we might be watching and have long since left the text by the time it asks us to wander what Croker's "idea" might be come the final shots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Here be spoilers **Recently released from jail, Croker (Caine) takes a job from an old recently killed friend. He visits a jailed but not hindered crime lord and assembles a gang. The goal is a big shipment of gold delivered in Torino. And how are they going to do this? By creating the mother of all traffic jams.Now, maybe I did this the wrong way around. I saw the remake (of 2003) and thought it to be very good. Naturally I wanted to see the original, as the original usually is better than sequels, prequels and remakes. Now, that may have been my error, as the original didn't come close to living up to my expectations. If you should watch only one Italian Job, choose the new one.Now why do I think that? First, in my opinion this is a movie about a heist. The thrill is to see a fantastic plan take form and then see it pulled of, usually with some complications coming along the way. Now this movie started out good, with the presentation of the goal of the job, the gold. But then it just went silly. The preparations were outright dull, with the exception of some silly attempts to be funny. Then the actual heist went off without the slightest complication nor suspense, they just did it. Big disappointment.Then there are a lot of very disturbing plot holes, unmotivated scenes and just annoying facts. I could give a lot of examples, but will make do with a few. Not being a criminal myself, I can't be sure, but the gang seemed very unprofessional, being cranky like babies without enough sleep. Now that didn't matter as the police were as stupid as could be. They seemed to give up just because the criminals closed a door. And they seemed not aware of how many exits (that you could drive a car out of) a public church had. In addition they didn't seem to get suspicious when a known mafia-boss trailed the shipment of gold by two meters. And were did the mafia go then, they just vanished from the plot.Then there is the fabled car-chase. Being a big part of the movie it takes place in most places a car can be able to drive, except roads (yeah I know, there are some). The police just manage to tag one police car after the three minis, and maybe a motorcycle. And this is always so, whatever stunts the minis do to avoid the police, there miraculously is always one and only one police car behind them. That with the exception when they get to the big motorway and load the minis into the bus. Then there is absolutely no traffic at all, not even going the other direction! (And why did they throw of the tracks they used loading the minis clearly exposing how they try to escape). So, there is never any suspense that they should get caught. And while pretty spectacular, why did they drive on the roof of the arena? I guessed it was a way for the movie to show off a bit, but it was completely over-shadowed by the stupidness of it. And why did they throw the minis off clearly telling everyone which route they tried to escape. And how did the crime lord get the news that they stole the gold while they were still making their get-away (cellphone?)? And finally, there is the ending (completely unnecessary had the gang had an ounce of competence), braking most physical laws there is, that we don't get to see the end of. They should have died you know...So. A surprisingly weak movie. See the new one!3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, that was bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea that the Italian Job I saw in the theater was a remake until I looked it up on Netflix. To say it's a remake is pretty unfair; it has just the name in common with the original. Therefore, this will not be a comparison review.The Italian Job is so slow-paced I was able to leave the room or mute the movie (when the little kids came in the room) and then pick up as if I hadn't skipped anything. The comedy was seemingly non-existent and the big car chase at the end dragged on so long I almost turned the movie off then and there. Even for it's time it was slow.I expected a lot more from Michael Caine, who has turned out much better comedies in his time (see "Educating Rita" instead of this one) but I guess it's right on par for Benny Hill (some brainless gags that just aren't funny).Netflix recorded this movie has carrying at 'G' rating, for General Audiences, which means you can put your five-year-old down in front of the movie and walk away. I have no idea why it would carry a MPAA rating at all because it would have to have been released in the theaters in the U.S., which unfortunately doesn't happen with enough European movies. Well, perhaps it was released in the U.S. If it were, it should have carried a rating of at least 'PG,' for Parental Guidance Suggested. I'm VERY glad I decided to view it before letting my daughter watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thieves target a gold shipment. The long exposition is so disjointed and sloppy that it's not clear who the characters are and what they are doing. The emphasis is on comedy rather than plot except that there's nothing here that's worth even a chuckle. The thieves are so inept that it's hard to believe they could steal even a loaf of bread. The robbery sequence itself is poorly executed, lacking any suspense or thrills. Then comes the never-ending car chase where three Mini Coopers try to get away with the gold while pursued by a single police car (where are the other cops?). The cliffhanger ending is utterly ridiculous. The 2003 remake is nothing great but is far superior to this turkey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I'm going to get rapped for this, but it wasn't very funny, nor very exciting. Michael Caine is good to excellent of course (or at the least as good as he can be with the material he has to work with), but that can't be said too much of his co-stars, who don't really seem to take things too seriously (with maybe the exception of Michael's love interest - even so, she isn't given much to do, as she's packed off onto a plane before the heist starts).While there is some spectacular scenery, the chase is not very exciting, the Italian police are beyond inept and the heist is "gotten" way too easily only to literally end on a cliffhanger (where humans weigh more than a large pile of gold). And let's not even mention the under-use of none other than Benny Hill.Overall, I was consider purchasing the UK blu-ray release, but after watching my $5.00 DVD I think I will stick with what I have (unless someone wants to purchase it from me).BTW, did anyone else feel as if this film needed some Lalo Shifren music to liven it up (ala KELLY'S HEROES, which IS a really fun and exciting heist movie)?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated and the editing seems confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilers:Michael Caine is thief Charlie Croker who gathers a group of criminals to steal $4 million dollars in gold bars from Turin, Italy. He uses three Mini Coopers -- red, white, and blue -- to abscond with the money. Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward) is a crime boss in prison who helps finance the heist. (I didn't get this from the movie; only after I had read some comments on it.) A clever plan is used to foil the Italian police so they can't give chase. The ending is an interesting chase through streets, weirs, sewers and rooftops and culminates in the beautiful Italian Alps.Michael Caine is the star and, as always, he does a very good job. Other than Noel Coward, and Benny Hill I didn't recognize anyone else from the film. The supporting characters are not very well drawn. I did a little research and apparently this film is a classic in Great Britain and some of the reviewers seem to love it. Frankly, I didn't know what the heck was going on in this movie. I didn't understand who the Noel Coward character was and what the Italian mafia had to do with it. Also there is a car crash in the beginning and I still don't understand what that was about. As an American viewer more than 35 years later, it seems dated and the editing seems to have left pieces of the film out so it's confusing. The remake with Charlize Theron has some similarities to the original but not many. I may be a lug head for not understanding parts of the film but I can't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing -- and loving -- the remake of this movie, and reading all the reviews that said it didn't quite live up to the original, I thought that the original would have to be something pretty special. I was quite surprised, and a little disappointed, by this strangely muddled piece of work. I was halfway through the movie before I realized that it was supposed to be a comedy, not a genuine caper flick. I'm still not sure exactly what kind of person Mr. Bridger is supposed to be -- a prisoner who has free run of the prison and is treated like royalty by everyone, including the guards? And the notion that this supposedly elegant job can only be pulled off by a crew of 14 (mostly indistinguishable) people is frankly flabbergasting. It makes me long for the clarity and simplicity of "Ocean's 11." All that plus the lack of a satisfactory resolution at the end makes for too much silliness and not nearly enough payoff. Give me the remake -- which was tight, well-placed and barely plausible -- over the preposterous original any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film embodies the worst of the sixties. It seems like Britain gets a pass when they make bad movies, and this highly rated crap is a classic example. I assumed that since Michael Caine and Noel Coward were in the movie that it would be tolerable. I was sadly disappointed. It's a waste of talent that can be compared to the junk churned out by Peter O'Toole and Peter Sellers in that same era. The plot is weak, the caper is boring, and the opportunities for acting limited. There's a lot of rushing around beautiful European vistas, and very little else. Very little comedy in fact. It's high spirited, like the 60's, but sadly lacking in value(like the 60's).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps when this dull heist comedy came out some of this stuff hadn'tbeen done to death; but even seeing it with a mint print on the bigscreen(as I just did) is pretty rough going. It's funny to me how people are praising the "we can't think of an ending" ending, which pretty much sums up the lack of imagination on display here. It's the kind of movie that says "you don't have totake any of this seriously"; and wants to a medal for it. It has nothing to do with the sixties except you can see some ofthe then current fashions on hand. Cane rises above the material andmanages to not come off badly, which has always sort of been hispersonal genius. Benny Hill is given thankfully brief screen time; NoelCoward looks like he was still mad at the Beatles for topping his wit in"A Hard Day's Night." In any event, this is for the hardest of hard core heist fans only, if your idea of great cinema is "The Hot Rock" and "ThoseDaring Young Men In Their Flying Machines"; this one's for you. Two outof ten. </fullReview>
