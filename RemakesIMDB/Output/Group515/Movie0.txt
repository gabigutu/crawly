		<shortDescription>Romantic comedy perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lubitsch's charming masterpiece, so often imitated and re-adapted since it appeared in 1940, is one of the very few films that can be called perfect. There is not a shot, a line, a performance, or a moment in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER that isn't exactly right. Everything fits together and runs like a Swiss watch.With its flawless screenplay and cast, it's the most subtle, discreet, and understated of romantic comedies. What other film manages to be so warm-hearted yet so rigorously unsentimental? What other movie story is so exquisitely planned and executed?Margaret Sullaven isn't sexy, it's true, but this isn't a film about sex. It's about love in the human heart and mind. A sexier actress would have thrown things out-of-balance. As always, Lubitsch knew exactly what he was doing. Just as he knew ace comedian Frank Morgan (the WIZARD OF OZ's Wizard) had hidden depth, which this film so beautifully reveals.They don't make them like this anymore -- they didn't make them like this back then, either. SHOP was under-rated in 1940, when it appeared. It's simply too subtle, too intelligent and disciplined for the average viewer or critic.Nothing overdone or exaggerated. Nothing out-of-place. If Mozart had been a filmmaker, he would have made this one. Warm, charming, adult, quiet, intelligent, knowing, touching ... perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Stewarts best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that gets better each time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villian" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Very believable in every facet of his role.The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman.This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stewart /Sullavan relationship and the warmth which flows on the screen are only one bend in a most extraordinary river.Although "extraordinary" is not the right word,because everything here is ordinary,no hero,no spectacular events and however,something happens.The shop is a life microcosm,with its little quiet joys and its bitter disappointments,but,Lubitsch,here very close to Capra ,proves that virtuous gents like Stewart character can triumph in the end;and the final scene of the lovers is one of the wittier in the whole cinema.We seem to know all the clerks in the shop as if we've known them for years,and their everyday life is depicted with love and affection.The yuletide spirit is captured with a lot of emotion-check the scene between the boss and his new delivery boy Rudi and predates "it's a wonderful life" by five years.The main topic is the fear of solitude.The shop is the place where everyone can feel he is part of a family,a family sometimes truer than the real one (see the boss's wife).And the director wants to make sure that ,when they leave their work on Xmas night,everyone is not on his own.A masterful conclusion.The remake "you've got mail" featuring Ryan and Hanks is politically correct to a fault.All Lubitsch's movie charm and poetry seem to have been swallowed by the computers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pen pals in Budapest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever, as is the case with "The Shop Around the Corner". This film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play, without the charm or elegance of Mr. Lubitsch's own, and definite version.Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in several films together. Their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all. Both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another, but who fate had them working together in the same shop in Budapest.The reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture. In here, we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the owner of the shop. Also, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing impressive work in making us believe that yes, they are in Budapest.That is why these films will live forever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have lost count of just how many times I have seen this movie - I probably know the entire dialog backwards - yet I am drawn to it time and again.Set in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the eligible bachelor "Kralik" who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent "Klara". Kralik secretly becomes Klara's pen-friend, and at work together Klara confides in Kralik about the content of his (Kralik's) letters. Clearly Kralik is besotted with Klara - but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the "pen-friend". Confused? Well you wont be - this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending - but we all know it is the ending we all want.Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan playing his usual role, this time as the shop's owner "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", Kralik's confidant. Joseph Schildkraut as the womanising arrogant "Vadas" - so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning.Finally William Tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over-confident upstart of a shop junior "Pepi Katona".Recently re-made as "You've Got Mail" starring Tom Hanks &amp; Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - although I suspect younger audiences would disagree.If this film is on in your area over Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex handy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oozes With Charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man-vs.-woman-argue-all-the-time-but-wind up-in love-type of Hollywood screwball romance/comedy.I usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm.Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple. The supporting cast is outstanding - from the always-likable Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career. He takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him. That "twist" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind.Once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of that. In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. I'll take this over the re-make "You've Got Mail," any day. No comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the saddest comedy ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful film, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes the film, however, is that undercurrent of sadness throughout. The story is underscored by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences. Most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed, having been ripped apart by the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes. Yet funny it is--listen to Margaret Sullivan's harsh dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend "of poetry and meanness". It's funny, pointed, and sad all at once. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a very good cast, a nice blend of wit and sentiment, and many other pluses, this classic remains as enjoyable and charming as ever. The fluffy but pleasant story benefits greatly from the Lubitsch touch, since he had the knack of giving significance to little things without taking them or himself too seriously. Presenting his characters honestly yet sympathetically, he makes the somewhat contrived situation seem believable and worth caring about. Its appeal comes across as almost effortless, but you only have to compare it with the less effective 90's remake to see how important the right touch is with this kind of story.The atmosphere of life in the Budapest shop is set up efficiently and convincingly, and the cast all settle into their roles seamlessly. As the leads, Jimmy Stewart works perfectly, of course, and Margaret Sullavan conveys the right balance of spunkiness and vulnerability. Felix Bressart is invaluable, giving perhaps the finest performance among his many character roles. In some of his scenes, he barely has to say a word to make you smile. Frank Morgan is surprisingly good in a role rather different than usual for him, Joseph Schildkraut is effectively oily as the deceitful Vadas, and the others all help out, too. Lubitsch gives all of the characters a chance to come to life without pretense, just by using simple details effectively.It all fits together very well, moves at just the right pace, and makes you a part of the characters' world. It makes for a very enjoyable movie that holds up very well even after several viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet, Unassuming, Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much about love &amp; life can be learned from watching the folks at THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film. With sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie. Always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the ?Lubitsch touch.'Although the story is set in Budapest (and there is a jumble of accents among the players) this is of no consequence. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great American city or small town could easily be the locus for the action.Jimmy Stewart &amp; Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing it. Their dialogue - so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural - perfectly conveys their confusion &amp; quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates. Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema.Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold. An accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented. Additionally, Morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments - near the end - when he determines that his store's newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve.Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic Lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him. Gentle Felix Bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues, yet remains a steadfast friend to Stewart.Sara Haden graces the small role of a sales clerk. William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force.In tiny roles, Charles Halton plays a no-nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor. Movie mavens will recognize Mary Carr &amp; Mabel Colcord - both uncredited - in their single scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother &amp; aunt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, despite not being the original - it began life as a play in Central Europe - has weathered the several incarnations that followed (MGM's own remake with period songs In The Good Old Summertime, the Broadway show She Loves Me, even the excellent theatre revival in Paris a couple of years ago) and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat. Several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s Hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today - try, for example, removing Ugarte, Ferrari, Renault etc from Casablanca and yes you'd still have Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo but they'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below. Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan WERE both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Hardy's Sara Haden and this is BEFORE we factor in that Lubitsch 'touch'. Okay, maybe they WERE a tad more naive, innocent even, in that Jurassic Age but how many genuine film lovers, sated with scatology, screwing and in-your-face sex, turn back to those days of Stories, Style, Slickness and Skill and wallow in great movies like this one. By far the best thing about this technological age is not CSI but DVD that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the Matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Shop Around the Corner (1940)' is a pleasant romantic comedy, not the sort that I will hold dear to me until the end of my days, but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation. By 1940, director Ernst Lubitsch had long ago taken Hollywood by storm, and his famed "Lubitsch touch" had become a sparkling commercial trademark. This film was planned for a 1939 release, but scheduling conflicts meant that James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were unavailable for filming. Rather than substituting either of his main stars, Lubitsch decided to postpone production, in the meantime directing Greta Garbo in 'Ninotchka (1939).' When it was finally completed, 'The Shop Around the Corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference, receiving zero Oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by Samson Raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and Frank Morgan in a supporting role. Time, nevertheless, has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence, with high-profile remakes including 'In the Good Old Summertime (1949)' and 'You've Got Mail (1998).'At its surface, one might assume 'The Shop Around the Corner' to simply be the story of two lovers, Klara Novak (Sullavan) and Alfred Kralik (Stewart), who love each other without knowing it. However, Lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that. It's the story of Matuschek and Company, a stylish gift shop in Budapest, and the various human relationships that make the store such a close-knit family. When store-owner Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife, we witness the breakdown of two families, both at home and at work. There's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the United States ? perhaps in the blustery streets of New York ? but Lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in Europe, the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep. This subtle subtext brings a more meaningful, personal touch to the film ? in fact, even as I write this review, I'm beginning to appreciate the story even more.Sullavan and Stewart are both lovely in their respective roles, but I think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film. Each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix, and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable. I especially liked how Lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards Hugo Matuschek, who, in any other film, would have been restricted to an underdeveloped, two-dimensional portrayal. Matuschek may have lost the love of his family, but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees, and you feel a heartwarming glow when, in the bitter cold of a Christmas Eve snowstorm, he finds companionship in a freckle-faced young errand-boy (Charles Smith). This genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of Billy Wilder's later creations, for example, Boom Boom Jackson in 'The Fortune Cookie (1966)' or Carlo Carlucci in 'Avanti! (1972).' Of course, it doesn't really need saying, but Billy Wilder learned from the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film, Balta Street in Budapest but it could really be in any place. The small number of sets reflect a middle European design but it could be a shop around any corner. The film is not about Budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters.Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance, and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully. Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the shop, is having trouble with his wife, she only a voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments. Mr Pirovitch's life is centred around his wife and children. Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' to a girl at Christmas. You even sense that quiet Flora Katchuck, while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone.The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. It is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again, simple yet profound. The dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days. All the acting is magnificent. Even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other perfectly. He was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days. Some of her other films are worth catching. As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. His moment of truth is very moving. Gold stars all round to the performers.It is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to (The vague re-make 'You've Got Mail' was dire) but in this case it is true. The director Lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading. The genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable.The Shop Around the Corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern-European atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the (also strong) nominal leads; I avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance.The 1998 film You've Got Mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen-pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake. This is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to even know where to begin to praise "The Shop Around the Corner." I'll avoid repeating what other IMDb critics have said by offering this: A good friend of mine is an older man-- in his 70s-- who scorned films, preferring opera (and not just opera, but Wagner), literature (Tolstoy at least), and philosophy (Wittgenstein, of course). He offered me one chance to show him a movie that proved cinema's worth as an art form.I chose "The Shop Around the Corner." It's neither highbrow nor lowbrow, it's neither epic nor a silly bit of froth, it's not a genre or a formula picture, and it's about nothing bigger than decency and love (which are plenty big enough). It is, however, flawless, both funny and touching, and I thought it was a fair representation of how superb even modest films can be, and therefore a fair test of how open-minded my friend was."Powerfully flavored," was his summation, and he was impressed enough to begin seeing movies again (the last one he'd seen on a big screen was "Lawrence of Arabia"). And so, among all its other qualities, "The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the best ambassadors the art form could ask for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Budapest, Hungary, the Matuschek and Company store is owned by Mr. Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) and the bachelor Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) is his best and most experienced salesman. When Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) seeks a job position of saleswoman in the store, Matuschek hires her but Kralik and she do not tolerate each other. Meanwhile the lonely and dedicated Kralik has an unknown pen pal that he intends to propose very soon; however, he is fired without explanation by Matuschek in the night that he is going to meet his secret love. He goes to the bar where they have scheduled their meeting with his colleague Pirovitch (Felix Bressart) and he surprisingly finds that Klara is his correspondent; however, ashamed with the unemployment, he does not disclose his identity to her. When Matuschek discovers that he had misjudged Kralik and committed a mistake, he hires him again for the position of manager. But Klara is still fascinated with her future fiancé and does not pay much attention to Kralik. "The Shop around the Corner" is a delightfully naive romance, and this is the type of film that deserves to be watched many times. It is charming and innocent, and James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan show a wonderful chemistry even in their arguments. I love this period of classic romantic comedies when society was satisfied with a screenplay that does not need to use sex scenes and other diversion but great dialogs supported by outstanding direction and acting. In 1998, Nora Ephron updated this film with the remake "You've Got Mail" without any reference to the work of Ernest Lubitsch. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "A Loja da Esquina" ("The Shop around the Corner")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the screen's best romantic comedies, and an excellent example of the subtle humor and wry character interplay that marked the films of director Ernst Lubitsch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Budapest in The Shop Around The Corner is fixed on love and shopping, essential bourgeois habits. But do not be deceived by the precious delicacy - like a fine music box - of the film. Ernst Lubitsch knew the risks lovers ran. You can feel his crossed fingers. This may be Hollywood's most poignant love story, set amid the fussy, heightened naturalism of a little shop where everyone is a character. At work, Alfred and Klara do not get on, no matter that they are James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. They are vexed by misunderstandings and cross-purposes. But they share one thing: they are both writing heartfelt letters to an unknown correspondent, and through this epistolary communion they have fallen in love. Of course, a moment of discovery will come, and the great Felix Bressart makes it as tense as some moments in Hitchcock films. American film has no more heartbreaking shot than that of Sullavan's face gazing into her empty letter-box. Lubitsch had come so far - from German costume dramas and romantic comedies to Hollywood and Paramount, where he was put in charge of production. He enjoyed considerable acclaim for his silent pictures, including Lady Windermere's Fan (1925), and in the 1930s, with the advent of sound, created a further series of successes - The Smiling Lieutenant (1931), Trouble In Paradise (1932), Design For Living (1933), The Merry Widow (1934), Angel (1937), and Ninotchka (1939). He was a master of sophisticated comedy, whose light touch inspired people like Billy Wilder, who really got his break writing scripts for Lubitsch. The Shop Around The Corner is something of a departure for the director in that its characters are poor and hard-working, and also because the film relies on the ambiance of the shop. It is also the picture in which Lubitsch himself seems most moved and anxious for his lovers. It's a grave and lovely film, as well as a secure masterpiece. In 1940 the US was not yet at war, and Hungary was still free from the worst Nazi domination, but the idea of Christmas at Matuschek's was already far-fetched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly beautiful, funny and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not sure whether I can add to the other reviewers here about the gem that is The Shop Around the Corner. It is beautiful, funny and touching and one of those perfect films really. It looks stunning, has deft direction from the great Ernst Lubitsch, has a truly sweet and romantic ending and has a beautifully-balanced script. I do agree to some extent the story is thin, but it is full of charm, wit and such that you actually ignore that, while the film is a good length and moves briskly.The acting from the two leads are delightful. James Stewart is perfect as Alfred, this film and his performance deserves to be up there with his other great films/performances It's a Wonderful Life, Vertigo, Rear Window, Philadelphia Story, Anatomy of a Murder and Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Margaret Sullivan is the epitome of grace and warmth as Klara, and Frank Morgan provides impeccable support as Hugo.All in all, a lovely little film as funny and moving as it is beautiful and charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nearly Perfect Little Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it. The key to this film's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low-key, unfussy performances. As a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them.There's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated. Loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager, played wonderfully by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it. This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met. Of course we know everything will turn out right in the end, but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy.Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry. The little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family, and that's exactly how it feels to us as well.This is a wonderful, unsung romance.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time. If you want to see a great movie, this is it. Jimmy Stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is spellbinding. Morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing. William Tracy as Pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances. Felix Bressart delivers a fantastic performance as Perovitch, a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with. It is a simple story of how close co-workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love story as great as it is real...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feel-good romantic comedies ever made. There's just no getting around that, and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words. It's not one of those films that tries too hard, nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end. In fact, all its charm is innate, contained within the characters and the setting and the plot... which is highly believable to boot. It's easy to think that such a love story, as beautiful as any other ever told, *could* happen to you... a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies, however sweet and heart-warming they may be. Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Clara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) don't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop (Matuschek &amp; Co.) he's been working in for the past nine years, asking for a job. They clash from the very beginning, mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened--he thinks it's a ludicrous idea; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired. Their bickering takes them through the next six months, even as they both (unconsciously, of course!) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through PO Box 237. This would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on, except that THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is expertly fleshed-out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters, from the fatherly but lonely Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) himself, who learns that his shop really is his home; Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), Kralik's sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion; smarmy pimp-du-jour Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous Kralik; and ambitious errand boy Pepi Katona (William Tracy) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for Matuschek &amp; Co. The unpretentious love story between 'Dear Friends' is played out in this little shop in Budapest, Hungary, in which Kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds-to-be along. It's nice that everyone gets a story in this film; the supporting characters are well-developed, and Matuschek's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one Alfred and Clara share. His invitation to new errand boy Rudy (Charles Smith) for Christmas Eve dinner, made in the whirling, beautiful snow of a Hungarian winter, makes the audience glad that he is not alone; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn't this film's business to tell. Aside from the love story, I must say that James Stewart is truly one of the best things about this film. He doesn't play the full-fledged Jimmy Stewart persona in this film (c/f 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' for that); in fact Alfred Kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind. He's rather a brusque man, in fact, with little hint (until, perhaps, the very end) of the aw-shucks down-home boyish charm Stewart would soon come to patent. When he finds out before Clara that they have been corresponding in secret, in fact, Kralik doesn't 'fess up--he waits it out to see how far he can take the charade, especially since he quickly realises (given his stormy relationship with Clara as boss and underling) that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself. His description to Clara of the fictional Matthias Popkin (what a name!) who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme, but also his way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man, just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her. Stewart plays this role perfectly--he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever Clara insults Mr. Kralik, as she is often wont to do, even (and especially) to his face. And yet one believes, underneath the brusqueness and professionalism, that he *could* reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer *hope* as he eventually does. Special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well. Margaret Sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film, but she really comes into her own in the closing-shop scene on Christmas Eve, when she almost gets her heart broken again by Alfred's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart. Frank Morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous Hugo Matuschek driven to nervous breakdown, the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to 'grow old with him'. And Felix Bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal Pirovitch wonderfully (a Lubitsch regular, since he appears as a hilarious Russian ambassador in NINOTCHKA)--of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend Alfred get the Christmas present the latter *really* wants... a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box Clara is so hung up on. Ernst Lubitsch really does himself proud with this film--for example, the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the Matuschek shop is well worth the effort, right down to the Hungarian names on the door, the wares and the cash register and so on. But even though Lubitsch chose to have the story set in Hungary, the setting is actually universal: it could happen anywhere; it could happen to you. Therein lies the charm of this simple story, these believable characters who really *are* people. The snow on Christmas Eve is real as well, or at least as real as Lubitsch could make it (he had snow machines brought in at great expense). It is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable, that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated. (No, not even in a remake like YOU'VE GOT MAIL.) *This* is really the Jimmy Stewart Christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Not to detract from the merits of that other film, but there'd be no harm, and in fact a lot of good, done in watching THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER this Christmas instead. It's sweet, funny, charming, and Stewart is impeccable in his role. We should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the story of Matuschek and Company- -of Mr. Matuschek and the people who work for him. It is just around the corner from Andrassy Street- -on Balta Street, in Budapest, Hungary.Klara Novak seeks work at Hugo Matuschek's Budapest store, after initially being turned down by head clerk Alfred Kralik, she gains employment after impressing the originally gruff Matuschek himself. This annoys Alfred and both he and Klara take an instant dislike to each other, completely unaware that they are both each others lonely hearts pen pal!.Boy oh boy was this production in safe hands. Produced and directed by the fabulous Ernst Lubitsch {To Be Or Not To Be &amp; Heaven Can Wait} and starring James Stewart {take your pick of many classics}, Margaret Sullavan {The Good Fairy &amp; So Red the Rose} and Frank Morgan {The Wizard Of Oz}. Adapted by Samson Raphaelson from Miklós László's play {Parfumerie}, The Shop Around The Corner ranks up with the best of the romantic comedies from the classic era. Blending charm with community spirit, and dark moments with beams of light, it's a concocted remedy for the blues at a time when war was at the forefront of everyones minds.Unashamedly sweet as it is, it's important to note the intricacies of the plot, with people being desperate for work, even forming rivalries within the confines of the shop, they even manage to flesh out an infidelity arc to really keep the viewer on their respective toes. All the efforts here are first class, Stewart gives the kind of performance that is often overlooked, no middle America Aww shucks on show here, it's precise and with feeling, this is a truly great Stewart performance. Sullavan is sadly something of a forgotten actress, and her films are so hard to find as well, it's a shame because she's right on the money and matches Stewart pound for pound in both humorous and emotive acting. Director Lubitsch once said that for human comedy he was never as on form as he was with The Shop Around The Corner, who wishes to argue with that? Because the evidence suggests he was right, and I can only add that The Shop Around The Corner is not merely just a romantic comedy, it's an experience all around the table; and then some. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly classic movie in its story, acting, and film presentation. Wonderful actors are replete throughout the whole movie, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart being the foremost characters. In real life she greatly admired, and liked Jimmy, and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles, and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set. The "chemistry" between the two was always apparent, and so warm and enjoyable to behold. She was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality portrayals. The story of these two young people, and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch, and pure magical entertainment. Heart warming presentations are also given by the other supporting actors in this marvelous story/movie. I whole heartily give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, that has a special appeal for all generations. A must see for all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a perfect picture!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There never was an actress like Margaret Sullivan, who could convey the radiance and poignancy of her soul in every part she played. She only had a few truly great roles, but this was one of them. She and James Stewart compliment each other perfectly in this exquisite picture.This is a story of a shop around the corner - in Budapest and the people who work there. Family man Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), two- faced, sly Ferencz Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut who was so sympathetic in "Orphans of the Storm"(1921)), unassuming Alfred Kralik (Jimmy Stewart), Flora (Sara Haden), flighty Ilona (Inez Courtney) and cocky Pepi (William Tracy). Alfred has received another letter from his secret pen friend - her letters transport him to a pleasanter place than his humdrum shop life. That day Klara Novak (Margaret Sullivan) comes to the store - desperately looking for a jog. She is told there are none to be had, but after ingeniously selling a musical box as a candy box to an over-weight customer, she is in!!! But she is out with Alfred, they antagonize each other from the start from the particular colour of her blouse to the right way to pack boxes. Of course she is the girl of Alfred's dreams, his pen friend (but neither of them know it) and they have agreed, by mail, to meet at a particular cafe. He is to wear a buttonhole and she is to carry a book, "Anna Karenina" by Tolstoy.The store's owner, Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) is having his own problems - the money he is giving to his wife is sending the store into bankruptcy. He is also suspicious of Kralik - he thinks he is having an affair with his wife!!! Events escalate and Alfred is sacked - Matuschek has had his wife watched and his fears are confirmed - she is seeing another man - but it is not Alfred, it is slimy Mr. Vadas. When he realises he has sacked the wrong man, Mr. Matuschek tries to kill himself. He makes things right from his hospital bed, Alfred is reinstated as the new manager and Pepi (who saved his life) is promoted to clerk!!! Even Vadas gets his come-uppance.Everything works out perfectly in this perfect film. James Stewart is as far from a lowly clerk in a notions store in Budapest as you can get, but this could be his most memorable role. Actually this film had an earlier remake than "You've Got Mail". In 1949 MGM remade it as "In the Good Old Summertime" with Judy Garland and Van Johnson. It was set in a Chicago music shop around the early 1900s and was a good excuse to give Judy some popular music of the time to sing.Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One and Only. Accept No "Remakes".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the great films from director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart .They're the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs. In fact, the film itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn't make anymore. (The makers of "You've Got Mail" claim their film to be a remake, but that's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise.) Anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's, you'll find "The Shop Around the Corner" to be nothing short of wonderful. Just as good with repeat viewings. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charming, Christmas Treat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shop Around the Corner" is a film about people. Simple everyday people, and just how colorful they can realy be. That romance plays a large role in the lives of people is, as far as this film is concerned, of no coincidence. Set around Christmas, "The Shop Around the Corner" makes a wonderfully festive film, although it does not deal with Christmas directly. But as Christmas brings out both the best and worst of people, it could not be a better stage for this delightful and touching film. In the hands of a great director a depression ridden Budapest becomes a soft, charming heaven on earth. And two "psychologicaly very confused" people become the luckiest on earth. As it is nearing the Holidays, please, do not pass up this film. Get as many people you love together, or perhaps best just that special one, and prepare to be introduced to a wonderful new Christmas tradition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darndest casting decisions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made. Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. Had I been casting the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan.Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her. But is only this one where neither of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York. In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then.I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out. But if you can accept Stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person. But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife. Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very scarce.And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day. Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as clerk in a gift shop; there, she bickers with co-worker James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal. Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying. Even better is a sub-plot involving shop owner Frank Morgan (as Hugo Matuschek), who suspects his wife is having an affair. Hiring a private detective, Mr. Morgan confirms his wife of 22 years is having sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, painfully realizing, "She just didn't want to grow old with me," and the supporting characters are what keeps this film from getting old.********* The Shop Around the Corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut</fullReview>

Margaret Sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the best in each other. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning performance, and with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" under his belt, that is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought "Trouble In Paradise" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph.

		<fullReview>James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan work in a knick-knack and luggage shop in Budapest. They argue fitfully with one another. Neither knows that they have a secret shared relationship, exchanging billets-doux by mail. By the end, after considerable mix-ups and secondary events, the hidden relationship is revealed and everyone enjoys a happy Christmas.It sounds sickening. I avoided it for years and stayed as far away as possible from its recent remake, "You've Got Mail" in which, instead of using the post, the would-be lovers exchange their love notes by email.But it was wrong to ignore the original. Lubitsch is not a slob. He rarely goes for the cheap shot and he knows ironic wit when he hears it. There is only one hug in the entire movie. (I counted.) Further, there are first-rate performances by most of the cast. The film is based on a play, so there really aren't that many characters. Sullavan looks pleasant without looking beautiful, and Stewart is Stewart, in one of his best pre-war performances. I'll give an example. Stewart is visiting Sullavan after he (but not she) has found out that they are secretly drawn to one another. Knowing this, he has written a letter praising his epistolary self. As they sit together, the letter is delivered to Sullavan and she lights up like the bulb on a Christmas tree and reads aloud the panegyric that Stewart (in his role as co-worker) has written about himself (as lover). Watch the expressions slowly make their way across Stewart's features, blending shame, pride, modesty, and calculation. It only takes a minute.In fact, the pace is pretty fast. Nobody shouts but everybody says what they have to say and darts off somewhere else. So, in expecting a sludge of sentimentality and tears, I must have been thinking of another movie. This one has quiet irony and is -- I don't know how to say this exactly, but it's European in its sensibilities. I'd have expected it from France but not Hollywood.</fullReview>

Co-starring with Stewart is an actress who helped him build his reputation as a true professional: Margaret Sullavan. In a supporting role is Frank Morgan, a marvelous character actor. The producer and director of this charming piece is none other than Ernst Lubitsch, a master of subtlety and wit - everyone calls it "the Lubitsch touch". (Please DO NOT read the rest of this commentary if you have not yet seen this picture.) Klara Novak (Sullavan) and Alfred Kralik (Stewart) are two bickering clerks at a small Budapest leather-goods gift shop owned by Mr. Matuschek (Morgan). With each passing month the feuding, fussing, and fighting gets worse, but the audience learns something about Klara and Kralik that they don't know about each other; they have been falling in love together as secret pen pals! Before too long, Kralik finds out, but he does not reveal his anonymous identity to Klara until the very end. Let me repeat, Ernst Lubitsch was a MASTER of subtlety and wit.The casting of "The Shop around the Corner" could not have been better. Margaret Sullavan as Klara Novak is a fast-talking, unpredictable wit, and James Stewart as Alfred Kralik displays a quiet self-control throughout most of the film. (In fact, Stewart biographer Jonathan Coe once remarked that "The Shop around the Corner" is one of the quietest motion pictures ever made.) Frank Morgan was the perfect choice to portray Mr. Matuschek, the owner of the shop. When he's in a bad mood, his staff dares not irk him any further; when he asks you for your honest opinion, he wants you to tell him what he wants to hear; when he's in a bright, cheerful mood, everyone working for him tends to be a reflection of that as well. Not to mention Joseph Schildkraut as Ferencz Vadas, a well-tailored, articulate clerk who kisses up to the boss, and Felix Bressart as Mr. Pirovitch, Kralik's fellow clerk and best friend who dares not contradict the boss.Notwithstanding the delicious chemistry between Sullavan and Stewart, here are some of my other favorite moments from "The Shop around the Corner". Matuschek asks Kralik, now the store manager, to dismiss Vadas as quietly as possible, but Kralik's handling of the matter is anything but quiet. To prove to the no-longer-anonymous Klara that he isn't bowlegged, Kralik pulls up his trousers to reveal his socks being held up by suspenders! On Christmas Eve, when the shop closes, the lonely Mr. Matuschek realizes that his new errand boy Rudi (Charles Smith) has no family in Budapest with whom to spend the holiday, so Matuschek happily takes Rudi out to dinner. Errand boy-turned-clerk Pepi Katona (William Tracy) saves Mr. Matuschek from taking his own life, just in the nick of time! At the opening of the film, Kralik quietly shares one of Klara's anonymous letters with Pirovitch, and then, from riches to rags, he tells Mr. Matuschek what he honestly thinks of his newly acquired "Ochi Tchornya" cigarette box. And I love how Mr. Matuschek engages in an angry tirade against his sales clerks, with a few subtle interruptions."The Shop around the Corner" is one of the finest romantic comedies I have ever seen. The same year it was released - 1940 - James Stewart appeared in another more sophisticated romance comedy with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant titled "The Philadelphia Story", for which Stewart garnered his only Oscar, but I personally feel that "The Shop around the Corner" is infinitely better than "The Philidelphia Story". I can also overlook the fact that the setting for this Sullavan/Stewart romance is Budapest, Hungary, yet a majority of the actors are American and speak the clearest English. To summarize, "The Shop around the Corner" is a truly remarkable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Sincere, Innocent and Pure it can get..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that 'The Shop Around The Corner' is a romantic comedy which is charming and endearing would be an understatement. Movies as pure and sincere as these are indeed a rarity these days. Lubitsch does a fantastic adaptation of the play by Hungarian playwright Nokolaus Lazzlo, about a man and woman working together in a gift shop who can't stand each other, but are falling in love with each other as anonymous pen pals. The 1998 Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks starer --You've Got Mail was largely inspired by this and was charming in its own right BUT it is no match to this original classic.It is a movie which carves out a niche for each character and makes all of them loved and memorable. The dialogs are some of the wittiest and the most charming I have ever heard.Sparkling performances by the lead pair James Stewart and Margaret Sulluvan. Aah.. the charm Jimmy is able to turn on, is simply divine! That such an actor once walked in flesh and blood on this earth is an eternal blessing for all of us who appreciate CLASSIC cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much has been written about the film's plot, the wonderful acting performance, the script, the melancholy, bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction - what can I add? Just watch for one of the most heart warming, beautifully acted, poignant scenes ever filmed. It is Christmas eve and Frank Morgan's character (the owner of the shop - Mr. Matuschek)is recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt. As each of his employees leave he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each and everyone of them politely turn him down. They all have plans for their own Christmas eve. At this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears. Thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene. The new employee, the errand boy, is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene. Desperately Mr. Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him, he will treat him to all the wonderful Christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen!The chap is overwhelmed, he too is obviously as lonely as Mr. Matuschek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene it moves me. If you manage to get the delightful DVD look at the great trailer with Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr. Matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film- the talented Ernst Lubitsch. This film is a joy from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original "You've Got Mail"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan bicker at work and unbeknownst to one another are falling in love via mail in "The Shop Around the Corner," a 1940 comedy directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch. There was no one quite like him; Billy Wilder once complained that something was "like Lubitsch but it isn't Lubitsch." Well, this is, and it's delicious.Set in Budapest, the story concerns two people, Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak, who work at Matuschek's gift shop. They don't get along. Meanwhile, they've both answered a personal ad and are writing to each other. They work with the trouble-making slimeball, Vadas (who else but Joseph Schildkraut), the pleasant and helpful Pirovitch (Felix Bressart) and Pepi (William Tracy). There is a subplot, which is the saga of Matuschek himself (Frank Morgan) who has suddenly becomes cold toward Alfred.James Stewart could be pretty sexy in these romantic roles. Maybe it's just me, but he softens his voice and looks right into the woman's eyes - quite disarming. Tall and boyish, he's adorable playing against Margaret Sullavan, with whom he worked 5 times. She's very funny, always sounding polite, upbeat and lofty even when she's insulting Alfred. She's especially funny when making unfavorable comparisons between Alfred and her pen-pal. "Oh, but you don't understand, Mr. Kralik. A man like you wouldn't..." Both were capable of such heavy dramatic roles and yet could turn around and do a light comedy with no problem.Frank Morgan gives a very touching performance and Felix Bressart is sweet and likable as Pirovitch. Schildkraut is hilarious - one isn't sure if it's his lines, his delivery, or the direction - it was probably all three. My favorite is when he says to Matuschek, "I saw your new dining room table. It's lovely. It must be especially beautiful in the evenings at dinner parties with the candles lit...Stunning." Sounds like nothing yet he's great.This can't possibly be compared to the remake, "You've Got Mail." After all, it isn't Lubitsch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy. Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected. But, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As movies should be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is noteworthy for three characteristics that cause an average plot to become a very good story: excellent acting, very good writing, and a strong supporting cast. The acting of the three major characters is exceptional with Margaret Sullavan as Klara, James Stewart as Alfred, and Frank Morgan as Matuschek. In fact, this film may be Stewart's signature role, that which solidifies once and for all the "Jimmy Stewart" motif. Sullavan plays a part which is decades ahead of its time, a romantic yet forceful and free-spirited woman who controls her own destiny. And Morgan is the gruff merchant with the golden heart. What is special about the writing is that one can find not lines which do not belong to the action. Situations are more or less normal and the language of the film is neither too sentimental nor too forceful, in keeping with the advice that Hamlet gives the players is Shakespears's play. The supporting cast is very strong, so much so that there is little distraction from the main point of each scene. Special credit goes to Felix Bressart as Pirovich, the wise one who seems to understand the human side of life; to William Tracy, the witty delivery boy turned clerk; and, to Joseph Schildkraut, who can make situation ethics seem virtuous. Aspiring actors may well find this a good film to study, as may rookie writers and directors. Come to think of it, even veteran Hollywood types would profit from viewing this film. Be sure to see this one, especially with the troubles of World War Two on the horizon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shop around the Corner (1940)A tightly contained movie made up of distinctive kinds of people that's so well done you sometimes forget the clichés. And the story is that classic of wanting love and not seeing it right in front of you.Yes, this story is now more famous because of the fun but slightly routine remake called "You've Got Mail." And James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan have a different kind of chemistry, and personal attitude, than their more recent interpreters (Hanks and Ryan). You have to settle in and see the sterling, unaffected brilliance of the two main characters here to fully feel the effect. You'll have to accept as exaggerated types the side characters who are a bit false for my taste, including the kiss-up co-worker and even the boss, who yes was the actual Wizard in "The Wizard of Oz" the previous year, Frank Morgan. But other writers praise even the supporting cast, so I think it's a matter of absorbing it all as style, a purposeful effect.The director is famous enough to have this whole style named after him--the "Lubitsch Touch"--and there is a good sense of that even here, but you have to see a few movies to understand what makes his interpersonal romantic comedies a little different. It's not screwball. In fact, it's not really outright comedy in this case, just a warm and fuzzy movie with an inevitably warm and fuzzy ending.Which is not a half bad reason to watch a not half bad excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jimmy Stewart's Other Christmas Film Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be of interest to study the dramatists of late 19th Century through 20th Century Hungary. The only one who has left a lasting imprint to most theatergoers in the U.S. and England (and the English - speaking world) is Ferencz Molnar, best recalled for LILLIOM and THE PLAY'S THE THING. But Ernst Lubitsch was born in middle Europe and frequently turned to German, Austrian, and Hungarian dramatists for his movie scripts. It is to him that we owe the discovery of Miklos Lazslo's THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, which has a remarkable track record: it is one of the few stage plays that was the basis for three successful movie versions. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER was the first and possibly the best (YOU'VE GOT MAIL may actually be the best, depending on who you talk to). The middle one is IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, which was the first musical version (there was a second, successful musical, for Broadway, called SHE LOVES ME). Oddly enough, it is the only play by Lazslo that seems to have been discovered. Perhaps someone will look over his dramatic confections to see if anything else is worth taking.The plot of THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is very simple. James Stewart is Alfred Kralek, who is the chief salesman at Matuschek and Company, a leather goods store in Budapesth that is owned by Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan). Kralek is forced to work with Klara Novak (Margaret Sullivan), an intelligent saleswoman (who initially he resisted hiring), who seems to question all of his ideas and orders. In the meantime Kralek has started writing letters to a pen pal whom he has never met - a woman that attracts him. What he does not know is that Klara is the woman, and she is equally attracted to his pen-pal form. So they love each other in their letters, but (not knowing each other's pen-pal personae) they dislike each other in the flesh.However, their pen-pal versions set up a date, and this is jeopardized by a change in the usually jovial personality of Mr. Matuschek, who becomes very harsh towards Kralek (up-to-then his "fair haired" boy). It turns out that Matuschek is aware that his wife is carrying on an affair with a male employee. He believes it is Kralek (who has been invited over to Matuschek's home several times). Finally, he fires Kralek a week before Christmas, and the night that Kralek was to finally meet his pen-pal.Kralek does go to the meeting spot with his close friend and co-worker Pirovich (Felix Bressart). He discovers Klara is his pen-pal, but he shows up (as though by accident - he claims he's waiting for Pirovich who has gone home), and proceeds to needle Klara. Klara manages to finally get him to leave. But her "pen-pal" never shows up. In the end the actual villain is revealed, and Morgan does rehire Stewart. I won't go into the rest of the film - delightful as it is - but the film does surround itself with Christmas. The store has a banner Christmas sales (an element rarely touched in Christmas stories; the commercial side is usually not considered something to push in Christmas stories). And the romance is straightened out in an entertaining fashion.Stewart and Sullivan make a very appealing couple (even when bickering). Morgan plays the comedy as he typically did, but his moments of anger and jealousy show he is really hurting (and disappointed at his wife). Bressart makes an art out of running out of sight when his boss wants advice (and he also has interesting views about apartments and having friends over for dinner). William Tracy (as Pepi), who is the store's messenger boy, is wonderfully nasty at several points to Mrs. Matuschek and her boyfriend, and to the fellow whom he eventually hires as his replacement - and look at his wonderful brief scene with Edwin Maxwell as Matuschek's doctor. And Joseph Schildkraut, as Ferencz Vardas (the villain) is properly sleazy and sneaky (although when Stewart is fired he shows he is feeling guilty about that). Perhaps not as soul enriching as IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, but it's sweet presentation of a set of little people who find each other makes it one of the nicest of all film romantic comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocent, Delightful Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in World Depression Era Prague, this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop, who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague. Add a little twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -Stewart- is having an affair with the owner's wife), leaving Stewart briefly 'fired', along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked' Stewart all along, the happy ending is inevitable.Although VERY dated (references to poverty and -I have a wife and two kids to consider- are over-used, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, like a musical cigar box, are out-of-reach for common people's enjoyment), this film is much more effective (and more credible) than the 1990s re-make "You've Got Mail". In the re-make starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual odds of the chain-of-events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended."Shop Around The Corner" is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated, less hectic, and more romantic time and place known as a novelist's Utopia. Lovers of Classic Romantic Comedies will enjoy this picture!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shop Around the Corner (1940): Dir: Ernst Lubitsch / Cast: James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut, William Tracy: Delightful romantic comedy that sometimes surrenders to jerking us around, but often times it is relentlessly charming. The action centres around a small shop where James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan star as employees who are unknowingly pen pals. Frank Morgan plays the shop owner who wants everything in tip top shape for Christmas. Director Ernst Lubitsch does a fine job at presenting relationships within an ordinary corner shop, but the film has tremendous depth as well. Stewart is terrific as someone who has mastered the shop and maintained its order but a misunderstanding results in his firing. Sullavan plays the female counter part who regrets the actions against Stewart despite their disagreements. Morgan steals his moments as he learns to take a closer look at life in the shop and demonstrate benefits to those of hard work. Joseph Schildkraut plays the film's villain whose tactics lead to the one act of violence where he is sacked in the jaw. William Tracy plays a young delivery boy who frequents the shop and eventually prevents a tragedy. While the ending is corny, the film's presentation of the characters through the walls of this little shop make for an interesting observation of those of us who must tolerate one another through eight hour periods.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful comedy, drama and romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's too bad that more of Miklós László's plays haven't been translated into English. The few that are from the Hungarian-born playwright have made wonderful plays and films. One has been copied and revised a number of times for Broadway production, TV musicals and films. "The Shop Around the Corner" is the original film version, true to the setting. The most recent that modern audiences will recognize is "You've Got Mail" from 1998. Billed as a comedy first, this movie shows us a slice of life of working people in 1930s Budapest, Hungary. Europe was also a part of the worldwide depression that had begun in the U.S. Even as the economies began to improve, jobs were scarce and hard to come by. That sets the stage for this story that has a wonderful mix of light comedy with romance and drama. It's a very good study of people. The entire cast shine in this movie. James Stewart as Mr. Kralik and Margaret Sullavan as Miss Novak play off each other splendidly. Sullavan especially does a wonderful job as Novak subtly comes around after noticing the changes in Kralik. Felix Bressart is perfect as Pirovitch. This wonderful supporting actor had a fine career in film before he died at age 57 from leukemia. Frank Morgan's performance as Mr. Matuschek is also worth noting. He portrayed a worrisome man with something on his mind exceptionally well. As I watched this movie again recently, I remember being curious about the monetary units in the story. We see the cash register tills ring up pengos, and Matuschek talks about the how many pengos they take in. I was a stamp collector for years growing up, and got to know a lot of world geography and other things from those stamps. Among them were monetary systems, capitals, famous historical figures, etc. For instance, I knew that Magyar referred to an area and people of Hungary, and I had stamps in denominations of korona. But the pengo had me stumped, so I just looked it up. The pengo replaced the korona as the basic monetary unit of Hungary from 1927 to 1946, when it was replaced by the forint. It was the equivalent of 100 fillers, making it similar to the U.S. dollar as the form of currency. Encyclopedias explain that the pengo was part of the stabilization program for Europe following WW I. It lasted only 20 years and apparently had the worst hyperinflation of all time. I don't know what the value of the pengo was in U.S. dollars then. The Hungarian Florint for several years now has ranged between one-third and one-half a U.S. cent. At the time this film was made, the pengo was issued only in denominations of 10-, 5- and 2-pengo bills. Minted coins included 1, 2, 10, 20 and 50 filler, and three in pengo amounts of 1, 2 and 5. The front of the 10-pengo bill had a picture of Mary holding the baby Jesus on the left, and a female model bust on the right. The reverse had the picture of a statue of King Stephen astride a horse. The story takes place around the holiday season. "Shop Around the Corner" makes a nice film to add to one's Christmas collection for annual viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matuschek and Company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1940), produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch, is a delightful tale of two store employees who don't get along very well, unaware they're carrying on a pen-pal correspondence through the mail that starts with "Dear Friend." Starring Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart for the third time together, following NEXT TIME WE LOVE (Universal, 1936), and THE SHOPWORN ANGEL (MGM, 1938), there's no doubt that this comedy-drama, based on the Hungarian play by Nikolas Laszlo, happens to be their finest collaboration thus far. Although a circumstantial love story from the viewpoint of its central characters, the film rightfully belongs to the owner of the shop around the corner, as wonderfully played by Frank "The Wizard of Oz" Morgan.What's the story about? Opening title reveals: "This is a story of Matuschek and Company - of Mr. Matuschek and the people who work for him. It is just around the corner from Andrassy Street - on Balta Street, in Budapest, Hungary." The shop, Matuschek and Company, consists of various workers starting with its founder, Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan), a middle-aged man devoted to both his store and wife, Emma, of 22 years; and staff: Alfred Kralik (James Stewart), a nine year employee/salesman and Matuschek's most trusted and closest friend; Mr. Petrovitch (Felix Bressart), a happily married family man whose the very first to arrive ten minutes before the store opens; Pepi Katena (William Tracy), an errand boy with a squeaky voice; salesgirls, Flora (Sara Haden) and Ilona (Inez Courtney); and Ferencz Vadan (Joseph Schildkraut), a "yes" man who mysteriously arrives each day by taxi loaded with large money bills in his pocket and expensive wardrobe. One morning, Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) arrives seeking employment. She successfully sells herself by selling an "O Tchonia" playing music box to a plump lady customer who mistakes it for a candy box. During the course of her six month stay at Matuschek and Company, Klara and Alfred find themselves constantly arguing, unaware that they carrying on a romance through the mail left in a post office box. Further complications arise as Alfred notices Mr. Matuschek to suddenly act indifferently towards him, even to a point of dismissing him before Christmas for no apparent reason.Being an Ernst Lubitsch production where his traditional locales to his motion pictures having European backdrops, mostly Paris, interestingly THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is a sort of story that could very well have taken place anywhere at anytime. Following the pattern of remakes, the musical version retitled IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME (MGM, 1949) starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson, takes place at turn-of-the-century Chicago; while the most updated edition, YOU'VE GOT MAIL (Warner Brothers, 1998) with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, not only is set in New York City, but uses the internet as its means of communication between pen-pal writers. With the exception of European born actors, Joseph Schildkraut and Felix Bressart, along with label signs written in Hungarian, many of the other players are essentially Americans talking naturally without any attempts using accents. Had director Lubitsch attempted on using European-born performers in leading roles as the two-time Academy Award winning Viennese born Luise Rainer as Klara, with Czech Francis Lederer as Alfred, for example, the outcome would have turned out entirely different and possibly not as successful as with the selected players as Sullavan and Stewart. Frank Morgan, best known for playing befuddled characters, is shown to best advantage here breaking away from his typical "Morgan style" for a more straightforward performance. Aside from serious performances from THE MORTAL STORM (1940), that reunited him with Sullavan and Stewart, and the much better known THE HUMAN COMEDY (1943) starring Mickey Rooney, it makes one wish Frank Morgan did more dramatic roles like these as opposed to the tailor-made double-talking bumbling characters he's done so often, even in his signature role as THE WIZARD OF OZ (MGM, 1939).Being a versatile actor, Morgan, believably having that European presence through his thick mustache and old-style haircut, gives a performance worthy for an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. His key elements include moments of humor for not trying to influence his employees when asking for their honest opinions; his surprise reaction when discovering the error of his ways towards his trusted employee, Alfred; and a heartfelt moment when inviting his newest and youngest employee, Rudy (Charles Smith), age 17, living alone in Budapest, to have dinner with him on Christmas Eve. When Morgan isn't around, the concentration resumes on the feuding store employees, Klara and Alfred. One unforgettable moment includes a scene outside the café where Alfred looks through the window, after being told by his friend, Petrovitch, that his pen-pal, with only means of identification being a Leo Tolstoy book, "Anna Karenina," happens to be Klara. While he doesn't give away his identity, he does surprise her when stopping by her table, only to soon be insulted and hurt when angrily called an "insignificant clerk." Other scenes involving Klara and Alfred are both amusing and touching in the best Lubitsch style and tradition. A pleasing musical score by Werner Hermann during its opening and closing credits is also worthy of an honorable mention here. No wonder THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER has lived up to its expectations in recent years as an exceptional motion picture.Formerly on video cassette since the late 1980s, and later available in the DVD format, for anyone looking for a bargain when it comes to shopping for a good movie with a Christmas theme, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER should make any customer satisfied without asking for refunds or exchanges the next time it's broadcast on Turner Classic Movies cable channel.

		<shortDescription>A perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't do better with this review than others have done, and I wholeheartedly agree with everything they have said. This is a perfect movie, truly--the directing, acting, editing, writing are all flawless. For an unexplained reason, I have just finished watching the movie five nights in a row and I have enjoyed it every time. The scenes between Margaret Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart are so delightful that I hold my breath to watch them. Especially Margaret Sullivan is so much fun to watch as she puts Jimmy Stewart down and is so charming in doing so that you can't help but love her. The whole cast is outstanding. The young man who plays Pepi almost steals the movie. What he does with the role is so rich and full and multi-layered and unique in its portrayal and interpretation. But they are all perfectly cast and work together so well. I don't understand why this movie didn't get multiple Oscar nominations in 1940, including Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recorded this film from Film4 showing at 3am. In reality this is a film perfect for BBC2 on a Sunday afternoon. It is a gentle comedy with beautiful interplay between the two leads and also adds pathos, wit and charm.The supporting cast do their job well and add to the story.There is also a lot of depth, most evident when the shop owner is subtly trying to find someone to spend Christmas day with and ends up with an unlikely companion.A film from a bygone age when all that was necessary to deliver perfect entertainment was a talented cast, a clever script and a warm delivery.I thoroughly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shop Around the Corner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernst Lubistch is a canonized name whose filmography has kept evading me until now, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, acclaimed as one of his most competent and most mature light comedies, is the ultimatum delight to savor under any circumstances. One might fully aware that this film is the archetype of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's commercial sensation YOU'VE GOT MAIL (1998, 7/10), but even its inception is over half a century older than the latter, the former still manage to overshadow it (or even any other praiseworthy rom-coms) in every possible aspect. An ingenious script renders a witty plot set-up which only leaves our leading lady unwittingly snared inside a white lie while audiences' appetite has been fully whetted and the final revelation is well-anticipated, humorous, affecting and sincerely good- natured, this is "the" kind of film which Hollywood doesn't (or is unable to) produce any more, pitifully!The temperaments of the two leads are plain congenial and mutually harmonious, the James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan pair oozes the optimal chemistry in the conventional rom-com mis-matched setting. The two represents the quintessential precious nature of the two sexes, role models of the golden age and rarely can be found in reality now, it all reminds us nostalgically what a pure golden-heart could be and elicits more whole-hearted appreciation. Stewart would win his Oscar for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (1940, 8/10) the same year, but under Lubistch's guidance, his slightly reserved suaveness and gentleman-like diffidence achieve an irresistible personal debonair which also is difficult to find at present. Sullavan, not quite a household name but in this film, her performance is exquisite, heartwarming, say, the ending, when she finally gets to know the man of her dream is her bickering partner in the shop, her psychologically-shocking-but-exhilaratingly-content transition is the killing of the film and saves the film from being an emotional overkill or worse, a stroke of bathos. Frank Morgan (afresh from THE WIZARD OF OZ 1939, 8/10) and Joseph Schildkraut both deliver excellent work as the credulous but kind-hearted shop owner and the sycophantic poseur in the shop respectively, pristine frills added to the main storyline. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, is a rare gem of its own kind, I highly doubt Lubitsch could excel himself in his canon, where I will burrow and wish me luck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was certainly the best of the 3 dealing with this subject matter of two people working in the same place who dislike each other intensely, not knowing that they are pen pals.This film isn't only about this but is about the interpersonal relationships of the workers at this Hungarian store.Frank Morgan gave a gem of a supporting performance as the difficult owner who is brought down to humility by the infidelity of his wife. Since Jimmy Stewart is the only employee who has been to his house, he discharges him erroneously, only to find that it's the cad played by Joseph Schildkraut, who has engaged in this unholy dalliance. The scene where Stewart throws Schildkraut out of the store is memorable.Margaret Sullavan along with Stewart provide the right chemistry here. A simple woman, but a fast talker and a wise, but unhappy lady, Sullavan etched an unforgettable character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Archetype of a Romantic Comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two employees at a gift shop can barely stand one another, without realizing that they are falling in love through the post as each other's anonymous pen pal.It is no secret that this film was remade as "You've Got Mail", with most of that film's audience being oblivious to this original. In fact, this movie could be said to be the archetype of romantic comedies. Sure, it was not the first... but I would dare say it is the best of its era.James Stewart never fails to delight, and he is here with his usual folksy charm. Margaret Sullavan, who I am otherwise unfamiliar with, is an excellent love interest and adversary. Why she is not a bigger name is unclear to me. (A quick search shows she did not do many films, and the only other I have seen is "Born Yesterday", which I hardly recall.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Christmas Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernst Lubitsch had a thing called "the Lubitsch touch", something which this film has in spades. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are perfect as a quarreling pair of co-workers at Matuschek's store in Budapest, Hungary. From the moment Sullavan's Klara Novak enters the shop around the corner, it's clear that she and Stewart's Alfred Kralik aren't going to be the best of friends. And with many quick lines of impeccable wit, a humorous tension soon boils. Meanwhile, of-course, some letters back and forth (unwittingly) between the two reflect a much different side to both lovesick leads. Alongside Stewart and Sullavan, Frank Morgan (The Wizard of Oz) gives an absolutely marvelous performance as the owner of the store, hurt and fragile as Christmas Eve approaches. With its setting of 1940 in Budapest, a rather difficult time economically, and its barely disguised feeling of despair amongst hope, this truly is a remarkable film that offers sack-fulls of touching moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart is always an asset to a movie. This one has a darned fine script which has been redone numerous times. Libitschs Direction is top notch too. Margaret Sullivan plays well with Stewart as the employee who falls in love with her boss.Frank Morgan heads a top support cast and everybody fits the roles they are cast in. The story is of Stewart working at a store &amp; becoming the store manager under owner Morgan. Before he does that O'Sullivan &amp; him are working together &amp; developing a great relationship until they have a fight over something insignificant.Then, they start exchanging pen pal letters, each not knowing who they are writing too though towards the end of the film Stewart figures out she is getting his letters. They fall in love reading those letters.The climax scene played just perfectly is a long dialog between Stewart &amp; O'Sullivan on Christmas Eve where he gives her the longest possible verbal trail to realize he is the man she is in love with, and that the feeling is mutual. It is one of the best verbal sparring climaxes ever put on film. She has put up so many road blocks from her fight with him that he has to take the most careful path ever to get the the happy ending.When it comes to this climax, both Sullivan &amp; Stewart play the encounter perfect. It is not often enough that the happy ending is so satisfying as in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Lubitsch film...one of the most perfect romantic comedies ever made....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lubitsch's charming THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER would have to be among the most perfect romantic comedies, nay, perfect films ever made. Lubitsch referred to the film as "absolutely the best thing I ever done" and, even though my Lubitsch education is a still a bit lacking, I am inclined to agree with the brilliant director. The film is wonderful in terms of acting (from both the two principals Sullavan and Stewart and the top-notch supporting cast, intelligent writing (it doesn't get much better or wittier than this)and a perfect narrative structure.We all know ten minutes in when Klara Novak (the lovely Miss Sullavan) walks into Matuschek's gift store and clerk Kralik's (Jimmy Stewart, in top form)life that these two will end up together. After all, it's a romantic comedy. But the sheer fun in this film, as with other pitch-perfect titles in the genre such as IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, is in getting there...The film is impossible to resist; romantics and cynics alike will be quickly won over by this great film. It is absolutely joyful to watch the goings-on in the Viennese gift store, with Lubitsch, as Goulding did in GRAND HOTEL, creating an entire milieu out of a single simple setting. Supporting actors such as Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart and William Tracy give the film much colour (and all get great lines), yet it is the pen-pal romance (the two clerks Stewart and Sullavan dislike each other-well, maybe are only just annoyed with each other-yet they are actually each other's "Dear Friend" on paper)between the two excellent leads that will leave you smiling long after the credits are over.An essential film, and it makes great holiday fare.</fullReview>

It's irresistible. It has been filmed at least three times, was one of Barbara Cook's great roles on Broadway. I think no one has ever failed with this little story. But touched by Lubitsch, it is entirely magical."She Loves Me", "In The Good Old Summertime" &amp; "You've Got Mail", all delight, but this version is the soul of the story. No one would want to miss Barbara Cook singing "Ice Cream". It's a pity they couldn't have written original songs for Judy Garland, and she was not at her freshest in "Good Old Summertime." But the story was still enthralling. It lends an innocence (innocent in a wicked, weary world) to anyone who plays the part.Anyone who loves film must see this Lubitsch version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is of course superfluous to praise this film any more than it has been already. One could only wish it to be shown more often as a replacement for the saccharine Stewart vehicle It's A Wonderful Life every Christmas. Faint hope.I am particularly impressed by the talent of director Lubitsch. Even though the actors themselves are superb in their portrayals of the various characters, it took a master's hand to generate the framing of scenes, the timing, and the little nuances of interaction we see here. Only Billy Wilder comes to mind as a similarly gifted director.Comparisons to the later Hanks-Ryan opus are as many have noted odious and inaccurate. Still, there is just enough there to suggest that the theme is universal and apt, whether as holiday fare or as straight romance. Substitute e-mail for tiny letter boxes.If I have any reservations this late in the day about a Hollywood production quaintly placed in a setting that was about to explode in real life, c'est la vie. One can easily ignore the very American dialogue and sensibilities juxtaposed against Hungarian signage, or for that matter the historical fact that Budapest was then under a fascist regime and on the edge of becoming a contributor to the Holocaust. This film must be judged on its own internal merits, which are considerable.Watch it every Christmas. You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film shows it's character's decency in his behavior towards his boss and in the fact that he isn't already hooked up with another girl, playing a game of toying with someone's heart by sending her love letters.The same is true for the female lead's character who imagines the letter writer as different from who he turns out to be, but isn't with another guy and looking for 'love on the side' Great give and take in the dialog back and forth between the two in this romantic comedy. It even dealt with issues that were ahead of it's time, such as attempted suicide.Sadly, the remake of this movie (trying to put it in the modern era) of "You Got Mail", the characters are about as different from the originals as you can get. Any similarity to this fine movie is purely coincidental.Would be interesting to read the play/book this was based on.</fullReview>

It's about the place where the two people work. It's very much about the owner of the business. It's about people, co-workers, friends, and enemies. It's about feelings, self-esteem, and of course, it is about romance. It's 99 minutes that will have you glued to your seat. It's a romantic comedy-drama, and there's even a little suspense thrown in.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie after watching the 1998 remake, "You've Got Mail," and was pleasantly surprised. In many ways, it is superior to the more recent offering. Although I can't understand why the movie was set in Budapest, Hungary with an all English-speaking cast that included Jimmy Stewart, the film captures the viewers' attention with interesting characters and a great story. I thought Stewart's performance as Alfred Kralik was outstanding, while Margaret Sullavan's work as Klara Novak seemed a bit stilted and unconvincing at times. The entire movie hinges on making the viewer believe that Klara can go from hating Alfred to accepting his offer of engagement in one scene. Sullavan doesn't quite pull it off, and the movie ends a bit too abruptly, but otherwise, this is an interesting show.</fullReview>

In fact I am surprised he didn't get a supporting actor that year instead of Walter Brennan for The Westerner.I mean, from his explaining the look of Stewarts pen pal ("if you don't like Mrs.Novack you won't like her""why not""because she is Mrs.Novack)to his response "who would do such a terrible thing" on learning a young brat was given the job of shop clerk. However, Bressart has many sentimental parts as well, and is more loyal than many friends are today. I would give my right arm(sarcastically)to have a pal like that.</fullReview>

In contrast to the Nora Ephron/Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan picture, "Shop" is not full of witty one-liners and hip 90's types. It is a straightforward love story with a twist, well played by the leads (James Stewart, Margaret Sullivan) and various character actors, including a kindly Frank Morgan. The plot is pretty well known by now - the leads don't get along at all, each believing they have the ideal partner in an anonymous correspondence. We think we know how it will all end, but it is carried forward beautifully. Mostly underplayed by the actors, it is a wonderful story, wonderfully depicted.

Each has its own identity and is not confused with the other. The plot is classic and universally understood and in that respect will never go out of style. Obviously it can be successfully placed in a contemporary setting, but the heart of the relationship between the two main characters should not be squeezed into the present day in such a manner that dilutes both the characters and the story, as was done so shamelessly in "You've Got Mail."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shop Around the Corner was a wonderful and unexpected surprise. The main plot between Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan was overtaken by the apparent subplot between and among the manager of the shop and his workers. This movie was produced in a more tender and sweeter time, with a much gentler sense of comedy, and the actors even seemed to be really participating in the show, not just acting like it. The choice of an Eastern European setting was very effective, especially the Budapest locale, a Hollywood version of Budapest it is true, but one which had not yet been ravaged and twisted by the horrors of World War II. The black and white format again helped in that the viewer wasn't distracted by the beauty or the color of the scenery, and could focus on the brilliance of the acting, which by the way, was evident among all the actors, not just the ones in the starring roles. I too fail to see much in common with the 1998 production of You've Got Mail, except for the actual mail element. Also, this movie was a much better and far more involved movie, with really credible acting.</fullReview>

On the other hand dark undertones, lurk beneath the surface. The protagonists in a variety of ways vie to deceive themselves about their position in life whilst trying to hold down a poorly paid job in the middle of a recession, simply to keep living.The two lovers to be make fantastical, successful, alter egos for themselves in their letters as extravagantly as Rudy acts up after his promotion. Meanwhile, Matuschek happily deludes himself to the point of ruin about his wife, pouring money via her into the dandy Vadas' jewelry box. The shop itself sells vanities to the affected middle classes epitomised by the musical cigarette boxes. Pirovitch alone is happy with his simple family life acting as a counterpoint to the self-deluding fantasies of the rest of the cast. This could be a set up for a tragedy, and indeed seems to be heading that way when Stewart looses his job and trades barbed comments with Sullivan. But we are offered the chance of redemption. Rudy saves Matuschek from the bullet, Vadas is uncovered (by perhaps an almost revelingly cruel Stewart) and we swing back into romance territory. The underpaid workers are happy selling their knick-knacks again, the tills ring for Christmas and romance fills the air, their salvation, or another happy deception?</fullReview>

I actually preferred this over the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan version. It is more believable that the two romantic leads can overcome their dislike for each other and fall in love. Also, Jimmy Stewart's character is much more likable than the one Tom Hanks plays in "You Got Mail." It is a shame that more people have not heard of this great Jimmy Stewart movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a 40s movie that isn't overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often I come across an old classic that deserves to be called that. While certainly not a masterpiece, this is an enjoyable, amusing old-school romantic comedy. The setting and the characters make it work. Jimmy Stewart is very good, and more assured and less of a stutterer this time around. The ending is not so much predictable as it is inevitable and a "must" in stories of this kind. What was predictable and obvious was that Morgan's wife is cheating on him and that he suspected Stewart while it was Schildkraut all along. (Then again, perhaps it was meant to be obvious.) The film doesn't cop out by throwing in some overly-dramatic twists to try to lull the viewer into sobbing uncontrollably; it remains light throughout. Even Morgan's attempted suicide isn't treated with doom and gloom. Though, I have to say, I was a little surprised how little disbelief Stewart showed when finding out that Sullavan is his pen pal; I mean, what are the odds of it?! He should have even been a bit suspicious; the woman comes to the shop, looking for a job, where, of all people, she bumps into him. Sullavan was a little more bewildered than Stewart when she found out, but I would have thrown in more amazement when the two were confronted with that strange fact.It's unusual that nearly all the last names are Slavic, whereas this is supposed to be in going on in Budapest.</fullReview>

Take Mr. Matuschek for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself. Not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of Stewart. (OK, weired example.) Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable. Yet still, I liked it a lot. If you liked Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful work by Lubitsch &amp; co</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see romantic comedies containing ridiculous premises - we've had them now with Hollywood for decades - but like so much in cinema what has to work is the execution. You could have a meet cute that involves two people meeting by accidentally bumping into each other and striking up a conversation about their dogs in 2016 (sound familiar at all?) and it could be a terrific, entertaining, engaging and artistically driven film if there's some heart behind it, if we can get behind the characters, and the actors and director are sympatico with how to add some humanity to the situation. Ernst Lubitch and Margararet Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart have that with Shop Around the Corner, and that's what counts.Hell, the movie may sound familiar because it IS now remade (1998's You've Got Mail): Klara gets a job through showing off a skill (apparently it is one) to sell an object like a music box to a newcomer to the owner of Matuschek's (Frank Morgan, Oz's Wizard in an apt role), and yet this doesn't sit well with Alfred, who can't stand the music box (mpph, he says, what if someone smokes 20 cigarettes a day, it'll get in their heads!) or maybe even her for that matter. But his animosity is also met by her's, and yet unbeknownst to each other they have a correspondence going with people they find "wonderful" and arrange some months after - it cuts ahead in time, it's fine - to finally meet. And of course they are writing to one another.So it's cute, it's precious maybe, but everything in this script is realistically drawn by Samson Raphaelson (from a play, and apparently it's why this takes place in Hungary for some reason or another). That is to say, no one really acts too much like an idiot (a common problem with today's rom-coms, when they do some out but you know what I mean), and there's even an element of sadness to the film, of things not working out for people and betrayal and mistrust. In a way it's as much about trust and belief in others as it is about love if not more-so, and a lot of this comes out in a sub-plot that makes the film as good as it is.What happens with this sub-plot? Well, Mr Matuschek is becoming more brusque with his employees as time goes on - he cares that things get sold and that his employees do things like stay after, just ONCE per year, to help set things up for Christmas - and it leads to an argument with Alfred that later in the same day results in Alfred being let go from the job. This isn't the kind of scene many might expect when coming to a screwball romantic comedy (and this isn't really screwball, but you also know what I mean). It's dealt with in a degree of reality, and that there's sadness to what's happened to Alfred and how Stewart and Morgan act the scene together when the boss tells him employee he's fired it's not something explosive or melodramatic, it's subtle and it cuts deep since we know there's this connection between the two going back years (Alfred being the oldest employee he has).And then there's Matuschek's marriage, which drives a lot of this sub-plot conflict, and it's not silly or meant for laughs. If anything the movie may lack some laughs in places, but there are enough that it satisfies as a comedy, if not *as* much as Trouble in Paradise or To Be or Not to Be (very different movies but also films dealing with romance and status in society). I think the real juggling act for Lubitsch here is to have this light tone, to have the kind of "ooh, I can't STAND you!" dynamic that Stewart and Sullivan have here - and I think Stewart is a better fit than in the other 1940 mega Rom-Com, The Philadelphia Story, which is possibly more entertaining overall but not as strong as a story - and there's that part of it, and then there's the dramatic parts. This is a business we're meant to take seriously as a place that Matuschek's made for his employees to feel like they're at home (with one exception, who I won't mention here but is revealed to be the sort of "heel" of the movie), and when this old man gets drama in his life it tears him apart despite his work life.I wish I could put into words what makes this movie so special, and I think that it's *because* that Lubitsch has this plot contrivance involving these two people and their correspondence, and how Alfred finds out first that Klara has been writing to him all along and he doesn't mention anything about it when he goes into that restaurant (only to let the tension and words and verbal aggression continue), that he has something to work with. It's fun to see this push and pull between the two, but then also how they naturally, mostly from Klara to Alfred, build attraction over the course of the story.So by the time it gets to that ending, it's not corny or cheesy, it's earned and emotional and it feels like a fable come true in some odd way. The Shop Around the Corner both reflects the economic uncertainty of the period (remember this is still pre WW2 and though it's Europe I'm sure it wasn't so different as in the US far as lack of work goes) and fulfills a good part of drama for how characters see one another and how misconceptions can drive things to a tipping point (and will one go over or not), and then also how a sweet romance can be concocted amid all of this. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This most agreeable Lubitsch-Raphaelson comedy has a great deal of charm. In fact it has more charm than humor, but don't let that worry you. Some of the running jokes and gags are really quite amusing. I particularly warmed to Felix Bressart's idea of giving his uncle an Old Tchoina music box. "It costs $2.95!" Bressart's character informs us. "But it's worth twice as much to ruin my uncle's Christmas!" I also delighted in Frank Morgan's "I don't know how Matuschek and Company can afford it!" and the wonderfully tart reply: "Well, if YOU don't know, Mr. Matuschek, your book-keeper must be keeping a lousy set of account books!"Yes, the super-lovely Margaret Sullavan and Jimmy Stewart make a great starring team, but it's the support cast, led by Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, Sara Haden, William Tracy, Inez Courtney and Charles Halton, that really make "The Shop Around the Corner" the outstanding entertainment that it is. True, Morgan does seem a little unsure how to say his lines, occasionally, but don't let that worry you. It's always appropriate for the character.Also on top of their respective forms: William Daniels for the delightfully crisp but moody photography, and Werner Heymann for his brilliant music score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a perfect and delightful movie. Jimmy Stewart actually plays to the role and gives one of his better performances. There is something whimsical yet simple about the story line of two people working in the same shop, and unbeknownst to the other, exchanging love letters. While engaged in the shop, they are antagonist, comparing each negatively to the fictional letters they receive.The story takes on a darker more ominous tone of despair and loneliness, highlighted by the Christmas season. (A darkness not so apparent in the musical remake of 1949 with Judy Garland and Van Johnson, "In the Good Old Summertime.")The writing is tight, the lines believable, the scenario plausible. And the love story charming. This is a delightful and charming movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Festive atmosphere flavored family drama, spontaneous love, heartfelt comedy and healthy humor. Director Lubitsch's film spice with warm and everyday human subjects. ?THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER" is a pleasant place with a lot of respect and charm. The film is a bit slow. I think that this approach is intentional, because this looks more realistic. The story is more or less everyday. The love affair or the love of the main character are strange spices in the story. Both changes in the daily routine of the protagonists and their views on life. Lonely hearts connected a piece of paper. True. It is fascinating to watch how the director deftly mixes comedy, drama and romance. In this film does not lose the thread, the atmosphere remains the same and only the changing characters. Characterization of the characters is very interesting. Frank Morgan as Hugo Matuschek owns the shop and he is benevolent dictator. James Stewart as Alfred Kralik is a workaholic and a perfectionist and very lonely character who is difficult to adapt. Margaret Sullavan as Klara Novak is safe but lonely. The woman in which the conflict her own and outer world. Felix Bressart as Pirovitch, the man who in life has two stations. Work and family. Two of the greatest love and the two biggest fear. A friend in need. The voice of reason and peace.The film that appeals to the Christmas atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Jimmy Stewart Christmas Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shop Around the Corner was the first Ernst Lubitsch film I saw, and as soon as the characters started interacting with each other I instantly knew this was a guy who knew how to handle dialogue, in what is referred to as the so called 'Lubitsch Touch'. With such levels of subtly, this is the kind of movie that needs to be watched multiple times, and gets better every time you do so. Often there will be a verbal joke, unaware it even is a joke and it will take a few seconds to catch onto it. Most of Lubitsch's films where set in Europe as this was where he was from. The shop of Shop Around the Corner is in Budapest, Hungary. The world this movie is set was on the brink of destruction in 1940, but there is no mention of this in the film. Just like the how the film hearkens back to a more peaceful time, it also acts like a nostalgia portal to a time before the internet or big corporate businesses. A shop which is a physical, hands on and above all, communal experience. The shop is a world onto its own populated by unforgettable characters.Most of Margaret Sullavan's movies also took place in Europe, I don't know of the reason for this however; a big coincidence or did she deliberately choose to star in movies with European settings? James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan aren't remotely Hungarian, but classic Hollywood movies aren't exactly known for their realism in this regard. I also find it humorous how Klara is able to get a job with such ease, if only it were that easy in real life! The Shop Around the Corner is one of the prime examples of the classic "they hate each other but are really in love", in fact they really hate each other. Stewart's Alfred Kralik is actually a real asshole; he's brash and very opinionated. Margaret Sullavan isn't a sexy, glamorous Hollywood star; Klara Novak is a down to Earth, intellectual. As the movie progresses you so badly want these two characters to end up together to the point that it hurts. These aren't two performers with great chemistry, these are two performers with incredible lifelike chemistry which blends the dividing line between fiction and reality. If ever there was an on screen couple how where made for each other, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the wide range of the Lubitsch touch, The Shop Around The Corner most certainly falls more deeply in the romance category than the comedic side, represented by his other masterpieces like To Be Or Not To Be. As another reviewer said, this is one of the saddest romantic comedies around, but we'll all be happy to know that the screenwriter couldn't help but put in a few clever quips that Lubitsch is so wonderfully known for. The script could easily be one of the tightest scripts of all time, and it is admirable how much mileage they get out of a single room and few relationships. I highly suggest this film to anyone who finds joy in simple stories made fun through the sheer mastery of the craft of film.</fullReview>

Very 'modern' for a 1940 film.

		<fullReview>Otherwise known as the inspiration for the 90s Hanks/Ryan vehicle You've Got Mail, it's a little hard for us kids of the 21st Century to imagine how the concept is done through snail mail. But I shouldn't underestimate the economy of Ernst Lubitsch who skims through time and teases what's happened offscreen and keeps his sequences tightly under wraps with big events occurring within a scene. Only Lubitsch could make James Stewart a despicable person, balanced out by Stewart's natural likability. I wanted to like The Shop Around The Corner more given that it's very popular among those who made it but maybe it'll grow on me. I did love its idea of love not being superficial. Warmed my heart by its end. I'm falling for Lubitsch.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good things: faultless ensemble playing; superb photography, costumes and set dressing; excellent script; perfect pacing, both within scenes and overall. Not-so-good things? Can't think of any.Although the film, in deference to the play on which it is based, is set in Budapest, its themes are eternally human. As is so often the case, emphasis on a particular locality has the paradoxical effect of heightening general truths. It's this that has enabled this wonderful piece to be turned into two musicals and be updated to the digital age with equal success.It does concern me that the sheer joy of this movie might become less appreciated as the years go by. It takes effort to look into films headlined by stars such as Sullavan and directors such as Lubitsch, whose names are not, let's face it, as prominent as they were in their own day. An even worse fate could befall, and perhaps already has befallen, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, described on my DVD cover as 'the original of YOU'VE GOT MAIL.' In this case, whatever might be said positively about the update, the original is better, by a long, long way. Lubitsch's film is a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find myself having to see this film every Christmas season. I am never disappointed - even though I know the drift. But that's the sign of a great film - you always delight in something new each time you see it. And these are characters you grow to love so much you want to be in their company, so to speak, every year - they're like old friends you missed and have to see again. This movie has humor and pathos, a wide range of emotions, and though it's ostensibly a comedy, it's also a romantic film and one that speaks of the human condition. In other words, it works on many levels. And all of the many brilliant actors in this film shine brightly. It's one of Jimmy Stewart's, Frank Morgan's, Felix Bressart's and Joseph Schildkraut's best - and perhaps Margaret Sullavan's very best (her comic timing is brilliant). And the other character players are lovable and brilliant, too - especially William Tracy as "Pepi." Sad that so many of them came to tragic ends or died fairly young in real life. What a great cast and sweet, touching story! And this is also one of those great old films where wit was in abundance.</fullReview>

It's mostly a romantic comedy (and one of the pinnacles of the genre) but it also has a darker side. The subplot about Frank Morgan's adulterous wife runs throughout the film and adds a dramatic layer to things. It's a wonderfully written and expertly directed movie. Stewart, Sullavan, and Morgan head a phenomenal cast that includes Sara Haden and the always affable Felix Bressart. A film that is definitely on my list of the best films of all time.

		<fullReview>One of Ernst Lubitsch's finest comedies, "The Shop Around the Corner" is a 1940 classic which takes places in a Budapest gift shop. The inspiration for the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan vehicle "You've Got Mail", the film watches as two employees, Klara Novak and Alfred Kralick, repeatedly bicker. Unbeknownst to both, they're also madly in love with each other, having been anonymous pen-pals for several months. Will their romance finally break free of the post office? In a way, it doesn't matter. Lubitsch is all about tone and style. A director with a gift for a certain velvety sophistication, he treats us to some wonderfully sharp back-and-forth banter, a gang of likable characters, and turns the film's chief location, a bourgeois shop owned by the paternalist Mr Matuschek, into a romantic alcove with its own little family dynamics. There's shop-boy Pepi, actors Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart as our romantic duo (they'd work together in 4 films), and a cast of European-born Jewish actors ( Joseph Schildkraut, Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart), all of whom play likable shop employees. Throw in much Christmas-time ambiance and you have a film which practically glows.Of course you couldn't make a film like this today (love at Walmart?). "The Shop Around the Corner" hinges on a very specific type of nostalgia, relies on a certain naiveté and hearkens back to a time when business meant family, corporate expansion meant buying a doorbell and all monetary transactions were seen as being inherently beneficial to any and all fellow-men. Such thinking is offensive today. To Lubitsch, though, the film's nostalgia means something else. It marks a world now lost and hidden "around the corner". A lamentation for the Germany he left behind, and a Europe which was changing come the the Second World War, Mr Matuschek's shop represents a place and time the Jewish Berliner recognises as having vanished. Perhaps this is why, though the film ends on a happy note, it ultimately leaves one with a keen sense of loss.Billy Wilder, another writer/director who had a way with words, adored Lubitsch, and had the phrase "What would Lubitsch do?" stencilled on his office doors. Today, modern audiences seem to have forgotten Lubitsch. "The Shop Around the Corner" still gets a lot of airplay, though, perhaps thanks to the always lovable Jimmy Stewart.9/10 ? Makes a good companion piece to Vincente Miennelli's "The Clock". For the pessimistically inclined, see "The Shop On Main Street" and "The Pawnbroker".</fullReview>

Some of the exchanges between Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are priceless and had me laughing out loud. Very well acted and directed throughout. The main oddity about this film is that it takes place in Budapest for some reason. The location has nothing to do with the story. It could have easily been set in Los Angeles or London and it wouldn't have mattered a drop. That one quirk does not detract from the film at all - just an interesting note (likely the result of the original stage play). The only reason I gave this a 9 instead of a 10 was that the ending was a little flat - especially with the big buildup that precedes it. All in all a real classic though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first class romantic comedy with James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan stored together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people consider this a delightful romantic comedy and a great Christmas movie. I agree with the first part but I certainly didn't get any particular festive feeling from the thing (despite the events taking place on the run up to Christmas).Based on a Hungarian play by Miklos Laszlo, the movie takes place in a store in Budapest. But you can just forget about that as a few American stars go about the important business of sparking off one another and providing some great laughs.James Stewart is Alfred Kralik, the top employee at the store run by Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan). All seems to be well, despite Alfred having his feathers ruffled by a new employee, Klara Novak (played by Margaret Sullavan).Alfred and Klara just don't seem to like each other at all but, unbeknownst to either of them, each has fallen in love with the other through a series of anonymous letters they have been sending to each other. The correspondence is intelligent, warm and witty and, apparently, the complete opposite of how the pair interact with each other when face to face. Tension rises but there's something else going on that Mr. Matuschek seems reticent to share - something that could endanger Alfred's position and guarantee that he never "meets" his anonymous female letter writer.Directed by Ernst Lubitsch, with a great screenplay by Samson Raphaelson, The Shop Around The Corner is yet another example of those classic movies they just can't really make any more. A film in which people hope a first proper date will end in an official engagement. A film in which some people act deceitful (for both good and bad reasons) and yet nobody really needs to have any major punishment doled out to them, even though at least one character is someone you hope to see getting a bigger comeuppance.The performances are wonderful. James Stewart is great, Margaret Sullavan is great and both benefit from some fantastic lines of dialogue. Frank Morgan is very good, Felix Bressart raises a smile or two and William Tracy steals many of the scenes that he's in as Peppi. and then there is Joseph Schildkraut as Ferencz Vadas, someone you can enjoy disliking.Remade more than once, modern audiences may identify the plot as similar to the one utilised in You've Got Mail. That movie was, in my opinion, fairly enjoyable and had the benefit of another great team up for Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. But, as is so often the case, the original remains the best.</fullReview>

I also realized that Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were incapable of making any movie together other than "Sleepless in Seattle".I realize making a connection between YGM and SiS is reaching but there is no mistaking the obvious. YGM was a direct copy of ItGOS. I was not aware that there was a precursor, until now. Being a musical lover I was quite content to stay with Judy Garland and Van Johnson but I also will watch anything with James Stewart. The title drew me in enough to find out what it was about. When I found I knew the storyline (which I like) and that James Stewart was the lead I had to see it.It is a charming story and with the right actors it can be beautifully told. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were superb. So, for that matter, were Garland and Johnson. Ryan and Hanks left much to be desired; they don't have the right chemistry for such a plot.I now wonder if there is an even earlier version of the same story. The hunt is on.</fullReview>

This, not the maudlin "It's a Wonderful Life," is the annual must-see Jimmy Stewart Christmas movie.Note: The remake, "You've Got Mail," is an abomination that completely misreads and distorts the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Christmas comedy right around the corner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many folks who've seen "You've Got Mail", I'd heard of "The Restaurant Around the Corner", but had never gotten around to seeing it until Christmas Eve, when it ran on TCM. What a gem! The hallmark of a great old movie, like a jazz or country album, is not the headliners but the supporting cast. Jimmy Stewart is so, well, Stewartesque as the senior employee of Matuschek and company, a gift shop anticipating a busy Christmas, and Frank Morgan, his boss, makes you forget all about The Wizard of Oz and almost convinced me that rich people really are worse off than those who have to work for them, when he suspects his wife of an affair with one of his employees. Margaret Sullavan stirs the shop's crew when she manages to sell a hard-to-move item to one of the shop's hardest customers, and she and Stewart create a delicious love/hate relationship that was imitated, not matched, by Ryan and Hanks decades later. The cast includes Sir Joseph Schildkraut, one of the earliest Oscar-winning supporting actors, and his role as Vadas, a co-worker to Stewart, is marvelous; at once mousy (whenever he hears the boss asking for an "honest opinion", he disappears as if the building is on fire) and fatherly, offering both Stewart and Sullavan advice on their love lives. The rest of the supporting cast is not as well known as the leads, but equally as delightful. Grace Hayle (not even credited) plays "plump woman" for perhaps the 100th time in her prolific career as a character actress. The movie exhibits the "Lubitsch touch", and sixty years after its release it still has moments that will make you laugh out loud. If you aren't used to watching movies from the 30s and 40s, you might not be used to the long sequences that, today, would be accompanied by soundtracks; likewise, some of the entrances and exits (walking into the scene after the camera has started) may appear dated. But that is part of the film's charm, for me at any rate.I'm sorry it's taken me so long to discover this happy little movie. Look for it year round, or at Christmastime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet and amusing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once you get over the fact that thought the movie is set in Vienna and all of the characters have Austrian-sounding names -- but everyone speaks in English (some accented and some not) -- the story is almost too cute for words; but in a nice way. It's a twist on the now standard, boy meets girl; boy likes girl; girls dislikes boy; girl and boy get together and live . . . you get the picture. The performances by Stewart and Sullivan and the pacing of the movie take you beyond all that and make you root like crazy for boy and girl.This movie is a classic, and deservedly so, in spite of its very ordinary premise. The whole is a lot more than the sum of the parts in this gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another one of those films which could be called a "minor classic". The story is timeless (with echoes of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol") and the performances are sympathetic, but it's too much like the play it was based on to make it a true classic. Having lived in Hungary it's weird seeing Hungarian signs and hearing Hungarian names in a Hollywood movie, and that adds something extra to my enjoyment of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly nice romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1940, 5 years before I was born. This movie is a nice example of a good romantic comedy at a time when we were more civilized. No sex, no bad language, just an interesting script and good acting. Set in Budapest, it is the same story that made it to Broadway, and also was turned later into "You've Got Mail" with Hanks and Ryan. Already a movie veteran and nearing age 30, James Stewart is Alfred Kralik, trusted salesman and assistant manager in the little "Shop Around The Corner." But he has figured out he needs more than just work, so he begins to correspond with a local pen pal. About this time Margaret Sullavan, also a movie veteran nearing 30, as Klara Novak shows up in the shop, she desperately needs a job, and manages to talk herself into one as a sales person. It is nearing Christmas so they probably needed some help.The big boss is Frank Morgan (of Wizard in Wizard of Oz fame) Hugo Matuschek. He owns the company and runs a tight ship. Everyone seems afraid of him, always deferring to his opinions, except Kralik, who always tells him what he thinks. My favorite in this movie is William Tracy as the young messenger boy Pepi Katona, always efficient and eventually talks himself also into a sales job in the shop.SPOILERS FOLLOW: We figure out pretty quickly that the two anonymous letter-writers are Kralik and Novak, but they have no idea. In fact, they generate interpersonal friction early and appear to detest each other. But the letters tell a different story, and they each begin to fall in love with the other letter writer. Kralik gets fired, because of a misunderstanding. The boss thinks he is cheating with his wife. But the real news puts the boss in the hospital for a few weeks, during which Kralik is re-hired as manager and the Christmas season turns out to be one of the shop's best ever. In the last scene Novak finds out Kralik is the letter writer, they embrace, they will marry and live happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unparalleled Lubitsch Touch in a Genuine Romantic Comedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernst Lubitsch was a master of the unexpected comedy element, something so idiosyncratic that it defies serious explanation. This charming 1940 classic epitomizes his style so well that the subsequent remakes appear either marginally pointless (the musical 1949 version, "In the Good Old Summertime") or excruciatingly formulaic (1998's e-mail update, "You've Got Mail"). This is a wondrous and gentle romantic comedy starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan.Written by Samson Raphaelson, the soufflé-light plot involves the staff at Matuschek &amp; Company, a Budapest leather goods emporium run by its curmudgeonly namesake. Head clerk Alfred Kralik is on the management track when Klara Novak impresses Matuschek enough to get hired as a new sales clerk. Inevitably, Alfred and Klara are at odds with each other from the start, but we discover they are also unwitting pen-pals who are falling in love without having met. Meanwhile, Matuschek suspects his wife of having an affair and suspects Alfred, whom he immediately terminates. When it turns out not to be Alfred but his despised co-worker, the bootlicking toady Ferencz Vadas, Matuschek commits a desperate act which forces Alfred to become the interim store manager. The busy Christmas season provides the appropriate setting to resolve all the plot strands.What strikes me most about the film is not the actual storyline, which borders on predictable and contrived upon closer inspection, but the way Lubitsch and the cast bring it to life in such subtly memorable ways. Young and assured, Stewart gives one of my favorite of his performances as Alfred, and with her buttery speaking voice, Sullavan provides the perfect match as Klara. Their chemistry is palpable and makes the subsequent remakes feel comparatively pallid. The Wizard himself, Frank Morgan portrays Matuschek with alternate bluster and poignancy. The other players also make vivid impressions, in particular, Lubitsch regular Felix Bressart as the timid Pirovitch, a cast-against-type Joseph Schildkraut as the slimy Vadas, and William Tracy as the resourceful errand boy Pepi. The print transfer on the 2002 DVD is blessedly clean, and there are two extras offered, the original theatrical trailer and a 1940 short, "The Miracle of Sound" about the impact of the sound revolution at MGM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shop Around the Corner, The (1940) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Charming romantic comedy has co-workers (Margaret Sullavan, James Stewart) constantly arguing at work but what they don't know is that they are falling in love via penpals. This is actually the first "big" Lubitsch film I've actually watched as he's a director I haven't really gotten into yet but that'll certainly change after viewing this film. The direction here is incredibly strong and I really enjoyed the way Lubitsch kept the story going without getting everything too complicated or more difficult than it had to be. The pacing of the storytelling was wonderfully done as well. The big key to the film is the chemistry between Sullavan and Stewart who are wonderful together. Whenever they're fighting it comes off very funny and charming and the romantic scenes come off exactly as they should. Frank Morgan is terrific as their boss and William Tracy does a nice job as an arrant boy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen 'You've Got Mail' (I found 'You've Got Mail' to be a good remake), then you will understand the plot of this movie as this is the original. The story revolves around the shop around the corner - being "Matuschek's" and all the employees there. The owner, played by Frank Morgan is a likable chap despite his harsh temper at times. Then there is Mr Kralik, played by James Stewart, who is in love with a woman who has been corresponding with via letters... who he's never met. He has been there for nine years and is one of the most beloved employees... until Klara Novak (Maragret Sullavan) comes along! I was very surprised at how much I was laughing in this movie - there are some very cute and heart warming moments. I didn't think it would be this good, and completely exceeded my expectations. There is a timeless feeling of the characters, in fact the whole movie. I like how the romance subtly develops, and you can see it. There are truly beautiful performances all around - by every one of the cast. This sets the standard for every movie in this era and is, no doubt, superior to its remakes. A very beautiful movie, perfect for Christmas time. Film-making at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan, this story is what "You've Got Mail" is based on. Only this is much better.For one thing, there's no profanity. For another, it has my favorite actor, James Stewart.Alfred Kralik (Stewart) and Klara Novak (Sullivan) know each other by both mail and real life. By letter, they're in love. By real life, they loath each other.Alfred's boss (Frank Morgan, "The Wizard of Oz") thinks that Alfred is after his wife. So he fires Allfred, but then he gets sick, so he tells Alfred that he's the new manager. Meanwhile, Alfred and Klara find out that they secretly love each other.I have only seen this movie once, and that was over a year ago, so I don't remember the exact ending. But if you like Jimmy Stewart, you'll love this movie.My Score: 8/10.</fullReview>

But....no. More tentative romance with the two former pen pals.</fullReview>

This is one I just can't help but watch when it comes on TCM (which is fairly often). It's the original based off of the play; don't be thrown by the fact that it's set in Hungary. The star name you'll recognize is Jimmy Stewart but you'll see other familiar faces (ex. the Wizard of Oz). For the modern viewer, it's the same basic plot as that in "You've Got Mail," with the pen pal romance and in-person conflict though the heroes are co-workers. It's simple but charming with clever banter. Great for lazy weekend afternoon!</fullReview>

The photography is exceptional, and Lubitsch's direction as always is finely balanced. He always gives you just enough and not too much, whether it be "corn" or drama or anything.Stewart is also very good in the role, I was surprised he could play so "young".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ernst Lubitsch comedy, adapted from the play "Parfumerie" by Nikolaus Laszlo, involves two sour gift-shop workers (in Budapest, Hungary!) who are unknowingly each other's secret romantic pen-pal. Despite the odd locale, a blithe, easy romantic comedy, well-tailored for stars James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. Director Lubitsch never strains for big laughs; true, he doesn't get them, but instead he strives for a more gentle type of comedy with humor deriving from character development and situation--not jokes. Quite appealing; remade in 1949 as "In The Good Old Summertime", staged as the musical "She Loves Me", and remade yet again in 1998 as "You've Got Mail". **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm a Lubitsch fan, but not a fan of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a passion for the great movies and stars of early Hollywood, and at this point I have seen many dozens (possibly hundreds) of gems from the '30s and '40s. Ernst Lubitsch is one of my favorite directors, yet somehow I have just gotten around to watching this highly touted movie. I'll admit upfront that I have never been a James Stewart fan, though I don't deny the greatness of films like Rear Window, Vertigo, Anatomy of a Murder, ... (the list could go on and on). I was expecting to be similarly impressed with this movie, given all that has been said about it. Instead, it left me cold.The story is a little silly, but that didn't bother me in The Merry Widow or The Smiling Lieutenant. The acting was very good, but I was thinking throughout the movie that I would have liked it better with two different leads. As a whole, it just didn't click for me, and I have no desire to see it again. For me, the two movies mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph, along with Trouble in Paradise and Ninotchka, are far superior examples of "the Lubitsch touch". One fan's opinion.</fullReview>

While the stories are very similar, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER deals with such topics as attempted suicide and infidelity!! How this is NOT to say that it's a bad movie--just VERY different in tone. Many may find the original film better, but I guess I am just an old softy and like the bouncier remake. Both are excellent and you should see them both.Now, concerning the recent remake with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (YOU'VE GOT MAIL), I do not recommend it.

This movie is so rich with such a wide range of characters, and I think the casting choices were superb.The main problem I have with the film however, is the whole Budapest angle. Not a single person speaks with an accent and are all very American. But yet all the signs in the shop are written in Hungarian ( I presume). But not a single customer coming in the shop speaks a foreign language or even has an accent. Perhaps this was characteristic of movies of that day, but I found it distracting. Why not rewrite it as taking place in New York, or Chicago, or Wichita for that matter.A very good film - a must see for any Stewart fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart gives a sweet, captivating performance as the head salesman of a small-owned bookstore just around the corner in Budapest, Hungary. Margaret Sullivan plays the newest addition to the store's crew and soon these two idealistic young folks begin to contradict each other every time they speak. However, what they don't know is that they have written many letters to each other secretly, not knowing who the other person is but falling for them anyways.As much as I liked the story, and it is so much better than the 1998 remake You've Got Mail, I felt it wasn't one of the best Ernst Lubitsch efforts. It certainly doesn't have the charm or irresistible properties of some of his earlier films and this story is one of the darkest of romantic comedies I have ever seen. Still, with all due respect, Stewart is one of the greatest actors to ever live and the supporting cast is wonderful with Frank Morgan as the store owner and Felix Bressart as Pirovitch. All in all, this has more heart and soul than any of its successors, but I think there is not enough Lubitsch here to make it an absolute classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Purely comical orientated movies weren't a that common thing in the '40's. it makes this movie an all the more refreshing and delightful one.It's a simple movie, with a simple story, that at all times is kept pleasant to watch. But that doesn't mean that the story is not a well written one. Often though of course most elements in it are generic and predictable, it is still all brought in a fresh way, which makes the movie still original enough in its genre and definitely for its time. The dialog is especially well written, as you would expect from a '40's movie, when writers understood their craft. It even in the end has a great Christmas spirit in it, which adds all the more to the pleasant warm feeling of the movie.To me it seemed pretty redundant though that the movie was set in Hungary. It added nothing to the story or characters and worked only confusing, since the characters all had Hungarian names but of course were all talking in plain English. I understand they let this movie take place in Hungary because it was based on an Hungarian play but movie-wise it didn't added anything. This was something the later movie versions of the play "In the Good Old Summertime" and "You've Got Mail" understood.James Stewart wasn't really known for his leading comical or romantic roles, so his role in this movie is quite surprising and he does a good job at it as well. He still looked so very young in this and in his first scene I didn't even realized it was him, simply because I didn't recognized him. The rest of the cast isn't that well known but the movie is filled with many and delightful characters, that are by no means standard or one dimensional. The many characters within the movie definitely adds to the movie its fun.It's not the sort of comedy that will make you laugh out loud but it's more the sort of movie that will put a smile on your face, all the way through. 8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The chemistry between Stewart and Margaret Sullavan was clear to see and improved the impact of the film dramatically. William Tracy and Joseph Schildkraut stood out as particularly impressive members of the supporting cast. Another enjoyable film that doesn't require too much thought.

		<fullReview>This is a film, in which it is really difficult to write a comment without a spoiler, as after first twenty minutes you already know the end. There is no real plot and characters (not actors) are pale. Of course one has to admit that in the time film was made audience was not bombarded with extraordinary plots with breathtaking resolutions, nevertheless the story is plot-less even for these old standards.Of course, the whole film, scenes, directing and acting is done perfectly, but the talents of director and actors are wasted on a bad screenplay. The story remains alive by the unbelievable virtue that one of the characters just don't get it - and we are not talking about a stupid person. There is no psychological aspect presented and it is quite unclear, what is the point of the story - is it better to get in love over the correspondence or in live? There is only few instances of humor and no film music worth mentioning (except for a lead tune, which is a well-known Gypsy song).So, if you are looking for a Christmas or easy rest-your-mind-and-reason film, this is a right choice. You definitely do not want to watch it two times in a row, because there is absolutely nothing below the surface of the superficial story. Relatively high mark is only due to excellent craftsmanship of the director and actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honestly not as good as I had hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shop Around the Corner" has one of the greatest plots for a romantic comedy ever. You know it already if you'll seen the remake, "You've Got Mail." A man and woman who dislike each other in person are unknowingly corresponding to each other as pen pals and are falling in love with someone they think they've never met. Being that "You've Got Mail," is one of my favorite romance comedies of all time, I expected that I would love this film as well. Unfortunately, this version did not work as well as I would have liked. Unlike the remake, this film does not keep us and the main characters in suspense, waiting and wishing for them to finally fall in love. Several subplots also put burdens on the light-hearted nature the film should have, as the remake did. The film has too many upsetting moments, such as job losses, nervous breakdowns, and Jimmy Stewart's boss (Frank Morgan, the Wizard of "Wizard of Oz") learning his wife is having an affair. I prefer this film as the fun, romantic story it turned out to be in the remake. Jimmy Stewart and Margret Sullivan make excellent stars, but the supporting cast is not as good or appealing as I would like. If you don't mind a romantic story like this mixed in with more serious moments, you will probably enjoy this. If you want a more carefree and romantic film, as I did, this one may not be for you. Enjoyable at times, but fairly disappointing for me.Nevertheless, *** out of ****</fullReview>

Fortunately there's James Stewart and he is perfect for that role. The plot itsef is very good (Tom Hanks could send e-mails to his neighbor, a simple-minded gay castaway on the Web) and the supporting actors are quite good. Still the narration is not so nimble as it should have been all along. Sometimes the quality of simplicity you'd never deny for those movies (comedies of the 30s-40s) appears more like a flaw.

		<shortDescription>It was ok..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was ok but not the best. Jimmy Stewart gives a good performance but I really wasn't impressed with Sullavan. She seemed to be whining for most of the film. The other charactors were pretty good. It drags at times but overall it's a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, except for Margaret Sullavan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that keeps this movie from being completely satisfying is Margaret Sullavan. She has absolutely no sex appeal, and very little anything-else appeal. Jimmy Stewart is wonderful and of course any girl would fall for him, but poor Margaret can't come across as anything but a snide brat. Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Sara Haden, Joseph Shildkraut, and William Tracy are all perfect in their supporting roles.The musical version of this film "In the Good Old Summertime" with Van Johnson and Judy Garland is far superior in every way, despite the odd title. However, "Shop Around the Corner" itself is far superior to "You've Got Mail," a dreary, lengthy, rather mean-spirited copy.Point of interest: Look for Charles Smith as Rudy, the new delivery boy, at the end of the film. Mr. Smith also appeared, uncredited, in "The Good Old Summertime" as the youngest and tallest member of the mustachioed barbershop quartet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, though I prefer the Tom Hanks version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shop Around the Corner" is the movie on which the Tom Hanks / Meg Ryan film, "You've Got Mail" is based. My wife and I enjoyed the Hanks film a great deal and, as I am a big fan of Jimmy Stewart, I expected to like the original even more. Alas, in this I was disappointed. Stewart is excellent as Alfred Kralik and Margaret Sullivan makes a good foil for his efforts as Klara Novak, but overall the movie falls short of what it could have been. There are really two stories going on in this movie: Kralik's anonymous postbox relationship with Klara Novak, and Kralik's pseudo father/son relationship with his employer, Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan). This means that the script must make room for both stories, the result of which is that neither is as fully developed as it could be. This is most evident at the end, when we learn -- in what comes off as a very artificial rush -- that Klara has been attracted to Alfred all along and was (supposedly) faking her dislike for him as a means of attracting his attention. This Deus-ex-machina contrivance is necessary in order to produce the required Happy Ending when Alfred reveals to Klara that he is the letter writer whom she has pined over.Nora Ephron's adaptation of this story avoids this pitfall by sticking with only one story -- the two-sided relationship between the Hanks and Ryan. She was thus able to permit Meg Ryan's character much more time to change her view of Hanks, and Hanks more time to woo her to that changed point of view. The result was a more believable Happy Ending (to the extent, of course, that any Hollywood Happy Endings are believable!).I also found the supposed setting (pre-war Budapest) to be a similar contrivance. As a Hungarian, Miklos Laszlo's decision to set the play in pre-war Budapest is understandable. But when the movie was cast with the all-American stars Stewart, Sullivan, and Morgan, a New York or Chicago setting would have been much more credible.Disappointment aside, though, this is still a fun film to watch. As I said at the beginning, Jimmy Stewart acts with his usual brilliance, and Margaret Sullivan and Frank Morgan complement him very well. So do go ahead and get this on DVD if you are a Jimmy Stewart fan or a lover of romantic comedies. The Shop Around the Corner is not perfect, but it is pleasant. I, for one, like pleasant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but there are better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shop Around the Corner" is a good film. I love the story which has been used in 2 other movies to follow. But out of the three movies(Shop Around The Corner, In The Good Old Summertime, You've Got Mail) I like this one the least. Stewart gives a good performance as usual but Sullivan who plays the girl isn't that appealing. At some points she gets so annoying and whiny that you almost hope they don't end up together. The supporting cast gives good laughs and keeps you entertained most of the time. This movie does have more plot than the other two and the supporting characters are not just "window dressing". It's a good film, worth seeing if you have the time, but definitely check out the other two versions and make your own judgment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as good as I expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing all the raves about this "definitive" version of the story, and having enjoyed the musical remakes (IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME and the Broadway musical SHE LOVES ME), I was let down when I actually sat down and watched the whole film on TCM the other night.First of all, let me explain I'm not a MARGARET SULLAVAN fan. She always strikes me as a drab looking little creature--notwithstanding a certain amount of charm--but nonetheless not a movie star I really care about. On the other hand, JAMES STEWART is terrific here. His restrained skill in romantic comedy is never put to better use than he does with the role as the love-smitten clerk who doesn't realize the girl he works with is sharing his pen pal letters.I had trouble with the clunky screenplay that veered off in the direction of dramatics at unexpected moments--pertaining to the Frank Morgan character. And the Joseph Schildkraut character comes across as a complete puzzlement--never adequately motivated or explained by the script.Frankly, I much prefer both musical versions that I've seen. And YOU'VE GOT MAIL wasn't bad either. At least the musicals played both leading roles for comic effect. Here Sullavan is much too earnest and plain to be appealing in the role.Of course I know this film has its admirers and they're all probably shaking their heads in disbelief at my review. But this is my impression of the film after hearing about it for years. The chief asset is James Stewart's effortless performance and Felix Bressart adding a great deal of warmth as a fellow clerk who avoids offering an opinion to the boss. Frank Morgan is not as lovable as usual in an ill conceived role and William Tracy is completely over the top as an ambitious errand boy promoted to clerk.Summing up: Could have been so much better since it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch who was supposed to have "that touch" with comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>desperate and mean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is composed of a bad start and a weak ending, which frame about 35 minutes of actual enjoyment. The first hour is a catalog of hostile and desperate workplace unpleasantness, and that's letting it off very easy. After that comes a revelation (not who the pen pals are) that makes certain awful people slightly more human and causes some trailing effects (Pepe making salesperson) that are funny and interesting. Then it ends with Stewart executing a fairly cruel subterfuge and Sullivan having to hastily accept him because the movie is rapidly running out of time; structurally, it's off the rails. If all you care about is that an improbable happy ending arrives in the final three seconds of a movie, this might satisfy you. I was not amused by the cheap, crappy resolution of the movie's entire premise. It's a cop-out.The bizarre choice to leave the movie's setting in Hungary, with no impact whatsoever on any other aspect of the movie is a head scratcher. The movie is pure and straight 1930s Hollywood. This material was also unappealing when it was remade as the musical 'In the Good Old Summertime' with Judy Garland and Van Johnson.</fullReview>
