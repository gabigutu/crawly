		<shortDescription>Bedroom Problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the "Bedroom Comedies" of the 50's &amp; 60's this is the best by far. Nothing else comes close to "Pillow Talk" with its witty script, stylish sets, and costumes and a great cast of "A" actors at their very best. Some movies wrap you up like a warm mink coat and make everything seem right in the world. 1950's New York looks fabulous, and I've always wanted to go one of those chic supper clubs decked out like Doris is here. This is one of those rare movies that make you laugh, no matter how many times you've seen it. How sad it is for some reviewers to take fault with Alma and her apparent drinking problem (only to find love herself and throw away the bottle!) or Rock's sexuality that some just can't get past. This is an elegant romp with Doris and Rock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy to aid the sick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there I was, in my sick-bed when this film comes on. I start to watch, having never seen it before, and to my surprise, find myself laughing...out loud. I have never really been a fan of either Doris Day or Rock Hudson, but I did enjoy this piece of fluff. And in our modern times when comedies currently released in the cinema can hardly raise a smile, let alone a laugh, I found this a pure delight. So the sexual politics maybe a little outdated, but there were some beautifully timed comedy set-pieces: The moment Doris Day discovers the real identity of Hudson's character has one of the best use of music I have seen in a movie since the Warner Bros cartoons!A film that I didn't think I would enjoy, but was completely bowled over by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super! Super! Super!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well done Cinemax(cable TV channel) for showing this wonderful movie!Surely this must rank amongst the top romantic comedies of all time.Brilliant performances from the super stars Doris Day and Rock Hudson, with equally brilliant support from the likes of Tony Randell and Thelma Ritter.This picture is so good it had me laughing out loud constantly.Everything about this film is perfect: the script, the acting, the music, the story, the lighting, music, costumes, titles et al.Why is it that most movies of this type nowadays ain't a patch on this one?! And the movie industry should ask itself why it cannot find megastars as good as the cast in this picture.The basic story line involves a shared phone line leading to deception and romance. The use of split screen portrayals is done marvelously. For example the two lovers talk romantically in separate bath-tubs in their different apartments the touching of each others feet is magically shown by the split screen.One of my favorite scenes is where Rock Hudson in one of his deceptions, pretends he is gay, and of course later history reveals the irony of that.I thought one of the best lines in the movie was when Thelma Ritter says in effect that one cannot tell a good bottle of wine from a mere sip.All in all, top class entertainment:10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fabulous Doris Day and the equally enigmatic Rock Hudson work wonderfully together to create this stylish comedy. Witty lines and double entendre trip off their tongues with ease in one of the best and funniest films I have seen for a long time. Doris Day looks fantastic, in what I would consider the greatest film of her career and Rock Hudson shines in his double role - watch out for the scenes where the Doctor and Nurse mistakenly believe him to be pregnant! Would advise anyone to watch whether a fan of Doris or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great stuff from Doris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This hugely enjoyable romantic comedy from the late 1950s teamed Doris Day with Rock Hudson and struck gold. They'd team for three films in all, but this is the best of them.Doris Day plays an interior decorator who finds she's sharing a telephone party line with a womanising songwriter (Hudson) - she finds him unbearable at the end of the phone, but there are definite sparks for the better when they meet for real. He goes about romancing her in the guise of a nice Southern boy and almost succeeds ...In support are the funny Thelma Ritter and Tony Randall, perfect foils for the glamorous leads. The film zips along with a large amount of charm, certainly helped by the colour and the snappy title song. There are numerous classic scenes to add to the fun but I won't spoil yours until you've seen it. If you've never seen this, lucky you, you've got a treat to look forward to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wildest behind in New York City!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A party-line turns an interior decorator and a songwriting ladies' man into enemies--that is, until he gets a look at her. When Doris Day is forced into a nightclub by a junior-suitor, she makes the best of it and does a shimmy on the dance-floor in a tight white dress--you can't blame Rock Hudson (at a nearby table) nor the cameraman for zooming in on her derri?re, which wiggles seductively and comically. This businesswoman is really a closeted gal-about-town, and Day gives one of her freshest, funniest performances here. I also liked the tinkly background score and the handful of songs (the title cut, "Roly Poly" and "Possess Me"), but apparently Doris didn't. In her autobiography, she scathingly dismisses all the music from her '60s bedroom comedies as "mediocre", blaming her skinflint husband for bypassing top-rank composers like Henry Mancini for "a bunch of no-names". Why Doris!!***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of what we know now, Rock Hudson still convinces as a woman-chaser!! He was never considered to be a great actor but he convinced the public for years- so what dom the critics know? This movie is brilliant in every respect-script, plot , performances and the look of the whole thing. How can Doris Day be so sexy and virginal at the same time? Rock Hudson showed a real flair for comedy in this film and it is no wonder that every romantic comedy has been judged against the "Rock Hudson/Doris Day" movies. Even the Doris Day movies NOT starring Rock Hudson were called "Rock Hudson/Doris Day" !!! Doris Day was/is one of the most underrated actresses of the last 50 years. She could play comedy with perfect timing, but convince totally in dramas (check out "Love Me or Leave Me"-fantastic performance.) I must have watched this movie dozens of times and it is still true entertainment. If you have never watched one of her movies then make a point of doing so-yes they have dated, but what has not? Real talent not hype is what true stars have. By the way the 9/10 is because of the dated plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This smart and sassy sex comedy was made in 1959 but it could just as easily have been made in 1939 and the roles played here by Doris Day and Rock Hudson could have been played by Irene Dunne and Cary Grant. Michael Gordon's direction is serviceable at best but it has a likable Oscar-winning script by Russell Rouse, Maurice Richlin, Stanley Shapiro and Clarence Greene that makes the most of it's premise of the mismatched couple who find romance in the most unlikely of farcial situations.Day is starchy and frigid but Hudson is immensely likable and displays a real comic flair. There is a gay joke at the expense of the Hudson character and knowing what we know now we might well ask how much of an 'in-joke' this really was and just who was in on the joke. The film was a huge success and re-vitalized Day's career in non-musical roles. Tony Randall's character of the slightly effete millionaire who is in love with Day is not unlike David Hyde Pierce's Niles in "Frasier" and you can see some of the best "Frasier" scripts in some of the situations here. Influential or what?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, but a delight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This first teaming of Doris Day and Rock Hudson is a delightful, visually beautiful comedy - old-fashioned but hardly dated. The two stars make a charming, shiny couple (it's easy to see why they were so popular in their time) and Thelma Ritter steals the show in a needless but funny supporting role. The only problem you may have is that the course of the plot seems to be thoroughly predetermined from the first frame, but the film does a pretty good job of delaying the inevitable. Great sound effects, too. (***)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You are my inspiration....Doris"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly say that this is my favorite movie of all time. It has everything a romantic comedy needs...a wonderful script, snappy dialog and of course, the wonderful performances by every single actor in the movie. Doris Day is dead on as Jan Morrow, a single interior decorator, living alone in New York City in the late 1950's who has to share a party line on her telephone (which was not that unusual for that day and time, as hard as it is to believe now) with Brad Allen, played with smarmy brilliance by Rock Hudson. Tony Randall plays Jan's friend and client, Jonathan, a neurotic millionaire who wants to be more than just friends with Doris, but can't get to first base with her. The delightful Thelma Ritter is perfectly cast as Alma, Day's hard drinking but wise housekeeper. Doris can't stand sharing her party line with the womanizing Brad Allen, but when Allen sees her at a night club and figures out who she is and that she will never have anything to do with him if she knows his true identity, he invents an alter ego for himself, Rex, the cowboy from Texas. The ensuing story just gets funnier and funnier, as Jonathan, (Tony Randall's character) starts figuring out the deception, and romantic mayhem ensues. Doris Day never looked lovelier as she did in this film, and Rock never looked more handsome. It is ironic that he played such a blatant womanizer in this film, when of course, in real life he was a gay man. Although the film seems kind of dated now (at the time this film was made it was unusual for a woman to be single and successful) it is still tons of fun to watch. They just don't make movies like this anymore. A definite 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Screen Coupling Creates Box Office Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1958, Doris Day's career was on the downslide and something drastic needed to be done to revive her career. 1959'S PILLOW TALK redefined Doris' image and created an entirely new genre of the "will she or won't she" sex comedy as well as introducing one of the greatest romantic screen couplings in history...Doris Day and Rock Hudson. Day plays Jan Morrow, an interior decorator who shares her phone line with Brad Allen (Hudson) a song-writing playboy who ties up Doris' phone by singing love songs (actually the same song) over the phone to the parade of women in his life. Day's attempts to get a private phone line fail and she and Hudson begrudgingly come up with a system to share the phone which Hudson doesn't stick to. Tony Randall plays Jonathan Forbes, a rich playboy who is a client of Doris' and Rock's best friend, who is crazy about Doris but she doesn't feel the same way. One night, Brad discovers Jan at a nightclub and knowing she already hates him, pretends to be a wealthy Texan in order to romance her and this is where the fun begins. Yes, the story is dated because party lines are virtually a thing of the past but it is the linchpin upon which this story delightfully plays out. Director Michael Gordon cleverly uses split-screen images to put Doris and Rock together on screen in seemingly compromising positions, very adult for 1959 and watching Brad pretending to be cowboy Rex Stetson, trying to romance Jan while Brad tries to advise Jan over the phone about what a cad Rex is, is a lot of fun. Day lights up the screen here, in a luminous performance that earned her her first and only Oscar nomination. Hudson, previously only seen in dramatic films up to this point, turns out to be gifted farceur and interviews in his later years, always credited Doris for teaching him how to do comedy. Randall is comic perfection as Jonathan as is Thelma Ritter, who was also nominated for an Oscar for her work as Jan's housekeeper. A delight from start to finish that introduced a new movie couple that would give Fred and Ginger and Spenceer and Kate a run for their money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New York, the interior decorator Jan Morrow (Doris Day) and the wolf composer Brad Allen (Rock Hudson) share a party line, but Brad keeps it busy most of the time flirting with his girlfriends. They do not know each other but Jan hates Brad since she needs the telephone for her business and can not use it.Coincidently Jan's wealthy client Jonathan Forbes (Tony Randall) that woos her is the best friend of Brad and he comments with him that he feels an unrequited love for Jan, who is a gorgeous woman. When Brad meets Jan by chance in a restaurant, he poses as a naive tourist from Texas named Rex Stetson and seduces her. But Jonathan hires a private eye to find who Rex Stetson is."Pillow Talk" is a delightful romantic comedy that improved my Saturday afternoon. This is the first time that I watch this movie and Doris Day and Rock Hudson show a great chemistry. But Thelma Ritter steals the movie in the role of the alcoholic housemaid Alma. The gags with the nurse and the obstetrician are also hilarious. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Confid?ncias ? Meia-Noite" ("Confidences at Midnight")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, despite the dated conventions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many modern viewers might find this film to be 'cheesy', and I'll admit that many of the conventions are outdated and possibly sexist, but the fact is the script and directing are flawless. This sort of film could simply not be made in 2004. In today's industry, the only directors and writers given any kind of control over their product are either head- tripping geniuses (Charlie Kauffman) or sci-fi directors that have proven their box-office worth (Spielberg, Cameron). Any film falling under the category of 'Romantic Comedy' or 'Woman's Picture' is exclusively the domain of the major corporations, and so they're churned out in paint-by-numbers duplicates byHollywood every year. Anyway, a film doesn't have to 'artistic' or 'deep' to be well made, and this film proves that. The story is perfectly laid out, and Hudson and Day are excellent on camera. Doris Day, in fact, could be the best actress of her generation.Any doubters should see 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' for a more intenserole.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jan Morrow (Doris Day) is a successful interior designer living in her cushy New York apartment, apparently content with her single life. Unfortunately for her, she shares a party line (a shared phone line) with composer and serial ladies man Brad Allen (Rock Hudson), and whenever she needs to make a call, she is always caught up in his crooning seduction technique which he tries on all the ladies. His arrogant playboy attitude riles Jan and she seeks to have the party line ended. Jan is also being wooed by millionaire client Jonathan Forbes (Tony Randall), who, unbeknownst to her, is Brad's friend and business associate. After hearing about Jonathan's infatuation with Jan, who Brad has never met, and after coincidentally coming across her in a bar, he adopts a fake Texan accent and backstory, and seduces Jan. Aiming to teach her a lesson, it's only a matter of time before his cover is blown and the possibility that he may just fall in love with her.The sight of Doris Day and Rock Hudson, with their squeaky-clean personas and rather smug characters, is usually enough to induce vomiting. However, in Pillow Talk, the first time I've seen the two together in one of their now-celebrated rom-com partnerships, I found them, and the film, a delight. Okay, so Doris Day is a tad annoying, but Rock Hudson is in great form here. Playing dual roles, he has the appeal to make his really quite nasty and obnoxious character still likable. Tony Randall, always a reliable supporting character, is great fun too.Modern-day romantic comedies should take notes from this on how to create a film with actual chemistry between the two leads, a witty script, and genuine charm. It has been attempted with films such as Down With Love and the Coen brothers' Intolerable Cruelty, but have ultimately failed to hit the mark. The film is also tightly directed by Michael Gordon, who maintains a snappy pace throughout.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jan Morrow (Doris Day), an interior decorator who moved from Milwaukee to Manhattan, is at wit's end. In the late fifties, especially in the booming New York City area, private phone lines were hard to come by. Thus, she has a "party line" (she shares one) with Brad Allen (Rock Hudson), a smooth songwriter of Broadway hits. Since Brad is very handsome, women call him at all hours, thanking him for their "nights" together and begging him to sing them love songs on the phone. This exasperates Jan, for she needs to make business calls as well as personal. Arguing and pleading with him does no good. So, she goes to the phone company with a complaint and a plea for a private line but it backfires. Wouldn't you know, Ma Bell sends a unmarried female inspector to investigate and Brad charms her into writing a positive report. This upsets Jan even more. But, one day, wealthy businessman, Jonathan (Tony Randall), who provides the finances for Brad's shows, happens to mention that he has a new love interest. Yes, he tells Mr. Allen, her name is Jan and she decorated his office very nicely. Not only that, she's a looker. Well, well. Soon after, a chance encounter at a restaurant lets Brad see Ms. Morrow but he knows if flirts with her as himself, he's dead in the water. Thus, when she needs help with a drunk client, he poses as "Rex Stetson" from Texas, with a drawl and since Jan has never seen him, she has no idea he is pulling one over on her. But, oh, how she likes his looks and charm! The two begin to go out on dates and Jan falls head over heels. Meanwhile, Brad still calls up Jan to give her advice on love, which she can't help listening to, since she knows he's an expert. How soon will it be until the truth comes out? This is a classic romantic comedy that may indeed be the best one ever made. My sisters and I loved it as teens in the early sixties and "caught" it on the tube whenever we could. The two stars, Hudson and Day, are perfection itself as the sparring phone partners and as the couple falling in love. In addition, the rest of the cast, including Randall and Thelma Ritter, is also quite nice. The setting, costumes and camera work are topnotch, too, while the script is gleefully, unabashedly funny AND romantic. If you have never seen it, don't delay. Buy, borrow or rent it, plop yourself onto the couch with some soft pillows, and giggle your cares away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rock and Doris are perfectly cast in this hilarious if improbable comedy. Tony Randall excels as does Thelma Ritter in supporting roles. There is a thinly veiled reference to Rock's sexual preference as there is in Lover Come Back. Was Hollywood jerking our chain? Doris plays the dedicated career girl/unspoiled maiden and I am reminded of Oscar Levant's comment, "I knew Doris before she was a virgin". The atmosphere of New York City in the 50s is faithfully reproduced and the dialog is witty and clever. This was Rock's debut as a comic actor and he pulled it off flawlessly.

There is still a battle between the sexes and although the movie premiered in 1959 it's as fresh and relevant as it ever was. I'm sad now that Rock didn't do more comedy than he did, as he had a knack and a timing that is second to none. I loved 'Send Me No Flowers' and 'Lover Come Back' also.

		<shortDescription>VERY mixed feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first of the three so-called "sex comedies" made with Doris Day and Rock Hudson.Day plays interior decorator Jan Morrow. She shares a party line with womanizing Brad Allen (Hudson). She hates him for always monopolizing the phone calling his various girlfriends. Allen's best friend Jonathan Forbes (Tony Randall) is in love with Jan. Brad sees Jan, falls in love, disguses himself as a Texan and proceeds to steal her away from his buddy. Some friend!SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!!This movie has a lot of negative things about it--the sexual innuendo is stupid and extremely unfunny (I groaned aloud at one of the lines). Thelma Ritter plays an alcoholic maid named Alma--her alcoholism is presented as cute and funny--alcoholism is NOT funny (although I did laugh when she drank Hudson under the table). There are a few homophobic lines that come from Hudson--homophobia is never funny and hearing them come from Hudson is extremely disturbing. The film also makes the point that a woman living alone with a successful job can never be happy without a man in her life. Sheesh!The good things--the acting is good--Hudson and Day play off each other beautifully. I love the split screens used throughout the picture. Everything looks colorful and beautiful--Day is just breathtaking and her clothes are incredible--Hudson is strong, handsome and when he smiles...sigh. Also this is where some of the things we now see as cliches were invented--the voiceovers, split screen, the (purposedly?) lousy back screen projection and the montage of Hudson and Day seeing the sights.So, on one hand I liked this a lot--there's always something to look at. On the other hand the stupid sex jokes and treatment of women make me uncomfortable. I can only give it a 7. And don't let the term "sex comedy" bother you--this might have been extreme in 1959 but it's very tame today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pillow Talk (1959)A silly comedy, not quite screwball, but clever as can be, and filled with things you sort of half expected but when they happen they are even funnier because you knew it was coming.Rock Hudson is super charming as the heterosexual stud he wasn't, in real life (his character makes a hilarious comment about gay men, the ones who like recipes etc.). Doris Day is, well, Doris Day, and if you like her phony style of acting, and being, hurrah. She only goes so far for me.The writing is smart and economical, and the writers have given the plot and terrific number of small twists, one after another, that fit together like fingers of two gloves by the end. Nicely constructed! The sets are gorgeous of course (it's 1959, widescreen, bright color), and Day's character is an interior decorator, which comes into play. New York is always a fun town on some level, and it really is charming and pretty here, as much as we see of it, reminding us why "Mad Men" works in the first place. The formal tricks of this movie are interesting (and historic) for their pushing the censorship people to the wall, even though everyone is squeaky clean in it. The split screens allow our two heroes to be in bed together, to take a bath together, and even, in their apparent nakedness, press their feet together. Totally fun.And funny. It's a joyous movie, in some unexpected way. It's lightweight--by design.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw Pillow Talk, as much as I did love Young At Heart, Move Over Darling, Love Me or Leave Me and The Thrill of It All, I thought I'd never see a Doris Day film that I loved more than Calamity Jane. Well with Pillow Talk, I found it. It is witty, charming, smart, fresh and funny, and like I said with Move Over Darling it doesn't have a single wasted scene. Also it is my personal favourite of the films Day made with Universal Studios.I will admit when I first saw the film I did occasionally find it slow and the ending a little abrupt. Seeing it again, any flaws I had with it initially went completely, and the more I saw Pillow Talk the more I found to like and the more I liked it. The story about a telephone party line is smart and quite original. It is glossy froth, but I like glossy froth. The production values are pretty simple yet glamorous and the music is pleasant and memorable, I especially loved the title song which is really quite catchy. The screenplay is witty and funny and has charm to it too, while the film is very well directed by Michael Gordon.Even better are the performances. Doris Day once again is fresh and endearing, and Rock Hudson also has his share of adroit humour and does it with flair. But these two are superbly supported by Tony Randall, who I think gives his best performance in this film and Thelma Ritter who also have the best material. In conclusion, a truly wonderful film, if you give it a chance I think you'll like it. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of This Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say that Pillow Talk is one of the best, if not the best comedy of this era... The plot is as follows: an intelligent, hard working woman (Doris Day) shares a phone line with a handsome womanizer (Rock Hudson) and he is always on the phone line romancing women, so she cannot use it. She detests the man, but after a series of events Hudson fakes his voice pretends to be a southern man with values. They fall in love.This funny, clever, witty and fluffy movie is what inspired 'Down With Love'. I actually saw Down With Love first and was really interested to see what inspired that great love. Just the pure wonder of the amazing, quirky lines and the fun outfits makes this movie worth buying. You can see the transition to the early sixties fashions was very much taking place.I love this movie because it will always cheer me up no matter how I feel. It's very clever and witty - one of the best of this era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Talk with Day and Hudson ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a string of serious dramas, Rock Hudson broke out into comedy and showed his adeptness to it in 1959's "Pillow Talk."As a swinging song writer, Rock was charming but nasty to the person that he shared a phone line with-Doris Day.The two really go at it as they accuse each other of monopolizing the phone. What they don't know is that they share a common friend, the ever great Tony Randall, a millionaire in this one, who can't seem to get Day to marry him.Doris is an interior decorator in this one and when she does the home of the wealthy Lee Patrick, son, Nick Adams, in a funny performance, gets drunk while with her at a local nightclub. As luck would have it, Hudson is in the next booth with his date, a lovely Julia Meade. He realizes that this is his enemy from the party line. Too woo her, he puts on a terrific Texas accent, which he may have learned from his role in "Giant," and becomes Rex Stetson.You can imagine the hilarity when Day finds out who he really is. Along for the ride is Thelma Ritter, Day's maid, who portrays Alma, an alcoholic maid, ready to give good advice to all concerned.The dialogue is great. Randall hopes that Hudson will do great scoring when he loans him his weekend retreat in Connecticut.This was the only film that Doris Day was ever Oscar nominated for. Thelma Ritter received her 5th of 6 supporting nominations for this film.A classy movie, funny to watch, and a pleasure to view. You may even wish for cross-wires after seeing this great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better sex comedies with perfect casting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just had my first viewing of this film and grinned all thru it, not only that but I also laughed out loud on some occasions as well. So do I love this film because of the following: I have always had the most loin yearning crush on Doris Day since my snot nosed years? I simply find Tony Randall an irresistible comic joy? Rock Hudson actually brings acting substance to the table? Well all of the above helped me to enjoy this delightful sex comedy, however, it should be stressed that it has much more to offer.I loved that Doris was showing a more sexually knowing side with the character of Jan, I really feel that the chemistry between Hudson &amp; Day is casting gold, and boy is the story a cheeky joyous romp. Tidyily scripted and containing some visual treats {watch as Hudson towers over Randall whilst Randall picks him apart}, Pillow Talk is a film for film lovers to enjoy no matter what is the individual's preferred genre.Looking at the history of the film I was not surprised to find that it was a massive box office success, for although the film may have been {and still seen this way now} a bit too sweet and sickly for some, it is actually a delightful wink wink nudge nudge comedy that we could do with more of in this day and age. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There Must Be A Pillow Talking Rock For Doris, THERE MUST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pillow Talk was the first of three films Rock Hudson and Doris Day teamed on. Personally, I don't think it was their best, but it's entertaining enough.Though for the life of me I can't understand what Doris did in this particular comedy to warrant an Oscar nomination. Pillow Talk doesn't stand out in that way. Doris was passed over for such things as Love Me Or Leave Me, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Midnight Lace where she really did do some good acting. The premise is dated, party lines are certainly a thing of the past now with text messaging cell phones. I do recall back around the same time my grandparents still having a party line. In that sense Pillow Talk is dated.Still the film is funny enough. Virginal interior decorator Doris Day happens to get the same party line as wolfish songwriter Rock Hudson. Rock with his non-stop love life is constantly cutting in on Doris's business calls.When he accidentally learns who she is when at a bar she's fending off the advances of young Nick Adams, Rock embarks on an all out campaign to nail her as another trophy. Of course the imponderable of love always gets in the way in these films.Doris Day in all of her comedy films, be they with Rock Hudson or others always got a good group of supporting players. It seemed obligatory that Tony Randall before finding fame as Felix Unger, was always cast as the hero's best if goofy friend. It's either him or Gig Young in these roles. He creates his perennial character in Pillow Talk. On the female side Thelma Ritter as Doris's perpetually hung over maid is her deadpan best. My favorite scene in Pillow Talk is her drinking Rock Hudson under the table.Though audiences today might not get the whole party line premise, Pillow Talk is still funny enough for even the younger viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humming in her underwear, full-figured interior decorator Doris Day (as Jan Morrow) wants to make an important telephone call, but her New York City "party line" is occupied by playboy songwriter Rock Hudson (as Brad Allen). He uses the phone to romance various women, which Ms. Day finds boorish. Day takes her concerns to the phone company, where she calls Mr. Hudson a "sex maniac." The complaint ends when handsome Hudson arouses the female investigator. Although they agree to take half hour turns, Day and Hudson continue to bicker on the phone. The adversaries have never met - in person. This changes when Hudson hears Day, seated at the next table while they are out with dates. Immediately attracted, Hudson assumes a phony Texas accent and begins to court his attractive blonde phone-mate..."Pillow Talk" was the first Rock Hudson &amp; Doris Day comedy. Their chemistry is obvious. The co-stars appeared in two additional 1960s comedies and are among filmdom's best-loved couples. Ahead of the curve, this film is a fine example of how the seemingly "innocent" 1960s sex comedies began to push mainstream films from innuendo to explicit. Most obvious is the successful use of "split-screen" to visually put the unmarried couple in bed together. Director Michael Gordon and his crew use the technique beautifully ? which is rare for split-screen. At one point, the stars touch their feet while in (separate) bathtubs. Also artful are sexually subtle scenes, like Hudson squeezing into Day's car. This genre of film often flattens when overdone - but, herein, the sex talk and situations are playful and fun...In hindsight, it is perversely ironic to see Hudson's gentleman from Texas suggested as possibly homosexual because he adores his mother, exchanges recipes and enjoys gossip. The "gay jokes" often drag down these films (the next Hudson-Day outing, for example), but they are not fatal, here. It is amusing, for example, when Hudson is thought to be pregnant. A bigger problem is the light-hearted treatment given Thelma Ritter's character - a meaningless and hopeless alcoholic. Day should either fire or get help for her maid "Anna" - Ms. Ritter plays the part well, however. She and Tony Randall's millionaire pal "Jonathan Forbes" were acclaimed among the best supporting characterizations of the year. Frank DeVol's soundtrack music is perfect and Day's "Pillow Talk" title song is one of her best.******** Pillow Talk (10/6/59) Michael Gordon ~ Rock Hudson, Doris Day, Tony Randall, Thelma Ritter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pillow Talk is a great film. It's an opportunity to watch Rock Hudson and Doris Day looking great at the peak of their careers. Tony Randall and Thelma Ritter are marvelous in their supporting roles. This is not a deep and socially important movie - if you want that, why not try "To Kill A Mockingbird"? It's somewhat preposterous and improbable, and centering as it does around something called a "Party Line" telephone it's dated. (For those who don't know what that is, a "Party Line" was a telephone line shared by two or more "parties." It was very much like having an extension in someone else's house. And, yes, if they were using the phone, your phone was also "busy" - you could neither take nor receive calls while your party line sharers were on the phone. "Private" lines were available, but they were priced at a premium. Most people were satisfied to have party lines...they were actually fun in many ways, one of those being that you could eavesdrop on your neighbors.) This movie is a lot of fun, doesn't require much thinking, and is safe for the whole family. No mean-spirited slapstick here, just fun, and if you give yourself permission to suspend disbelief, you'll love this movie as much as I. You get a couple of great tunes sung by Doris Day, too. Doris had it all: wholesome beauty, great acting talent, and an amazing singing voice. I almost never pass up a chance to see this movie whenever it's on TCM. Next time it comes up, I'd recommend you see it, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Norma Rae but never intended to be. A cute film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who have commented on how sexist this film is, and how a woman would never fall for a guy like the womanizer Rock Hudson is in this film have completely missed the point. As a 1959 film, it was ahead of its time, with Doris Day playing a gainly employed female with a desirable occupation as an interior designer. The fact is - Hudson plays a womanizer who is reformed by Day's character by the story's end. This is a strong story point, given emphasis in the conversation between Hudson and Tony Randall where Hudson compares himself to a tree in the forest that gets cut down (when married). The point isn't that all women should just be swept away by womanizers, but that womanizers can be reformed. Clearly, this was the intention of the filmmakers, not the other way around. By contemporary standards it is no "Norma Rae," but it was never intended to be anything other than entertainment, which it certainly is. The visuals are much buoyed by the use of split screen. It's a cute film, in the best sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and charming--Rock Hudson and Doris Day are at their best in their first film pairing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pillow Talk" was the first time Rock Hudson and Doris Day were teamed as a romantic couple, and it is easy to see why they became so popular as a team. In this movie, they show perfect comedic timing, playing off each other to perfection. Doris is cast as Jan Morrow, a successful interior designer and Rock Hudson is Brad Allen, the playboy songwriter with whom she is forced to share a party line. When they meet by accident, Brad makes up a new identity (Rex Stetson) in order seduce Jan, who has never seen his face, but knows his voice. With his cornpone accent and naive country ways, Rex (Brad) has Jan totally head over heels in love. Of course, this double-identity must be exposed at some point, and the way in which it is exposed and resolved makes for a very entertaining romp. Tony Randall as a love-struck client (and friend of Brad) and Thelma Ritter as Jan's hard-drinking housekeeper round out the great cast. I must comment on Doris' wardrobe...her clothes in this movie are absolutely fabulous. She never looked lovelier, and Rock is gorgeous as well. Of all the 1950's "bedroom comedies", this is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Favorite Movie Quote: "At least my problems can be solved in one bedroom. You couldn't solve yours in a thousand!" With Westerns, War-Dramas, and Sci-Fi dominating the movie-fare of the 1950s, producer Ross Hunter was aptly warned that Screwball Comedy like Pillow Talk would never, ever be a success at the box-office.Even though Screwball Comedy had long been pronounced "dead" at the end of the 1940s, Pillow Talk turned out to be one of the most successful films of the 1950s. It proved just how starved movie-audiences were for pure escapist fluff, such as it was. Pillow Talk went on to be nominated for 5 Academy Awards. It won an Oscar for "Best Screen-writing".Pillow Talk starred Doris Day and Rock Hudson. Pairing these 2 stars together proved to be such a success that they eventually went on to make 2 other Romantic Comedies together, but neither of which turned out to be as magical as Pillow Talk.Featuring some pretty snappy dialogue, energetic performances, lush photography, and high production values, Pillow Talk is certainly an all-round fun and very enjoyable 1950s Comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great lines and great cast equal great laughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pillow Talk" had many things going for it to make it the hit it was in 1959. And, those same things are what keep it a big success with modern viewers, 50 years later. They'll likely keep it near the top of the heap in the future, especially in the comedy-romance field. After a few decades of comedy-romances with very similar plots ? although many were quite funny and good ? Hollywood began to put out more original comedy plots in the 1950s. PT was one of those. It won the Oscar that year for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay?Written Directly for the Screen. The plot was simple and not hard to follow. Indeed, part of the enjoyment is in seeing how it unfolds as we are led from one scene to the next. And, then we can catch the one-liners and zingers that bring out the long bursts of laughter. I say bursts, because even after seeing this movie a few times, I still laugh so hard in places that I miss many subsequent lines and have to go back to resume the film (of course, we couldn't do that in the theater original, or when viewing it live on TV). PT is a classic comedy-romance that should endure through the ages. All of the cast give top performances, the directing is superb, and the sets and scenes are spot-on. With all of this, the witty writing and dialog delivery stand out and provide the real punch. One must see the film to appreciate the expressions of Rock Hudson, Doris Day, Tony Randall, Thelma Ritter or the nurse and doctor, with delivery of so many laughter lines. Here's just a small sample of laughter starters: Hudson to Day: "We have a saying back in Texas, ma'am ? 'Never drink anything stronger than you are, or older.'" Hudson to Day, on his warm feeling around her: "It's like being around a pot-bellied stove on a frosty mornin'." Day, when the phone company sends a woman agent to check a complaint against Hudson: "It's like sending a marshmallow to put out a bonfire." Randall to Day: "And even the air out there (in Texas), there's nothing in it but air. In New York you've got air you can sink your teeth into. It has character." Randall: "I don't know how fast he works, but it takes an early bird to get the best of a worm like me."Randall to Hudson: "You love her and she can't stand the sight of you. Heh, heh, heh. It's wonderful." Hudson: "Jonathan, how do I get her back?" Randall: "You don't. That's the beauty of it. You suffer and I watch." Randall, seeing a photo from his private investigator: "Why, this is my best friend." Private eye: "Yep. They're usually the ones."</fullReview>

Doris Day is beautiful in the movie, I love the costumes that she wears. Her constantly hungover maid is also hillarious, adding another dimension to the piece.

To my surprise, I found it on a classic movie channel and started watching it and my mouth about dropped open when I saw who was starring in the movie. Instantly I fell in love with Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Tony Randall! The chemistry between Rock and Doris was so believable...it's hard to fathom that they were just "good" friends offscreen. The script is truly witty and I love how everything fell into place. Even Thelma Ritter as Alma snuck in some humor by eavesdropping on the conversations Rock was having with his "women" (and how could he not be a player as handsome as he is) and drinking Rock Hudson under the table in the one scene. I was so delighted after seeing that movie that I decided to find more of the casts' other movies, but this still remains on the top of my list. Definitely one of my favorites!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of the "Romantic Comedy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Pillow Talk" again yesterday after a gap of many years. It was, and remains, amusing and witty. It was not meant as a broad, "laugh out loud" comedy but there are elements of that in it.It is interesting to compare it, as a film which, undeniably, falls within what is now recognized as the genre of "romantic comedy", with current and recent movies which have established that as a recognizable genre. The problem with most of the latter is that they take themselves too seriously (e.g. "27 Dresses"), so that some of them actually fall out of the genre into "drama with comic elements" ("Dan In Real Life"). "The Holiday" was a good exception, however.I do not think that "Pillow Talk" would have been seen as part of a genre when it appeared. Indeed, its impact (five Oscar nominations, including one award) would suggest that it was seen as something different from the witty comedies involving couples whose relationship would develop into a romance that had, of course, appeared ever since the 1930s (cf. such diverse films as "I Married A Witch", "His Girl Friday" and "Sabrina").The Doris Day-Rock Hudson pairing occurred three times but Doris extended the concept in several other films over the next eight years. These films may be seen as having established the benchmark for the genre. Certain other pairings attempted to introduce themselves but none with the same success - Paul Newman/Joanne Woodward ("A New Kind Of Love"), William Holden/Audrey Hepburn ("Paris When it Sizzles"), Bobby Darin/Sandra Dee ("That Funny Feeling"). The latter pairing did appear in the more successful "Come September" but they were the second leads to Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida. (Interestingly, I have just seen, in checking this, that it was written by the scriptwriters of "Pillow Talk".)Therefore, one may draw the conclusion that "Pillow Talk" was both influential and, almost by definition, one of the best of its type. Why the does it have "only" a 7 from me ? One explanation is that I seem to mark less highly than many other contributors. (I see a 6 as "quite good"). Another reason is that I would, if I could, place it as 7.5 (which equates with the IMDb rating). Perhaps another explanation is that I have not seen any of these films for many years and that it is desirable to leave scope for their potential to be that bit better. Although the trailblazer will usually be the best of its type (e.g. "The Magnificent Seven"), that is not always the case and I have noted that some contributors prefer the later ones.Finally, I can not leave this film without mentioning the invaluable contributions from the supporting players, in particular of course Tony Randall and Thelma Ritter. The impact of the film owes as much to them as to the stars, in the sense that it widens the area which the comedy covers. It still, however, remains grounded in real life and characters whom one could imagine meeting (cf. the "Road" pictures). Therein perhaps lay the root of its difference when released at the end of the 1950s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but hollow romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Internal designer Jan Morrow moves into a shared apartment block to find that the lack of phone lines means she has to share a phone with a man in another apartment. However that man, Brad Allen, spends so much time talking to other girls that Jan can't get a call in. However through a common acquaintance the two meet ? but Brad covers his accent and woos her with her never suspecting his true identity.The story won an Oscar! How! The contrived and unlikely plot is just one of many unlikely set ups that romantic comedies use to get people to fall in and out of love before sorting everything out in a big happy hug of an ending. The plot here is OK (but an Oscar?!) and is slightly better than average in it's scenario. It's quite predictable and unlikely but as long as it's fizzy and enjoyable then it shouldn't matter.The delivery is quite enjoyable and is fizzy without being hilarious. The jokes are never more than amusing but still add enough fizz to the mix to the film. The chemistry between Hudson and Day is at an early stage in their career together and doesn't always come together ? although it may be the fact that she spends the majority of the film disliking him. Hudson however is actually pretty good throughout and delivers a lot of really good jokes and asides. I'm not a big fan of him as I've always seen him as just a matinee hunk but the material suits him here. The two leads are OK but the support cast are wasted for the most part. Tony Randall is capable of much more than the bitter friend role given to him here, and only occasionally does he get a chance to look good. A bigger waste is Ritter as Alma. She has delivered a similar character in other films to good effect (most famously Rear Window) but here she barely has any screen time to work her world weary, drunken wonder.Overall this is a Saturday afternoon matinee at best. The predictable plotting and unlikely set up would be terrible if it didn't have fizz and some nice humour. If you're in an undemanding mood then this would suit you well for a wet Saturday indoors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two New Yorkers (Rock Hudson, Doris Day) sharing a party line find themselves annoyed with one another. He's a womanizer who monopolizes the phone to talk with his many girlfriends. She's a fuddy duddy who doesn't think much of his lifestyle. Eventually he sees her and realizes what a looker she is, so he pretends to be someone else to date her.I'm a big classic movie fan but there's something about this period (late '50s through the early '60s) that just leaves me cold. I can count on one hand the number of films from this period that I genuinely love. This is not one of them. I did enjoy this and I think it's good and daring for its time, but it just didn't connect with me like it obviously has so many others over the years. For one thing, I have never really cared much for Doris Day. Nice singing voice, pretty enough, but there's something so staid and sober about her that I find it hard to become invested in her characters in these types of movies. I recognize mine is a minority opinion among classic film fans. I know others like her but she just doesn't do it for me and I find her much-touted chemistry with Rock Hudson to be overstated.Anyway, this is considered by many to be their best movie and I can see why. It moves along at a nice pace and the comedy is somewhat risqu for the time. The fashions and sets will appeal to those who are fans of the period. Hudson is having a blast and it shows. I already gave my opinion on Day but, if you're a fan, you'll undoubtedly enjoy her here. Tony Randall and Thelma Ritter steal the show in supporting roles. The recurring bit with the obstetrician who thinks Rock is pregnant is probably the funniest part of the movie. The screenplay won an Oscar (!) and Doris Day was nominated for one (!!). How either of those things came about from this I will never know. Must have been a slow year.</fullReview>

Sexist and with some definite pointless plot motivations, still the charm of the clueless Hudson and the determined but gullible Day make it through. Also, there's enough of a fun feel of NY City and fashion in the Sixties that there's plenty of eye-candy for a fan of retro-design like myself. The addition of Tony Randall and his quips are quite funny too. Like I said, I find many of the other Hollywood 'romances' of this era get tedious and have dreary scripts where long scenes are acted out in one room (more like a radio play).

		<fullReview>I love this movie because of its unique plot, but I love it more for the stunning opulence. When most of the world were still living in dreary shacks and gray concrete buildings, America was already modern as it is today. The buildings seen in this movie would be a good architecture of a brand new building even today.But some parts of the society seems like it wasn't keeping up with the rapid modernization. Who's ever heard of a "Party Line" ? I guess people had to share a phone number because the telephone companies (or company at the time - Bell Telephone) couldn't provide as many individual phone numbers. I sure didn't hear about anything like this until I saw this movie.When people around the world saw this movie, they thought American girls were like Doris Day. It's not true, but the image stuck. And what a hunk Rock Hudson was.Everything about this movie is just beautiful. What ever happened to this glamorous society ? We're certainly living at a lower point of the curve than what's shown in this movie.A beautiful movie, that I love every part of. I wish we can go back to those times again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Long Preserved Virginity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very successful romantic comedy. It's often maligned because Doris Day doesn't hop into bed with the robust Rock Hudson, but, after all, this is the 1950s and, also after all, she's willing enough to spend the weekend in Connecticut with Hudson's alter ego. What do you think they're going to do in that woodland cottage for two days -- make fudge? Doris and Rock have never met but share a party line and argue constantly on the phone about the problems it's causing. Hudson accidentally bumps into Day at a night club. He recognizes her, and immediately forms one of his usual rakish plots. She's attracted too but doesn't know who he really is because he assumes the identity of an honest, naive and filthy rich visitor from Texas. Tony Randall plays a splendidly comic third banana, trying to talk Day into marrying him and becoming his fourth wife.But -- true enough -- you have to alter your mind set to fully appreciate the comic touches. It's like watching an exceptionally well-done example of a TV situation comedy, more risqu than others, and certainly more expensively mounted. The set dressers did such a good job that a couple of imitations that followed turned tastefully appointed apartments into vulgar displays. (I'll mention "One Thousand Bedrooms" as an example.) A lot of the humor depends on homosexuality, a subject still amusing at the time, especially when applied to the ironically masculine Rock Hudson. And the story is studded with sex jokes and double entendres. Randall advises Hudson: "A mature man looks forward to being married and having his branches cut off." Actually Randall is flawless. And even Doris Day gives a professional performance. Her double takes are sometimes exquisite. Hudson isn't asked to do more than smile and be charming in a phony way and he does it well.Sometimes I wonder if I'm not more impressed with Doris Day than I ought to be, or, on the other hand, if others appreciate her talent. A German girl from Cincinnati (where else?) she was cute as hell, first of all, and had a sassy figure. Second, an appealing soprano. She could act, too, and not only in roles like this one. She was better than could be expected in early dramatic parts in "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and "Storm Warning," but her career never really took off. "Pillow Talk" and its sequelae established her, at least in a certain generic context, but she was already approaching forty. It was just the right age for the kinds of characters she played but I suppose her directors wanted teen agers with gigantic bosoms because within a few years, her close ups were filmed through lenses smeared with Vaseline or KY Jelly or something. Bog in Heaven, how Hollywood fears age. Even performers who have become magnificent wrecks are spurned. Fortunately, age has not withered MY infinite variety, though I can't say the same for my three ex wives. Okay, that was a nasty crack. To quote my drill instructor in boot camp, what's the sense of getting out of bed in the morning if you can't give somebody the shaft during the day? That man was a saint, although although he was sick and perverted. Actually the comment was meant as a compliment to Doris Day. But alright, alright. It's still an unnecessary vile remark. Can I take it back? See this movie -- or give me twenty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny and entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. Especially considering the film was made in 1959. The sexual innuendo is great!! I liked the fact that because of Rock Hudson's scheming, Doris Day didn't know up from down. It was good fun entertainment. I also like Thelma Ritter (a note to the person who wrote that alcoholism is not funny - it's a movie - it's not real). I also liked the fact the Rock Hudson had Doris Day believing he was gay!! It's intersting that he came out as gay later in life.If you like dark humor, and very intelligent story, you'll like this one.signed, a gay man in Washington DC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful escapism!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A deeply sexist movie, but I love it anyway! Doris and Rock are great together,the dialogue is witty, and Tony Randall is just terrific in a supporting role. Doris actually looks *good* and often convincingly sexy in this movie (as opposed to Lover Come Back, where the fashions and hairdo make her look matronly). One of the things I appreciate about this film is that Rock Hudson (even in his country hick role) comes across as a grown man behaving with restraint rather than an asexual half-child who hardly knows what to do with a woman, a character all too popular in old Hollywood comedies. Of course, knowing Rock Hudson's story, it makes me cringe to listen to his character in this movie (and also in Lover Come Back) making insulting cracks about gay men! Despite the limitations of her role, Doris Day comes across as the woman holding out for true love, not just society's approval. You remember her as the glamorous working woman with a serious career, not just as a submissive would-be housewife. She certainly had a talent for comedy - the expression on her face in the piano scene says it all! I have to admit I also like the music, especially the title tune and "Roly Poly Baby". If you want to forget your troubles for an evening with a great romantic comedy, choose this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock and Doris-pure magic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pillow Talk is a fun movie full of twists and turns. Jonathan (Tony Randall) loves Jan (Doris Day), but Jan doesn't love Jonathan; Jan hates Brad(Rock Hudson); Brad wants to meet Jan and pretends to be Rex, a Texas rancher; Jan loves Rex. As you can see, it's very confusing. However, my brief summary doesn't do it justice. It's the classic love triangle with the classic Hollywood ending. It's wonderfully entertaining and amusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doris and Rock are great together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first teaming of Doris and Rock and Tony, and still the best.Doris plays an interior decorator who's redecorating Tony's office, and Rock is a womanizing song writer who's scoring one of Tony's current Broadway productions. Tony loves Doris, but she doesn't love him. Tony mentions Doris to Rock, who's intrigued, but Tony knows better than to give an old woman stealer like Rock any clues. But when he hears her first name, he wonders.It turns out that Doris and Rock share a party line (does anyone remember those?), on which Doris has to listen to Rock seduce many different women. Thelma Ritter does a funny turn as Doris' hard drinking maid, who likes to listen in on Rock's phone conversations. While they hate each other online, Rock eventually rescues Doris from a drunken date (Nick Adams in a funny cameo) at a club, recognizes her name, and schemes to bring Doris down by making her love him; he ends up falling in love with her himself. He pretends to be a visiting Texan (named Rex Stetson!), and charms the naive Doris with his innocent ways. Tony sets a PI on Doris' trail to find out who this Rex Stetson really is.Tony finds out about Rock's treachery from the PI, and sends him off to Tony's cabin in the mountains to finish the songs for the play, which is behind schedule, thinking he's sent him away from Doris for good. Rock manages to invite Doris to the cabin without blowing his cover, and envisions he and Doris having a passionate weekend together, which would seal his revenge on her, he thinks. He goes out to get wood for the cozy fire he plans to seduce her in front of, and Doris makes an alarming discovery when she sits down at the piano and plinks out the tune on the sheet music Rock brought with him in his coat pocket.When she realizes who she's been spending the past weeks with, (there's a silly little song that wends its way through the entire film and provides her with the inevitable clue to Rock's true identity) Doris is humiliated by his machinations. Tony shows up at that moment, and drives her back to New York. Rock now realizes that he loves her, but she won't give him a second chance. When Rock tries to apologize by offering her the commission to redecorate his apartment, she thinks to take out her revenge on him by buying every ugly or disgusting piece of furniture and art in New York and piling it in his apartment.When Rock sees what she's done, he goes to her apartment and drags her out of bed in her pajamas and electric blanket, and carries her through the streets to his place. He mentions marriage, and she accepts.Don't see this movie any other way than in it's original widescreen format. With all the split screens and special inventive scenes, pan and scan detracts from the fun of the film. This is a film everyone can enjoy. It's about sex, but it's squeaky clean. Rock was very good at comedy, and with Doris he was just about perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The settings are cute, the wardrobe lovely, the actors talented, and the script snappy, but I really could not get into this film.This is one of the many movies I have seen with the formula of manipulative louse finds upstanding citizen with something they want (ex. power, wealth, that body), cons them, louse ends up not following through with it because true love, upstanding citizen finds out truth and freaks, but no worries, they get back together in under twenty minutes.I disliked it in Guys and Dolls, but here there are no side plots or fantastic music numbers to distract me.So the story is that a man with fantastic charisma which he uses to pick up women is hogging the party line of the female lead. She is rightfully annoyed about this but he is dismissive and says she is just jealous he isn't one of the women he chats up.She complains to multiple people, but everyone without a crush on her hints that she is not really mad about not being able to call people from her home (what?) but what she is really upset over is not getting the D.Manipulative louse gets away with it because he put all his character points on charisma. (I did some home installations a few years ago and I would have been really uncomfortable with someone crowding me like that, no matter how pretty they are.) Then they meet outside of the apartment, face to face, for the first time. Louse goes,'Wait, the woman who has been yelling at me is hot. I want a piece of that.' He proceeds to use a fake accent to chat her up. Cue shenanigans of him trying to keep her from finding out the truth. Insert rest of formula.Movies like this make me want to take the upstanding citizen aside and go, "Honey, I know you are lonely and really attracted to this person, but I want you think about something for a moment. The person you are attracted to has spent years of their life manipulating people to get what they want. Behavior like that does not clear up overnight. Just because they love you doesn't mean those bad habits won't reemerge. So I want you to think about this for a while away from them before you find yourself swept along in something that could be really damaging down the line. I know I'm over-thinking this, it's a comedy. On the other hand, there are much worse movies out there who don't deserve such a loop hole. I'll stick to my 6/10, only because many people won't be bothered by the same things as I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a pure delight from start to finish--with a very witty script and great repartee between Day and Hudson. Rock plays a playboy who is pretty nasty to his annoyed neighbor, Day. He seems to spend all his time chasing women and talking on their party line--such that she can't get much sleep or make a phone call. Although they don't actually meet, they have a very tense relationship over the phone. Later, Rock decides to play a trick on her and poses as another person. She quickly falls for him--not realizing he is the womanizing schmuck! Well, during this time, Rock is often seen in the halls or on the street by the same two guys who think he is an amazing stud--and they marvel at his prowess. Later, they see him dressed as a woman (due to a misunderstanding) and their response is priceless. I'm actually VERY surprised this sort of humor is involved, since Hudson was trying to hide his being gay. But it's still funny and he mustn't have minded.Anyway, it's a fun film--good for the family or as a date film. Almost as good is the follow up, LOVER COME BACK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doris Day was along with Audrey Hepburn, my favorite childhoodmovie star. She looked gorgeous, had a sweet voice, appeared inlots of sexy comedies and musicals, and owned the best body inHollywood. PILLOW TALK turned her into the #1 movie star inAmerica, a position she held for five straight years (before herproducer husband and an unscrupulous business partner wastedher fortune on bad investments, and pushed and aging Doris intotoo many badly produced movies). As Molly Haskell had said,Doris was the first career-girl in Hollywood who wasn't a hooker, agold-digger, or a schemer. She lived alone, and while everyonearound her reminded her of her single marital status, she didn'tseem to mind at all! In PILLOW TALK, she's a decorator, whoshares a party-line telephone with a womanizer played by theimpossibly handsome Rock Hudson. His best friend is TonyRandall, and Doris, who doesn't appear to have a best friend, isadvised by her comically drunk housekeeper, played the byincomparable Thelma Ritter. PILLOW TALK is full of double-entendres and winking jokes aboutsex. When Doris discovers that Rock is really the man she sharea party-line with, her indignation is hilarious as she redecorateshis apartment in "early reign of terror" decor. This being the 60s,all ends well with the final comic set piece the icing on the cake. The sight of pajamed and blanketed Doris being carried by Rockon the street with passersby commenting is still funny more than40 years later.I recently saw SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE with the adorable DianeKeaton. She has one long, comic scene of crying when her affairwith Jack Nicholson ends. Well, this scene is lifted from PILLOWTALK. When Doris discovers Rock's duplicity, she is driven backto New York by Tony Randall. She is comically sobbing all the wayback to the city. Keaton is expert in this scene, but Doris was theoriginal master. Nobody does romantic comedy with the kind of routine expertisethat Doris and company supplied so masterfully in the 60s. Keaton, Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, George Clooney, SandraBullock, Joan Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Diane Wiest, GoldieHawn, Steve Martin, Jennifer Anniston, Candace Bergen, MichaelDouglas, Richard Gere, Bette Midler, and any number of othersfine comic actors have proven, if only fitfully, they have the chops for comic movies. But producers don't trust them to work at the boxoffice, and nobody cares about quality comedy scripts anymore. Why, I have no idea. In very short order, Doris, Rock and Tony starred in three classicsof the genre--PILLOW TALK, LOVER COME BACK, and SEND MENO FLOWERS with PILLOW TALK being the very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On a party line with Doris and Rock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best film that Doris Day ever made, not to mention one of the BEST comedies ever made. Doris' comic timing and her chemistry with Rock Hudson goes unparalleled in the annals of film to this day. Doris plays interior decorator Jan Morrow who tries to run her business and her private life without any interference from any outside parties (she got an Academy Award nomination for her performance in this role by the way). Party did you say? Oh, that's where Rock comes along. Rock plays songwriter Brad Allen, a man who always uses every available trick up his sleeve (and then some) when it comes to wooing a woman. That is until he meets Jan Morrow, the interior decorator with whom he's to share his party line with. I don't want to say anymore lest I give away the outcome, suffice to say this plot makes up for a very enjoyable, funny two hours. Now, just sit back and watch the sparks fly.Tony Randall plays Brad's best friend, Jonathan, a fellow (gay?) songwriter who unbeknownst to Brad has intimate knowledge of Jan (Doris). And of course, Thelma Ritter steals the show as per usual as Doris' feisty, alcoholic cleaning lady Alma.All in all, this is a very enjoyable lighthearted comic romp, a battle of the sexes if you will. The plot is a bit foreseeable (it won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay that year believe it or not) but the acting and the star power deem this a film to be reckoned with after almost fifty years.My rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glossy; Nicely-Produced Adult Battle of the Sexes Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pillow Talk" is a well-liked and physically attractive comedy about a classic but perhaps not- too-serious "battle of the sexes". I assert this to be true because the principals, played amiable by miscast Rock Hudson and Doris day, are supposed to be high-powered creative types; while both "stars"are quite attractive and underplay their roles professionally, she is never a brilliant interior decorator nor he a convincing Broadway-level song composer. Moreover, their quarrel appears to hinge on "bedroom difficulties"--his is a popular motel and hers is empty. The two share a party line, due to a lack of trunkline space, circa 1959; she in exasperation gets angry at him and demands they divide up the hours available so she can receive professional calls and he can carry on his romances. Doris's maid enjoys his romances, on which she eavesdrops; Doris is bored by them. And when Brad finally sees Doris, who is being romanced by his best friend millionaire-and- show-backer Tony Randall, he tries his wiles on her, disguised as a Texan named "Rex Stetson"--with voice-disguising western accent. Of course the ending is funny, well-set-up by snappy dialogue and satisfying, I suggest, to the duos fans. But we as viewers are required to believe he's writing a Broadway show, and that she is busy doing her job brilliantly. The problem with the film therefore is that with popular stars playing classical accent roles requiring talented dialogue readers, the film loses much of its potential force despite the stars friendly liking for one another. The piece is a visual one, a color-heavy feast, with attractive and serviceable costumes, settings, innovative split-screen photography and several silly subplots involving Hudson being mistaken for a man about to have a baby and Randall failing to take no for an answer and getting knocked out by a truck driver. Director Michael Gordon takes no chances but keeps events moving, I suggest. Russell Rouse and Michael Richlin have been overpraised for a pedestrian but adult screenplay, completed along with Stanley Shapiro and Clarence Greene. Other credits belong to costume designers gownmaster jean Louis and Bill Thomas, a core of composers of such songs as "Possess Me", "Pillow Talk" and "Roly Poly", whose works are knitted together by Frank De Vol's score. The production design is good but not great; the plaudits here belong to Arthur E. Arling, cinematographer and set decorators Russell A. Gausman and Ruby R. Leavitt. In the large but underdeveloped cast of characters, Thelma Ritter is a standout as Doris's inebriated maid, and Randall easily outacts the putative stars, as usual. Lee Patrick, Allen Jenkins, Hayden Rourke and William Schallert are standouts among very competent minor role players. The film is seminal, I suggest and has been included here for its easy style, use of split-screen techniques and solid comedic storyline. I believe it could have been much better acted; but the use of a name-song, changed for each successive conquest by Hudson, becomes a memorable ploy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic movie but too much of it promotes offensive ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of movies both modern and classic. I like many movies despite some uncomfortable moments due to changing times and beliefs. This movie, however, I found appalling. The plot from beginning to end, promotes rape culture. It does not matter if it is a well acted movie with famous stars, it still champions faulty ideas about how men are allowed, even encouraged to treat women. Ideas that still today mislead young men into thinking their behavior is not rape. Deceive a woman, that's OK, stalk her, that's excusable, forcibly break into her apartment and kidnap her, no problem as long as you propose. She'll fall at your feet and marry you too. Think that last one doesn't happen today? It happened here in Maine about two years ago. A troubled young man kidnapped a young woman thinking she would fall in love with him when he "rescued" her. The girl ended up dead. Perhaps remembering that event colored my opinion. I still maintain that some classic movies can be enjoyed over and over, even today. Others really need to be left in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man (Rock Hudson) and woman (Doris Day) share a telephone line and despise each other, but then he has fun by romancing her with his voice disguised.This is an absolutely brilliant romantic comedy. Today (2015) it might confuse people, because the concept of "party lines" is so foreign. But it was quite clever in its day, and remains rather humorous now.One thing in particular that is strange now is the part where it is suggested that Rex is gay. (Never said directly, but strongly implied.) We know now that Rock Hudson himself was actually gay. And it seems that some people at the time must have been aware. Doris Day likely knew, as the rumor had been around for years when this film was made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story goes like this. We begin the movie with Jan Morrow. She is a frustrated, rude woman that has no patients. She is also not in any kind of a relationship. I guess she's waiting for the right one to come along. She is sharing a party line with Brad Allen, played by Rock Hudson. He is the opposite of her because he is far from frustrated. He has relationships with the opposite sex every night. In the middle of these two is their friend Jonathan Forbes, played by Tony Randall. Jonathan also happens to want Jan and has no idea Brad even knows her. Jan and Brad have many arguments and they aren't exactly crazy about one another. That's until Brad sees her at a restaurant and overhears who she is. Being that Jan appeals to Brad and that he also feels like screwing with her head, he wins her over and begins a romantic relationship with her. Only she doesn't know who he is. He is Brad Allen on the phone, but with her in person, he is a Texan named Rex Stetson. His western accent hides his real voice that she hears on the phone. When watching the movie, you wonder if she'll find out who he really is. And if she does, what will happen.There are so many funny scenes in this movie that I don't even know where to begin. The three actors in this movie are great together. We have Rock Hudson, Doris Day and Tony Randall, a perfect trio for a romantic comedy. This movie is very funny and fun to watch. This is probably my favorite movie that Rock Hudson and Doris Day made together. See this classic. See this great romantic comedy and you won't be disappointed. Turn it on, get a bowl of popcorn and watch a great movie. It's great for a date night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some films that are absolutely perfect in every way and this is one of them. No matter how many times I see it, I just enjoy every moment, savoring it like a delectable pastry. The fact that the script won an Oscar is indicative of how good the film is. When Doris Day talked to Rock Hudson about the script she said it was very funny and she was right on the money. Apparently, Hudson had some misgivings about doing a light comedy when he had developed into a top flight dramatic actor. He was the top male lead in movies at the time and did not want to do a thing to damage his reputation, but Day convinced Hudson the film would work and they would have fun making it and they did. And they became fast friends too with Day standing by Hudson even during the darkest days of his life with AIDS. The fact that Day and Hudson followed up this film with an equally good one with Lover Come Back is even more incredible. Between Pillow Talk and Lover Come Back Day and Hudson established themselves as one of the great romantic pairs in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock and Doris in bubbly, pastel-colored classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a sex comedy that wouldn't even elicit so much as a blink today. Its outdated values will either amuse or offend. It has a mistaken identity plot that's as old as the hills. A "Rock Hudson &amp; Doris Day relationship" has come to describe a relationship that's wholesome to the point of platonic. Yet, for all its flaws, it's impossible for me to hate "Pillow Talk"! It's a frothy, funny, kitschy comedy whose reputation was nearly destroyed by the awful 2003 comedy "Down With Love" with Renee Zellweger and Ewan MacGregor. Forget the latter film... Hudson and Day are the originals, and they had a special chemistry that's hard to describe, but they really create an innocent magic together. Interior decorator Jan Morrow (Day) and songwriter Brad Allan (Hudson) share a party line in New York City, and Jan is fed up with how Brad monopolizes the phone line to woo various women. Brad is annoyed with Jan's butting in on his "important calls". Predictably, she thinks he's just a heartless womanizer, he thinks she's a nag and a spinster. They have one thing in common: a friend in neurotic, thrice-divorced millionaire Jonathan Forbes (priceless Tony Randall). Jonathan is Brad's boss and is in love with Jan. When Brad discovers this bit of information, he is able to catch a glimpse of Jan in a nightclub and realizes the "lonely busybody" he shares a phone with is quite attractive. He also realizes Jan won't give him the time of day, so he assumes the identity of a guileless Texan, and Jan is soon head over heels... as is Brad. Of course, you know how these mistaken identity plots turn out, and that's when the real fun begins! Once you overlook some of the oh-so-'50s values (Single Jan is secretly unhappy with her life) and awkward handling of hinting at homosexuality (I won't give the scene away, but like all movies in the '50s, homosexuality is treated like Bigfoot: a possibility, but something that most likely doesn't exist), "Pillow Talk" is glossy, escapist fun. Hudson is magnetic and funny as womanizer Brad, and he's almost cartoonishly handsome. He also has fine comic timing and never gets too broad. Day finally escapes the saccharine, unsophisticated image she was burdened with for so long, and she gets all decked out in gorgeous Jean Louis outfits (my favorite is the sleeveless white evening gown with elbow length gloves). Still, I've noticed that Day's look is very inconsistent in "Pillow Talk": she looks innocently sexy in some scenes, but frumpy and jowly in others. Randall is invaluable in the best friend role he would play in all three of the Hudson/Day comedies. With his dragged out inflections and nebbish mannerisms, he the perfect foil for handsome, confident Hudson. Ritter all but steals the movie as Jan's perpetually hungover maid, Alma, who never runs out of quips and offbeat wisdom ("If there's one thing worse than a woman livin' alone, it's a woman sayin' she likes it!"). Once you check your postmodern cynicism at the door, "Pillow Talk" is delicious entertainment in a pastel-colored, martini-soaked alternate universe. So cuddle up with your "pillow-talkin' boy" (or girl) and see Day and Hudson at their best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First (and Best) Doris Day Sex Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Pillow Talk," Doris Day established a mini-genre of her own that would last well into the 1960s, the wholesome sex comedy. These films offered healthy doses of man-and-woman lust but couched them in bubble gum colored sets and silly complicated sitcom plots that made them palatable to the suburban housewife audience.Still, Doris Day deserves kudos for creating a new kind of 50s heroine, one that looked like the dutiful cookie cutter housewife but had a mind of her own and a saucy tongue to go with it. Her strong-willed independence threatened the uber-masculine appeal of her leading men (Rock Hudson, Cary Grant), but did it in such a comical, likable way that audiences loved her rather than hated her for it."Pillow Talk" is funny and mindless, not a bad combination if you're in the mood for it.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DORIS DAY and ROCK HUDSON were at the top of their form in PILLOW TALK, and it was the beginning of a wonderful friendship that lasted through the years, until the actor's untimely death from AIDs.In this sunny romantic comedy, they share a party line (which makes the story dated already), and the comedy stems from their instant dislike for each other that melts only when Hudson happens to see what she looks like at a night club. Realizing he'll never score with her unless he pretends to be someone else, he puts on a Texan accent and proceeds to charm her--until the deception wears thin.With THELMA RITTER as Doris' tipsy maid offering one-liner wisecracks and TONY RANDALL as best friend, the supporting roles are in good hands.It's the only time Doris received an Oscar nomination for her work and well worth seeing for the clever script and sexy situations. This would be the beginning of the sex comedies Day starred in throughout the next decade and still remains the best of the lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable on more than one level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies which can be enjoyed on more than one level. If one is old enough, it can be enjoyed on a nostalgic level, as an example of the antiseptic romance films of the 50's, and the fashions of the period. For younger viewers, it is an excellent example of these to be enjoyed for the first time. It also is interesting in view of the subsequent lives of the two male leads, Rock Hudson and Tony Randall. Hudson, one of the handsomest, most virile presences ever on-screen, of course, lived an entirely different lifestyle in reality, and died tragically of AIDS. In contrast, his "second banana," Tony Randall, who played this role here and in other films (and never "got the girl"), married as an older widower, and with his younger wife, fathered a child at an age when it was possible to become a great grandfather. And for this type of light comedy, the movie has a plot more interesting and clever than that often found in such lighter fare. For most scenes, as was the style of this period, and in films of this genre in the 1950's, the leading lady would appear without a hat and full array of accessories as readily as she'd go barefoot; and a situation had to be extremely casual and informal, before the leading males would even wear a colored dress shirt, much less loosen or remove a tie. In terms of the liberties which story lines can show today versus then, I recall reading that the production team had at least some discussion about possible objections that the scene where Rock carries Doris from her bedroom through the street (with modest pajamas and about 50-pounds of bed coverings) might be too immodest. All-in-all, this movie is a pleasant, entertaining way to spend an hour-and-a half, and get a nostalgic look back at the 1950's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose this was funny in 1959 but it is even funnier today, obviously for different reasons (hey you try and keep a strait face when Rock Hudson goes into the obsterticians office). Don't get me wrong, the original jokes were good, but in hindsight we have about Hudson adds a new dimension to the humor. I mean Rock as a roue, and joking about gay men is too funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to choose one Doris Day picture, I'm pretty sure it would be "Pillow Talk". Here she's rather down-to-earth (thankfully), while Rock Hudson makes a perfect match for her. The film is somewhat naive, however, and there's no doubt about how it will end. Moreover, some might get frustrated on the time the two main characters spend on telephone. But if you can overlook these 'aspects', it's an immensely delightful movie, supplemented with catchy tunes and a wonderfully amusing supporting performance by Thelma Ritter.An extremely pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie when I was 12 or so and I loved it! It's a funny movie from Hollywood's glory days. Rock Hudson and Doris Day made excellent sparring partners and Tony Randall was also very good. I've seen this movie several times and it never gets old. It's also a good movie that you shouldn't be afraid to watch in front of your kids. It's a harmless romantic comedy where you can just sit down and enjoy yourself for an hour and a half or so. Good, clean fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pillow Talk" will undoubtedly gain a new set of fans who discover it on DVD. The colors, split screen work, and the wonderful chemistry between Rock and Doris, who were such great friends, make this a Hollywood classic. Rock's work is especially good in retrospect: he WAS really ACTING! And also spoofing his private life in various scenes (unbeknownst to the audiences of the late 50's). Has a more clever romantic comedy script ever been written? I suppose we could ask Woody Allen. In the mean time, rent or buy this great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pillow Talk didn't invent the antithetical courtship, but it certainly defined how it should be done for all romantic comedies that followed.I'd say easily 60% of the romantic comedies made since 1959 trace roots of their stories and plotting back to this film.Although tame by the standards of the last 30 years, Pillow Talk is a charming and very funny film about a womanizer who disguises his real identity, initially to "bag a babe" that he knows detests him ... if she were to find out who he is.Rock Hudson's performance as the fake Texan tourist in New York is as charming as it gets. Doris Day, in one of her frequent 'virginal' roles, is perfect as the good girl enraged at the inconveniences her "party line partner' puts her through, and at his shameless skirt chasing.Through all this you, the viewer, will wind up rooting for both, in a testament to just how good a job both actors do in putting their 'side' before you favorably as the film progresses.This is a true classic of romantic comedy, and a can't miss film. Truly just as funny today as it was 50 years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have given 'Pillow Talk' 10 out of 10 points because it is a masterpiece of its genre; late 1950s technicolor excess, a squeaky clean Manhattan, squeaky clean sexual innuendo (how refreshing!) and eye-soothing pastel colors to soothe the worst hangover ala Thelma Ritter.To add to the enjoyment is the very funny script delivered with perfect timing and vocal inflections by Rock Hudson, Tony Randall, Doris Day, Thelma Ritter and a supporting cast that makes this delightful fluff a classic of its kind.The music is good, and not too corny, the cars are beautiful and Rock Hudson is shown at the height of gorgeous male pulchritude. For the more modern taste there is a fair amount of homo-erotica. How Rock and Nick Adams must have enjoyed the scene where Hudson slings a drunk Adams over his shoulder and carries him out to the car.Ah, the good old days when secrets were exciting. Alas no more secrets, no more thrill of it all.That's progress (?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a hoot!! Much better than the RomCom/ChickFlicks of today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember growing up in the '70s and seeing this movie pop up two or three times a year on the late movie, back when they had late movies on local channels and not infomercials. I ignored this and other romantic comedies from that era because they were all considered cinematic Pablum by the smarmy ass critics of the time. After seeing it I couldn't help but think that this movie is a gem. There's nothing worst than a romantic comedy that isn't funny or romantic. This movie IS romantic and funny.The movie won an Oscar for best original screenplay and listening to dialogue it's easy to see why. The screenwriters never allowed an opportunity for a one liner to slip by. Not all the funny lines are saved for the big stars many are used by supporting characters and even just by extras and most are very funny. There are two scenes to me that are priceless, the one with Mr. Hudson in the obstetrician's office and the other with 6' 4" Mr. Hudson trying to fit into an MG-TD. Both scenes had me literally rolling on the floor.The acting is wonderful, both Rock Hudson and Doris Day are severely underrated and overlooked performers. They played their characters well and had so much chemistry together despite Mr. Hudson's sexual preference. It just show how good an actor he really is. Miss Day gives her character a strong persona that is sadly missing in the whiny wimps that is common among female RomCom stars today. And Mr. Hudson plays his character with charm, and masculinity something missing among male Rom Com stars (Are you listening Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant). The supporting actors are very much on par with these two big stars. Their timing and their delivery are so right on the money it's unbelievable how at ease they are in what they're doing.The sets and the music are big, brassy, and bold yet the movie wears it like a perfectly fitted Mink coat. I can't believe how so many people derided this movie and others like it. And I am glad that many of those people has learn their mistake and have recognized that this movie specially is a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Featherweight romantic comedy confection (and that ISN'T an insult!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singer-actress Day had a healthy career going prior to this film, but this one revolutionized her career, gave her a snazzy new image and led to countless other "good girl" sex comedies for her until she left the movie biz in the late 60's to honor her TV show commitment (and soon after that, quit the business almost completely!) She plays an interior decorator, successful in every area of her life but love, who shares a party line with a woman-juggling songwriter (Hudson) who enjoys a never-ending parade of conquests, each of whom he makes feel special by "composing" the same exact song in her honor. When his yammering becomes too much to bear, she tells the phone company on him, which does nothing but make him exact revenge on her by posing as someone else and putting the moves on her! Unwittingly stuck in the middle of all this is Day's frequent escort and Hudson's employer, the mild-mannered, easily-perturbed Randall. Things get increasingly out of hand as Day and Hudson romance each other with this big secret in between them while Randall begins to piece together the facts. Day, who producer Ross Hunter said had been unduly hiding one of the wildest rear-ends in Hollywood, shines brightly here. Her Jean Louis clothes are mostly knockouts, she gets to sing a few songs along the way and nobody ever displayed indignation as amusingly and as effectively as she did. Her reactions to Hudson's remarks are priceless. Hudson is tall, dark and handsome, as the clich goes and gives a wonderfully relaxed, but secure, performance. He's allowed to play two characters, actually, as he dupes Day into falling for his southern-fried alter ego. The chemistry these two create is wonderful and it led to two more pairings, always with the indispensable Randall along for the ride as well. The dynamic between the three of them is magical. Ritter appears as Day's liquor-loving cleaning woman and is given a small parade of funny one-liners. Adams has a small role as an over-amorous college boy with the hots for Day. Patrick is her usual dippy and flighty self as his wealthy mother. Blackwell, who bears a resemblance to Gladys Knight, gets in a few musical licks as a nightclub singer who learns of Hudson's duplicity. From the moments the credits begin, this movie has style to spare. It's old-fashioned and simplistic by today's terms, but remains thoroughly engaging and enchanting nonetheless. The sets, the clothes, the creative use of split-screen and the delightful background scoring all combine with the charm of the performers to create a winning and memorable film. Even now, there's something sexy about the famous dual-bathtubs scene, so one can only imagine what that was like in 1959. Day, Hudson and Randall would later team up in "Lover Come Back" and "Send Me No Flowers", but Day would score other hits with similarly handsome costars such as James Garner and Rod Taylor (though nothing could beat what she shared with Hudson. She claimed to have trouble getting through scenes with him, he made her laugh so much.) Strangely, the director isn't particularly well known as he did a terrific job with this and had just come back from a period of blacklisting. What a comeback. The film was a major success. "Paid tribute", in a manner of speaking, by the much later film "Down With Love", this type of film can no longer be made because the type of people in it no longer exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pillow Talk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really miffed when I missed this on TV, I'm a big fan of the lead actress, and then when it was repeated only two months or something later, I was very impressed. Basically composer Brad Allen (Rock Hudson) and interior decorator Jan Morrow (Oscar nominated Doris Day, also singing the opening title song) share a phone line, Jan makes a deal to Brad to have half hour slots for calls, after complaining he is occupying the line with too many calls to girlfriends. They have never met, but from talking to his friend, Jonathan Forbes (Golden Globe nominated Tony Randall), he finds out more about her, and then eventually he gets the opportunity to get to know her. He decides though, knowing her feelings about his phone habit, to give himself a new identity as a Texan country boy, named Rex Stetson. His plan goes off without any hitches, and they do fall for each other. It is obviously Jonathan that is determined to find out more about Jan's love life, and track "Stetson". She does find out and hate him for a while, but there is a good happy, and funny ending. Also starring Oscar nominated Rear Window star Thelma Ritter as Alma, Nick Adams as Tony Walters, Julia Meade as Marie and Allen Jenkins as Harry. Some of the best laughs come from Hudson mixing his two identities together, and making a nurse believing he has female anatomy, and it is a great love story. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Music for Frank De Vol, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy. Doris Day was number 84 on the 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Rock Hudson was number 79 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he is a gay man playing straight, and the film was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Doris Day/Rock Hudson Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was very funny and even was very controversial when it first came out. The scene where Brad/Rex and Jan are talking on the phone is a classic especially the part when their feet "touch". That was the closest you could get to having a sex scene in those days and not get in trouble with The Hays Office. For those who think that this is a sexist, I beg to differ on that point. In those days, women were expected to be barefoot, pregnant and cooking dinner. At least in this film, Doris Day plays a career woman who until the end of the picture shows that you can have a career and still feel fulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the Sixties Happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have but to look at "Pillow Talk" to see why youth rebelled against the plastic world the 1950s offered us. The origins of feminism's fight for freedom can clearly be seen in the almost-armored burden of Doris Day's seeming thousands of ensembles, accessories included, to the hilt. Even when she's alone, her slip and her dressing-gown match, and she wears jewelry with her housecoat. And her hair seems a blond helmet; it and her apparently tattooed-on make-up are as firm and fresh when she leaves her virginal bed each morning as they are when she crawls into it at night. How could a woman have an instant left to think after going through the process of getting rigged up like that (she seems to change outfits ten times a day, as if she were her own Barbie doll). Just inhaling all of that hairspray alone must have addled her reason. However, all this adornment is oddly unrelated to the mating process. Male advances on the presumably attractive object Doris has made of herself are greeted as insulting offenses. Only bad or stupid women fall for Rock Hudson's million-megawatt charm. Doris may be a bit flustered when first hit by Rock's Cinemascope shoulders and boomerang-shaped grin, but her armor protects her. Despite split-screen shots which make them appear to be in bed or bath together, the zippers on Doris' outfits remain firmly locked. I watched several intelligent women go mad from trying to live up to Doris' example, their husbands descend into sullen recluses, and their offspring wind up on prescription drugs from childhood. Something had to give.Coy jokes about castration ("We may be forced to disconnect him."), sight gags about alcoholism, and the treatment of male gayness as a slightly shocking misfortune (a misfortune for the women attracted to them, of course; gay men were considered far too silly and funny to be the objects of any human concern) give a pretty clear image of the rewards and releases that the Eisenhower era offered us. The roots of Woodstock, the Pentagon march, "Hair," and "The Rocky Horror Show" are all there in the incredibly shallow widescreen world of "Pillow Talk."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeVol's score, Hudson's witty performance, Day's "roll eyes" and Thelma Ritter make this a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the dialogue is breezy, clever and outright funny. Rock Hudson delivers his lines with panache. Doris Day defines "roll eyes". Then there's Thelma Ritter. Wow. What a hilarious performance.The music is perfection - you can't beat the first 15 minutes; the integration of DeVol's inspired score, defining each character, emphasizing the comedy of the action and dialogue, is simply brilliant. When the movie begins after the opening credits, focusing on Doris Day's gams with her humming the theme music, continuing the soundscape, you know you're in for a treat.If you want quick pacing, punctuated with witty (for the 50's) dialogue - this is it. Yes, the movie doesn't quite keep up the tightness of the first part but the *wink wink* humour and the pacing are immaculate. The ease with which Hudson and Day work together make this a delight. I now have a new appreciation for Doris Day - her reactions are priceless. The puritanism of Day's character, contrasted with Hudson's peurile and randy motivations, define the 50's sense of humour better than any other movie of the time.What separates this movie from modern comedies is the pacing, the editing, the writing and the acting. Sit back, fluff some pillows, and get ready to laugh. It's no "Trouble in Paradise" or "My Man Godfrey", but it is entertaining. Compare "Pillow Talk" to the countless humourless, slowly- paced modern romantic comedies starring Kate Hudson or Katherine Heigl and the like. There is nobody around today - writers, directors, actors - who could pull of the witty dialogue and wicked-but-so-innocent charm of this Hudson/Day/Ritter vehicle. It's simpy delightful.</fullReview>

Brad is always on the phone with his bevy of girlfriends whom he's juggling around in that they don't know about each other and think that their the only one or one's for him and no one else. It's when Brad, while taking one of his star struck female admirers out to dinner, spots Jan and realizes who she is, the person on his party line, that he decides to work his charm and good looks on her instead of constantly being at odds with Jan. There's only one fly in the ointment in all this! Brad's good friend and who's financing his latest Broadway musicale millionaire and three time divorced Jonathan Forbes, Tony Randall, who's madly in love with Jan and want's to make her wife number four!One of the best screwball comedies of the 1950's and 1960's with the tall dark and handsome Rock Hudson, Brad Allen, trying to get the apple pie all-American girl or women, she's 35 at the time the film was made, Doris Day, Jan Morrow, in the sack with him only to find out that she's involved with his best friend Tony Randall, Jonathan Forbes. There's also a very ironic scene in the film with Hudson, as Brad Allen, using the fake name and persona of Texas oil and cattle millionaire Rex Stetson trying to convince Doris, Jan Morrow, that he, or Brad, is in fact gay or a sissy and doesn't really go for girls in the romantic and manly way of doing things. He just want's to swap recipes with them!There's also the elderly, at age 57, Thelma Ritter as Jan's maid Alma who's ability to put it, booze, away would make legendary boozers like Dean Martin and W.C Fields look like tea totalers in comparison. Elma like every other woman, young &amp; old, in the movie just can't keep her eyes off Rock, or Brad, and ends up drinking the poor guy under the table in a boozing contest that he in fact, in not knowing what he's up against, initiated!***SPOILERS*** Utterly hilarious ending with Brad enraged in how Jan, in him making things up with her, decorated his bachelor pad by making it look like the Presidential Suite at an expensive and high class Paris or New Orleans bordello as he literally kidnaps Jan and takes her there, in her pajamas, to have fun and games with. The movie "Pillow Talk" would end up being one of the biggest money makers of 1959 and spinning off two more like wise and successful adult screwball comedies "Lover Come Back" in 1961 and "Send Me No Flowers" in 1964 reuniting Rock Hudson again with Doris day and Tony Randell as his co-stars in them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, but still funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies, despite the dated plot line. It was the first of the three "Rock Hudson-Doris Day-Tony Randall" sex comedies of the 1960's, although it would be rated G today. Even though Rock Hudson was gay, he could still convincingly play a ladies' man. Ironically, Randall often played milquetoast characters who seemed gay, but was straight as an arrow in real life (but that's how Hollywood was back then; beefy hunks were manly men and skinny guys were portrayed as effeminate).The plot revolves around a shared phone party line (which automatically relegates this to the 60's). Thanks to fiber optics and cell phones, no one today has ever heard of a party line. Anyway, Rock and Doris share the line technically, but songwriter Rock hogs it to call his numerous girlfriends. Doris complains to the phone company which sets off a heated rivalry until Rock sees Doris's Jan Summers and decides to add her to his harem. It requires him to tone down the chauvinism and turn on the charm, to go from boorish Brad Allen to Rex Stetson. Tony Randall plays a friend to both and ends up playing referee between them, to both his pleasure and his chagrin.Director Michael Gordon, who done done mostly minor movies and TV work pulls off a literal gem. He gets Doris to belt out some fabulous tunes ("Possess Me" and "Pillow Talk" among others). He decks her out in terrific wardrobes (including a diamond &amp; turquoise necklace, earring &amp; bracelet set worth $1,000,000!) The split screen format during the phone calls is effective.The musical score and songs are very well done. The use of the piano during the scene at the farmhouse in Connecticut was masterful. Not a word needed to be said. Sure, the plot is dated and you can see the next scene way ahead of time, but Gordon gets such good performances out of Rock and Doris that you will readily dismiss the thought that Doris's character should have seen right through Rock's atrocious Texas drawl right away.There are many funny lines. Rock gets in the perfect subtle dig at Doris when his "Rex" persona takes care of an inebriated Nick Adams who tried to hit on Jan because he liked "older women." Rex: As my mother used to say, never drink anything stronger than yourself. Or older."Randall and Ritter practically steal the movie.Randall: (when visiting Brad and trying to call Jan) "I can never get her on the phone. She shares a line with some nut."(After getting sucker-punched by truck drivers when he tries to stop Jan from crying another 50 gallons of tears) "I've given her up on the advice of my psychiatrist. And my dentist."(After busting in on Jan at his farmhouse after Jan's discovered Rex's ruse) "At least you could have had the decency to bring your own champagne." The scenes where Jan discovers the real truth behind Brad's bachelor pad is a hoot, only outdone by what she does to it at the end of the film.But, the movie really shines with its acting ensemble, most of whom were known for dramas or musicals. Day had won an Oscar for "Que Sera Sera" from "The Man Who Knew Too Much" with Jimmy Stewart and had dazzled America on the airwaves (with "Secret Love") and on the big screen in the musical classic "Calamity Jane." Rock had done westerns and war flicks like "Battle Hymn" and "Giant." Randall was his usual perfect self (he actually didn't make an acting flub until 1982 on the set of "Love Sidney"). All three had no problem transitioning to full-fledged comedy.The supporting cast is wonderful, too. Thelma Ritter ("Rear Window," "Titanic") is excellent, although her character's alcoholism was really nothing to make fun of. Other notables include a pre-"Johnny Yuma" Nick Adams, Hayden Rourke ("I Dream of Jeannie"), songstress Perry Rockwell, Miss France 1954 Jacqueline Beer, "Ed Sullivan" regular Julia Meade, French film legend Marcel Diao and Allan Jenkins (more familiar as the voice of Officer Dibble &amp; Joe Rockhead, among other characters, for Hanna-Barbera).There are some things that don't work in this film. One is Ritter's aforementioned alcoholism (except when she drinks Rock under the table). Another is the homophobia (Brad infuriates Jan by hinting that "Rex" is overly devoted to his mother; ironically, Randall &amp; Rock inadvertently pull off a totally gay moment in a nightclub). Thirdly, Rock and Tony make fun of a fat woman at a restaurant. Finally, when Jan complains to the phone company that Brad might be a sexual pervert, the phone company sends a lone female employee to investigate (there'd be a sure lawsuit today).Also ruining the plot is a completely needless subplot about male pregnancy. The actors involved try to play it serious, but it's so ludicrous and out-of-place, it throws the movie off-kilter.All in all, try to get all three of the Rock-Doris-Tony sex comedies (the other two being "Lover Come Back" and "Send Me No Flowers"; "Lover" is the worst of the three, if only for Doris's absolutely awful wardrobe ensembles). But, if you can only find one, make it "Pillow Talk." It's dated, but still very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a review (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was this film all about anyway? Pillow Talk had some strangely interesting concepts in it. I was a little disturbed by the general plot. Rock Hudson plays the woman chasing Brad Allen and stars opposite Dorris Day, who plays the independent woman Jan Morrow. While the performances are good, and the direction and editing of the film are done tastefully, there is an odd feeling to this film. Perhaps it's the seemingly endless barrage of humor that is to say the least, unique. It certainly was original and the characters grew a little, but it was strange. Rock Hudson's character was played out in typical male dominance and sex role fashion. There are certain things that are to be expected from men at this time in Hollywood (as well as the world) and it is portrayed well. Brad was all about chasing women around until he found out that Jan was hot. This is typical, however the plot thickens when his friend Jonathan (played by Tony Randall), becomes interested in Jan. Brad is all about taking this woman away from him, and doesn't care about hurting anyone's feelings. This is strange, but apparently is the way that men are, at least at this time. I also think that Brad is really more concerned with taking his friends girl then he actually is with beginning a relationship with her. When Brad begins to morph into the "Texan" that Jan wants, so begins the sick and deranged ride down the path to oddness in film. Jan seems like the typical independent woman, but she has a spark of rebellious youth to her, that has to be dealt with. This is shown when Brad takes her back to his place after she redecorates it. He passes all kinds of people in a strange series of shots and imagery which actually shows a police man laughing at the cries for help from Jan. This was perhaps the most disturbing scene for me. This woman was being dealt with because she had wronged this man, and that's all there was to it. She really had no sense of place there, and it seemed that she was obviously not in control.The plot in this film gets even weirder when Brad becomes Rex, and begins to call up and seduce Jan. Jonathan is wary and tells Jan to watch out for him. Brad also tells Jan to watch out for him, which is extremely creepy. He then does just the opposite of what he says he will do. By acting like he is gay, he makes Jan become more and more comfortable with him. This is also a strange thing, because Rock Hudson is a gay man, playing a straight man, pretending to be gay. This is just beyond me and I have no idea if this was purposely done. This was the only thing that seemed to work well, because throughout his life, Rock Hudson was actually pretending to be all of the things that this film was portraying. As Rex, Brad begins to fall in love with Jan and she certainly does the same for him. The lie is unveiled when Jan finds a piece of music that Brad had used to score all kinds of women and she makes the connection. It is an odd choice, because it shows the music bringing out the truth for the woman, and it being the downfall of Brads character. In the end when Brad tries to win back Jan, this is where for me, it just plain gets strange. There are a bunch of scenes that depict Brad trying desperately to get Jan back, and this is so odd. Why anyone would go to these extremes is so confusing to me. Perhaps it was that he could be his "gay" self around her and not have to deal with being something he is not, which is Brad. He liked the idea of being Rex with her and wanted to stay that way. There were several attempts at getting her back and it was made apparent that she wanted nothing to do with him; everyone in the film was pushing her in that direction. This is perhaps because of some kind of strange cultural norm, I don't know why this was happening. Not only was I confused, I was disturbed. As previously stated, the scene with the cop just freaks me out and the scene when Brad takes her back to his place, is just the strangest thing imaginable. He ends up getting what he wants, which seems wrong. The message of this film was that men get what they want, and that's just the way that it is. If you are a woman, be prepared to have men do whatever it takes by any means necessary to get you. I also think that this was a film made at the beginning of an era right before the motion picture production code fell down, and I wonder what this film would have been like, or it would have even been made, if the code had fallen before it was produced. My guess is that it would either have ended up on the cutting room floor (where it belongs), or ended up as some trashy film about the dominance of man. Perhaps the most obscure thing in the film was the message about men. When Brad is forced to get Jan back, he is realizing that he is actually more Rex than Brad. This is saying that deep down inside, all womanizing men either want to, or are actually gay, and shielding it behind some sort of male faade. This is just ridiculous, but perhaps, I have misinterpreted. If that really is the true message of the film, then it leads me to the net logical question, which is why would one make a film with that as its main message? I certainty do not know</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty sauce over doubtful dish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This funny comedy about two people sharing party line with expected romantic complications revived Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Universal studios fortunes. It started a whole cycle of sex comedy films in the 60's.Tony Randall and Thelma Ritter add great support.What rankles is the subtle smug undercurrent that Doris can't be happy until she bags a man! All the men seem to be sexist pigs that make women easy game.The point is softened under pretty color,witty dialogue,and fine direction.You'll notice that Doris never actually owns any business she works at.She's bossed by a man.Even the supposedly professional woman sent by the phone company to see Rock can"t resist him. Some comment on women in the business world.Still,it's a funny film and has great Doris Day role</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining But Dated Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies that were controversial during the Hollywood Golden Age are rarely still controversial in the contemptuous decade of the 2010s; Pillow Talk is yet another reminder of this notion. Back in 1959, S-E-X was on the shitlist of every major movie studio, but audiences were sickening of perfumey, sanitized entertainment. Doris Day was the epitome of that cloying wholesomeness ? to the world, she was the 40 year-old virgin, a woman carrying all the sexiness of your mom. So imagine. It's 1959. You're sitting in a theater, waiting for your movie to start. Then, a preview for Pillow Talk comes on. You see Doris Day, her buttery voice in the background, singing the title theme. You automatically roll your eyes. But then, Rock Hudson, playing a womanizing cad, blames Day's hygienic uptightness on her lack of action in the bedroom. You're taken aback. Since when have "bedroom problems" been discussed in a movie?Naturally, everyone saw the film when it was released; it made $19 million (which was considered to be a blockbuster in the penny-for-an- ice-cream decade), renewed Day's status as a bona fide movie queen, and reestablished Hudson's box-office appeal. It was the talk of the town, a "racy" romantic comedy that could be charming but also risky.But now, Pillow Talk is merely a charming romantic comedy without the racy riskiness it carried in 1959. Doris Day is still about as sexy as your mom and the film is still perfumey, even if it is a little less sanitized than other rom-coms of the decade. Yet, Day and Hudson are attractive. The CinemaScope makes even the gaudiest of colors feel chic and nostalgic. The exchanges between the characters are sitcomy in an I Love Lucy way. The ballsy courageousness of Pillow Talk has severely waned over the years, but its appeal hasn't.Day portrays Jan Morrow, an interior decorator, and Hudson plays Brad Allen, a playboy musician. They live in the same apartment building and are forced to share a telephone party line; naturally, Jan accidentally interrupts many of Brad's gooey conversations with various women. She scoffs. She needs to make calls too, after all. Jan goes to the telephone company to complain, but the employee they send to resolve the situation is seduced by Brad. Of course. Jan has never seen her enemy in person, but if she did, she'd surely sock him.Well, that's what'd you think. When the two bump elbows at a local restaurant one night, Jan, unaware of who Brad actually is, is instantly smitten. Brad, meanwhile, knows who she is as his best friend is taken with her himself. But the former is surprised to find how much he is attracted to Jan, even if she does have bedroom problems. In panic, he devises a Southern accent and a fake name to fool her. Brad finds himself in quite a pickle, however, when the romance begins to take a more serious turn.The chutzpah in Pillow Talk is not balls-to-the-wall daring, but rather, hesitant, somewhat unsure of its footing. If it makes a sex joke, a double-entendre of sorts, it covers it with a sheen of CinemaScope glamour. It's a precursor to the soon-to-be sexual revolution. But if the film's gutsy movements aren't as penetrative as they once were, then there should be a much bigger focus on its stars. Day has become the underdog when reflecting on vintage films, as more attention is turned towards the voluptuous Marilyn Monroe or the exotic Sophia Loren. But she is a true talent, effortlessly at ease in her performances and radiant when she sings. She is at her best in Pillow Talk, marking a new name for herself in bright red permanent marker and knowing it will stick. The chemistry between Hudson and Day is uncomplicated and natural, transitioning smoothly from comedy foils to love interests.These days, you can see Pillow Talk's influence. Some scenes have the pupil staining pigmentation of an Almodvar film. Others contain the split screen camera-work that would plague mod '60s capers and various television shows. If it hasn't aged well in consideration to the new age, then Pillow Talk should be seen as a template, a quintessential romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Ten Comedy with a Real-Life Kicker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is magic. One of the top 10 comedies of all time in the same rank as 1) The Producers and 2) Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Doris Day and Rock Hudson were a magic (can't stop using this adjective for this film) combination. The plot, dialog, character development, and production techniques were absolutely terrific. Rock is the lovable, hunk lecher using a false identity to seduce Doris; she is the beautiful, intelligent, gutsy, unattainable women who eventually almost succumbs just before she discovers his true identity. Tony Randell (as the jealous, unsuccessful lover) and Thelma Ritter (as Day's earthy, tipsy maid) give supporting character performances so funny and likable that you will not see their equal more than once a decade. The twists and turns of the plot ending are great. This is a great, feel-good comedy from 1959 before the darkness of the 60s arrived, but without the sappiness that existed in many of the 40s and 50s movies. But for pure existential weirdness, years later Rock died of AIDS, and the world discovered that he was homosexual and had no sexual interest in women. I enjoy this movie every time I see it, but this dark background motif keeps going through my mind, and once again proves that Hollywood and human nature are a study in good and bad. This movie is so good that most of the time I can block out images of Rock kissing guys. Aaaggghhh!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen lots of movies from this time period and this is without a doubt the most degrading movie I have ever seen. This sure sends a great message to women-go ahead and marry a man who completely humiliates you because after all, any man is better than no man. Sheesh. I would never let my daughters watch this garbage. Really sad.</fullReview>
