		<shortDescription>One of the most romantic movies I've ever seen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been starved for a great romantic film and YOU'VE GOT MAIL more than sated my appetite! I'd rank it right up there with CASABLANCA as one of the most romantic movies of all time. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have more chemistry than a High School Science Department! This movie was warm, funny, smart, and sexy. Tom and Meg light up the screen and Tom Hanks is the perfect hero! The movie was 2 hours long, felt like 10 minutes, and I didn't want it to be over! This is a definite keeper, and I can't wait for it to come out on video so I can watch it again and again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable film! Such a warmth and happiness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm from Germany and I love this film! It makes me happy to just watch it! When watching this film one comes to think why in real life such beauty in words and moments can't be achieved! The film does'nt get boring, even if watched for the 23rd time! It's pure magic - you could endlessly listen to the conversations, the beautiful music and enjoy the excellent acting! Other films try to come in too trendy with freaky music and sexual content(not that there's anything wrong with that) - but it's not a feelgood movie! Besides the puns and the lovely warm hearted atmosphere does the rest! To everyone who hasn't yet seen this movie - rent it, buy it - enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romantic comedies are not everyone's cup of tea; after all, who would want to watch unrealistic stories about ordinary people 'coupling' when we are offered such wonderful everyday experiences as ten car pileups, hordes of people being slaughtered in a hail of bullets while shopping, goblins, explosions, vampires and intergalactic spaceships?But the majority of women, and many of those men who do not see themselves as the Governor of California will surely find much to like in this charming eye-moistener.Tales of this ilk can easily be mawkish, but this one largely avoids the trap, thanks to an intelligent script, the believability of the lead pair (as well as the supporting cast) and good pacing that leaves the denouement until the closing shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so much better than I expected, which was a simple romantic comedy with predictable "pass each other in the street" scenarios throughout. I was pleasantly surprised to find a love story that touched my heart. Kathleen's vulnerability and pride in her mother made me cry and Joe's sensitivity and devious behavior were so very sweet.I didn't think that Tom Hanks &amp; Meg Ryan could pull off a romance better than they did in Sleepless In Seattle but I am happy to be mistaken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Chemistry, likeable characters make this film work"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In films like You've Got Mail, where you can almost predict how it's going to turn out as soon as the opening credits appear, then it is up to the writers, director, and actors, to get us to enjoy the journey to the end credits. Nora and Delia Ephron's script succeeds because they know their characters well, and give them a can't miss plot device. Tom Hanks is believable as the head of a gigantic bookstore chain, as is Meg Ryan as the owner of a small children's bookstore shop. As the guy who is putting Meg out of business by opening a chain store close to her little shop, Tom Hanks character comes across as the arrogant person who only goal seems to open as many bookstores as he can, and make as much money as he can in doing so. When he is talking to Meg Ryan on the internet, we see another side of him, and learn that possibly, he's not the evil guy you think he is. Of course, in person, Meg hates him for what he is doing, on the internet, she falls in love with him. This is what makes the film work, as their reaction to each other in person is completely different from when they talk on line. Some people may quibble that the ending is not very believable, but face it, do you fall in love with a person because of who they are, or what you think they are? I think this question is answered quite adequately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised to find "Mail" not to be a rehash of "Sleepless." Ryan and Hanks do work exceptionally well together! Three-quarters into the movie I was wondering how they would ever pull off a romantic and yet believable ending, but the scene at the garden was one of those perfect moments in filmmaking. It just rang true and consistent with the story.I really enjoyed this one! (And hearing Harry Nilsson's music again, used so beautifully, was icing on the cake!)</fullReview>

I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan and I collect all of his movies, and it has been quite some time since i've seen a really good and special movie of his. He's just such a wonderful actor and Meg Ryan's just... Well, she's just so great, always happy and when she's acting she always makes me laugh, cause she's just so wonderful! Let's talk about this movie: I'm gonna be honest with you, this isn't Forrest Gump or The Green Mile, but it is romantic, special, wonderful and it made me smile and wish for them to get together in the film, and in the end I was just happier then before!

		<shortDescription>Cookie-cutter romance, but Meg Ryan radiates with charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pleasant, undemanding fluff reworks 1940's "The Shop Around the Corner" (remade initially in 1949 as the musical "In The Good Old Summertime") and reteams Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan for the second time in genial plot about rival bookstore owners. She operates a Mom &amp; Pop bookshop, he's opening another outlet in his retail chain nearby; they lock horns over business, yet are unaware they are also each other's internet pen-pal. Slick and occasionally too-cute, but very entertaining picture with a holiday theme. Ryan is delightful, Hanks less so (he's rote, and looks tired to boot), but Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton and Steve Zahn make up a terrific supporting cast. Engaging and lots of fun. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9 on a scale of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was hard not to give this movie a 10, but since I have only given out about 20 10's in all the movies I have ever seen - thousands, a 10 here would have been a little too generous.Though, it is difficult to find fault, I suppose it is fair to say that the movie didn't always have full steam - especially early on. Still, even during those times, it was interesting. I mean, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. What else do you need?Additionally, I didn't laugh very much. Not that I was required to, but this genre would, after all, be considered a romantic comedy. Despite the lack of laughs, it was as feel good as it gets.The movie was blessed with two great actors, a creative idea, excellent writing and directing. And, the ending was one for the ages. I might have chosen to "tweak" it a little, but it was about as good as you will ever see - assuming you like romance. I do!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute, sugary, but ultimately worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually drawn to the stereotypical "cute chick flick," but while You've Got Mail unabashedly falls into this category, I still loved it. Mail is a clever story, cleverly acted by Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. I enjoyed it more than their last joint project, Sleepless in Seattle simply because the immensely likeable pair were onscreen together so much more. Some will dub the movie predictable and sappy, but hey, I wasn't looking for deep psychology, just a friendly feel good. If that's what you're after, Mail delivers. Hanks and Ryan have the greatest onscreen chemistry I've seen, and the last half hour of the film is right on target. While the happy ending was inevitable, I was curious to discover exactly how it would occur. Sugar-coated it was, but charming and thoroughly enjoyable!!! A few bits of dialogue were a little too cute for my taste, but overall, You've Got Mail is more sweet than sugary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laszlo's Play Makes It's Third Film Appearance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have been reading the last three reviews I did, this is the natural concluding review of the sequence. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, and SHE LOVES ME all were based (in the central plot about two people at loggerheads in physical life, falling in love through anonymity in pen-pal letters) on Miklos Laszlo's PERFUMERIE. They all had their differences in a secondary plot dealing with the jealousy of the owner of the store towards the hero (his closest employee) resulting in his firing the hero due to a serious mistake by the employer. This was jettisoned and altered in the middle film, but resumed in the Kander and Ebb musical of the 1970s (made into a television version in 1978). But that version actually gave the actual villain a parting shot in his last song, showing he was down, but not out, and would still find a way of getting an undeserved success.When Nora Ephron did her version of the play in this screenplay, the jealousy angle was dumped, and the concentration was on the business antagonism between the hero and heroine (here Tom Hanks as Joe Fox, and Meg Ryan as Kathleen Kelly). Hanks and Ryan do not work at the same store as James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan or Van Johnson and Judy Garland did. Hanks works at a mega book store (Fox Books) like Barnes and Noble. Ryan runs a small neighborhood book store for children, called "The Shop Around The Corner" (Hanks takes her to task for that name, saying it can't be claimed as a single corporate name). Fox Books is moving into the neighborhood that Ryans's store is in, and she fights it's irresistible push - in vain as it is. In the end not only is she the loser, but members of her staff get hired by Fox Books as well.There are other elements here that do not come out in the original version or the 1949 version. The protagonists don't write letters, but are sending e-mails to each other. Times are changing, and the discovery of a small notice in the newspaper's classified for a pen-pal is replaced by Ryan meeting Fox accidentally in surfing the internet and finding a chat room (a scene we are told of, but never see). In the 1949 film, Garland was pursued (if you will - somewhat weakly) by Johnson's friend and fellow employee Buster Keaton. Johnson was linked (by Garland) to a female friend who was a violinist. Neither relationship was that strong or threatening to the eventual Johnson-Garland relationship. But for the first half of YOU'VE GOT MAIL, Ryan is living with a self-righteous newspaper columnist (Greg Kinnear), and Hanks is living with a self-centered publisher (Parker Posey). We barely knew the families of Sullivan and Garland (we saw an aunt or two that they lived with). Here we know that Ryan's mother is dead, but her grandmother Birdie (Jean Stapleton) is alive and thriving. In fact we learn Birdie is rich due to a stock investment and that she once dated John Randolph, Hanks' grandfather. In fact, we even learn that Birdie romanced one of the most interesting political figures of 20th Century Europe. Hanks' family is developed too, beyond Stewart's or Johnson's (or Ellis's for that matter). Besides grandfather Randolph (about to remarry), we see Hanks' father (Dabney Coleman), who keeps running through wives and never finding the right mate. We also meet Hank's aunt and brother.The film worked well again, and just as the early pairs of couples (Stewart and Sullivan, Johnson and Garland) had good chemistry, so did Hanks and Ryan. This was their third film together (people forget they did JOE AND THE VOLCANO first), and the second film (after SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE) with Ephron at the helm. With all the modernization and story changes, and character histories, and assaults on the concept of mega-stores (check the scene where Hanks hears an inept salesman in the children's book section), Epron managed to show the old warhorse by Mr. Laszlo still had plenty of juice in it to go down well with the public. My guess is that like Lubitsch's original film it will end up a classic version of the story. My wonder is what will be the next version be like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They "Mail"--ed It In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie on cable again, and have to say what an uninspired waste. We've seen this so many times before, and it seemed as if everyone from the Ephron sisters to Hanks to Ryan were just cashing a paycheck. No subtleties whatsoever. The ending really angered me, too. Was it just me, or did Hanks' character spend the last quarter of the movie manipulating Ryan's character needlessly? The final scene would have rung much truer if, rather than sobbing and kissing him once he revealed himself to be her on-line paramour, Ryan's character instead slapped him in the face for screwing with her head. If you must indulge in such romantic piffle, you can see essentially the same movie by renting "When Harry Met Sally." But then you would also get the added bonuses of performances that aren't so paint-by-numbers, some actual humor, and a few likeable supporting characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You gotta pay attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first comment here so I have decided to comment on a film that has received very mixed reviews. A few despise it, a few hail it as a classic, and the majority either find it decent or below average. Massive SPOILERS BABY, WATCH OUT! Anyway, I have seen all or the majority of this film about 6 times at least, either on HBO or on our copy on video. And it gets better and makes more sense each time I see it.First I am gonna set some facts straight (people who havent seen it stop now). I am going to try an explain many of the things people obviously didnt get. Now some people have serious issues with this film, and some people are inserting points in the story that dont exist, like one reviewer saying "Her life gets oh-so much better after he has clobbered her book shop and gives her a job at his big phallic megamart". Now if you actually PAID ATTENTION you would know that after she is closed down she becomes a Childrens book author, which is right up her alley. It would be great if she could keep her store and its still very sad that dream is gone but becoming a childrens book author is just as much of dream for her, one that she never expected to realize.This is what I mean by paying attention folks. Just about everyone (especially us men) had a preconceived notion that this film is just innoucous fluff and doesnt require much attention to enjoy. And they have ended up missing half the film and not even getting the facts right. And if you dont pay attention to this film you could end up really not liking it.Joe is not a remorseless businessman at heart ever, he feels remorse at when he zings an enemy (he explains that early on while emailing Shopgirl, and Shopgirl on the other hand desires to aquire some of that zing that Joe has since she is so wholesome that she cant come up with zingers all that quickly). His motto of "its not personal, its business" is his way of reassuring himself and ignoring his concience. The only time he is ever really mean to Kathleen is the scene early on at the little convention. Well before he knew Shopgirl was Kathleen. And after that is when confides to Shopgirl the remorse he feels over those comments and that side of his personality in general (mentioned in parentheses above). A few people were creeped out by Tom Hanks actions, and there was no reason to be. One guy even compared it to stalking, which is sooooo way off I wont dignify it with a response, except that he definatly paid no attnetion.NY152 technically never stood her up, and Kathleen figures that out at the end. The writers had two options when they meet in the cafe the first time, He could have come clean there or shortly thereafter or they could go the direction they did. I'm sure the writers considered the other option. But it would make things very muddled. Kathleen would have a very difficult choice, with the personality "NY152" she adores so much belonging the seemingly cold and heartless Joe Fox would very easily be enough for her to give up on "NY152" altogether and move on. And what kind of movie would that make? I can understand why Joe withheld that info in the cafe, He was coming to terms with all of this himself, the persona he adores online being the same person he is putting out of business. His business just became very personal. And she has no idea. From the moment Joe finds out "Shopgirl" is Kathleen he contemplates giving up on the whole thing. But he goes in and talks to her as Joe Fox. And he finds out how deep her dislike of Joe is (she is finally able to put together the mean words she wants to). Of course he is hurt that this woman who is so cold to him is the same woman he anonymously adores.Its the little chat with dad in the boat that convinces Joe to pursue the relationship. In fact its the final line of that chat which does, and its very easy to miss. Right in the next scene Joe visits her at her apartment. And This scene is pivotal. When he first shows up she resists his charm and is still rather cold to him. But now she realizes what NY152 was talking about earlier when they talked about saying exactly what you want to say when confronted with an enemy. So she tries to not be so cold to him, though she still thinks he is slime. During this scene Joe turns on the charm and starts to reveal that he is not such a bad guy (which we already knew) and he is remorseful about what has occured. They learn a fews things during this scene. The rest of the film up to the end is basically the two of them becoming friends. When NY152 tells shopgirl he has a project he is "tweaking" he means he is trying to be friends with Kathleen, which even he had said himself was almost impossible but if they connected so well over the internet there is no major reason to not connect as well in real life, except for the one hurdle. At the end of the Apartment scene Joe hints quite a bit at the internet relationship without giving it away. Kathleen begins to suspect I think. And this is what warms her up to him, is the similaritys between him and NY152. A late line by Joe sums it up, where he says NY152 is waiting for Kathleen to be primed, so that she is convinced that NY152 is "the guy". In fact he is partially talking about himself becoming friends with her so she is more receptive to him. He did NOT manipulate her. He simply tried and succeeded to become friends with her simply as Joe Fox. Well thats enough for now, I have practically transcribed scenes to help some of the more ignorant critics. In short I liked this movie at first, and I love it now. I liked Sleepless and I like lighter romantic comedies in general (though I dont like the Julia Robert's romantic comedies, I dont care for her in general). This one may be my favorite though. A very interesting, well paced (people who thought it was slow werent paying enough attention) and definatly cutesy and sweet but excellant nonetheless and a step above Sleepless in Seattle IMO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that most people commenting liked this movie, but I was disgusted. I watched it with my wife (who likes the genre) and she loved it. To me, watching the Hanks character knowfully and unremorsefully destroy the life and memories of someone he "loves" and then watching the story bring them together was nearly painful. It was like watching a light-hearted movie about a woman who falls in love with a man who she slowly realizes is the fellow who had stalked and brutally violated her.Maybe I'm the one who's wrong here, but I sure don't find this movie's premise to be that "cute".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A modern romance set in New York. Two people who are in stagnant relationships fall for each other online. Kathleen Kelly is the owner of a children's book store, Joe Fox is her competition. He runs a chain of bookstores that is putting her out of business. They wind up as heated rivals. Little do they know that they have fallen for each other online. I'm a guy that loves a good romance story. I like chick flicks, sue me. I was looking forward to this one after enjoying Sleepless in Seattle. This movie was as phony as a two-dollar bill. Please spare me the "Magic of movies" BS as well. These were not real people as far as I'm concerned. Hanks and Ryan's characters are so poorly written that I didn't care about them or their plights. I also thought that despite all the evidence to the contrary, Meg Ryan's character never realized that Joe was her online love interest. It took almost two hours for her to figure it out fully? Give me a break. I love both Tom Hanks &amp; Meg Ryan, but this is a rather boring romantic comedy that did absolutely nothing for me. Believe it or not. This was the third collaboration between Hanks &amp; Ryan. The first two were Joe Vs The Volcano and Sleepless in Seattle. Sleepless in Seattle was far from perfect as well, but it was at least charming. This movie tries so hard to replicate the success of that movie, but it isn't creative enough to pull it off. The storyline is potentially a winner, but it is done very generically. When all is said and done, it's your typical "I hate you, love you" storyline that you've seen many times. Another problem with this movie, is that it's rather mundane. There were a few occasions where I looked at the time to see how much was left. The performances are alright. Tom Hanks is solid as per usual, but I wouldn't say he's at his best. His character is a bit too unsympathetic for most of the movie. Meg Ryan can do this type of stuff in her sleep. She's witty and charming, but a bit uninspired. Their chemistry felt off as well. David Chapelle is OK as the comedic relief. The last 15 minutes are actually good. It left me wondering where this was in the first place when this movie sorely needed it. I didn't hate it, I just didn't care for it at all. It has it's moments, but not nearly enough of them. The star power is enough to make this a watchable experience, but don't expect many sparks or magic. 5.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YOU'VE GOT MAIL - If you have, I advise you to go and read it. Even if it's one of those e-mail jokes you've been sent ten times before, it'll still probably be funnier than this movie. It's hard to believe that the team that made Sleepless in Seattle could go so badly wrong. Don't get me wrong - I expected clichés and contrived situations. I realised that it'd all turn out alright in the end. But I still thought there might be the occasional funny line or winning moment along the way.Instead Meg Ryan has somehow got the words charming and imbecilic confused. She meant to play one but played the other. Tom Hanks - he does a very good impression of . . . Tom Hanks. It's obviously not written by anyone who actually uses e-mail and the plot line is as thin as a piece of thread. This is romantic comedy by numbers but in this case, they just don't add up.OK, the dog is good, and so is Parker Posey as Tom Hanks's career-crazy girlfriend but both are sadly under-used. Believe me, this film has no redeeming features. Even the music is terrible. Watch at your peril.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sleepless in Seattle" was good, no question."You've Got Mail??" Well, you're gonna love or hate this one. Which is which? It is a righteous two-hour romantic comedy that plays almost similar to a mellow sitcom. Like Nora Ephron's SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, it tries to mimic something from a golden age classic on a black and white print. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan still have their proper roots to make this worth sitting on a loveseat with Kleenexes., even if two of their worlds don't exactly collide. It's the Internet jargon that sputters, letting this emotional (???) experience go wishy-washy right where it is (at this current moment) senseless to produce a cyber-love romance. For a movie that does brilliant with storytelling, the Internet idea is mighty cute (and rare!, but in the end, it was lacking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an all right movie, but can I make just one little observation? If the movie is trying to make a social statement about big book chains with no personality (like Hank's Fox Books) greedily driving the little stores with charm (like Ryan's Shop around the Corner) out of business, how is it that the filmmakers chose to put every other scene in a Starbucks? Starbucks has undoubtedly forced more little shops out of business that any big book chain has.This doesn't mean that it's not an enjoyabe movie. But it takes something away from Meg's righteous indignation when she woefully closes the bookstore and then goes to suck down a Mochacino.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take two popular everyman megastars already entrenched in the bankrolls of the Hollywood machine. To this add for spice one of the queens of INDy film and for nostalgia Edith Bunker; mix well. Throw in a huge dose of Republican conservative nonapologetic conformist tripe disguised as the good guys vs. the bad guys. Bake for 1 hour plus occasionally sprinkling over 60s liberal ideas and 90s wealth at any cost philosophies. Out will come a new millennium cake pallatable for the masses that says the rich aren't evil, being poor is evil and when you lose your business it is so you can write the next best seller and be on Oprah and join those rich happy people who God loves most and gives more to because they deserve it! How in just half a century did a story about clerical basals living in boarding houses and struggling to meet another human being with similar interests become the story of a superstore who is the new Shop Around the Corner you needn't fear? The sad fact is we are left in this version feeling the liberal individual was better for being homogenized into the larger aggressive hoardes swelling Wall Street. This is what the bankers wanted to say, after all, and Mr. Hanks and Ms. Ryan were the willing puppets for their shadow play. Or, perhaps Mr. Hanks really wants to be feeling and genuine and Ms. Ryan would love to have brass balls beneath her kilted skirt that swung out so far it could smash the men who got in her way? You choose. Either way, I smell a rat! It is of interest that since this movie came out: America has been kneecapped by the MidEast with a weak dollar and shrinking middle class (if any);we have a 1-party system parading as 2; and we are a very disturbed culture based on violence greed and celebrity. This all happened while we were sleeping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail (1998): Dir: Nora Ephron / Cast: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Dave Chappelle, Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear: Dreadfully predictable romantic comedy about connecting and communication. Third film collaboration between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. They make contact via e-mail while their poorly written significant others continue to dissatisfy them. Introducing them both as single would have left out this unnecessary rubbish. They are required to pass each other on the street and not know it, etc. Ryan owns a family bookstore handed down to her from her mother. Hanks is the son of the owner of a bigger bookstore around the corner that threatens her business. They are required to hate each other until the conclusion where Ryan cannot figure out the bloody obvious. Bookstore rivalry works but what follows is total idiocy. Director Nora Ephron is reworking Sleepless in Seattle but unfortunately she didn't counter the bullshit until Hanks came clean. Hanks does his best with the predictable tripe. Ryan plays a total airhead who cannot figure out that Hanks is sending the e- mails despite his sudden interest. Parker Posey and Dave Chappelle play flat supporting roles. And as in Sleepless in Seattle, Greg Kinnear gets to play that unnecessary boyfriend not needed for the plot. Purposely repeating Sleepless in Seattle but Ryan's airhead ways render this a return to sender. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts out in a promising way, small bookstore owner Meg Ryan is about to be put out of business by mega-store guy Hanks, with the twist being that they are also anonymous e-mail friends. It was a good premise for a romantic comedy, and Hanks and Ryan have done well together in the past, but the storyline becomes contrived and implausible, and the whole thing falls apart. It's as if the execs in charge wanted to do Sleepless in Seattle again, instead of just doing their best with this movie as it stood. You've Got Mail runs way too long, and I really had a problem with Ryan's increasingly warm feelings towards Hanks, who is trying to put her out of business. Totally implausible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can only say this: Rip off. This is practically the same movie as the 1940 James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan movie called "The Shop Around the Corner." Except it's not nearly as good. In fact, as a whole, it's terrible. And it's FUNNY that too because it is a rip off of that other film, and the other film was so good. You'd think a remake would be somewhat appealing. The 3/10 is a pity vote... I only rated that high because of Tom Hanks. I like Hanks. I also liked The Godfather references. "Take him to the mattresses." "Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday." But...It was a really unappealing film. Jimmy and Maggie might just be rolling over in their graves. I know I would. Give me the original ANY day. It was such a better film overall... You don't just get intimate with Stewart and Sullivan's characters in the movie, but you get a good taste of everyone else involved. There seems to be more depth to the minor characters. Hell, even the errand boy, who proves to be a rather vital part (as he saves the other guy from killing himself after learning that one of his employees is having an affair with his wife). There are creative and detailed subplots that entwine itself with the romance plot between Kralik (Stewart) and Novak (Sullivan). I felt that "You've Got Mail" was weak in that respect; it was focused too much on those two characters that everything else was overshadowed, leaving the world they were leaving in and the other characters that interact with them in this bland shade of gray. So in a crude sense, you could say that this new movie was "half-baked" in a sense. If not for Hanks, it simply wouldn't be worth my while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hated this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, maybe I don't hate it as much today as I did when I first saw it.When I learned they were making a modern day version of my favorite movie "The Shop Around The Corner", (actually, I love the musical version with Judy Garland much better, titled "In The Good Old Summertime"), I was so happy.Then I saw it, and with the exception of the scene where Tom Hanks and Dave Chappell first see that Meg Ryan is his email pal, while she is waiting for him in a restaurant, the whole movie is completely different, and not for the better if you ask me.First of all, I would never, ever forgive anyone who shut down my mother's beloved shop, I don't care if he is Tom Hanks.Second, the movie doesn't have what I think is one of the best elements of both the original and the musical version, these were two ordinary people leading ordinary lives. The male character was a struggling salesman who works hard to impress his manager, a hard, but vulnerable man. And the woman was desperate to get a job for the holiday season and when the male refuses to give her a job, she goes right over his head and gets it from his boss, thus setting up a great rivalry between them. And while there was some rivalry between Tom and Meg's characters, there was no passion, or real sexual tension between them.This is a typical, Nora Ephron movie. Taking something that wasn't broke and making it worse.Too bad.</fullReview>

Maybe it's Tom Hanks and his ever smug niceness, which is really blinding us from seeing his real evil.Whatever is wrong, I don't know...this movie is just not right. Just as Pretty Woman - there is only pretty faces covering a story of something cruel and heartless and disturbing. However, we don't see it because of the pretty Meg Ryan and her perkiness smile.Another story - overdone by the media to hide the real truths about the evil corporations...the evil suits on Wall Street dn the clones they have turned our cities and towns into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Fox is the son of wealthy bookshop chain, Fox books opening a new store in Manhattan. Kathleen Kelly runs a small children's bookshop across the street from the new proposed store. She has been in business for several generations and the new chain threatens to put her out of business. Naturally Joe and Kathleen's animosity reaches new levels with every public meeting. However both have online identities and are, unknowingly, involved in an email relationship with each other. As their professional lives become more stressful their anonymous email relationship becomes increasingly intimate. Until Joe finds out that his email partner is indeed his business rival.In a shameless attempt to cash in on the click flick appeal of Sleepless in Seattle Nora Ephron reunites with the two stars for a repeat. However as with Runaway Bride, simply wheeling in the old elements of a successful film and hoping the magic just happens to work again. The plot here is a lazy adaptation of The Shop Around the Corner (with James Stewart). The idea is so basic that it fails to convince. The problem is that the whole thing is so damn twee that it just feels to sugary and sentimental to be believable.First off the characters exist in this sort of posh upper-class Manhattan life that isn't like any life I've ever lived. They live in a warm cocoon that is annoying and not real life for all but the most fortunate elements of New York society. Secondly the fact they meet in twisted circumstances and is deeply contrived. This just gets worse and worse and the plot just bends over backwards to allow our characters to do whatever they want. The final 15 minutes is so unlikely given what's gone before that it is just silly.Hanks is on auto-pilot here doing this chubby faced clowning thing. He isn't a real character but just his usual good guy caricature. Ryan is even lazier. She is so sappy and sentimental that it made me want to b*tch slap her till she just grew up. Her performance is so very average that I never felt for her situations once. She was not a real person to me at any point. Supporting characters are not in effect. Sleepless in Seattle was not a perfect movie but the support cast was good enough to add some foundation (Reiner, Pullman Pierce and O'Donnell). Here we have potential ? Parker Posey and Greg Kinnear ? but they're just not used well at all and add nothing to the film. It like the film knew it needed to have a supporting cast but just didn't know what to do with them.The film is not bad, just distinctly average and merely passes the time rather than entertains. Ephron at her best is hard to stomach at times, but on auto-pilot her brand of sentimental romantic `comedy' is barely worth sitting still for. Lazy and mushy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional rape? -- spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers alert* After seeing this movie, my husband and I just could not believe that Meg Ryan's character, Kathleen Kelly, would fall for Tom Hanks' character, Joe Fox. First off, and most disturbing, Joe finds out who Kathleen is and lets their online relationship continue without telling her. He manipulates her into falling more deeply in love with him, and he lets her business go down without lifting a finger to help her. We're supposed to believe that Kathleen, who likened her shop going out of business to "her mother dying all over again," would rush into his arms at the end? We're supposed to believe that she wouldn't mind that he pulled her strings like a puppeteer in what can aptly be described as an emotional rape, and she would be willing to overlook this? Second off, we don't believe that if the roles were reversed, anyone would think that this was okay. If Kathleen was the ruthless chain-store business owner, and Joe was the warm-hearted independent bookseller, she would be perceived as irredeemably corrupt (because women aren't supposed to do well in big business) and Joe would never cave in to her advances, because to do so would allow his masculinity to be trampled on.</fullReview>

At the same time, he starts a e-mail relationship with Meg Ryan, who owns a small bookstore in the same area. As it happens, Meg Ryan's bookstore is utterly destroyed by Hanks chain, and has to fold up. Yet, when at the end, she learns of his identity, she stills agrees to go out with him! Is she a masochist or something?. This pretends to be a romantic comedy but, believe me, you leave this movie with a very bad taste on your mouth. That's a problem with many American movies that try to be critical of capitalism, but they end up embracing it (case in point: Jerry Maguire). Capitalism is too much in America's DNA for a Hollywood movie to be too critical of it.</fullReview>

I enjoy it and I think you will too. I give it a seven because Tom Hanks character was kind of a prick, and it was just not as timeless feeling as I'd like, veering closely to the a cookie cutter RomCom a la Katherine Heigl, for me. I feel this way probably because Meg's character is much more insipid as opposed to past similar roles she's played. But maybe I just need another re-watch...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two business rivals hate each other at the office but fall in love over the internet. The owner of a large bookstore chain starts putting the owner of a small local bookstore out of business. Meanwhile they have been corresponding over the internet without knowing who either of them are. They can't stand each other in person but over the internet they are very attracted. He finds out who she is but she doesn't know. He starts to like her more but she still hates him. He has to fix it. Roger Ebert wrote "The movie is sophisticated enough not to make the megastore into the villain. Say what you will, those giant stores are fun to spend time in, and there is a scene where Kathleen ventures anonymously into Joe's big store for the first time and looks around, at the magazine racks and the cafe and all the books--and then there's the heartbreaking moment when she overhears a question in the children's section, and she knows the answer but of course the clerk doesn't, and so she supplies the answer but it makes her cry, and Joe overhears everything. Whoa." It is great entertainment but it wouldn't be on the top of any of my lists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've Got Mail is still very much revolutionary while still sappy. It is one of the few tech love stories that men could really enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe but there was once a time in the dating world where the use of technology didn't have the impact that is does today. With Facebook, Twitter, dating sites and advancements in phone technology, there are now so many ways to connect or make contact with a person where as before you really only had a home telephone or even letters. You've Got Mail was a 1998 romantic comedy that introduced new technology to the dating world and in a very cheesy way. Small time book owner Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is living in the Big Apple and must compete with the opening of the new Fox Books run by the high profile Joe Fox (Tom Hanks). As it turns out, both of these business-owners are instant-messaging each other without realizing who the other is and a love relationship forms.If anything, this seems very much like a typical relationship film. It is a love story that starts with people not connecting, being enemies and both doing opposite type of things. Even though these ideas are very dated now (when that last time you heard of anyone using AOL?), the instant- messaging is what makes this story. At the time, instant- messaging was somewhat new and I believe AOL may have been using the movie as a marketing idea. The idea that these people are messaging each other without realizing each other is unlikely but we can still very much go with it. It provides us with an ending that we see coming a mile away but there is still something in it to make us like it.In this love story, there are a lot of hidden messages and surprises offered. Through the book theme, we learn what it means to own a book company whether big or small. We also get to watch life as it was in 1998 which is quite interesting close to twenty years after the fact. Even though it is redundant in every shape of form, we do learn a little about dating and how that works. From Greg Kinnear to Steve Zahn, You've Got Mail has a surprisingly strong supporting cast for a type of film like this. It's a very needed part of a love story that's only half- good.You've Got Mail is far from an outstanding love story. As mentioned earlier, it's as dated as it ever could be and the leads have done much better romantic films. That said, You've Got Mail is still very much revolutionary while still sappy. It is one of the few tech love stories that men could really enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so cliché, melodramatic, and cheesy. The characters are so terribly one dimensional. Also, they are not at all steeped in reality. Joe Fox is supposed to be some cutthroat businessman, yet you never see even an inkling of that in Hanks' performance. Meg Ryan is over the top cutesy to the point of inducing nausea. This is a business savvy New Yorker? She seems to barely have the wherewithal to tie her shoes let alone own a store. The supporting characters are weak and completely waste the talents of Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear and Steve Zahn (all awesome actors). Even Dave Chapelle sucked, but to be fair he had nothing to work with and had no real character at all. What a waste!Perhaps it is the on screen charisma of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks that made me watch this inanity to the end. It's bizarre to me that Meg Ryan was nominated for a Golden Globe for this. Her acting strength lies in When a Man Loves and Woman. Anyway, this movie makes for a decent rainy Sunday. I wouldn't pay $$ to stream or rent this. But if it's free - go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aged badly, but still enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1998, it was a guilty pleasure romantic comedy/drama. Today you see that technology has changed, making this movie very dated. America Online is no longer popular that it once was when this movie was released, and there are other "instant messages". Nowadays, people can afford cell phone messaging that is growing rapidly popular, also known as "texting", while "instant messaging", also known as "chatting", is still popular, not the AOL IM.At the time of release, the connection to Internet was very slow, and "dial-up" (or hooking the Internet to telephone outlet) was our only option. Nowadays, you have so many expensive yet faster connection.Even its original version, starring James Stewart, did not age well, mostly because sending postal letters is nowadays less convenient, especially when you wait one to two days for your mail to arrive.Nevertheless, if you love to see Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, rent it. If you own it, ... let's say that there are better timeless movies than this one. But if you do not mind history lessons, this is for you.2016 EDIT: Another thing about the film is the book retailer corporation, which relied on the old business model before Amazon.com and Barnes &amp; Noble (which started out as in-person bookstore chain) became successful online retailers. Stand-alone Bookstores have become less common nowadays, while book sections are merged into department stores or discount retailers, like Target. Somehow, this film feels too nostalgic or ancient.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoiler... This movie is a romance with an underlying story of big business strangling the little mom &amp; pop shop. The conflict that really gets in the way of me liking this movie is that it could've been a better show of the consequences of gentrification. YES, you WILL see a Starbucks and a Gap...unfortunately. Therein lies the problem... There were many ways she could've made this a better script like Mommy and Daddy's _Desk Set_.The heroine owns a little bookstore that was her mom's. WHY is she buying her coffee at STARBUCKS?!?!?! That's the BIG corporate bully. She's not practicing what she wants others to practice in order to keep her business alive. You've got to buy coffee from a place that has REAL baristas and not someone who presses buttons. There are a lot of coffee houses in NYC that treat every cup like a work of art. Ephron should've had her going to those stores and articulating the importance of keeping those places in business.Also, I would've respected the heroine A LOT MORE if she read _Pride and Prejudice_ for what it is. Tom Hanks' character, Joe Fox, made fun of the heroine for reading _Pride and Prejudice_. Meg Ryan's character, Kathleen Kelly ?, could've shown her literary prowess by responding that it's not a shallow, girly romance avec wonderful brooding Darcy, but Austen's social commentary of the day. She could even throw in Elizabeth Gaskell to drive the point home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a very good example to what is side-stepped when people see this movie, is the bad behavior that is expressed in what is going on in the co-book store owning movie that was captured and expressed as a romance movie in the society that we live in.It is easy to see the bad behavior in this movie and put it into perspective to me when I watched the movie again when keeping these things in mind.In the movie, the two bookstore owners basically, in person, can't stand each other because their businesses are competing but what they don't know is that they have actually been talking over the internet and have yet to meet each other, but wouldn't you know, love the person that they are talking to over the information superhighway. The obvious, and disregarded bad behavior is how much these people judge each other without getting to know each other which yes, is very common for people who are put in the business and promotional situation what they are in, but if they weren't so quick to jump the gun and claim to marginally dislike the person that they are talking to, they would see that under the surface is the person that they have been searching for and the person that they wish to be with all along. It goes along way showing this type of behavior and how people act in America every day, because it is obvious for anyone who lives and follows anything in America, that the situation that those two are in is a situation that is probably very common with so many business competing to get an edge and since it is too make a living, it is obviously a more cut throat situation when it comes to evaluating the person that is across the table. With all those being the case, the bad behaviors are still reconciled which is a very happy output to the situation that was started. The two learn who they are and see that the way they are acting was absolutely preposterous, and that there was no reason for them to be acting so harsh and brash because if they would have just taken a step back and looked at who the people were inside, which if everyone else in America would do who were also in this situation would see, that there is a good thing and a lovable, kind person in us all if we would just take the time to look at each other and not just judge people and stick it right in their face that "no matter who you are, I am not going to like you because I disagree with your initial view on this certain situation." It is so very sad, but so very true, but in the end it gives a good look of people and what love is capable of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone noted earlier that the book that Kathryn carries to the restaurant to help NY152 identify her is Austen's *Pride and Prejudice*, a good observation that suggested the parallels between the female and male characters in Pride and Prejudice and those in You've Got Mail. An interesting side note is that in the original movie with James Stewart and Ms. Sullivan, the book in this scene was Tolstoy's *Anna Karenina*. I think that prop change in the later movie is significant commentary on the screenwriters' differing perspectives in these respective movies. In spite of its capitalistic capitulating, You've Got Mail is a very sunny tale compared to The Shop around the Corner, which contains subplots of betrayal of coworkers, betrayal of spouses, jealousy, suspicion, and suicide. Likewise, Austen's novel, a satire of manners, is a sunny tale compared to Tolstoy's epic of betrayal, unhappiness, and ultimate suicide.</fullReview>

So they fall just a little bit in love (surely you can be no more a little bit in love than you can be a little bit pregnant?)courtesy of AOL.(advt.)Sigh.

Mr Hanks discovers quite early on that his cyberlover is Miss Ryan who he is about to put out of business and spends the rest of the movie trying to hide the fact from her whilst encouraging her to become more and more in thrall to him.No more Mr Nice Guy eh Tom? Miss Ryan,in contrast,is all Blonde Innocence rather than Blonde Ambition,and signally fails to connect her business bete noire with the lovely,sensitive,caring New Man she has found courtesy of AOL (advt.) I was determined from the start of "You've got Mail" to resist the charms of Miss Ryan who had managed to slip under my guard in several previous movies and caused a manly tear to wrinkle my nose more than once despite playing basically the same character for some years.About 20 minutes in I gave up and sat back in admiration as this very shrewd and capable actress did yet another variation of her so - called "girl - next - door" schtick which can render even a grouch like me uncritical. I have to say at this point I have lived next door to several girls,none of whom was remotely like Miss Ryan in any way,shape or form.Indeed one was so unprepossessing that she had to hang a pork chop round her neck before her dog would go out with her (joke,joke).

If you wait me to say, "Oh, it's like "Sleepless ...", or "they were better/worse in "Sleepless...", well, i hear about it but don't see it actually. And now, this is New York and this isn't the 1st town in the world for nothing.The story is enjoyable: the trick of the loving writing and the bad meeting is a good one. There are almost two movies in one and the second part is interesting: how to save a failed relationship, and ironically, that's the actual point of my life.The only drawback in this movie, like the constant big American productions, is that the characters evolve in the "high society". They have good jobs, fine housings, good friends, health.. In fact, their only worry is their feelings, which is per se almost "paradise".I know it's movie and not life: the big difference is here: movie is happy ending &amp; smooth progression; Life can be sad even if you try your best &amp; the "fight" is every day... It's easy to understand why people (as me) like movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meg Ryan is Kathleen Kelly the owner of a small bookstore. Tom Hanks is Joe Fox the son of the owner of a huge mega-bookstore which moves into the neighborhood and threatens her little bookstore. They make contact on the internet but she doesn't know her true identity and she doesn't know his.This is supposed to be a romantic comedy in the vein of Sleepless in Seattle but Hank's character is not likable. Why would Meg Ryan fall for him when she hates everything he represents? The story just doesn't ring true. I didn't like this movie much for that reason.Meg Ryan is just getting too old to play these parts any longer. She certainly has been cute in previous movies but now her wrinkles are showing.Tom Hanks is just too good an actor to play these slight roles anymore. He seems to sleepwalk through the movie and his heart just doesn't seem in it.Instead of this movie I'd recommend Must Love Dogs with John Cusack and Diane Lane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why keep remaking classics?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since "The Shop Around the Corner" is one of my all-time favorite films and since I also think that the only time Hollywood should remake older films is when there is something fundamentally wrong with the original (i.e. almost fatal miscasting, a studio's insistence on an ending that belies everything that came before it, etc.), I avoided this movie when it came out in theaters. When it recently came on TV, I watched it because disliking a film one has never seen is just goofy. If I had never seen the original film on which it is based, I might have had fewer qualms about the film, but as it was, I had enough problems with the film on its' own merits. Why did the writer immediately shoot herself in the foot by having Joe and Kathleen in "as committed as these two can ever get" relationships at the start of the film? It immediately marked these characters as people who don't have the guts to end unsatisfying relationships and who don't have the character to break free from other people before moving on to something else. This hardly ups the protagonists' likeability factor, does it? The basic unappetizing feature of movie makers wanting us to root for the success of a relationship that was tainted by the inescapable fact that one character brought about what would be in real life the economic downfall of another character has been discussed far more eloquently by other reviewers, so I won't dwell on it here except to say that I really cannot understand Hollywood screenwriters. Their ideas about what constitutes likeability and success and honor are completely foreign to me. When Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are allowed to act as mature, vulnerable, intelligent people**POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD**--i.e. the scene in the restaurant when Kathleen is waiting for NY152 to show up, the movie showed us how charming and real it could have been. Most of the time though, Meg Ryan was forced to give her loveable, "I'm this generation's Goldie Hawn" ditz impression and Tom Hanks was trying to make a venal businessman seem likeable. They succeeded as well or better than most actors could, but I long for the wit and tenderness and subtlety of the incomparable and irreplaceable original. If you've ever seen the beautiful original, then you know what I mean.</fullReview>

I read somewhere a negative review about it, claiming it was impossible for such things to ever happen in the Internet. Obviously he has not heard my story nor read my 6,000 e-mail database!. And I dare that writer to challenge me on that. The story has all the things men and women search for in a relationship in a medium which may be so difficult and frightening as the Internet can be. I saw the film in the theater, I bought the movie and I watch it every time it is shown on television. It is bound to become a classic!

		<shortDescription>Romancing the Net!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another typically Ephron romantic movie. And like all others it ends on a happy note, though we wonder whether Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox will ever get along professionally as they do personally. This films ends making you ponder on a possible sequel i.e. what happens after they get together? Can Kathleen with her angst for the commercial big-wigs stand a soul mate who is one himself? Does she relinquish her career ambitions to go into some kind of a collaboration with Joe Fox and his mega store which she so much hated and championed against? Well, this film clearly chooses to ignore the after-the-romance part to concentrate solely on the romance and I have to say it succeeds to that end. Even though the pace of the movie at times slows down, it is an integral part of the movie. I'm talking of the part where Joe Fox tries to win over Kathleen. He knows that she won't over accept him as just the guy whom she is e-mail friends with, he has to win her over as the business man who drew her out of business. And when he almost succeeds he is ready to confront her both as who is and as her e-mail friend. I do agree with what one more viewer over here has commented that the movie seems to be partial to Hanks's character by making him privy to more knowledge than Ryan's character has. And by getting both the business and the girl in the end(a case of getting the cake and eating it too). But as I wrote above this movie is typically in the vein of romance and chooses to ignore the irritating technicalities of reality... I liked this movie because of it's atmosphere, supposedly shot in New York's West End area, it lends a beautiful aura to the movie. I liked the banter between Kathleen and Joe on their respective favourite books - hers being Pride and Prejudice and his Godfather(what a combo!). And last but not the least, I loved the that cosy Shop Around The Corner; being an absolute book buff it was a vision of my dream shop! Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are as adorable as ever! I'd recommend this movie strictly for those who like romantic comedies. The absence of sex in this movie is conspicuous and quite a relief actually. This movie is for those who love books and who are romantic at heart! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what to begin with ? I haven`t ever had any special opinion about "romantic movies", I simply missed them all the way through. But that Christmas (1998) I didn`t go to the local theatre by my own and we had to choose between "Enemy of the state" and "You`ve got mail". OUR choice was for ROMANCE and, while I was just preparing to have few hours of sleep, Tom Hanks stepped into the corridor. Where is he going to, why does he seem so afraid to get noticed ? Oh, I see, he`s got a girlfriend. No, not that one, just-out-of-doors, but a REAL GIRLFRIEND. From Internet.Since that moment the movie got my attention. And it was ALWAYS fun, exciting, kind and - yes - romantic ! Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were really great, even the music helps to create a great mood after watching it. But do you know, what I liked most of all ? We knew that THIS MOVIE WILL END WITH THEIR KISS IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA and yet - it was exciting all the way !Well, what else to say?.. 2 months later I was going to the theatre by my own again. Still I didn`t feel THAT LONELY, `cause... I had A REAL GIRLFRIEND. So - I really want to recommend this fine movie to all SLEEPLESS IN INTERNET. And to all the others too :)</fullReview>

Ryan and Hanks give out interesting performances, but the movie is farfetched and dis-jointed.

		<shortDescription>Romantic and accessible, funny and smart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are at their best in this gentle comedy about love and business war (and all's fair in either). A remake of "The Shop Around the Corner" and "In The Good Old Summertime", it has been updated by Nora Ephron for the digital age and the transition is well done. They are helped by a good supporting cast, including a classy turn by Jean Stapleton (the love of her life is one of the funniest parts of the movie). Dabney Coleman and John Randolph are endearing as Hank's father and grandfather, both of whom are as unlucky at love as Hanks. Parker Posey is excellent as his self-involved girlfriend.Hanks and Ryan are perfectly cast. Ryan is playful and charming, yet quirky and passionate enough to differentiate this character from some of her other films. Hanks is understated as usual, and risks being more than a tad unpleasant in a few scenes with Ryan. Some people will complain that they've seen this type of story before. Well, it IS a remake of a story that's been filmed twice before. Some will complain that everyone knows they'll end up together. Well, it IS a romantic comedy. The characterizations are good, the dialogue is smart, and the music is well done. **POSSIBLE SPOILER:** The ending is just a shade too pat -- I would have expected more of a conflict at the last reveal, but my wife thought it was just perfect the way it was, so what the heck do I know anyway?How can you go wrong with all of that and Hanks and Ryan? You can't. Maybe it's a bit formulaic, but if so you'll never see formula done this well. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nora Ephron, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, meet up again after the success of Sleepless in Seattle, for another movie with a high saccharine content.The chemistry between Hanks and Ryan is again superb, whether bickering as business rivals, or when falling in love over the endless void of the internet.Hanks is the big business bookseller, who threatens, and eventually destroys, the livelihood of Ryan's children's bookstore owner.Hanks does a pretty good job as the ruthless business man, while at the same time making you feel that, at times, he would rather have the life that Ryan's character leads, if his up-bringing and family expectations did not prevent it.Ryan plays the character that she as honed over so many similar movies, while the other characters, such as Greg Kinnear as Ryan's boy friend, are really just window dressing, although some wonderful comic moments do come from Parker Posey, as the high flying business woman, and Hanks' partner.A wonderful script from Ephron, which keeps the schmaltz at bay, while remaining funny and romantic throughout, and good performances from the leads make this as good as Sleepless in Seattle, though it is still not quite as good as the original Shop Around the Corner, on which it is based.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've got corn syrup</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Nora Ephron is obviously the kind of woman who believes you can't be too cute. I mean this is one cute movie. To begin with, Meg Ryan practically defines cuteness. Even at thirtysomething she is cute enough to fawn over, bless her heart; and Jean Stapleton as her bookkeeper and her mother's bookkeeper-adorable. The clever old gal even bought Intel at six-just adorable! And can Tom Hanks ever handle this? Play a male lead with property and money and a bad dye job? Piece of cake. I mean, just behave and you are plenty eligible and totally adorable yourself. Throw in a dog and some cute kids and a fairy tale New York, and what have you got? You've got corn syrup! That's what you've got. My lord, even Dabney Coleman is cute in this! (And don't you just love the way his bad dye job mustache matches Hanks' bad dye job hairdo?)This is a diabolical, cynical seduction of sappy-hearted lovers everywhere. Indulge. This is femme porn. Bring a box of Kleenex (actually the Ephrons anticipated this and put a few on screen, bless their hearts) and some bon-bons. Know that the female lead will find true love, money and life-long security simultaneously after going through some real fun misdirections en route. Muggers in New York? AIDS? Cockroaches? Crack cocaine? Summer swelters? Dirty snow? Garbage strikes? Smelly, polluted Hudson? Odoriferous poverty? I mean, get real! Even the two roommates that our lovers dump are going to live happily ever after. Do we experience heartaches? Does love bite? Diss off! This is the yellow brick road in Olde New York, and it feels just like mainlining heroin.Best line: As Hanks reveals himself to Meg he uses her email handle and says, "Don't cry, Shopgirl" while the sound track prompts our tears with "Somewhere over the Rainbow." I mean, this is a BIG HANKY kind of movie!In summation, the "cute" speed limit was greatly exceeded in this Pollyannish feel-gooder, and I am imposing the following fine on Director Nora Ephron: 200 hours of community service in the ladies powder room of the Bronx welfare office, and a promise never to do anything like this again, no matter how great the temptation.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

Not to have cyber-sex anymore because it is just a waste of time 2. To try and find a partner over the Net. This happens to be my favourite love story of all time because it is in a format that is familiar to me personally (internet and all). I love chatting and finding online pals of the opposite sex. This movie showed me that it is possible to have a serious relationships too if you behave responsibly on the Net. Tom Hanks and cuddly Meg Ryan put in superb perfomances as we would expect of them.

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail is one of those old-fashioned feel good movies, the kind that is rarely made any more. It is reminiscent of movies made in the 30s and 40s. In fact, it is a remake of the 1940 classic, The Shop Around the Corner.You find yourself rooting for the hero and heroine to get together and live happily ever after. What is a little hard to believe is the fact that two total strangers communicating over the internet are actually living in the same city, in the same neighborhood much less the same country. Figure the odds on this happening in real life.All this aside this is a pleasant movie. Stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan make the characters real and sympathetic. Hanks has never given a bad performance and how can you not fall in love with Ryan. This is essentially a two-character movie with the supporting cast merely going through the motions. It was nice though, to see Jean Stapleton in the role of Birdie, even though she too had little to do.It's still hard for me to believe that the Ryan character would fall in love with the Hanks character, given that he has just run her out of business, however this is Hollywood where the impossible and unlikely happen every day.You've Got Mail is still an enjoyable movie despite all of its apparent faults.</fullReview>

What can I say--I'm a sucker for romantic comedies, especially when they house one of my all-time favorite actresses (this would be Ryan). And I was pleasantly surprised by this film; it had some genuinely good moments. Anything with the dog, for starters. That was one great dog. And the scene where Ryan and Hanks discuss "The Godfather" lingo ("Go to the mattress."). Pretty amusing stuff. Of course, that's not to say it didn't have it's ouchy moments too. Like the bit where Hanks takes his two child relatives (one's an aunt, the other's a brother--don't ask) to a Halloween street fair. Yeah, it was a cute touch and shows you how wonderful Hanks' character Joe Fox is, taking kids out for a good time. But it was completely superfluous. All it did was add a bag of fish and a couple balloons to the set. And provide a VERY longwinded excuse for Hanks and Co. to visit Ryan's shop.I think my biggest problem with this film had to do with three main things: (1) its overuse of sterotypes, to wit: good little guy (oh, sorry--girl) v. big bad corporate wolf theme (seen in probably 95% of all movies made anyway); predictably oddball characters; way-cute little kids and obvious romantic pairing of people (but since I've never seen a movie where it isn't obvious, I can't really hold this one against this flick); (2) Starbucks. I have nothing against the company, but I've never seen such blatant product placement in all my days; (3) the remaking of an older movie--why is every other film a remake anymore? What ever happened to original scripts?Still, all in all, it's really a pretty good movie. Ryan is wonderful and a little vulnerable as Kathleen Kelly, Hanks (as Joe Fox) is charming and funny, and there's an obvious rapport between them (as also evidenced in the other two films they were in together, "Sleepless in Seattle" and "Joe Versus the Volcano"). The story is a sweet one, the supporting cast is pretty good overall and some moments are downright hilarious (Ryan had a beautiful moment of physical humor when she is psyching herself up for a "war" with Fox Books by shadowboxing behind the counter of her bookstore). And might I suggest that you check out the older film that this was based on. I can guarantee that it will increase your appreciation of "You've Got Mail" by pointing out all the little salutes to the original film, Ernst Lubitsch's brilliant 1940 "The Shop Around the Corner". For instance, the naming of Ryan's bookstore by using the title of the original, or my favorite bit, when Hanks goes to meet his cyberbuddy "in the flesh," so to speak, not knowing she's actually Ryan. Hanks' friend Kevin (as brilliantly portrayed by David Chappelle) asks Hanks if the signal between the two of them is going to be a rose tucked in a book or something like that--the same identifier used in the original film. The way Kevin asks, it makes it sound like the character has actually seen "The Shop Around the Corner" and was basing his guess on that. But definately check the original out. Yeah, it's old. Yeah, it's black and white. No, they didn't have email. No, it wasn't set in a bookstore. But yes, it's an awesome film, with wonderful performances by all the members of the cast. Doesn't have the dog though. Bummer. That was one great dog.Oh, and I have one big question that's not related to anything: how does Meg Ryan always have the most perfect hair in the world in all of her movies? I know she has her own team of make-up artists, but so do many other actors and actresses and yet they are not as consistently hair-perfect as She of the Sleepless Seattle Nights (I bring before you as proof the King of the Bad Hair Dept., Johnny Depp). You have some awesome hair, babe.Cute movie. Great dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful to see Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks together again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie in the theater, I couldn't help noticing and thinking about the 1940 Lubitsch comedy 'The Shop Around The Corner'. Especially in the scene in and outside the cafe when Meg Ryan didn't know that Tom Hanks was her pen-pal/e-mail-pal. In scene in the street right before Tom Hanks walks in was it almost copied word for word of the dialog from the 1940 gem. But that aside, it was really refreshing Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan together on the screen again, a combination that working to very well in 'Sleepless in Seattle'. I think that the ending was a bit lame though. Not nearly as magical as the ending on 'Sleepless in Seattle' was. I was in tears when I saw that. But I guess this is Hollywood nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute &amp; fun romantic comedy, even if it is wholly unrealistic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romantic, fun, and different. "You've Got Mail" is a wonderful movie that is perfect for those looking for love, and those in love. It gives us hope that we can find that perfect someone, no matter how unrealistic it might seem. Meg Ryan is her lovable self. We can't help but feel sorry for her predicament, and sympathize with her even as she is being mean and insensitive to Joe Fox (Tom Hanks). Although not her best performance, there is still plenty to enjoy. One can only laugh as she tries to talk with a "stubbed up node..." Tom Hanks is the perfect mix of being a serious business man on one hand, and a caring, compassionate friend on the other. He's the "villain" in this movie, but a more likable villain I've never encountered, or cheered for! "You've Got Mail" does a good job of setting up the story of the corporate giant superstore taking over the small independently owned shops. Where it truly shines, however, is when we are treated to the interactions between Hanks &amp; Ryan. We laugh at all the things hinted at, while we know what is truly going on.I was thankful that the computers on screen were kept to a minimum. We weren't subjected to a lot of technobabble, keeping it to Email and a chat room. After all, it is far more interesting to have characters talking to each other than to have them thinking about what they are writing (which was done rather well in this film).Sure, it is virtually (no pun intended) impossible for something like this to happen (no one can REALLY get online with AOL in less than 10 tries!) But who said romance needs reality? Watch this movie, be enchanted, and may your dreams come true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The recipe for this movie was written long ago, but Ephron's preparation and presentation made it enjoyable if not distinctive. I think Lubitsch would have liked it. She made it whimsical and frothy, with a little cynical garnish, laid out in an idyllic version of New York. It almost makes you want to live there. The Godfather/Pride-and-Prejudice business was annoying and the side relationships were unnecessary and distracting, but Jean Stapleton was enjoyable and the online/offline relationship between Hanks and Ryan worked well.</fullReview>

You might think that endings like that don't happen any more, but surprisingly, that ending works rather well for this movie.The first half simply sets up the story. The second half, beginning where Joe visits Kathleen when she's sick, is where I begin to fall in love. I fell in love with cute, perky, Meg Ryan and all her cute mannerisms. I fell.... well, I don't love Tom Hanks. (He's a great actor and all, but I'm a guy, he's a guy, you catch my drift...) The ending, while very predictable, still managed to lift my spirits.

		<shortDescription>84 Charing Cross Road goes Sleepless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bookshop people are different. They know what people really read. And generally they love books. Or at least they used to. Here crass commercial Tom Hanks tramples all over the lovely Meg Ryan's little New York children's bookstore while at the same time conducting a friendly e-mail correspondence with her. He starts off not knowing who she is but she doesn't find out who he is until after he does, if you see what I mean.Unlike "84 Charing Cross Road" the writing (of letters) is largely incidental, and the real plot is 'will they get it together?' This of course means there is no suspense since in movies of this type the couple always gets it together. And so it is. This is apparently a remake of some earlier Hollywood hit and follows the romantic comedy formula perfectly, even down to the protagonists' compulsory best friends.The script is by Norah Ephron, and she does raise a laugh on occasion. When Tom Hanks introduces the children he is with to Meg Ryan, it turns out the 7 year old girl is his aunt and the 9 year old is his brother, the products of late second marriages by his father and grandfather (both still alive). "A typical American family" says Tom. I hope not - Dad and Grandad are pretty ruthless people. Recommended? Well, saw this one as an in-flight movie, so it was free. It could have been worse. I didn't fall asleep. But I guess I just don't like the genre.</fullReview>

The film ends abruptly, with no attempt to tackle the most central question, how can a woman trust the guy who has destroyed her livelihood--and enjoyed doing so? Instead, we are treated to weird, pointless details such as the fact Joe Fox's father and grandfather keep reproducing with younger and younger women. The writer seems to get a kick out of introducing Fox's eight year old aunt and her playmate, Joe's four year old brother, and watching the reactions of fellow characters. The problem is that this needless display of Viagra virility takes time away from the central plot, allowing the director to skimp in a horrible fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan deliver excellent performances as they re-team for the third time. Fresh off Saving Private Ryan Tom Hanks plays Joe Fox a bookstore owner looking to take over every bookstore in sight in order to make his the only one in town. He butts heads with Meg Ryan who portrays Kathleen Kelly, a small bookstore owner, called The Shop Around The Corner. As rivals in the book business they are natural enemies, but what they don't know is they are carrying on an e-mail correspondence. One of the many great surprises for me about this film was the performance of Jean Stapleton as Birdie who adds with her witty humor and jokes. As Meg Ryan's boyfriend, Greg Kinnear stars as Frank Navaski, a newspaper columnist, has the sense of humor that takes this film to a new plateau. Since this movie is so good I don't want to give away many details but I can say when this movie hits its groove it gets better and better and by the time the movie is over people will not want to leave their seats. This is a smartly made and brilliantly directed film by Nora Ephron who worked with Hanks and Ryan in Sleepless In Seattle. It seems as if Tom Hanks took over the role of director in the last thirty minutes of the movie; he does a wonderful job at doing this. The best part of the whole entire movie comes in the final scene and the dialogue between the actors involved with that scene; with that scene the whole movie is tied together. This is a tremendously well-done and brilliantly put together film and definitely worth everyone's while to sit and relax for 120 min.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few loose ends too many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Routine, but well-made, romantic comedy with an excellent cast. The business rivalry between the leads gives the film an extra hard edge which turns this old-fashioned story into something contemporary and lifts it above average.The film has quite a few loose ends, characters and stories that make you wonder how they fit into the overall picture, only to discover later that they simply do not. These loose ends seem to have been put there deliberately, Hitchcock-style, to circumvent the curse of the genre - its utter predictability. However, this method does not work equally well in this genre. Another criticism is that the film concentrates too much on the leads and gives its supporting cast not enough to do; a crime when you have first-rate actors such as Jean Stapleton and Dabney Coleman in your cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing 2 hours of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "You've Got Mail" today and was very disappointed when I left the cinema. The beginning was a smart and funny movie which got weaker and weaker when comming to the end. I think, the movie has a wrong timing. Kathlyn falls in love with Joe too quickly. It seems to me, as if the director ran out of time, because he didn´t want to make a 3 hour movie (or he probably spent too much at the beginning).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can suspend your disbelief and your knowledge that the Net is really not the place to meet the love of your life this film is a bit of fun. However, in real life if people don't get on face to face the fact that they can romance in cyber-space is not going to help. Meg Ryan's character is a strangely old-fashioned girl - "never mind the business as long as I get my man" and her reaction when she finds out who her on-line lover is, is just not normal. A normal woman would be contemplating castration, not marriage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great romantic comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I am not a fan of so-called romantic comedies, I do enjoy watching oldies with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. I think Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have some of the same chemistry, updated of course. I actually liked this movie better than "Sleepless in Seattle." The casting was inspired, particularly Dabney Coleman and John Randolph as Hank's father and uncle (I believe). The dialogue is far more inspired than in "Sleepless" and the story more engaging. The biting exchanges between Ryan and Hanks are wonderful and all the more so because they both admit to feeling remorse afterwards. The little throw away scenes like the one between Hanks and Coleman on the boat are priceless and provide the viewer with an opportunity to speculate on the characters' motivation without hitting people over the head with "insight". A most satisfying experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan reteam for the third time in this film about internet romance. Their chemistry radiates off the screen. It seems as if the audience would need to get something cold to drink. In their previous film, Sleepless In Seattle they did not exude the type of chemistry as in You've Got Mail; maybe that is because they only had one scene together. I love the banter because it is harmless and almost sarcastic.I saw this movie two times; something I usually don't do. Nora Ephron does a good job directing especially the ending which will remain my secret as you will and must watch the movie for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not brain surgery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're expecting intellectualisms, you should be reading books, like this movie's central characters. The fact that you're not means you're sitting in the movie theater hoping to be entertained - and this movie does just that.Hanks reprises the role he plays in many of his other movies, as a man most men would like to be, or hope to be if the subject matter isn't as pleasant as "Saving Miss Ryan". His ability to be "everyman" without being "any man" is what keeps his rent paid year after year.The real gem however, is Meg Ryan (again), who once more dominates the screen with her patented quirky smiles, and that enthusiastic projection empathy that can drag you kicking and screaming into whatever her emotion of the moment might be.My opinion of Ryan over Hanks isn't to diminish the undeniable interaction this couple seems to share in their movies. It's just the plain, hard fact that I'll never leave one of Tom's performances hoping I've mistakenly stumbled into the premiere and just happen to bump into him on the way out. Meg Ryan is definitely underrated as one of America's best female leads. No, she tends not to stretch herself, and note that I didn't say "best actresses". But she is apparently smart enough to know a good thing when she sees it, so if her characters tend to look and act alike, it's a cross I'll bear to spend 120 minutes with her every few months.Unfortunately, in the debaucherous 90's, the girl-next-door image Ryan portrays onscreen (like her perfect parallel in Hank's Joe Yuppie) is seen by too many people as simplistic and overplayed in its NutraSweet way. I disagree. This love story is warm, funny, and most of all, charming, and we just don't get enough of these any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Meg and Tom set out to sketch the lives of an internet couple, I already started wondering how and when they would meet. But it seems a romance should always tear itself on every thorn available to make the ending more of a climax.The acting of the two was great, the dialogue was great. Unfortunately I found some mood sketches slightly dragging the plot in the first half of the film. And in the second half we get to witness the complete downfall of "the Shop around the Corner". Seemingly introducing sub plots, which eventually turn out not to be there.Finally Tom gets to his senses,and from there the film moves steadily to its well expected ending. I thought it was a solidly cast film, with just a little too much mood sketching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vanilla movie gives me belly ache (not belly laughs)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't go into this movie expecting much, and I wasn't disappointed. Meg Ryan seems happy to coast along on the strength of her formidable array of cute expressions, and Nora Ephron seems content to keep making "chick flicks" with monotony... the supporting cast are great, but are wasted as the film is mostly concerned with the self-absorbed leads. Some amusing moments but mostly filled with the kind of fatuous reflections on success and happiness that we've come to expect from the '90s fuzzy-warm-feeling films.Tom Hanks still continues to be the most overrated and boring actor of his generation but New York in autumn is beautiful. This film is concerned with people who seem to have so much time, they spend it being neurotic... or is that just New Yorkers?In fact, you could say that the best things about this movie were Parker Posy (as a woman "who makes coffee nervous") and New York, and even though they both didn't get enough lines, they still acted the pants off Tom and Meg."When Harry Met Sally" was not just funny, it was insightful. This insipid vanilla-flavoured money-maker aspires to heart and soul, but ends up leaving you with belly aches, not belly laughs... soggy. In fact, one of the only honest things about it was its constant references to the book it rips off: "Pride and Prejudice" (which did it better first anyway).PS: A good test would be to take your partner. If they love it, get on the internet and find another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't do justice to internet relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have this funny feeling the internet thingy was just incorporated into the film to make it *make sense* in terms of the new wave of 90s relationships, especially that founded on the internet. It showed distinctively with a bias no doubt that only the person whom you meet and know in real life eventually gets to your heart first. The way Hanks slowly ensnared Ryan's character without her knowing it and eventually winning it, perhaps Ryan's so-called "love" for NY152 might even melt if it didn't happen to be Hanks himself. Also, it was fairly unbelievable that Ryan's charcter would wittingly believe that she was in love with NY152, for the film certainly didn't give enough sense to it, and besides, we all know how grounded Meg Ryan is. Also, I was pretty disgusted with the way the usual machismo and shallow-mindedness at which Hanks' character displayed before he was to meet Ryan. It is only pure cowardice on the male side to be unable to accept someone not remotely as attractive as Meg Ryan. It's good only if you're willing to let it ride, and take in 2 hours of Woody Allen-esque kind of comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the movie sags the director gets Meg to screw up her cute little face in close up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you loved Sleepless in Seattle but wanted Meg and Tom on screen at the same time a little bit more, then this is for you. The chemistry is there and it is SO romantic but it overstays its welcome by 20 minutes. You know when you walk in what is likely to happen but it takes so long to get there.Either Meg Ryan or Tom Hanks are in every scene and the world revolves around them. Other characters are allowed to glimmer for a moment until their two dimensional images are carted off back to the props department. The trouble is the other characters are more interesting and the potential for sub plots involving a dictator's mistress, an amorous future step mother and Meg Ryan's employees is wasted to return to Tom and Meg and their linear travel towards each other.I love romantic feel-good movies as much as the next red-blooded Englishman but I felt cheated as the formulaic nature of the Nora Ephron plot envelops you like a warm but wet blanket. I would have given it the benefit of the doubt but when the band struck up "Somewhere Over The Rainbow", I realised that I'd been suckered. Meg Ryan's cute, screwed up face, whilst it seemed to make all the men in the cinema sigh almost inaudibly in unison, is not enough to rescue the film. It is however the best thing in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hasn't anyone noticed that this film is amoral and corrupt. The moment that Tom Hanks skulked off to be the knowing male manipulating naively one dimensional Meg Ryan I went from slightly amused to agitated. What on earth do these Hollywood people think passes for morals these days. Didn't anyone notice that Tom Hanks happened to be dishonest, manipulative, scheming and insensitive to the nuances of human decency. And God!! Nora Ephron - you didn't even have Meg slap either of his two faces at the end when she discovers he was a liar and a coward. Instead sweet Meg melts several million brain cells (she can hardly spare them in this character) and retreats to the role of romantic bimbo, happy to be lied to and lessened by her ruthlessly manipulative Prince Charming. Sorry folks. After that little powerplay I couldn't even raise a smile at some of those clever lines and romantic ploys as Tom tries to seduce Meg with the subtlety that only a consummate liar and deceiver can muster. Nice Godfather impression Tom. Liked your hair again Meg. I know you only read the lines as they are written folks, but aren't Big Stars able to control the flow even a little. If Tom had come clean with Meg at the crucial meeting, then the movie could have still been about the romance and maintained some moral sensibility. As it is I left the theatre depressed at the message being sent out to the world. Lie when it suits, and maybe you can repair the 'collateral damage' later. And what are all those External Reviewers seeing? Not a single warning about this vile trick of a movie. So depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moderately successful romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will they or won't they? This basic sexual/romantic tension has proved powerful enough to fuel scripts for television shows that run for years (e.g. Cheers). So it has more than enough power to hold an audience's interest for about two hours. There's just one problem with it. It does require that you have some actual suspense. The parties responsible for You've Got Mail decided, early on, to do without it. As a result this sentimental film will entertain you for ninety minutes, without making you guess for five.Basically, this movie is a throwback to the old studio system way of making films (which is not necessarily a bad thing). Take a tried-and-true story, add star power, and shazam! You've Got a Hit! You've Got Mail is based on "The Shop Around the Corner" (made in 1939). That film was remade as both a film and a musical. So the plot is well tested. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are pretty solid star power. What could go wrong?Well, that depends on your point of view. If you want to see a sweet romance, hear a few good one-liners, and ponder the homogenization of America without much effort, well, then, nothing will go wrong. Hanks and Ryan do a good job, the story is well paced, and in the end there are no bad guys, just good guys. If you were hoping for more, you clearly didn't see the ads.If you were hoping for more, everything went wrong. No suspense, Hanks goes to waste, and the characters wind up being paper thin, so you can't call this a character study. More like a character Cliff-notes.I went in expecting very little, and was certainly not disappointed. But I did like this movie. In part because I love books and book stores (Hanks owns a book superstore, Ryan a small shop that Hanks' store puts out of business), in part because they meet on AOL (remember AOL haters, Americans liked VHS and made Wal-Mart the world's biggest retailer), and in part because Ryan has star power (i.e. I think she's very attractive). So liked it well enough.At least it will give someone besides Hanks a chance at the Best Actor Oscar this year!</fullReview>

That's not a slam at all. In fact, I enjoyed "Mail" much more than "Seattle". It is far more interesting to see the two relationships continue in parallel (both not knowing who the other person is via email and the actual relationship where there is the tension of knowing exactly who you're dealing with).This movie has charm and a lot to say. I would rank this as one of Hank's finest performances. There are far too many satisfying elements in the characer and story developments to find fault with this film. There are those who will love it and those who will hate it as with any film. I loved it.If you liked this film, I'd strongly suggest The Apartment starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley McClaine.</fullReview>

Think about it: love on a computer???Nora's main question, a legitimate one I think--today your "soul mate" can be found in a chat room--seems to be: can "true love" exist in such a frenzied, email-controlled and chaotic manner? And her answer: yes it can!

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that "You've Got Mail" is a fantastic film, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I somewhat reluctantly, then, point out two problems I see with the film - one serious, one silly. The serious issue is that Fox books is allowed to steam-roll The Shop Around the Corner with little more than a token protest by Meg Ryan et al. We have seen all along how charming Meg's shop is, how much she cares about it, her employees, and her customers, but it is all for nothing. When she strolls into Fox Books, rather than see the cold, heartless, cash-grabbing villains of capitalism, we are again charmed by the open, relaxed atmosphere, the children playing on the floor, and so on. The inclusion of the dim-witted sales assistant is something of a mystery here, especially considering Hanks jokingly says at a different point in the film that you needed a PhD to work in the book store (or words to that effect). At least that shows that one of a company's most important assets are its people, and the skills and knowledge they possess.The silly issue is that Meg Ryan obviously isn't a *real* Internet user. Who in their right mind takes the computer's word for it when it says they have no new mail? All *real* e-mail junkies check again, just to make sure. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Male Mailed To Meg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about the internet many would say is e mail because it's fairly instant. It's the scratchy of written communication. And some romances have begun on the internet, a phenomenon explored in You've Got Mail.Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan with writer director Nora Ephron last teamed in the hugely popular Sleepless In Seattle. One of the great things about Sleepless was that as well as being funny you could also have a good cry. You've Got Mail is pretty funny but you'll almost certainly not find it very moving.Bland but enjoyable would best describe You've Got Mail, at least until the last reel. It's based on a 1940 film called The Shop Around The Corner where James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan corresponded by ordinary mail whilst working together, not knowing who the other was in real (not reel) life.In Mail, Hanks and Ryan have been friendly by e mail for some time (we're not told how long), but have kept their identities secret. Ryan is running a small book store (around the corner) and Hank's family open a chain book store (around the corner) which will most certainly drive the small family business broke.They meet and become enemies but of course we know that they will eventually fall in love. It's the ol' boy meets girl, boy loses girl, etc thing. There are plenty of small bows to the conflicts between mega-stores and family businesses but it's somehow enveloped beneath Meg Ryan's cuteness, Tom Hank's niceness and Nora Ephron's determination to not let a small thing like the destruction of family values by big business get in the way of a good profit for the film.As I inferred, Mail does gather some strength in its last third, largely because Hank's character becomes resolute towards Meg Ryan's (who wouldn't?) but because of its commercialism You've Got Mail mostly doesn't deliver all that much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First the characters aren't "co-workers" they just both work in the book business. One owns a superstore and the other a charming children's bookstore. Nora Ephron did it again - she put Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan together with a wonderful script and created magic. Oh and this film is not about "email" email is used as a method of communication in it - it is how the characters met originally but don't expect to see constant emailing. It is a truly wonderful film. You get to see the characters expressing their true feelings via email about life, business, relationships and see them treat each other differently in real life (because in email they use screen-names). You see how although just doing business can destroy one way of life in a sad way but open another door for opportunity. And yes there is a happy ending. A film with moments to make you laugh, and moments that will touch your heart and an interesting truthful look at the book business. If you loved Sleepless in Seattle you will love this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ugh. I feel manipulated. From the treacly, cutesy beginning to the hokey ending with Tom Hanks' big thumb wiping away Meg Ryan's genyoowine tears with a whispered, "Don't cry, Shopgirl." Puh-LEEZ! Vintage Ephron (and I don't mean that as a good thing) with cheesy tunes on the soundtrack over montages telling us how we're *supposed* to feel. And someone, somewhere along the line told Meg Ryan that swinging her arms and batting her eyes with her little chin stuck forward was a "cute" thing and that she should run with it. Because she does. In every movie she makes. Tom Hanks is better, playing against type as a man with unpleasant qualities, but then his bag of acting tricks is much deeper than Ryan's. He's always terrific--able to show us the inner depths of his characters with a flicker of a smile or trace of pain in the eyes. Still, he's not given much to do here but meet Ryan cute-for-cute. Not even the wonderfully vinegary Parker Posey or Greg Kinnear's customary charm can save it. Please please please. Let there NOT be a Sleepless in Seattle II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wouldn't be a lie to say that Nora Ephron makes the same movie over and over...it wouldn't be a lie to say a lot of directors do. I went into You've Got Mail ready for a replay of Sleepless in Seattle--which wouldn't have been bad or boring, just unsurprising. After the film i find myself happily surprised. While thematically remaking any number of films Ephron succeeds in making it fresh, remarkable and moving. The dialouge balances the talkiness of the late 90's with more sensible scriptwriting. The characters are more than facades.Especially of note are Greg Kinnear as a radical type-writer lover and Parker Posey playing, well, Parker Posey (and doing it brilliantly!). Hanks' dad's fiancee is also amazing...This is a movie calculated to pull the heartstrings but i found myself not feeling compromised or cheated (as many huge productions leave me)...i felt good. That's what this movie is about and it does its job with perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this beautifully filmed ode to New York City, the woman who owns a children's book shop is being put out of business by a big bookstore tycoon - and unknowingly developing a deep relationship with him by email. Although it plays into every fantasy about who your anonymous correspondant might be (and never would be!) other aspects of the movie persuaded me to suspend my disbelief. I enjoyed seeing glimpses of the characters lives - their family, friends, dogs, daily routines, etc. These people actually work, unlike many movie characters. As an admirer of both Ryan and Hanks I enjoyed seeing them do what they do very well indeed, and as a book lover, I smiled at every shot of full shelves and happy shoppers. It may not be real life, but it would be nice if it was!</fullReview>

On the positive side, while "Sleepless" managed to thrive without any interaction between Hanks and Ryan until the end of the film (leaving me to want to see how the relationship progressed from there), "Mail" only seems to come alive when the two stars are together. But there are too many supporting roles and a lifeless ending that slows down the film.</fullReview>

Ok I was having a laugh or two, sort of enjoying the movie when the whole idea of the book stores came up. I felt that we, the public was placed as being stupid or dumb, why may you ask? Well I truly believe in that heart of mine, that if someone closed down my book store that was for 30+ years that I would be sadden of the fact and would not turn around and fall in love with the person who did so. No matter how nice he was on email or in a chat room. I mean people had there lives in her(Ms. Kelly's) book store. Now I know movies are entertainment but they do try to reflect life and I just spoke about this in my speech class a few week earlier about how we should support the small guy. I mean when Meg Ryan's character went into Fox's Super store it broke my heart to know that the person behind the counter did not know about books. On a good note though, I feel if they would have just stuck with the idea of them on the internet and not book stores it would have been much better. Sleepless in Seattle was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan may well be the Tracy and Hepburn of their generation. Each is an accomplished actor with a broad range, but their onscreen chemistry makes their appearances together something unforgettable. Viewers expecting a reprise of "Sleepless in Seattle" will not find it here. Nora Ephron has taken much of the same team, including the two stars, and turned out a very different romantic comedy that is every bit the equal of its predecessor.Meg Ryan's first scene has her prancing about the apartment with anticipation, looking for all the world like a 12-year-old with a gleeful secret all her own. She may be the only actress her age in the history of film to so completely revert to adolescence and get away with it, but get away with it she does.As the protagonists' relationship develops online and in real life, the viewer is drawn deeper into their lives, rooting them on in their quest for love and happiness, even as we realize the inevitability of success. It isn't the question of whether they will find each other that holds our attention, but how the miracle will occur. By the time the movie ends we're thoroughly enchanted by both Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox, and the only regret we have is that we can't spend more time in their company.Dig out the rose colored glasses and settle yourself into your seat for the most delightful two hours of the season. This is the perfect antidote for holiday cynicism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot, until the ending. The ending was pretty weak, almost anti-climactic. I was expecting more of a tear jerking, romantic ending. Unfortunately, that is not what I got. I think that having Hanks' character do something incredibly romantic for Ryans' character, as far as the situation with their bookstores went, would have made for a much better ending.I guess if you can overlook the fact that the movie is the longest infomercial for AOL that you may ever see (the AOL logo appears less than a minute into the film) and the very weak ending, it is a very engaging and enjoyable film.Did anyone else notice that Hanks was using an IBM Thinkpad and that Ryan was using an Apple Powerbook? I am not sure if this is supposed to reflect their characters as far as Hanks being the businessman and Ryan being the creative writer-type or if it is supposed to reflect Hanks as being Big Blue to Ryans' much smaller market share.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming update of old stories and stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be nearly impossible to make a movie about Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan falling in love without it having enormous charm. Everyone who loves romantic comedy should love it.Having said that, it also should be said that the movie treats its stars as so special that it can take no chances. It lacks the compelling innocence of Sleepless in Seattle. The theme of the individual shopkeeper fighting the mega-store has great potential, but that was not seriously addressed.Did this movie do justice to the online relationship? Other than the stars' furtive anxieties to get online without detection by their live-in partners, we really don't see the magic of getting to know new people in cyberspace.Finally, I had to wonder if Hanks and Ryan are too old for this movie -- not too old for romance, but too old for the unexplained love-before-first-sight theme. I wonder if an opportunity was squandered to make a more mature romantic comedy. They were surrounded by shallow relationships, including their own live-in temps, and Joe Fox's father's and grandfather's caricatures, and framed by this unexplained cyber-love. We are left to assume that these folks have found something deeper -- but not really told how or why. These stars are so engaging, we want them to deliver something more than this movie offers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The details of Ephron's script and direction turn this from just another romantic comedy into a smart film. First, she gets nearly all of the computer stuff *refreshingly right*. None of these gee-whiz e-mail programs or unknown operating systems like we've seen in other movies. Instead, it's our friend AOL in all its glory and infamy and Hanks and Ryan have to type, delete, scroll, mouse, and otherwise interact with the machines. Ryan's laptop even has a phone cord plugged in when she's sitting in bed. This is, to my recollection, the first time a movie even comes close to doing this sort of stuff right.Second, it would have been easy (and misguided) to make this movie a diatribe about the evils of huge, corporate mega-stores destroying the little-guy. Instead, while Ephron shows Ryan's small kid-lit store as a wonderful place, she's careful to show that Hanks' mega-store also isn't evil incarnate-people talk, read, and enjoy themselves. She's also quick to show that even the mega-store bashing Ryan loves Starbucks. Details like this show a smart script that doesn't go for the easy emotional responses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YOU'VE GOT MAIL was not the defining film of the late 90's but it was the first time I ever saw the Internet treated so benignly and not as the devil incarnate. There was a joke about how Meg's (aka Shopgirl) cyberpal could be a serial murderer, but that usual "danger" implication associated with the internet was not there. I cannot tell you how refreshing that is. It accepts the internet as a social venue and nothing sinister. Also, not only is this movie a two hour infomercial for AoL (talk about PRODUCT PLACEMENT), it is also a training film on how to use it. It is like how Paul Thomas Anderson's HARD EIGHT (he also did BOOGIE NIGHTS) taught the audience how to professionally gamble. This movie shows America (and the whole world) how to use AoL. Released so close to Christmas. Hmmmm. And this film is not only an infomercial about AoL, but it is also a TRAVELOGUE about New York City. This film is really only ABOUT WALKING AROUND NYC. Everything else is just an excuse to WALK AROUND NYC. In last week's NEW YORKER, there was an article about Tom Hanks in it and in it Hanks mentions, jokingly, that the next Nora Ephrom movie will take place all in her apartment. Hee hee. This woman has the same problem that Woody Allen has...they are both obsessed and enthralled with NYC, and consequently the city becomes the lead character in their movies. Yet, this is not bad. I happen to like NYC and since I am a left coaster, I enjoyed the visit to the other coast.In closing...I enjoyed YOU'VE GOT MAIL, but I have to warn internetophiles about taking your significant other to the movie. If you met on e-mail or through the internet, then you are safe. But both Shopgirl and NY126 have significant others at the beginning of the film who they eventually have to dump to find true love via the internet. If you are an active interneter and your significant other is not, taking them to this movie might make them even more paranoid about your potential to find aother mate on-line. So, proceed with caution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, Lighthearted Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1937 play Parfumerie by Miklós László, The Late/Great Nora Ephron's 'You've Got Mail' is Sweet, Lighthearted Fun! Also adding to its aces are its lovely performances by its dependable leads.'You've Got Mail' Synopsis: Two business rivals hate each other at the office but fall in love over the internet.'You've Got Mail' in an ideal romantic-comedy, that touches the core of your heart, with its genuineness &amp; charm. The journey of its warring yet love-driven protagonists is interesting to watch &amp; the conversations they share with each-other, be it face-to-face or via internet, are well-written &amp; well-shot. Ephron was among the best we've ever had. And her work in 'You've Got Mail' is a gentle reminder to the statement I just wrote before. The Screenplay blends romance with humour, admirably. And there is a certain sweetness to this story, which adds freshness to the tale. Ephron's Direction is excellent, as always. Performance-Wise: Tom Hanks &amp; Meg Ryan are lovely here. They sparkle magic &amp; sustain it till the very end. Also in superb form is Greg Kinnear, who despite having a very brief role, leaves a mark.On the whole, 'You've Got Mail' is a must watch for all the romantics out there. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Romantic Comedy You've Been Waiting For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you ever feel like studios don't make good, wholesome, feel-good romantic comedies anymore? My wife has certainly expressed that concern and I have to agree with her. I don't blame studios for green- lighting more profitable ventures, but that doesn't mean we don't miss a good old-fashioned "Rom-Com." Well, if you're searching for a fun, low-stress Rom-Com, then look no further than You've Got Mail. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's delightful chemistry and down-to-earth personas continue to entertain in this, their 3rd cinematic pairing. Joe Fox (Hanks), is a "brilliant businessman" and owner of the discount book-selling emporium "Fox Books." Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) is the kind and warm- hearted owner of the "Shop Around the Corner," a quaint little bookstore that has been around for decades. After anonymously meeting online and developing a close friendship, they meet in-person, as competing bookstore owners, and become mortal enemies. Comedy ensues as their offline competition and online communication begin to cross paths. I found this film to be thoroughly charming in its humanity and humor. It is definitely a film that men and women can enjoy together due to a satisfying blend of romance and humor. I list You've Got Mail as one of my top 5 romantic comedies of all time. Go check it out - you won't regret it! What did you think of this film? What's in your list of top 5 romantic comedies? Feel free to leave your message in the comment section.

		<shortDescription>Soulless, Boring RomCom Fodder; Easily the Worst of the Hanks / Ryan Trifecta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan prove three's far from a charm in this limp, flat, by-the-numbers romantic comedy, their third (and last) such collaboration. Ryan plays the owner of a small children's bookstore who, when her shop comes under fire from a big-box retailer around the corner, finds solace in the advice of an anonymous e-mail buddy. Spoiler alert, said buddy turns out to be the billionaire owner of said retailer (Hanks), and the two dance around like marionettes with a sliced string or two for the next two hours, narrowly avoiding each other's identities while gnashing teeth and slinging mud in the press. It's an irritating story, filled with irritating people doing irritating things. Hanks and Ryan are locked in on cruise control, looking down their noses at the material (and, perhaps, at the doofs who actually make such online connections), and enjoy none of the easy chemistry and warm charm they enjoyed in Joe Versus the Volcano or, to a lesser extent, Sleepless in Seattle. The '90s mascara is caked on thick, too, with eye-rolling mainstream rock soundtrack choices, cookie cutter casting stereotypes and an era-typical Hollywood take on all things cyber. It's bad, empty, corporate-friendly trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>None of the magic of 'Sleepless'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) runs a small neighborhood children's book family store handed down to her from her dead mother. Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) runs a large corporate box store about to put her out of business. Unbeknownst to either one of them, they are the best of internet friends. But in the real world, they can't stand each other.Director Nora Ephron rejoins with her 'Sleepless in Seattle' leads. The biggest difference is that the magic isn't there this time around. Sleepless doesn't let them get together until very late in the movie. Yet the radio talk show phone calls allow more magic in the story than the tippy tappy quippy internet correspondence. This time around, the forced separation really damages the movie. Having them involved with different people does nothing but drag out the movie. It does improve markedly when they are together after the closing of the store. This is not a special rom-com but it's reasonably acceptable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third of the three films Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks starred in together, You've Got Mail is my favorite of the three. Joe Versus the Volcano was a great and quirky adventure, but Sleepless In Seattle was merely OK, having made the mistake of keeping Ryan and Hanks apart for too long, as the greatest appeal of their films is the two's chemistry. You've Got Mail manages to brilliantly find a way to keep them apart and together at the same time.Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox are internet pen pals, frequently sending e- mails to one another, not knowing each other's real name and leaving out specifics that would give away their identities. In their real lives, Kathleen runs a quaint little bookstore called The Shop Around The Corner, while Joe runs Fox Books, a chain of book superstores, one of which is opening near The Shop Around The Corner. As the two clash in their real lives they continue to communicate and develop a relationship through their e-mails, not knowing their rivalry.As previously mentioned, the greatest part of the film is the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. I never get bored watching the two interact, always funny and engrossing with extremely quotable dialogue. The supporting cast consisting of members such as Jean Stapleton, Dave Chappelle, Parker Posey, and Greg Kinnear, all doing exactly what the supporting cast should do, providing a lot of comedic support to the two leads but not overshadowing them.I highly recommend You've Got Mail. If you're a fan of either Meg Ryan or Tom Hanks, or both (like me), you'll definitely enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does everyone think this movie is a romantic comedy about two people who fall in love with each other over the internet? You guys are way off. Maybe the original was about that, but this movie is about the debate over email. Think about it. Can people really fall in love over the internet without ever having seen each other? What if they were some psycho serial killer like the roof top killer or worse what if they were the very person that you thought that you hated the most, but turned out to be a perfect match for? Just like in the movie trying to get a match in real life is just imperfect as email. Think about how they both where unhappy with the person they were married too even though they they thought they where perfect for them. Will email bring the end to regular mail? Just like how Fox Books eventually closes the Shop Around the Corner because it is cheaper, more convenient, and more modern just like email is. But just like email is to regular mail it lacks the very personal and very quaintness of writing a letter to someone. Everything the Shop Around the Corner has that Fox Books is missing, but we will go on just like she goes on after the store is closed. People communicate much better over the internet and it has been hailed as the way people have been able to come together peacefully.Remember when she says "I finally said exactly what I wanted to say"? That is in reference to how people type emails and retype emails because it doesn't sound just right. Email is able to bring two New Yorkers together who hate each other in real life because it is the great communicator. Will email eventually be the end of all human contact? NO! Email brings people together and they will eventually meet just like in the end. Both never reveal who they really are and any personal detail but they meet and spend lots of time together. The analogies are all there just look for them. Heck it's even in the title! You've got mail! NOT EMAIL! You guys are half right about it. It romanticizes the debate over email.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes like this ought to make people furious. This one cost $65 million to make. Why not just re-release Ernst Lubitsch's original movie? THAT'S the good one, after all, the one that we'd all be better off seeing - and lucky for me, I'm in a position to know, since I've seen it. If I hadn't I'd be really annoyed. I'm driven mad by frustration at the thought that an Adam Sandler remake of Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" will soon be hitting Australian cinemas; in this case, I haven't seen the original, I know I ought to see it, and I'd very much like to - but I won't be given the chance.It's not as if Nora Ephron had an alternate take on the material, or her own distinctive way of presenting it. She's scarcely even bothered to re-adapt it. She's merely "updated" it - given us something "relevant" and oh-so-1990s in the place of something she no doubt saw as being passé and 1930s. Where she comes up with new material, she's as lugubrious and unimaginative as in everything she's turned out after "When Harry Met Sally", a script on which it appears she used up all the good ideas she would ever get. The characters are didactic. The humour is leaden. The jokes aren't even funny in the abstract. The action doesn't so much stop as congeal. One sits back and wonders idly which of the two - Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan - is trying the hardest to be charming, with the least success, or whether it's worse to watch Ephron's original scenes, which are bad through and through, or those which she's lifted from the source material, which contain good moments ruined.By the way, while I'm in favour of small business and opposed to anonymous chain stores, Fox Books is clearly a better store than The Shop Around The Corner, from the customer's point of view, in every way. Meg Ryan's "service" consists of bombarding people with unsolicited advice and aggressive chit-chat from the moment they walk in the door. At least the staff at Fox leave their poor customers in peace. Yes, it's a pity they're powerless casual workers, but not once in her high-horse campaign does Meg Ryan mention the single respect in which her shop really is morally superior to the competition. If she did, who knows? Maybe people would realise that the solution wasn't to save her business in particular but to better regulate the labour market.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've been there and IT'S not like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I met my husband online four years ago, in a chatroom, in a fabuolous whirlwind romance, and when we heard of "You've Got Mail" we were both curious to see 'our story' on the big screen. But the fact that this was a Hanks/Ryan movie meant we didn't actually watch it till it was out on video and we got desperately short of other choices.And unsurprisingly, it was interminable, boring, unexciting, slow, unromantic and unreal. Everything our own experience was not. The urgency of our need to communicate totally passes by the authors of this movie. My husband and I would spend entire nights chatting, exchange 60 emails a day, run home to the computer to look for more messages after we'd been out, spend sleepless nights when we were apart, dream only of the moment when it would be possible to meet in person at last (we were on opposite sides of the pond), and when the internet connection was slow call each other on the phone for hours. Plus send each other faxes and snail mail every single day till we finally were united.We've met other people with similar experiences to ours, and the lightning speed with which romantic online relationships develop seems to be common to us all.It's clear to me what this movie is about: exploiting the apparent success of the oh-so-uninteresting Ryan/Hanks love stories of the past. The internet romance was just a vehicle to bring these two together on the screen one more time. Whoever wrote the script has no idea what they were talking about.I wouldn't have bothered writing a review for a movie this inferior, but felt compelled because I've been there and I know it's nothing like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a cute film! Unrealistic as all getout, but cute. This is the kind of fluff that you get all gooey and romantic over and go "Ahhhhh,Love!"; then reality sets in and you remember that this sort of affair only happens in books and movies. I had a great time watching Meg and Tom together again - how well I recall them in one of my all time faves "Sleepless in Seattle". If you are a hopeless romantic then by all means see this one, it is a keeper!</fullReview>

It's kinda like their old movie Sleepless in Seattle but I like this movie much more better because the two characters have more time on screen together. This movie is about these two people that live in New York that they fall in love over the internet but ooutside their business rivals. Tom Hanks's character Joe Fox owns a big bookstore company while Meg Ryan's character Kathleen Kelly owns a small bookstore and is running out of business. I recommend this movie for whoever enjoys romanctic comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got to hand it to Nora Ephron and her sister Delia. This is the most "professionally" done film I have ever seen. I thought I would reserve this word for Barbara Broccoli and the crew behind TOMORROW NEVER DIES, but I just can't. Is there a more calculated movie out there than YOU'VE GOT MAIL? I mean, the producing on this film is just flat out perfect. Is there any Starbucks/AOL refrence that they missed? I don't think so. And what a joy for Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks to work on ... they didn't have to do any, and they don't. Remotely interesting actors like Greg Kinnear and Steve Zahn are just simply cut-out, 'cause god knows we don't want anything to take away from the glowing close-ups of Meg Ryan (what with all of her clothing, hair, and make-up assistants doing all of that work).The funny thing here is that we have seen the evolution of Nora Ephorn. We started our journey with the Jack Nicholson/Meryl Streep vehicle HEARTBURN, which is a very good, solid film. We progressed by watching Rob Reiner create a modern classic from her script for Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan called WHEN HARRY MET SALLY ..., and then we saw little Nora take all the strings competently in the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan vehicle SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE. What has she learned? That a- you cast a genuine superstar Tom Hanks, opposite b- a genuine cutie Meg Ryan, and fill the air with c- Nat King Cole/Jimmy Durante etc.. And then you have a movie, right? No, what you have is YOU'VE GOT MAIL, because along the line you secure corporate sponsorships from STARBUCKS and AOL (during the movie, I kept asking myself where the GAP plug and the Dave Matthews song?). This film is the epitome of formula filmmaking. Did anyone have any original thoughts during this production? And on top of all of this, did they have to use the same Hallmarky photography that was employed in MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE? And who has ever seen New York City streets as clean as these? Boy, I tell ya', I wish the Ephron sisters had taught at my film school, 'cause they are the very definition of "produced" and if they had been on staff at my alma mater, Id be working on films rather than writing about them. Jerry Bruckheimer obviously doesn't know what he's doing (yes, his films are "produced", but, oh, I forgot ... they're entertaining and fun also). This is one of those films you really wished you had not seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Warning: May contain some spoilers*I rented this movie yesterday and I have to say I expected something as charming and funny as "Sleepless In Seattle". Guess if I was surprised! The movie lacks everything "Sleepless In Seattle" had, except for Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan of course. The story was extremely mediocre with flaws bigger than the Atlantic Ocean.I didn't laugh once during the entire film, I just smiled a few times. And the romance? Did anyone really buy that? Fall in love on the net, even though they didn't know ANYTHING about each other? I mean, come on. And why wasn't Meg Ryan's character angry when she found out who her love from the net was? Her behaviour was so irrational. The ending of "You've Got Mail" is one of THE worst endings I have ever seen in a romantic comedy.The only thing who saved this movie from total humiliation was the performances by Hanks and Ryan.If you were planning on seeing this movie, I can only advice you not to. If you would like to see a good romantic comedy, see "The Brothers McMullen", "Four Weddings and a Funeral" or the very underrated "Kissing a Fool". Anything but this.I give "You've got Mail" *1/2 / ****</fullReview>

I wanted Ryan's character to show more love for children's books, it would have given her more character. I wanted Hanks to have more time to try to charm her, it felt a bit rushed. Still it a good move and gives you lots to talk about with your friends. Otherwise I would not be writing this.See it, its worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YOU'VE GOT MAIL ( rating, * out of 5 )Once again I find myself in the position where I'm going to make myself highly unpopular, (territory I'm starting to become well-acquainted with). I really wanted to like this movie but alas, it left a bitter taste in my mouth, the same way phosphate on a slice of asbestos would.This soulless movie has really wound me up and made me very angry, angry because the talented film-makers have sold out and gone for the big pay-day - cashed in on an established formula and cast, and have consequently walked away with more cash than a Miami laundry operated by Colombian Drug Lords. So, without further ado, I'm going to let my acid tongue loose and I'm in a right mood to be caustic and belittling.'You've Got Mail' is almost too excruciating to describe but I'll struggle to press on. In a nutshell, it's about falling in love via the Internet E-Mail. Woopy do. The Ephron sisters, Nora and Delia with their contemptuous artistic vision, construct this connect-the-dots-plot that fires cliches like ballistic missiles.This film has absolutely nothing to say and takes forever to say it - a classic example of how 119 minutes can pass without anything actually happening - a mind-numbing movie that could serve a more useful purpose as a New Age meditation tape.I was left completely underwhelmed as this pretentious guff attempts to take flight like a pelican with lead boots. Even though it's packaged with pretty ribbons and bows, the facts are irrefutable. This is a basement-brow romantic comedy that stumbles over romance and airs on the unfunny side of amusing - I've laughed more during eulogies.There is no doubt, 'You've Got Mail' was produced for the sole reason of reuniting Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and to unashamedly make a truck load of money. I despise the film makers arrogance and the fact that they have gotten away with it. My only consolation is that all the video copies of this movie will one day make good landfill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing really. At one time you used to think that you could fall in love with someone's voice and their personality perhaps over the phone. Beauty is only skin deep as they say. Now the internet comes along and it takes that theory a step further.Tom Hanks is awesome, just as he always is. He really makes you laugh and he is flawless in his comedic timing. Ryan is cute just as she always is and by the time these two get together at the end, you are so starved for them to do so that you literally cheer when it happens. But the guy who makes the movie is Dabney Coleman. He may have all of 10 minutes screen time, but he makes your sides burst every time he is on the screen. This is a very funny, romantic film.

As the movie progresses, you become more and more anxious and interested about the romantic chemistry between Hanks and Ryan. Many laughs also contribute to the relationship that forms between the two. It starts off very rocky between both Ryan and Hanks and it is impossible to see how they could ever get together under such intense circumstances, but that makes it all the more fun to watch.

If the events in this film actually happened in real life, poor old Tom Hanks would wind up with a restraining order at best and be put in jail at worst.He does almost every stalker's trick short of opening her real mail before she Meg Ryan reads it. I felt the film had a malevolent tone that made my skin crawl. It is so far short of being romantic it reminded me of a horror film where the killer learns everything about his victim before slitting her throat. I wanted to leave but unfortunately I was on a plane.although it was a close call.If all you have to do in life is deliberately crush someone's business, read all their private thoughts without their knowledge and then utilise this information to "trick" them into liking the "real" you by hanging around and offering uncannily accurate advice, then stalking should be legalised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've got to love or hate this one. Which is which? There's not explaining much about this catchy title known as YOU'VE GOT MAIL. It is a righteous two-hour romantic comedy that plays almost similar to a mellow sitcom. Like Nora Ephron's SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, it tries to mimic something from a golden age classic on a black and white print. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan still have their proper roots to make this worth sitting on a loveseat with Kleenexes., even if two of their worlds don't exactly collide. It's the Internet jargon that sputters, letting this emotional (???) experience go wishy-washy right where it is (at this current moment) senseless to produce a cyber-love romance. For a movie that does brilliant with storytelling, the Internet idea is mighty cute (and rare!). A good contemporary romance, nonetheless, but there's more room left over for tweaking out this totally new concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one will ever see this, but what the hell ... I have no excuse for the fact that I've seen this movie. I was on a ferry and was looking for an excuse to stare at a wall for 2 hours. This is one of the most offensive films ever to make a bunch of Hollywood millionaires richer. I find it amazing not only that the producers of this film could condescend to such a low level, but also that a ton of people ate it up and begged for more.Aside from the obvious exploitation of Tom Hanks as a cutesy nice-guy-at-heart type (such as the unbearable carnival montage, in which he is depicted riding around in the kiddie cars and other such calculated moves to make us say "Awwwww."), the real problem is the implicit sexism. The lesson Meg Ryan learns is that ultimately, she does not need to run her own business and carry on the family tradition, because her man will be making all the decisions for her. Her life gets oh-so much better after he has clobbered her book shop and gives her a job at his big phallic megamart. Plus she gets to be in love with him after he has fingered both sides of their disturbing "secret romance." This film makes "Joe Vs. the Volcano" look like "Citizen Kane."It seems to me the reason this film received any audience approval is because we have been subjected to these implicitly didactic tomes for so long we mistake its disturbing vision for "sweet sweet romance." I am outraged at Hollywood, as this is new low for them, and I am depressed for the droves of people who lapped it all up. Claiming "light entertainment" as a defense is no excuse. For it is through the most innocuous means that society is shaped. If this is any indication, the apocalypse is close at hand.I have seen two horsemen, and they are Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.</fullReview>

For a start, You've Got Mail has a decent ending: 'Sleepless' (if I remember rightly) did not reward us so well.On the lead up to that final scene however we see a brilliantly paced, delightfully funny story with characters that were pleasantly believable. Tom Hanks, in a subtle kind of way, was a lot more on form than he was in Sleepless in Seattle and as for Meg Ryan, all I can say is she was wonderful.For me, everything was perfect: great story, great performances, romantic highs and touching lows... needless to say I was tremendously impressed by this film which I feel so far hasn't demanded the respect it so truly deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched most of Nora Ephron's movies and have most of them in my video collection. We must have the same sense of humor since I find her movies to be not only funny, but with deep content. At home we use expressions such as, "What is it with women and pillows?"(Mixed Nuts), "What is it called when all lines intersect? The Bermuda Triangle" (Sleepless in Seattle), "You are the first thing I want to see in the morning and the last thing I want to see before I go to bed" (When Harry Met Sally). Meg Ryan was nominated for a Globe Awards for the part. She did a good job in this movie. Tom Hanks is just great! I read comments where people think that they are getting old to play those type of roles. I do not take that view, since there is no statute of limitations for falling in love. At least I have not heard of one! Even though I do not like to compare movies, "You've Got Mail" is very "Ephron". Getting trapped in the elevator, cute kids and cute dogs, the NY scenery in different seasons,the beautiful garden where Shopgirl and NYxxxx really meet, this is all true "Ephron". The story topped with Meg and Tom make this a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

The chemistry is there throughout the entire movie and, with an all-star cast including two veterans of screen and television such as John Randolph and Jean Stapleton, You've Got Mail has a great chance of being nominated for an Oscar this year. Reminding me of such wonderful films as It's a Wonderful Life and It Happened One Night, You've Got Mail takes the viewer back to a simpler age and time while still dealing with the little electronic mailbox so common in our lives today. A great job of acting, production, directing, and casting. Thank you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail is akin to a breath of fresh air to movie goers. It's charming, romantic and fun, and Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks delight as two competitive book store owners who become intimate friends over the internet. The movie opens your mind and heart up to the reason why certain people find it easier to get to know someone over the internet than in person. This is a wonderful film for the romantics and the wide-eyed dreamers that believe in soul mates and happy endings. (The many novel references will delight literary buffs). I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's about time! Tom Hanks &amp; Meg Ryan-- together again--are reminiscent of romantic couples from decades ago. Hanks &amp; Ryan are like a modern day Spencer Tracy &amp; Katherine Hepburn. When a couple has chemistry, why not pair them up as often as possible?"You've Got Mail" is a refreshing romantic comedy that _works_ without anyone baring anything but their souls. Unbelievably refreshing!I laughed or smiled the whole way through, thanks to Tom Hanks' delivery of his lines. And Meg Ryan was perfect in the part of the children's book shop owner. ...I'm still smiling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really enjoyed "You've Got Mail" the new pairing of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (without a doubt 2 of the cutest people in the world). Of course, the original gem "Shop around the corner" was about as perfect a film as one could make back then and there were two things that would have made this film perfect had they followed the original a little more. When Joe "stands" her up on the date, he should have emailed her (as in the original) and informed her that he saw her there with a "handsome" man and did not want to intrude and Joe also should have pretended the email buddy came to see him and lead her to believe her soul mate was inferior to him. Overall, it was very entertaining but it is hard to improve on these old films!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOT's of spoilers here, but I assume many of us current reviewers have seen it a time or 2. If not, you may not want to read further. This has been my "go-to" movie for 10 years. What I mean by this is on occasion when I'm home alone on a rainy day, or have friends over or just want to watch a movie that makes me feel good, I pop the VCR tape of this movie in (I really must get the DVD), sit back and enjoy every moment! There are so many great elements to this film, starting with the beautiful chemistry between Meg Ryan &amp; Tom Hanks. Unfortunately in the years since this film has been made, Mr Hanks has fallen off my A-list of "Stars whose movies I'll watch" due to his jumping on the causes and political bandwagon, but I digress...In this movie Mr Hanks is unspoiled, charming and romantic. Other elements which continually draw me to this movie are The little book shop with it's eclectic supporting staff....shout out to Steve Zahn &amp; the amazing Jean Stapleton! The houseboat his dad lives on, and speaking of his dad... Dabney Coleman, Love him! The kids, F-O-X. "Matthew is my father's son, Annabelle is my grandfather's daughter. We are... an American family." The conversation they have on the bench after their walk thru the Farmer's market. And then, "They're so friendly. Don't you think daisies are the friendliest flower?" And the ending... "Brinkley!" Cue the music...."Some-where ov-er the Rain-bow.... "Don't cry, Shopgirl. Don't cry. I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be you so badly." And I'm happy and I'm crying like a baby! Every time, like I'm watching it for the first time all over again. The story, the romance, the tingling on the inside, the hope... my favorite movie. Much better than Sleepless in Seattle, which leaves me frustrated at best. I am a hopeless romantic. If you are too, or just have a desire to see a fairytale on a quiet afternoon, you will enjoy this movie. As you can see for yourself, the majority of "Hated It" reviews are written by men. As a general rule, men don't like chick flicks, and this movie fulfills every definition of what a chick flick entails. Love it, love it, love it! demographic: married, over 50 now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, please, it wasn't that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was kinda looking forward to seeing You've Got Mail, because I know there were so many parodies and it is a film that over all is pretty well mentioned in a conversation of cinema. Tom and Meg would seem like a good combination for a romantic comedy, but to be honest, I wasn't all that impressed by their performances or the story itself. It seemed to dull and predictable, you know? Maybe it was just me, but it couldn't have been, because I was very happy to see this movie when I slipped it into the DVD player this morning! See what I mean? Joe and Kathleen have been e-mailing each other and having an internet romance, only they don't get personal, to where they know each other's real names or business. Kathleen works at a little bookstore where the clerks know their work and really help their customers, Joe becomes the lead manager of a new huge discount book store down the street that might destroy Kathleen's business. They fight face to face not knowing that they truly love each other through these love letters online.You can pretty much guess how the plot goes, because it is a typical romantic comedy. It isn't me either, I had asked my mom and friend who both saw this movie what they thought, and they said that it was over rated, I completely agree. It was a waste of two terrific actor's talents and the story was just nothing, it didn't work. I couldn't even call this a romantic comedy, because there wasn't any funny moments, so I'm not understanding the 6.1 rating on IMDb.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THis film had good structure, the cast complemented each other well and there was definite on screen chemistry. Unfortunately Meg Ryan's character (Kathleen) has her family business founded by her dead mother run into the ground by Tom Hanks (Joe). Kathleen fights a losing battle and eventually loses her store at this point she says to her anonymous pen pal (Joe) "I'm heartbroken...I feel like a part of me has died and my mother has died all over again". This woman is truly miserable but suddenly as if she realises there's not long left in the movie her entire mod changes. Briefly Kathleen mentions becoming a writer but after a very convincing Meg Ryan playing a truly heart broken down to earth woman, it just seems un-realistic when in the last 15 minutes she decides what the hell I don't care too much. Her store is gone her mothers legacy lost but because the film has to end shortly she very very very quickly falls in love Joe and the film ends. Very disappointing conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** MILD SPOILER ALERT*** I am a sucker for romantic comedies, maybe because they are an escape from reality. And, I was not disappointed by "You've Got Mail" - I enjoyed it. I was able to forget about the bill collectors and how far away my family is from me and all those other worries only significant to myself. If you are a fan of the romantic comedy genre, you won't be disappointed. I do have one caveat with this film. I find it odd that Ryan's character, as a small business owner (***SPOILER*** that was eventually put out of business by the larger box store *** END SPOILER***) still bought coffee at Starbucks. I wonder how many small coffee shops 'around the corner' have been put out of business by Starbucks???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers following.Admittedly: The chemistry between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan works very well. And the supporting roles and actors are very good (Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Steve Zahn). But all that is not enough to save a film of which the premises are spoiled from the start._When Harry Met Sally_ will always be Nora Ephron's masterpiece, and *the* romantic comedy of the 80s. Nowadays we know that she didn't come up with the _WHMS_ of the 90s (that was _4 Weddings And A Funeral_, if anybody's wondering). She did come up with some abysmal scripts, however, and this remake is among them.A man and a woman have an anonymous Internet friendship. In Real Life they are direct rivals; she owns an independent bookstore, while he is heir to a big bookstore chain. When she asks her unknown email-partner for advice, they agree to meet. He finds out that his email sweetheart is his business rival - and decides not to tell her. This is the point after which the movie becomes unbearable. It worked fine so far (even in the scene where Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) doesn't tell his rival Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) who he is when he comes to her store).Near the end of the film, Joe asks Kathleen if she can't ever forgive him for putting her out of business. While I think she could forgive him for that, she should never ever forgive him for lying to her not only once, but twice, about his identity. This is dishonest, dishonorable behaviour (and, as several of my co-commentators remarked, cyber-stalking), and every woman should run, not walk, away from any man who behaves like that. I really don't see what's romantic about that. And relationships based on lies have a rotten track record.What does this movie teach us about ethical behaviour in relationships? Nothing good, that's for sure.Somebody pass me that mental floss, please...</fullReview>

This film really made me sing when I walked out from the cinema as if I could own the world that night. The chemistry between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan is definitely impressive and we could see that in "Sleepless in Seattle". The camera work is quite good and the acting matches the highest expectations. I really think they should promote this kind of movie. Especially nowadays, in a sociaty where looks and sex seem to have taken over true love. So if you are hopelessly romantic this film is a must and if not you can still have a good time watching the funny situations in which Meg and Tom get involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw You've Got Mail. I hated it.What does it mean? That it's okay for big capitalists to do in small businesses and then have the ditzy but pure hearted small business owner to jump in the sack with him? And that it is good for the small business owner, who has just been jerked around and taught a lesson "for her own good" by said capitalist, to flee for comfort into his protective arms? Sounds pretty retro to me.Although I have always sort of liked Tom Hanks (how can you not) for some reason I have always been deeply suspicious of Meg Ryan (except in When Harry Met Sally - wasn't that her in some other life?) She's made a career of appealing to men's befuddled desire for a woman who is childishly cute and very non-threatening and, let's face it, not very real.

This movie was definitely a complete waste of time, in fact I am still in shock that it has gotten such great reviews. The best thing I got out of this movie was a nap and a few good laughs at the fact that people still actually enjoy mindless, less than awful romantic comedies that leave you thinking, "Is this a joke?"

		<fullReview>Well, this was actually pretty good, though its scenes were all rather short-did Nora Ephron go to the same editing class as Micheal Bay in Armageddon? I would have liked a little pacing in some of the scenes. And I was sorry to see the supporting cast-Coleman, Jean Stapleton, etc. all vanish in the final 15 minutes too. Jean seemed to add something to the movie, as did David Chappelle(Here I was wrong, thought Chapelle was Andre Braugher of 'Homicide'. What do I know...) and co. I had no trouble with the plot itself, though it bothered me that Meg Ryan didn't catch onto Tom Hanks' identity quicker. Just could not quite buy that to be honest. They did seem to work well together, as they did in 'Sleepless', which I found to be the better film. That had a little more heart, you know? This one was a bit too cute for its own good in places.They exist in a Never-never version of Manhatten, by the way-not a bum, hooker or Rudy Juliani poster anywheres. Most NY parks aren't quite as gussied up as what you saw there, either.But never mind-it is a decent, well made film, with its heart in the right place, if somewhat too blantently 'Rah rah AOL' in places. I liked it, it didn't surprise me in the least but that is fine, what is familiar is good too, if made well.*** outta ****, pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most, I was drawn to the film through the success of "Sleepless," but I can't help but think the film makers missed the point on this one.Meg Ryan has been endearing and adorable in other films, but was pitiful and "pouty" in this one. She can't bear the cross of the comic relief which I thought was obvious to all in "French Kiss." And poor Tom Hanks is no romantic lead without Rob Reiner or Ross Malinger to play off of. The characters of his father and grandfather were good in their own rights, but they were no awkward sidekicks that the audience could fall in love with.The supporting cast was all this film had going for it. Greg Kinnear, Dabney, Jean, and John Randolph were the only reasons I looked up from my watch.Just like a good cookie still has salt in the recipe, You've Got Mail should have tried something else besides sugar for theirs. For cheese of this caliber, I can watch Touched By An Angel for free . . .</fullReview>

I've been a Meg Ryan fan for years, even though I still think that "Harry &amp; Sally" was the best movie she ever did, this one comes second. While "Sleepless in Seattle" was too fixed on this other movie that I have never seen and I could not relate to the 'why' they fall in love (I know that can't be explained), the storyline of "You've Got Mail" really touched me.

		<shortDescription>Ryan And Hanks Light Up The Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To those who are wont to put forth the proposition that `They don't make ?em like they used to,' I have a rejoinder: The two best romantic comedies ever made, EVER, have come our way since 1998; one of them is `You've Got Mail,' an absolute delight of a movie directed with heart-felt care and finesse by Nora Ephron. It's the story of two people who meet in a chat room on the Internet; Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is the owner of a chain of bookstores, and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is the owner of a small, independent children's book store called `The Shop Around The Corner,' whose continued existence is threatened by the Fox superstore which offers discounts and cappuccino. Harsh competitors in the real world, they are able to connect with one another via the net only because of the anonymity provided by cyberspace, where neither has a clue as to whom the other really is. The charismatic Hanks delves beneath the businessman veneer of Fox to give him some real humanity; he's tough in the trenches of commerce, but he makes it clear that this is a guy whose interests range beyond the bottom line. Hanks lends a natural, self-assurance and charm that makes Fox a complete character, and one you can't help but like. And Meg Ryan has never been better than she is here as Kathleen Kelly, a role she was born to play. As soon as you meet her, you feel as though you've known her a long time; she is so open, wears her heart on her sleeve and has a vulnerability and benevolence to her nature that make her totally endearing. Ryan imbues her with a joy and warmth that is almost tangible, and she plays her with nuance that is distinctly drawn and which makes her unique from any character she's ever done before. There's a real chemistry between her and Hanks, and Ryan utterly lights up the screen with her winsomeness. There's a terrific supporting cast on hand here as well, which includes Greg Kinnear (Frank), Parker Posey (Patricia), Heather Burns (Christina), Steve Zahn (George) , Jean Stapleton (Birdie), David Chappelle (Kevin), Dabney Coleman (Nelson Fox) and John Randolph (Schuyler Fox). This is a great story, with outstanding performances by all, the dialogue is crisp and witty, and it's all put together and delivered so well, and with such style and class by Ephron that it makes `Sleepless In Seattle,' (an excellent movie in it's own right) seem like a mere warm-up for this team. The music, with the choice of songs and the specific scenes into which they are inserted, is just another reason this film works so well. The musical interludes, which set Hanks and Ryan at different stages of their relationship against the backdrop of New York City, are entirely effective; the city comes alive during these scenes and adds further character to the overall ambience of the movie. `You've Got Mail' is quite simply the second best romantic comedy ever made, and it should have walked away with a basketful of Oscars, especially for Meg Ryan's performance. And anyone who comes away from this one thinking differently is jaded and needs some serious help (and I say that with a smile, folks), because this is one terrific movie that must not be missed. If there's any romance in your soul at all, you're going to love this one. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a another remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had two big problems with this movie. The first one is that all romantic comedies of the 1980's and 1990's seems to duplicate each other. Always the same thing! Always oldies music in it! No surprise! So are the most of the movies with Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts. It's got no originality. Thesecond problem is that I hate remakes! And 1940's The Shop Around the Corner was one of my favorite romantic comedy of all time, because the great Ernst Lubitch directs it and young James Stewart was in it. The 1940 version is full of charm! There was a musical remake, in 1949, In the Good Old Summertime, featuring Judy Garland. And it was badder! Now here comes the 1998 version, with Meg Ryan, with oldies music in it. The idea of Nora Ephron was not so bad. It had differences with the original. In the 1940's, the man and the woman works at the same place. And, of course, they don't write e-mails! I also like the idea of the battle between big surface book store and the little shop with humanity. And I was ANGRY, real ANGRY when Meg closes his store, because of these stupid big stores! But a lot of scenes between Ryan and Hanks are similar to the ones between James Stewart and Margarett Sullivan. Looking at those scenes, I was always thinking about Stewart. At that point, it don't work with me. But, this version is not so bad. It's just not great and shows little imagination and creativity, one particular of most of the American movies of the 1990's (remakes, adaptations of sixties TV works, catastrophic versions of French Films, special effects films, etc.) For the emotions of the finale, see the 1940 version. Very much better with James Stewart!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Writing Produces Good Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[WARNING: A review cannot be written without spoilers. You have been warned.]I really wanted to dislike this film. However, in the end I couldn't.I was frequently annoyed at Meg Ryan's theatrical mannerisms. Moreover, I resented the Manhattan snobbery abundant in the film and which was best evidenced by Ryan's female clerk who espoused the following, "If you close, I'll lose my job and have to move to Brooklyn." Gee, life is hard in the real world isn't it? She may have well admitted she didn't want to live amongst the working class, or dare I say it, "minorities." This goes to show that some of those who live at the very center of the most metropolitan of cities can be bigger, small town hicks, than the residents of Andy's fictional Mayberry.However, by the graces of outstanding writing, which avoided the all too convenient escape route of predictable happy endings, the small shop did indeed close, under commercial pressure. Miraculously, life did not end for the unlucky workers of the small shop. In fact, they went on to other things, as in real life. Of course the film doesn't follow every one of them post closure, but we are given enough assurance through the actions of the lead, Ryan.Another surprise of the film is how it expertly avoided relying too much on its gimmicky title. The internet aspect of the romance was not a crutch. Real interaction amongst interesting characters avoided the trap.This is like an old time love story.

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Two Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've Got Mail can be looked at on two levels. As a love story, it's successful enough, though not terribly original. We've seen Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan doing this before; they work well together, and it's fun to see them at it again.On the other hand, the other story going on - the conflict between the small corner bookstore and the big chain - gets in the way of the obligatory happy ending.Now suppose the roles had been reversed; would anybody perceive this as being a happy ending, and the movie containing this story as a fun romantic comedy - or would all the attention be focused on the business battle?The implied message here is that love is more important to women than their career. In the end, You've Got Mail is unsatisfying, because the love story is overrun by the sexism of its conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Oscar should happen...****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie brings back Tom Hanks' comedic aspects. This movie may have Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks together again, but in no way is it a duplicate to the '93 hit "Sleepless in Seattle". These 2 oscar deserving actors are 2 ordinary people, though Tom is a rich successful book dealer (Fox Books (much like Barnes and Noble)). Joe Fox, Tom's character, is just an ordinary guy looking for love behind that rich, greedy exterior. Katherine Kelly, Meg Ryan's character is the owner of the "Shop around the Corner", a tiny children's bookstore on 72nd street in NYC. Joe opens a bookstore down the block from her. You can picture what happened then. The quinkie - dink here is that Joe and Katherine met in an Over30 chat room under the screen-names NY152 and Shopgirl. 152 Riverside Dr. is Joe's address. The rest you will have to see for yourself. Because this is a romantic - comedy it will not get nominated for anything, though it should. Tom should be against himself in a tight race for Saving Private Ryan and this. Meg Ryan was awesome, simply put. See it this holiday season with your love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in love with this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>although many cynics and detractors are quick to compare this film as an extension of "sleepless in seattle," i like to look at it apart from that (also lovely) film. what really draws me to "you've got mail" is the attention it gives to words and reading. tom hanks and meg ryan (who have amazing chemistry and are wonderful, evocative actors) are charmed with each other based on the words they say, not something superficial like looks. the film's premise allows both leads to fall in love with the other over email. through their messages (and the haven of anonymity that cyberspace offers) they can expose themselves honestly and vulnerably. i'm also excited that perhaps this film will generate some renewed interest in one of my favorite books: "pride and prejudice."i just loved the light, sunny atmosphere this movie provides. after all, if this movie is to be compared to anything at all, it should be within the genre of the romantic comedy. these films should be fantasies, their purpose is to indulge in all our romantic naivete and whimsy. it doesn't emulate real life, but gives us the option to hope: can love happen like this? i left the theater feeling warm and happy, what more can a theatergoer ask for?hanks and ryan obviously radiate. their chemistry is amazing and their acting is never amiss. i was very moved by some of their heartfelt declarations. complaining about this pairing (again) would be complaining about the multiple pairings of katharine hepburn and spencer tracy or katharine hepburn and cary grant. and who has not been delighted by these pairs?anyway, the bottom line is that i am in love with this movie, and in love with its view on love. i adore it so much that i've already seen it twice and advise any one with a romantic spirit to see it at once!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are any number of films which I can say that, on an objective level are far worse than this film: 'Bloody Murder', any of the 'Friday the Thirteenth' franchise and any number of godawful action flicks all have pathetic production values, dreadful acting, cruddy scripts and no characterisation. However I hate this film with a passion that goes beyond my contempt for the aforementioned.This is possibly the dullest film I've ever seen in my life.Film is one of the most exciting, vibrant media for the telling of stories it can be compelling, immediate and breathtaking, or intimate and subtle.You've got M@il manages to kick the life out of the medium, but wearing pillows on it's feet so it takes a long time.Those two hours stretched on into eternity and because it was my future father-in-law subjecting me to it, I couldn't just say turn it off, please make it stop. It wasn't just me that hated it. My wife does too.I think the overwhelming problem with the movie is that I cared about the characters as much as I would about the bland, faceless ciphers that get torn apart in horror flicks i.e. not at all. In fact a hockey-masked maniac tearing them apart would have raised a cheer. Anything to add a little colour.The script wasn't up to the standard of a good TV sitcom.Dull, smug, self satisfied twaddle.I could go on like this for hours and you wouldn't scratch how badly this film scarred me. Hell is indeed other people, if they're Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (and a Nora Ephron marathon on infinite repeat in the background)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a great play and maybe better old movie, this film had promise. A likable cast, a once-skilled writer/director, surely it could work as a romantic comedy, right? WRONG.If there's a lazier, more pleased-with-itself, predictable, trite, non-urgent movie than this, I'd like to know--so I can avoid it too.If you go in expecting the Nora Ephron of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY or SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, you'll be disappointed. This is the Nora Ephron of similarly lame movies MIXED NUTS and MICHAEL.This movie is remarkable in only one way: the product placements for America Online are perhaps the most unrelenting you've ever seen. Do yourself a favor and rent the original SHOP AROUND THE CORNER instead. Back then, Hollywood knew how to make a romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly despicable movie. (Spoiler alert!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I will qualify this by saying that I enjoyed both Sleepless in Seattle and Joe vs. the Volcano, which are two other Tom Hanks - Meg Ryan romantic movies. Yes, even a heterosexual male such as myself can enjoy getting lost in a love story, if it's a good one.You've Got Mail! is anything but romantic. Basically what director Nora Ephron did is took the plot of The Shop Around the Corner and "modernized" it. In theory this would be fine and bringing Hanks and Ryan together again wasn't a bad idea... in theory. Somehow, Ephron created a movie about a predator (Hanks) and his prey (Ryan) which is not what the original movie was about, nor what a romantic movie should be about.The plot of this movie is basically this: Tom Hanks character, Joe Fox III is a millionaire businessman, not unlike a Donald Trump type person. Fox owns a chain of commercial bookstores/coffee houses. He wants to put one of his stores in every major business district and dominate the book/coffee business world. By doing so he's putting other small bookstores out of business. Enter Meg Ryan's character, Kathleen Kelly, who owns a small store around the corner that eventually she is forced to close due to Fox and his actions.Unknowingly, the two of them are friends via the internet. They fall for each other by email. Fox eventually finds out that Kathleen is the woman he has been talking to over the computer, but does not tell her. This is where the movie becomes truly horrible.What happens next is that Fox then manipulates Kathleen's feelings by pretending to be two different people, both himself and the "internet friend". He befriends her as Joe Fox in real life and keeps corresponding with her over the internet telling her completely different things under the guise of two different people. In doing so he confuses her and manipulates her. He sets up meetings with her via email and then doesn't show up (as his internet self), only to have his real life Fox self show up to cheer her up because she was "stood up". This is not romance, it's called cyber-stalking and it's a criminal act.I have a friend who was stalked via the internet and it's not romantic, it's a scary thing. You don't trick people into falling in love with you, and if someone feels the need to, they have serious emotional problems.If you are a woman and think this movie is truly romantic, then I urge you to seek counseling for your self-esteem. I am not saying this as an insult to you, I'm saying it as one human being truly concerned about another's well-being. If you feel it's romantic to have someone manipulate another to get them to fall in love, then I feel very sorry for you. There are too many women who are stalked, abused, aquaintance raped, tortured, etc. in this world and it all starts with manipulation and a man putting up a false front like Joe Fox did in this movie. Ask any woman who has been in an abusive relationship and they will tell you the same thing, "He wasn't like that when I first met him, he seemed like a really nice guy."That's what predators and abusers do, they manipulate and put up a guise of being a nice person. Just because Tom Hanks is a likeable guy, doesn't mean that his character is. Joe Fox is a stalker, and I urge you to avoid this movie if at all possible. I know I'm probably going to hear a lot of feedback about this. I'm going to hear, "But it's not real life, you're taking it too seriously." or "Don't you know that people just like to get lost in a movie?" There's nothing wrong with the suspension of disbelief or getting lost in a movie, even if it's not such a great movie, I've done it many times in my life. The fact is, that there are GOOD romantic movies out there that don't involving sneaky manipulative people. Stick with the original movie (The Shop Around the Corner), or go rent Sleepless in Seattle again, don't get lost in movies about stalkers being portrayed as nice people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike "84 Charing Cross Road"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike "84 Charing Cross Road" the writing (of letters) is largely incidental, and the real plot is 'will they get it together?' This of course means there is no suspense since in movies of this type the couple always gets it together. And so it is. This is apparently a remake of some earlier Hollywood hit and follows the romantic comedy formula perfectly, even down to the protagonists' compulsory best friends.The script is by Norah Ephron, and she does raise a laugh on occasion. When Tom Hanks introduces the children he is with to Meg Ryan, it turns out the 7 year old girl is his aunt and the 9 year old is his brother, the products of late second marriages by his father and grandfather (both still alive). "A typical American family" says Tom. I hope not - Dad and Grandad are pretty ruthless people. Recommended? Well, saw this one as an in-flight movie, so it was free. It could have been worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail 1998The main characters are Kathleen Kelly played by Meg Ryan and Joe Fox played by Tom Hanks. The movie takes us back to the time when the internet was a new thing. New and generating sparks of curiosity. Kathleen and Joe were among the people who liked the whole new idea of online chat rooms and mailing. They met each other online but decided not to share any personal details; only chatting. But in real life, both of them were business rivals. Kathleen was running a small shop of books since years, meaning, her mother used to run the shop before her. While, Joe had just started a new big and trendy book shop right across the street which ultimately led Kathleen out of business. During this whole time, online they got attached to each other even more. The tension in the movie builds up when Joe finds out the truth about his online love. He is devastated. He has no idea what to do. He loves her but knows that he is responsible for throwing her out of business and she will never accept him. The movie captures all our interest now. And the attention is worth it. The way he reveals the truth to Kathleen is the best part of the movie. Totally unpredictable, the end of the movie will bring you to tears. Before starting, I must tell you that I watched this movie in the year 2015. So, usually when I watch a movie from '90's I find the dressing of characters really bad. Fortunately, the characters here are so interesting and well defined, also the acting is carried out so well that you don't mind the dresses. Meg Ryan looks beautiful in the movie. I am not sure if I find Tom Hanks handsome. But, I love him in the movie. Brilliant acting. The movie starts out slow and for teenagers like me, will need a bit of patience. Trust me, it's worth it (esp. if you are a romantic). The point where the two characters are at war with each other in the real life, I was worried. Because, they had decided online that they will not reveal their personal details. Hats off to the script writer here, wonderful job. The mails that they send to each other are equally as interesting as the characters themselves and even in the toughest times manage not to reveal the truth about each other. So, the movie never bores you. One drawback I found was the presence of too many side characters. Like, Kathleen's current boyfriend, her two employees and her aunt. Joe's father, grandfather, girlfriend, father's wife, father's wife's daughter, grandfather's son, etc. The main thing is that all of them have at least one dialogue and not a light one. This distracts our attention from the main story. Though I think you might not mind it much. The scene director has also done a pretty good job. One of my favorite scene is the one where Kathleen sits with a wizard hat on and reads out a story for the children in the store. The movie gets a hold of you when they decide online that they will meet in person. Only the audience knows, that a disaster is following. But before both find out the truth, Joe finds out first. The thing is that Joe took the whole business thing as professional and not personal. On the other hand, it was not the same for Kelly. She was attached to her store. Joe was the reason why she has to close the store, so Joe knew that Kathleen will never accept their online love in real life. My favorite part is how Joe brings out the truth to Kathleen. Mainly because, it shows how much he loves her. It is heart touching. The ending brought me to tears and I am sure it will not disappoint you either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant little romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the original better - 1940's "The Shop Around the Corner". However, for a modern romantic comedy this one hits the spot. It alters the means of communication between the mismatched couple to email from letters. This film has Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) as the heir to a Borders-like bookstore empire whose family is opening a new store near his pen pal Kathleen Kelly's (Meg Ryan) small children's' bookstore. It is the same as its predecessor in that the pen pals actually know each other and do not like each other. It alters the basis of the disagreement to be that of Fox's big impersonal business delivering goods at a discount with the price being a largely anonymous and unknowledgeable retail staff versus Kelly's personal service and first editions that carries a large price tag for the paying customers. It turns out that, even in Manhattan, people prefer to buy discount with the result being the end of Kathleen's store. The movie keeps things interesting with several little side stories and unanswered questions. Did Joe's grandfather ever date Kathleen's mother? Did Kathleen's employee Birdie (Jean Stapleton) have an affair with Francisco Franco in her youth? Why and how did Birdie decide to buy all of that Intel stock? Then there is the whole issue of Joe's serially monogamous dad (Dabney Coleman) that plays out quite humorously and the fact that Joe has an aunt that is thirty years younger than he is. Considering Joe's mother had to be a victim of his father's philandering at some point, Joe seems to take his dad's personal habits quite casually. A very moving addition to this version of the story is Kathleen's identification of the store with her mother to the point that, when the store does finally close, she considers it to be much like her mother dying all over again.The only thing that really bothered me was the issue of Joe and Kathleen seeking other relationships while seriously involved with other people to the point of living with them and not letting on that there was anything amiss. This seemed a bit underhanded on both their parts and somewhat undermined their likability, at least to me.Now I wrote the paragraphs above several years ago. The technology was relevant to the year it was made -1997. Of course today, everybody would be texting one another, and Joe's bookstore would probably be just as extinct as Kathleen's since Amazon managed to put not just the independent bookstores out of business, but big brick and mortar chains like Border's. Of course, that is not the point of the film. The point is love finding two people who on the surface seem completely mismatched in every way, and who, on top of that, are competitors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've got mail. Have you got any mail? If you got and that too from an unknown people and grew up friendship with him or her, then you can easily get what this movie is. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan the two lead cast here get the exact friendship as respectively Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly what the title scents. The plot goes with various ups and downs in this Rom-Com. From sending mails to complete strangers, then knowing that girl is a rival of the man, helping the girl in critical situations, at last felling in love with her - dominates the movie in a funny way. The movie can fresh the viewers mind with its sweet sense, though still there is some questions. Ain't it a little bit awkward that Joe is giving the clues that he is the same person who got mail from the girl constantly, but the girl thinks her silver lining is somewhere else. But at last she got the whole things and the movie ends in a comic way to put some laugh in viewers' leaps. Anyway, it worth a watch at least from those people who just want to get the feelings of love from a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They just don't make romantic comedies like this anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went into a thrift shop yesterday and to my surprise they had this DVD of the movie for 2 euros and I decided to buy it and check it out. This is the 3rd outing of its two leading stars Tom Hanks from Toy Story and Big and Meg Ryan from Anastasia and Kate &amp; Leopold playing the same damsel in distress in every movie she is in,but I do like Meg Ryan since I was a kid so that is why I bought this on DVD as I like Hanks and Ryan. Also they were good in the movie Sleepless In Seattle which I might get on DVD down the line. Anyway back to the film You've Got Mail which is distributed by Warner Bros Pictures in 1998 while they were celebrating 75 years of movie making is a romantic comedy about two business rivals named Joe Fox(Hanks)and Kathleen Kelly(Ryan)who start chatting online together little do they know that they have met in person on several locations. So the two fall in love online little do they know about their bookstores going head to head as he just opened a bookshop across the corner from Kathleen's bookstore which was ran by her mother before she died and since Fox Bookstores is so popular she has to end up closing up her bookstore.But will Kathleen discover that her secret admirer online is in fact Joe and will she be able to have a relationship with him? Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as the chemistry between Meg &amp; Tom was very good and even though its a tad bit predictable you can't help but root for them to get together like in the 1993 film that they both starred in Sleepless in Seattle. Also I love Ryan's haircut in this movie that in the other film that she was in with that awful haircut in Kate &amp; Leopold another romantic comedy that I secretly enjoy watching. Also starring in this movie(You've Got Mail) is Greg Kinnear from The Last Song as Kathleen's stand in love interest and Steve Zahn from Daddy Day Care. Overall I liked You've Got Mail which is almost on for 2 hours with a running time of 115 minutes and if you love a good romantic comedy that doesn't require sex in it then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some movies that I can watch all the time and others that I like but can only watch them every so often. This movie is one of the ones I love watching all the time. I read some of the reviews from people that disliked the movie and I would like to respond to some of those comments. Yes it doesn't seem to make sense that a woman who inherited a children's bookstore from her mother would fall in love with a rich guy who seemed to take pleasure in closing down small privately owned bookstores but neither one of them took an interest in the other until after Tom Hanks's character discovers that the mystery person he had been online friends with was the woman he had developed a heated rivalry with. Until then, they were bitter enemies. However, that discovery brought out the human side of Hanks's character. He knew he couldn't tell Meg Ryan's character that he was the one she had exchanged loving e-mails with for who knows how long. Not until he could get her to like him. He was disappointed about the discovery but then realized that it was a friendship he did not and could not end so he made the best of it and tried to be the nice guy she enjoyed e-mailing. When she finally took a liking to him, it made the meeting at the end easier for her to deal with. About the only thing I did not agree with in this movie was near the end when Hanks tries to get Ryan to forgive him by calling what he did "a tiny little thing." I'm sorry but putting someone out of business is not a tiny little thing in my book. At least Hanks was kind enough to hire George from her shop. No mention of what happened to the other girl. I did not like Greg Kinnear's character though. He seemed so full of himself and acted like everything he said and wrote was worthy of a Nobel Prize.</fullReview>

They have just opened a new store near a small independent bookshop owned by Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) whose business is soon adversely affected.However both characters are also anonymously emailing each other and have been for some time and have a close and fond relationship but as business rivals they have an abrasive one as well has having respective partners.As a comedy-romance the film does not work and lacks the charm of the original. The IT element has aged the film (just check the dial up tone!) In fact they do not email but chat. The corporate politics is all over the place, both types of bookshops would now be suffering from online retailers such as Amazon which the film could had made reference to. Also Ryan shows her support for small retailers by drinking in Starbucks every day. What about standing shoulder to shoulder with an independent coffee shop?To me the film seemed to drag, the lack of charm in both characters hindered and I liked both their partners more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks movies will be always different and best. No difference here, and also Meg Ryan, she is simply great with her natural acting. Its a real romantic comedy movie which entertains you a lot. In some point of the movie you feel angry towards Mr Fox(Tom Hanks) for making Kathleen(Meg Ryan) jobless by being a competitor in her business field. But the funny thing in this movie is that both are friends by chatting through the internet, but they doesn't know each other. And they are not revealing their personal identity through the net. But when Mr Fox realizes that his competitor is the one who is chatting with him through the net, then comes the real part of the movie. Still the heroine doesn't know that both the person are same. Meg Ryan will fall in love with the guy to whom she is chatting through internet. At last they will decided to meet. The story goes in flow were you can enjoy the feeling of love and the fun part as well. The plot of the story is simple but the acting of Meg and Tom Hanks makes it too interesting and entertaining. I have seen this movie more than tries. I recommend this movie to all of you who have not yet watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am going to submit about 4 reviews on this movie. They all got together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so, I made a connection between all three movies and I don't think anyone else in the world has made this connection EVER. Plus the movie is connected to the Godfather only in a little ways. OK so, here goes. All three movies, Shop around the Corner, In the Good Ole Summertime, and You've Got Mail is one story really spread out over 4 generations. All three movies come down to the one character that Meg Ryan plays. All of the women in Meg Ryan's characters family have all gotten their spouses by writing letters first. It all starts in Shop around the Corner where Meg Ryan's Great Grandfather is the one romancing Meg Ryan's Great Grandmother (I will prove this to you as we go). Then the story continues in the movie In the Good Ole Summertime when Meg Ryan's Grandmother (Judy Garland) is romanced through the mail by Meg Ryan's Grandfather. (I will also prove this as we go.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail is not a movie that I'm going to list in my Top 10 movies of 1998 or even my top ten Tom Hanks movies of all time but if you just view it as a fun little project for Hanks in between serious work in movies like Saving Private Ryan, The Green Mile and so on. And for a chick flick/romcom it's not all that bad all things considered. Meg Ryan well this is pretty much standard fare for her but then again she was never really considered a heavyweight actress and she's perfect for projects like this. They both start out as rivals in the beginning of the movie but unknown to themselves they've been anonymously communicating with each other via instant messaging. And even though they act like they hate each other you just know by the end of the movie they'll end up with each other, that's how movies like this always work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly entertaining, but unfortunately weakened by implausibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen Joe Versus the Volcano, nor have I seen Sleepless In Seattle. So this is the first and thus far the only time I have seen Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan act together. From what I've read, it seems that those other two films received mostly positive reviews, especially the latter, and I did get the sense that You've Got Mail was an attempt at capitalising on the success of those films.On the surface, the film is a typical romantic comedy, based on the premise that two business enemies begin anonymously chatting to each other online, and fall in love with each other's nameless identities through the internet. For me, this was the least interesting part of the film. What interested me more was its exploration of the business world, and the moral grey area of huge business chains and franchises sweeping through society, forcing the closure of smaller, family-run businesses that haven't a snowball's chance in hell of competing.Nonetheless, it is clear that this was not the main point that the filmmakers were trying to show, and what results is a slow romantic comedy, and the romance that ever-so-slowly blossoms between Hanks and Ryan feels all the more forced. Hanks gives a typically great performance, and Ryan isn't too shabby either. It's a shame that they are surrounded by a chorus of one-dimensional characters who really offer nothing of true value to the story, and the plot itself is strained to the point of implausibility. But for most of its runtime, it will keep you entertained.</fullReview>

I mean both d Tom Hanks n Meg Ryan just infuse life in their respective on screen characters. Wat with Hanks with his versatility n d truly addictive effervescence of Meg Ryan,dis movie does create magic.Watch Tom Hanks narrating lines from The Godfather n letting his partner know his feelings at the end!!

If you look at my profile and some of my movie reviews and lists you 'll notice I have a penchant for tough war movies ! Yet I can't resist YGM, the total opposite of a war movie. Is it the magnificent New York locations (does NY really look like this ?). Or is it the great script and direction by Nora Ephron (her best together with 'Sleepless'), the fact that everyone is so likable, smart and civilized (especially the two leads). Is everyone in New York like this ? Time for me to pay that city a visit (I'm from Europe)! I recommend this to anyone, especially if you are feeling a bit down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. As proof I'm watching it right now. I watch it every time it comes on TBS or TNT or Bravo. Last fall I was watching and I noticed what I perceive to be a ghostly figure. If you are reading this your probably own the movie. Go get it and put it in your DVD player. I'll wait .... Okay go to the scene where Kathleen is leaving the store for the last time. She's dragging her right hand on the counter. In the very next scene a figure can be seen going from left to right in what I think is a mirror to the right of the front door. If the mirror is actually a window then you would expect to see the image cross the front door first. Watch it over and over and please tell me what you think. I cannot find anywhere else on the internet regarding this ghost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail is a beautiful movie about a man who has privileged and private information about a woman, destroys her life and neighbourhood business and then uses this information to ingratiate himself to her. It is absolutely charming to see her repugnance of the kind of businessman he is melt away as he pushes her buttons, refers to her favourite novelists and singer-songwriters and gets the right flowers while saying the right things. When he finally outs himself, she succumbs with a smile and a tear to his perfidy. First he destroys her business, then all is right as he tramples her shame and self worth.

		<fullReview>In films like You've Got Mail, where you can almost predict how it's going to turn out as soon as the opening credits appear, then it is up to the writers, director, and actors, to get us to enjoy the journey to the end credits. Nora and Delia Ephron's script succeeds because they know their characters well, and give them a can't miss plot device. Tom Hanks is believable as the head of a gigantic bookstore chain, as is Meg Ryan as the owner of a small children's bookstore shop. As the guy who is putting Meg out of business by opening a chain store close to her little shop, Tom Hanks character comes across as the arrogant person who only goal seems to open as many bookstores as he can, and make as much money as he can in doing so. When he is talking to Meg Ryan on the internet, we see another side of him, and learn that possibly, he's not the evil guy you think he is. Of course, in person, Meg hates him for what he is doing, on the internet, she falls in love with him. This is what makes the film work, as their reaction to each other in person is completely different from when they talk on line. Some people may quibble that the ending is not very believable, but face it, do you fall in love with a person because of who they are, or what you think they are? I think this question is answered quite adequately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance In The Digital World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepless in Seattle director Nora Ephron originally made a name for herself as the writer of romantic comedies such as Heartburn and When Harry Met Sally. She continues the genre with You've Got Mail, marking her second collaboration with actors Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The story brings romance and courtship into the electronic age of the World Wide Web via e-mail and chat rooms. The film is about two letter-writing lovers who are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the person with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. An adaptation of Parfumerie was previously made as The Shop Around the Corner, a 1940 film by Ernst Lubitsch and also a 1949 musical remake, In the Good Old Summertime by Robert Z. Leonard starring Judy Garland. You've Got Mail updates that concept with the use of e-mail. Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly ? a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film. Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly live and work blocks from each other on New York City's Upper West Side. Their lives are practically intertwined. They both shop at the same place, frequent the same coffee shop, and even own competing bookstores on the same street. They also both have significant others of their own. Joe has the overly hyper book editor Patricia Eden, while Kathleen lives with the scholarly newspaper columnist Frank Navasky. Then they meet in a chat room. Though they keep their identities secret as they're known only by screen names "NY152" and "Shopgirl", they tell each other everything about their lives, including their private feelings, which slowly turn into affection for each other. When Joe decides to open a new branch of his "Foxbooks" chain that risks putting Kathleen's "Shop Around the Corner" out of business, the tension between them escalates. Surely her boutique business will be lost to the conglomerate with a built-in newsstand and coffee bar. When Joe sees Kathleen waiting for him in the restaurant where they agreed to meet up, he puts two and two together, but cannot face her, given their agreement not to reveal each others' names and professions. How can he reveal himself to her now, knowing that he is the cause of her misery? Hopefully, love will conquer all.It is a love story destined to be remembered as one of the best of the decade.Tom Hanks,Meg Ryan and America Online certainly are popular trademarks in the 90's.Chemistry between the leads were truly outstanding after they have previously worked with director Nora Ephron from another movie in the past.It has great humor and witty lines.Also,it was interesting as we get a glimpse of what romance will be in the digital world in the years to come.Although it is not a classic nor a masterpiece,it is still a must-see for people who love good romantic stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closes the shop, opens her heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director and screenwriter Nora Ephron must've been wishing on a star when she was writing You've Got Mail. It throws caution to the wind and dares to be different, and to top it off, features two big stars playing very big roles. In simple terms, it's a big success. The rebellious films aren't the ones mostly likely to succeed but You've Got Mail does on almost every level as a romantic comedy.The story is centered around two people in two very different financial positions in New York City. Joe Fox (Hanks) is a rich and confident man who runs "Fox Books," a massive store in the vein of Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders. Kathleen Kelly's (Ryan) shop is less than a hundred feet away. There she runs a much smaller, personal bookstore the Capitalist way called "Around the Corner." Due to this new massive retail giant opening up she is losing customers fast and worries her store will have to close its doors.In the meantime, Joe and Kathleen should be rivals, but they have unwillingly been talking to each other and exchanging very personal conversations over the internet via a chat-room. Joe is "NY152" and Kathleen is "Shopgirl." Needless to say they don't know who each other is, but they find a certain solace in that. Maybe the advice comes less sugarcoated when you hear it from somebody you're not well acquainted with.Eventually, the inevitable happens and Kathleen's shop is forced into the ground and the remaining inventory to be bought by Joe. While this is all happening, Kathleen is also trying to get in contact with this "NY152," but winds up being stood up. This is the only part of the film where I began to have a problem. It seems like the storyline and clichés past would hint that these two characters would find out the identities of one another about halfway through. Instead, You've Got Mail becomes an exercise in long, sometimes tedious pacing, and some moments we encounter leave us asking "how did you not get that hint?" If hadn't been for the uniquely witty writing and the terrific supporting cast I may have quickly lost interest. Supporting roles consist of Dave Chappelle as Joe's best friend, and Steve Zahn, one of my favorite men in the business today, Heather Burns, and All in the Family's Jean Stapleton as Kathleen's faithful coworkers who try to keep her optimistic when the "NY152" drama starts unrolling before their eyes.Going back to the internet portion of the film, who would've thought in the mid-nineties, when the internet was created and released to the public, that ten to fifteen years later it would become one of the main ways to form relationships? I could see people in 1998, seeing You've Got Mail, chuckling and rolling their eyes at the idea of one talking to someone who is seemingly a complete stranger. Years later, we do it all the time.Another thing I picked up along the way, if closely dissected, You've Got Mail doesn't seem like a love story at all. It seems like a genius drama centered around business. Here we have a very successful businessman who can create and operate a huge retail store while barely doing any work. He still manages to win the heart of his competitor even after closing her shop and making her feel extremely inferior. That's the power of big business. When closely examined, You've Got Mail is another simple and amusing romantic comedy guaranteed to charm and tear-up any lady. When looked at with a broader focus, one can see the business undertones quietly cemented in.So, my three and a half stars go to the movie and the big picture focus both of You've Got Mail. This is a crafty, yet very subtle film about love and the power of wealthy corporations. It not only has that to offer seeing as Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan create inseparable chemistry together and are complemented by the writing and directing talents of Nora Ephron.Also, it's currently 2011. I wonder how Fox Books has faired with the high sales of Amazon's Kindle and the closing of the popular retailer Borders.Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Dave Chappelle, Greg Kinnear, Steve Zahn, Heather Burns, and Jean Stapleton. Directed by: Nora Ephron.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review based on genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When someone watches a romance movie, they expect sappy love lines, difficulties in the relationship, and a happy ending. You've Got Mail (1998) with director Nora Ephron has all of that and more. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks play as Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox, both book store owners. They meet online, anonymous, and start emailing. It creates a charming love story where the star players don't know they have been chosen.The director knows what they are doing. We see Kelly and Fox as people that do the same kind of things every day and could possibly have become the best of friends, if only their books stores weren't competing. That is what makes this film completely unique. They would both wake up awaiting emails from each other, and going to bed safe in the knowledge that there will be an email when they wake up. When they meet in person they get alone perfectly fine, till the information that he is the head boss of Fox's Book store. A big chain of book stores everywhere, putting Kelly's little Shop Around The Corner out of business.Most people nowadays believe that email is old fashioned and slow, but it suited them just fine. Nice fairly long emails let them be honest with each other with no personal details. They fell in love with each other using only their personality traits, that is another reason his film is so unique. Normally, when we meet someone, we see their clothes, hairstyle, face, as things scoring or losing points for them. These things did not stand in Kelly and Fox's way as they do others.You've Got Mail is a sweet, funny romance that has a lot of charming moments in it. It is a must see for someone who prides themselves on seeing romance movies. It holds all the key factors, and has je ne sais quoi. It gives you those good little tingles all over when you watch it. You never know what exactly will happen next, or what someone will say. It brings alive that dream of that special someone that fills your heart with joy, for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who did not like this movie? Still charming after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been more than a dozen years since this movie was released; Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were at the top of the list of popular actors and I did not expect it would be one of the movies I tend to watch every couple of years or so. You must have seen a movie you liked enough to consider watching again if it came on the home screen; we buy DVDs (generic term) so we can watch movies again, or else what's the point. The Hanks-Ryan duo made three movies together, three then five years apart; the second, "Sleepless in Seattle" grossed ten times its production cost, which, inevitably and thankfully, meant they would do "You've Got Mail". I still think of it, today, as a charming romance which is not the kind of comment guys like admit, secretly thinking it is. The cast included other supporting actors who have been leads themselves, like Dabney Coleman, John Randolph, Jean Stapleton, Greg Kinnear, Steve Zahn and Parker Posey; Dave Chapelle's performance, in this film, also helped his career by displaying the talent some of us are familiar with now. Personally, I discovered the songs of Harry Nilsson thanks to this movie, which prominently featured compositions as well as his own renditions of many of them; the soundtrack is one of only a dozen I bothered to get and still listen to at times. I guess I can say I got my money's worth with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Story Not Romantic At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of this movie was interesting as we saw the two antagonists fight it out for the hearts of book buyers. At first, it seemed that the Mega-Store would win with their amenities and low prices. But then, a public protest and media blitz shifted the public support to Kathleen's little 'Shop Around the Corner'. So I thought she was going to win, using the ideas Fox unwittingly gave her. Instead, for reasons never explained, Kathleen gives up and closes the store. And from there it's downhill as the story shifts to his attempt to woo her without telling her the truth. It's creepy as this 'It's business, not personal' person manipulates her during her depression and illness over her loss. So what that he feels guilty about what he did? There is no way in real life someone would submissively forgive-and-forget as she did.That's why I gave it a five. It could have worked if somehow Fox relented and figured a way for both stores to co-exist or even better, if he closed his store. It has happened in real life where Mega-Stores have been voted out of a community. So I felt crushed by this disappointing ending where evil won.</fullReview>

It really is a modern day classic love story, and Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan just were perfect for the lead characters and have that special chemistry together. Greg Kinnear also gives a stunning performance and makes all realize, are we really with who is right for us? Should we be honest with our selves and our significant other if we feel that we should move on, and not just be in a relationship so we won't be alone? I am glad that this isn't one of those movies where the women are just trying to climb the social ladder by sticking with one guy, till they find the next best thing.Jose F. Medeiros</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I liked most about Sleepless in Seattle was its wit, humour and charm. You've Got Mail has the charm and the humour evident in the performances and chemistry of the actors, however it just lacks the wit of Sleepless in Seattle. Both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan give excellent performances, and their chemistry is believable. The supporting performances from Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton and Parker Posey are also impressive, if careful not to overshadow the two leads. The music is lovely, and the backgrounds of New York are especially nice to look at. The direction is good, if lacking the extra bit of sparkle that was used in Seattle, and sometimes the script and story is a tad underdeveloped. But as a romantic comedy, I really liked it, it is very sweet and good natured and it makes me feel good. So I will give it a 7.5/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptively cute...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm reminded of the shallow complaints that I heard about Runaway Bride, since it starred Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, who had already starred in the astronomically successful Pretty Woman together. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are teamed up again in a nice little romantic comedy and the producers no doubt hope that people can forget Sleepless in Seattle, also written and directed by Nora Ephron, and accept an entirely new story. And like Runaway Bride, it worked. The premise of the story is ludicrous in the extreme, not just that two highly attractive people fall in love through online chatting, but more because they get to know each other in real life at exactly the same time as they are starting to get to know each other online. It's a pretty wild aberration from reality, but on the other hand it allows for a compelling analysis of the different personalities that people assume online and in real life. There is also something to be said about the characterization. Tom Hanks plays on his status as a Hollywood megastar to portray the CEO of a mega bookstore chain, and who better to play the owner of a cute little corner bookstore than Meg Ryan, who is so cute that she could very well represent a 10 on a 1-10 cuteness scale. 10 being the cutest and one being, I don't know, Burt Lancaster or something. I find it a little amusing that the title of the film is from that asinine voice that used to welcome you when you would sign on to the internet back in the mid to late 90s, back when people still used AOL. There is a healthy level of irony included in the movie, as Joe Fox (Hanks) opens one of his massive bookstores around the corner from Kathleen's (Ryan) little shop, and she turns to her online friend, Joe, for help and advice. I appreciate how well they hide their identities, although they have such polarly opposite opinions about commercialism and professional ethics that it seems almost impossible that they should get along so well, especially when Kathleen, at least, is looking for comforting words to help her get through an experience that people like Joe make their living doing to people.I really like that the movie makes such a strong comment about megastores without making them seem evil, or demonizing the people that open and run them. Quite the opposite, in fact. Joe Fox, who is destroying the future of a charming little bookstore that Kathleen inherited from her mother, seems like a perfect fit for the greedy, commercial movie villain, but the whole charm of the movie is that we meet a wealthy businessman with dollar signs in his eyes, and before we know it we're rooting for his happiness. It takes a massive charm, like Hanks', to pull something like that off.While it's sad to see so many small businesses perish under the influence of the homogenized, impersonal super stores, it's also a sad reality of any growing society. Consider, for example, the emotional pain and insignificance that milkmen must have felt when the first supermarkets came along with their refrigerators and their plastic jugs back in the 50s and 60s. The neighborhood lost something of its personality and charm, interpersonal relationships were totally transformed, but now it's hard to imagine an American city without a Safeway or an Albertson's, or even a Piggly Wiggly. I think the really evil stores are ones like Wal Mart, which might be surpassing McDonald's as the worst American company. But the biggest problem with Wal Mart is the greed of the family that owns it. They bleed their employees dry while pocketing astronomical profits, and opening a store in every city imaginable. I live in a small town in central eastern China called Luoyang, and yes, a Wal Mart opened here a few months ago. Unbelievable.But the comment that this movie makes is that, love them or hate them, they are definitely convenient and affordable, and it's even fun to poke around in them. The biggest problem with them is that they are impersonal, you lose that quality of knowing people on a first name basis, and even of having employees who know about what they're selling. There's a scene in this movie where Kathleen wanders into Joe's store and has an experience where we learn that the movie understands this loss of a personal, friendly atmosphere. For all the lack of realism about how Joe and Kathleen meet and the fact that they fall in love, the movie is charming and fun and it's hard to remain indifferent to the happiness of the main characters. They each start the movie with other significant others, but end their respective relationships, leaving them newly single polar opposites looking to each other online for comfort and support. This might be the most obvious set-up I've seen in a movie in some years, so it's a testament to the quality of the movie that it's still a fun ride to the inevitable conclusion?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Get to Know You Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a guy and as others have said, guys like this movie. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are one of those screen couples that seem to just "Mesh." I get the same feeling about Travolta and Kirstie Alley in the Look Who's Talking movies. Some people compared this to When Harry Met Sally, but these movies are no where near the same, and as I said, Hanks and Ryan make the better couple.The movie is a remake of Shop Around the Corner and updated for the times, 1998 I may add. The allure of internet movies I think has past. But for 1998, it's a nice little story of two people who hate each other in real life but really love each other as their anonymous selves via email and chat. This topic may be sordid now, with all of the stories of internet affairs, but not in this movie. There are some holes in this movie, but as in most movies, they don't really hurt. There are times you'll feel they should be able to realize who each other are. And for most people who don't over analyze as I do, you won't notice.You can tell how the plot line is going to develop but for a first time viewer it's really a nice, fun movie. This is a good 2nd or 3rd date type movie if you're really interested in the person. This is the kind of movie where you want to sit close on the couch and see if snuggling develops. So go ahead and rent it, if you like it maybe buy it.Thanks, Gary</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot of 'You've Got Mail' is based on that of a 1949 movie starring Judy Garlan and Van Johnson titled 'In The Good Old Summertime'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed 'You've Got Mail'. I am a very big fan of the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan pair. It's quite a good romantic/comedic duo. And just the other day I came across a movie titled 'In The Good Old Summertime' playing on TurnerClassicMovies. I sat down and proceeded to watch this seemingly interesting movie. And it was very interesting.The movie follows the story of Van Johnson's character, Andrew 'Andy' Larkin, and Judy Garland's character, Veronica Fisher. Unbeknownst to the two after a run-in on the street, they are secret pen pal lovers. Neither knows of the other's identity, and when Veronica comes to work at Andy's place of business, all havoc breaks loose. At first, Andy and Veronica hate each other, but when they two pen pals decide to meet for a date, Andy gets his friend to peek through the window to scope out his soon-to-be bride-to-be. It happens almost exactly like the scene with Dave Chappelle and Tom Hanks in 'You've Got Mail. But when his friend relays that his date is in fact Miss Fisher, Andy is floored, yet slightly intrigued. He then proceeds to have some fun, and walks into the café. The scene in 'You've Got Mail' where the guy asks if he can take the chair happens the same way it does in the '49 movie. And when Andy is asked to leave Veronica's table, he does what Tom Hanks does and sits in the chair next to hers at the next table over. It's funny how the new mirrors the old. Minus the musical part. After her pen pal lover stands Veronica up, she remains 'sick' the next day. Andy goes to check on her and realizes that he is in love with her. It happens rather similarly to the scene in 'You've Got Mail'.It's a really quirky movie that inspires lots of laughs. Really, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very romantic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of You've Got mail isn't really cheesy. In the sense that it does not have any scenes in which they pass each other in the street, or say anything soppy. It is realistic, and I thought it was very romantic. Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is the owner of a small bookshop, The Shop Around The Corner, a cosy little book store, which has a lot of sentimental value to her as her deceased mother used to own it. Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is a suave businessman, with many chains of shops all over the country, and when he opens a new book store, Fox Books, he finds himself at war with the cute bookshop around the corner, and it's owner Kathleen. The pair become business rivals and Joe constantly tries to put Kathleen out of business. Suddenly, unknowingly, the two meet over the internet and are instantly attracted to each other. They begin emailing each other often and oddly become great friends. But when Joe finds out the identity of his internet friend, he's left in a mess. Joe is left to ponder over he will shut down the business of the woman he has fallen in love with, or reveal himself to her, knowing fully well that Kathleen loathes the sight of him.Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were amazing in this film - I really enjoyed watching both of them. The chemistry between them was magic - they are just one of those on-screen couples that can act and make it seem so natural. And YGM was not even anything like 'Sleepless'! I love seeing them together. There are not many intense moments in You've Got Mail, it is more of a cheerful, feel-good romantic comedy, rather than some serious drama. But the scene where Kathleen is shutting her mom's shop and relives all the memories of her and her mother, was what I thought, personally the most intense part in the whole movie.You've Got Mail is fun for any day that you want some cheering up, and I recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, charming movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've Got Mail may seem slightly dated ten years later, as e-mail and instant messaging no longer seem as exotic as they once were, but the movie remains engaging thanks largely to the considerable chemistry and charm of its stars.The plot is relatively simple. Two strangers, one a small bookstore owner and the other, the owner of a large chain bookstore correspond with each other via e-mail. Neither knows who the other is, and when they initially meet in real life (not knowing of their internet personas), they dislike each other. The plot contrivance in this film is that the large chain store is going to put the small bookstore out of business. Eventually, the two realize who the other is and naturally, they fall in love.Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan own this movie. They make you forget how silly the plot is, or how improbable various plot points are. They make you care about their characters. Simply put, this is just a nice movie. No hard thinking required.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll resist putting a pun in the headline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes superhuman effort not to put a pun in the headline of a review of "You've Got Mail." One wants to write "You've got Male! And Female!" or maybe "You've got a Remake!" or "You've got Tom and Meg Again!" The fact is that a solid team put this piece together. Say what you will about Meg Ryan, Nora Ephron, and Tom Hanks, they know what it takes to put together a solid romantic comedy. Is this the most original romantic comedy? No. Is it a solid piece of work, considering the genre - and by that I mean light, fluffy romantic comedies - sure.I think few people will go into this expecting hard hitting movie, which is good because this is a bit like cotton candy. Hardly filling, but not bad for a lazy afternoon.A word on the casting. It's loaded with excellent actors: Ryan and Hanks, of course, but also Dabney Coleman, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn, John Randolph. Any one of them could have carried a significant portion of the film themselves, but instead their parts seem to have been cut way back. It's too bad they didn't develop these parts more, considering the talent they had on hand.I understand that, according to the trivia on this site, the great Michael Palin even filmed afew scenes, which were cut. I find it astonishing that anyone in their right mind would do such a thing. Rule #1 of film-making: Don't if you can get Palin to do your movie, by all means keep his stuff in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Classics Wrapped Together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a combination of the 40's classic Shop Around the Corner and the book Pride and Prejudice. The plot loosely follows the movie Shop Around the Corner and Kathleen Kelly's (Ryan) shop is named Shop Around the Corner. It's especially interesting that Pride and Prejudice is mentioned in the movie. Joe Fox (Hanks) comments that he can't ever remember if it's Mr. Darcy that is too prideful or too prejudice. As the movie develops the characters of Hanks and Ryan continue to match up to that of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have magical romantic comedy that comes through wonderfully making this a great movie to watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kathleen (Meg Ryan) runs a small bookstore in New York City. Her mother owned and operated the store for years and, upon her death, passed it along to her daughter. Kathleen has an ongoing relationship with a newspaper columnist (Greg Kinnear) but something is wanting. That's why her favorite activity is corresponding, via email, with a gentleman she met in a chat room. She has not met this man in real life, but, hangs on his every word and the feeling seems to be returned. Meanwhile, Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is about to open a mega bookstore just around the corner from Kathleen's small but lovely store. Joe and Kathleen meet at a party and seem to dislike each other but, more importantly, the two will be competitors very soon. Will Kathleen's store be able to survive the book wars that are coming? And, will Kathleen ever meet the cyberspace gentleman of her dreams? This is a lovely story on film, told with humor and heartwarming care. Ryan and Hanks, as they did in Joe and the Volcano and in Sleepless in Seattle, prove that they are a quietly dynamic duo in the realm of romantic comedies. The supporting cast of Kinnear, Parker Posey, Steve Zahn, Dave Chappelle, and Jean Stapleton, is also a film lover's fondest wish. Nora and Delia Ephron's script is intelligent, witty and clever and Nora's direction is quite wonderful as well. The costumes, scenery, and overall production values are fine indeed. If you have never treated yourself to this movie, don't delay, not even for another week. You've got good times ahead of you, at any showing, especially if you can curl up next to that special someone on the sofa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most state of the art version of a classic film story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YOU'VE GOT MAIL is the most recent updating of a classic movie story about two lonely people who are antagonistic towards each other in life but have been secretly corresponding for years but have never met. We were first introduced to this story as THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER with James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan back in 1940, if memory serves. Then we got a musical version of the same story in '49 with Judy Garland and Van Johnson called IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME. Barbara Cook starred in a stage musical version of the story called SHE LOVES ME and now Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan play Joe Fox, manager of a large retail bookstore chain and Kathleen Kelly, the owner of a small children's bookstore called (surprise!)The Shop Around the Corner who become instant enemies when Joe's new store threatens to put Kathleen out of business. Unbeknownst to either of them, they have been e-mail lovers for the longest time but don't know it. The classic tale is updated for the computer age but it's still timeless and engaging and my personal favorite of the three films Hanks and Ryan made together. They are magical here and are surrounded by a terrific supporting cast including Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton, Dave Chappelle, Dabney Coleman, Steve Zahn, and John Randolph. If you're a sucker for a good old fashioned love story, have your fill here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely not my kind of movie, but Team Hanks/Ryan are so appealing that only a someone who wants to be curmudgeonly--but only can manage being annoying--would write anything really negative about You've Got Mail, a cookie-cutter chick flick with email as the novelty and hook.You and I really don't care about the plot. It's the idea that Meg Ryan looks cute and Tom Hanks is charming and in the end, they sort out their differences and everything is vanilla that makes this sort of happy crappy work so well. Remember that Hanks was coming off Saving Private Ryan so he needed something light to balance SPR. Ryan doesn't need balance--she just does an impression of herself in every movie. No big problem there if you don't expect anymore from her.About the time this movie came out, I got my first email account and the novelty was real. On the same evening I sent my first letter to a friend in California, I looked up IMDb for information on a movie I wanted to show to my high school English students.I didn't like the movie that much, but it has an importance for me personally. I like the stars . . . and I guess I forgive them for cutting cookies.</fullReview>

Some people say that these two people couldn't pull off another love story (at first) but come on people you have to remember this one thing that the characters are going to be completely different and so is the story. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are my favourite actors and actresses. I love seeing them on screen because you know that they are going to give it their all.

I love how the two people change their emotions about each other through the story; one minute they're enemies and then the next ... well you can work that one out for yourself lol. If you need to watch a good love film then i would say your in luck if you see this one or even Sleepless in Seattle you just can't get better than them. 10 star all the way people!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan deliver excellent performances as they re-team for the third time. Fresh off "Saving Private Ryan" Tom Hanks plays Joe Fox a bookstore owner looking to take over every bookstore in sight in order to make his the only one in town. He butts heads with Meg Ryan who portrays Kathleen Kelly, a small bookstore owner, called The Shop Around The Corner. As rivals in the book business they are natural enemies, but what they don't know is they are carrying on an e-mail correspondence.One of the many great surprises for me about this film was the performance of Jean Stapleton as Birdie who adds with her witty humor and jokes. As Meg Ryan's love interest, Greg Kinnear stars as Frank Navaski, a newspaper columnist, has the sense of humor that takes this film to a new plateau.Since this movie is so good I don't want to give away many details but I can say when this movie hits its groove it gets better and better and by the time the movie is over people will not want to leave their seats. This is a smartly made and brilliantly directed film by Nora Ephron who worked with Hanks and Ryan in "Sleepless In Seattle." It seems as if Tom Hanks took over the role of director in the last thirty minutes of the movie; he does a wonderful job at doing this.The best part of the whole entire movie comes in the final scene and the dialogue between the actors involved with that scene; with that scene the whole movie is tied together. This is a tremendously well-done and brilliantly put together film and definitely worth everyone's while to sit and relax for 120 min.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A closer look reveals a darker, more sinister story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once this movie moves beyond its chick-flick set up and the cheeky posturing of its lead actors, the viewer is introduced to a complex and disturbing exploration of domination, manipulation and surrender...much like the diabolical twists of Richard III and the voyeuristic pathology of Michael Powell's "Peeping Tom". Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) is a women harmed by Joe Fox (Hanks). Ryan's overt disgust for Hanks only energizes him to craft a scheme whereas he poses as an anonymous e-mail suitor who secretly stirs and manipulates her vulnerabilities only to serve his own desire to control and, finally, possess her. Much like Lady Anne becoming slave to the courtings of Richard III despite the fact that is was he who murdered her husband, Ryan falls for the Hanks who destroys her. The twisted voyeurisim arrives when Hanks manipulates Ryan by convincing her to meet his secret e-mail persona at an arrange location only to stalk her as the "evil" Hanks and "coincidentially"show up and try to engage her in conversation. He then witnesses first hand the effectiveness of his work on the clueless Ryan. Ryan's tense and antagonistic reactions to Hanks in these scenes creates an unsettling "inside joke" for the viewer as we see Hanks further manipulate her as she unwittingly engages his twisted fetish. When all is revealed, Ryan is too far gone to resist the monster and she falls into his arms. Her complete inability to combat Hanks' craven violations on her psyche become the ultimate domination by Hanks and the film ends with Ryan's character effectively "vanishing" as she folds into Hanks. This is Nora Efron's most complex and revealing take male/female tensions and the sinister aspects of courtship. As a tale of psychological terrorism, "You've Got Mail" is a stark warning sign to all of us who let others in but give not enough thought to how they got there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever and sentimental romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Faithful adaptation of the 1940's classic "The Shop Around the Corner," only now two strangers communicate through e-mails, rather than conventional mail. Due to their anonymous identities, each converses with honesty and vulnerability. They are acquainted in their "real lives," but neither is aware of this. Because both parties have adopted defensive exteriors that hide who they really are, they wind up becoming hostile adversaries personally and professionally.Routine rom-com approaches are readily visible, but Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks display so much chemistry, that you're ready to overlook these old plot devices. Example: they open the film each dating a cold, ambitious career-driven person who is obviously wrong for them. Through their interaction over e-mail, the characters change, and their real-life personalities begin to draw together as well. Of course, like any movie of the genre, we gradually progress to a predictable feel-good conclusion.There are two wonderfully sentimental scenes, the first one with Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) in dream sequence reminiscing about her childhood; second, a scene where a golden oldy song from a classic '30's movie punctuates the emotion of the two characters (and conveys their thoughts better than dialog could). The script gives Hanks and Ryan some clever dialog to have some fun with, especially in the latter stages of the movie.If you like the rom-com genre, or the Ryan/Hanks pairing, this movie is a pleasant treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is an innocuous piece. It has nothing to learn and an easy going and happy ending movie with a bit romantic stuffs at the end.As I started watching the movie in the beginning it seemed a bit boring. It started as two unhappy people started searching happiness online and found the same in each other. They were perfect friend online but offline in real life were absolute enemy. Both were working in the same industry of Book selling, but they Tom Hank was into discount selling and Meg tried to create a niche by selling good quality books, good ambiance?.but was charging for the same. No discount offer.The next half was interesting and kind off touched me. Meg lost to Tom and had to shut down her store. Tom knew about the Meg in real life apart from her offline appearance but Meg was ignorant. He fell in love with her, but was always under a guilt feeling of making Meg's life miserable. So he went directly to her and started to befriend with her, she hesitated in the beginning but later she agreed. Then he told her to meet the online guy and later on they met and had an happy ending of falling in love with each other.I liked Meg's charm in the movie and also the storyline.Won't say that, I recommend the movie but yes?..It is a soothing experience for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail is essentially another clone of the far superior When Harry Met Sally and to a lesser extent Sleepless In Seattle. What these three films have in common is that all of them are either written or written/directed by Nora Ephron, with Meg Ryan in the co-starring role for all the films with a male co-star(whom for this film and Sleepless In Seattle is portrayed by Tom Hanks). These co-stars learn to love each other as each film goes along. In all fairness, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are great actors, but they are given a weaker script than they had in Sleepless In Seattle. Because of that, it's harder to take this film seriously. Regardless, it's nice seeing this on-screen couple back together again even if the film is only a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Nora Ephron, reunited by Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan who previously worked on Sleepless in Seattle with her, has created another romantic comedic like drama film about the secrets spread to someone but not by vocal. Basically Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is a really bored book shop owner who wants to find someone to talk to, over the internet by email. He finds someone who refuses to give her name, just like him, and it is obviously the main girl, Kathleen Kelly (Golden Globe nominated Meg Ryan). After a while of talking to each other about their lives and their problems and interests, he decides he wants to meet this person. He doesn't know it (until later) but it is the woman who is trying to beat his book business with hers. But don't worry, there's a happy ending. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining version of an old play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second adaptation of a play by Hungarian author Miklos Laszlo, who died in 1973. Both versions feature stars whose battles are highly entertaining; the 1998 version is certainly more up to date, but both films are well worth watching.The Shop Around the Corner, released in 1940, stared James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan as battling co-workers in a small shop in Budapest. They can't stand each other in person but each is writing to an unknown pen pal. What neither realizes is that without knowing it, they are falling in love with each other.In You've Got Mail (1998), Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is the owner of a small book store, threatened by the arrival of a huge corporate book chain next door, owned by Joe Fox (Tom Hanks). Both of them are more or less satisfactorily involved with someone else, but each starts e-mailing an unknown friend.</fullReview>

More than that, however, he recognizes that his father, Sam, is desperately lonely. So, on Christmas Eve, Jonah calls a radio talk-show psychologist and asks for help.

Across the country in Baltimore, Annie Reed is listening to the syndicated program, and Sam's testimonial of love brings tears to her eyes. Even though she is engaged to Walter, Annie begins to wonder what it would be like to meet Sam. However, Sam is not interested in meeting anyone. Later Jonah receives Annie??s letter, and likes what says in the letter. With a strong will, the boy succeed in bringing the two together.This is a wonderful romantic story, from the beginning to the end, Annie make a good model to the girls who are falling in love now. She make them know what is the really love: the really love is beyond the distend, and it is from the daily life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What does NY152 mean?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be a question I should know the answer to, but what does 152 of NY152 mean? That was Joe's internet name. I have watched the movie many times, but cannot figure it out. Please help.I think this is a great romantic movie. I love how it all plays out. It kinda reminds me of Pillow Talk. Where 2 people, who have never met, are at odds with each other and the guy figures out who the girl is, and pretends to be someone different. I wish that Kathleen would have stuck to her guns and kept the store open, but I know financially it was hard for her. I would have liked to see Kathleen get a job at Fox Books in the end. She would have done a marvelous job in the children's department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie average after my first view. After a second look and with the assist of Nora's comments about what she was attempting to deliver, I find myself watching this movie over and over. Who would not want to own a little bookshop in one of the hoods on the upper Westside!On a personal note this was my first exposure to Pride and Prejudice and I now have Austen-itis ... just what a movie about a bookstore should do. I thought this piece was a modern day Pride and Prejudice as we all know that they will end up together but wonder how, considering that they start out with the same prejudice/pride as Elisabeth and Darcy.I recommend the extras on the DVD. As one who has not visited much of New York, I enjoyed getting to know about Zabars and some of the other sites in the city. I will visit them next time I'm there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Remake--first two were better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was first made in the 1930's with Jimmy Stewart. -- Then in the 40's, as a musical with Judy Garland (In the Good Old Summertime.) Both previous versions were better; especially the musical.A major problem with this version is the "modern" twist that the two main characters were both living with someone with whom there was absolutely no commitment, or even love, when the story opened. The fact that there were no overt sex scenes seems to have been done to make it more acceptable for the younger crowd. Few critics seemed to have warned parents of this assault on moral values.Other than that, just another lightweight comedy with good actors giving their customary performances.</fullReview>

I cant just tell you how long I had waited to see it on my VHS Pal videoplayer, sometimes the wait can be as good as a rain on a dry piece of soil. I just loved the storyline from the beginning I heard of it and when I saw it finaly, gosh, loved it like I love the color red. The story were better on the movie than on the cover of it, the cast were absolutely the best. I Have to tell you that the dialogue were the best ever since Casablanca and as easy to remember as in Casablanca. The last thing said in the move had the same feeling as in Casablanca only very much happier. I loved "Don't cry "Shopgirl" don't cry". Man the things Tom Hanks says in this movie and how he says it makes you wanna go into the television set and kiss him right on the mouth and love him for the rest of his life. Maybe this is the topdream for every strait and bisexual girl out there and ofcause why do not people.I have said many things personal here, but hey, movies can bring out the best in you. At least this one. You cry, you laugh, you make low noises like mmm and ahh and ofcause you want to hug the nearest person in the room as tenderly as you can.Watch the movie and you will become a great good soul who just want the best for people!The one who don't love the movie afterwards can go to h**l.</fullReview>

Second, it is a lovely fencing match about love, lying and prejudices, right up until the end. The banter is excellent. Third, if you have ever seen "Shop around the Corner", the elder inspiration for this piece starring Jimmy Stewart, you will appreciate this loving and updated remake. For some reason, I prefer this one to "Sleepless in Seattle", perhaps b/c in Sleepless we rarely see Hanks and Ryan together, and Sleepless does not take advantage of the wonderful chemistry these two actors have.

		<fullReview>Okay so I didn't really think it was a great movie, but there is one thing I'd like to point out that I thought was clever...Did you note that Meg Ryan's character's favorite book was "Pride and Prejudice"? Because if you've noted that, and you've actually read the book, you'll see an interesting parallel between Elizabeth Bennet and herself, Darcy and Tom Hanks, which is much more interesting than their coincidental e-mail relationship. He's rich and kinda snobby to her and really rubs her the wrong way. Then he finds he actually cares about her, and she might care a little for him, too, but her hurt pride gets in the way and he has to find a new game plan in order to let her know that really, he's not so bad and willing to love her. I think if you look at the movie in that perspective you'll enjoy it just a little bit better, I know I did.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks, collaberate with Meg Ryan for the third time, acted as Meg Ryan's character, Kathleen Kelly's rival by book business, Joe Fox, and romance partners through internet. Never knew that after many "obstacles" in their lives, they finally really get to know each other and finally realised that they are actually the internet romance partners.This movie is a very nice and sweet movie as it started out writing e-mails to each other, not knowing that they have already met through a business function, that they started to vie for the best book businesses in New York, that they go through many "rough times" and that, they finally know that they are the ones who are exchanging e-mails all the time. It is a very modern romance movie as it often involves the internet and the e-mail...it is indeed a very sweet and nice movie and I suggest that all singles out there should go ahead and watch it...and you will find it meaningful sometimes by exchanging mails with the opposite sex...and you might never know that you might be the next Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox in the movie &lt;You've Got Mail&gt;...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: YOU'VE GOT MAILRating: ***1/2Review: One of best romantic comedies in years, YOU'VE GOT MAIL is funny, charming, and endearing which all completely make up for the fact that it isn't original. A remake of the 1940 film THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan), this not only matches in the original in terms of greatness, but is also effectively updated to the modem age, where two ordinary New Yorkers meet in an internet chatroom and begin an "online friendship," little realizing they eventually meet...and become enemies! Tom Hanks plays Joe Fox, owner of FOX &amp; SONS BOOKS, a mega-bookstore that threatens to put a wonderful, 42-year-old children's book store (named THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER) out of business. Meg Ryan plays the owner of the little children's bookstore and she soon develops a grudge against Hanks who clearly is trying to establish the fact that the situation is completely business in nature, not personal. The solid supporting cast includes Parker Posey as Hanks' girlfriend (who has some serious problems), a charming Greg Kinnear as Ryan's beau, Dabney Coleman has Hanks' father, and Dave Chappelle (who I thought was the only likable---and tolerable---character in the ill- conceived HALF-BAKED) in a funny role as Hank's assistant. This is the third film to join Hanks and Ryan, after JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO and SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, and the second one to reunite the two stars with co-writer/director Nora Ephron, who wrote WHEN HARRY MET SALLY..., the film that made Ryan a star. The two stars have so much chemistry together in this film, and that's only half the reason why they give outstanding performances. Those who enjoy light and delightful romantic comedies (SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE in particular) that have all the basic ingredients such as a wonderful soundtrack, tender direction, and irresistable stars will adore this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had the right idea but the film makers here decided to sugar coat it too much with fantasy,disguising it as reality when this route was not needed.The result is a film that begs intelligent people to swallow a little too much just for the sake of romantic movie moods.Ryan's character here is supposed to be an intelligent person so she should in reality have figured out much earlier it was Hanks all along on the other end of their e-mail chats.Also,the tactics that Hanks did to win Ryan's heart was straight up criminal cyber stalking!Very decietful and manipulative which I do not find very romantic at all.The film degraded from the moment Hanks found out who the e-mail woman was.Before that,everything was going fine storywise.The film could have still been romantic if Hanks let Ryan know the truth right away and persued her thru e-mails and personal encounters without the manipulative tactics used in the film.The cinamatography and direction was average.The acting was good and the script/screenplay was poor.A wasted story opportunity but still worth a look for Hanks and Ryan fans or die hard romance movie fans......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'You've Got Mail' is actually better than could be expected. It's obvious that it will be forever compared to, stacked up against, and analyzed alongside the previous pairing of Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan, 'Sleepless in Seattle', so let me just come out in the open and say it. It's not quite as good. But... compare it to their first pairing, the tepid 'Joe Vs. The Volcano', and you have a masterpiece. The movie is still very funny, very romantic, very light, an overall good time. It has a somewhat original story, good chemistry between the leads (duh!), and a good script that creates two very realistic and well developed characters. So, why are the critics tearing it apart? The answer lies with 'Sleepless in Seattle'. If the first movie wasn't made, then this would be hailed as the best romantic comedy in years. And it is, one of the best in a long time, certainly since 'Sleepless'. Recommended, rent it if you feel like a fluffy, poofy romantic comedy, avoid it if you don't.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remembering the lovely way Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal bounced off each other in When Harry met Sally this 'version' of a tale of seemingly incompatible lovers is a profound disappointment. Although Meg Ryan still tries to pass herself off as a girl she cannot hide the fact that it no longer rings quite as true as it once did ten years ago. The dialogues between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan often misfire and are on occasion even too contrived to be funny. The camera-work is good and the film has some lovely atmospheric shots of NYC in Autumn and Spring.NB. It has been quite a few years since I wrote this review and I now find it needlessly harsh, if only because I enjoy the film now more than I did when the review was first written. That may be because there haven't been that many good romantic comedies since (the genre is clearly in decline) or I have learned to appreciate the merits I initially overlooked. I originally called this a poor remake of When Harry met Sally, but I believe my present tag is somewhat more accurate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hanks is majestic in his role. He shows us a character in need of healing and, like Scrooge or George Bailey, finds what it is in life that is important. Ryan is pure joy as Kathleen. She's quirky and searching for herself too. The script has the sense that both characters are destined to be together because they are lost souls on the road to nowhere. They need to find each other, and for them the Internet is an outlet. They know each other via e-mail, but not in person. Before the final ten minutes of the film, we are given a chance to see the two leads interact, and it is completely satisfying. Although the film is fantasy, it offers enough comedy and romance to warm us up so not to overdue its sentimentality. Nora Ephron beautifully directs Hanks, Ryan and a top notch supporting cast of Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Dabney Coleman and Jean Stapelton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to me that without this incredible cast, this would have been just another sappy love story. I could watch a thousand movies with the Hanks/Ryan combo. The addition of names like Coleman (Dabney, not Gary), Zahn, Posey, and even stapleton, made this an incredibly brilliant movie. Ephron provides us once again with witty dialog, much akin to "Sleepless". This is definitely worth the trip to the screen, and also reserves a spot on my home collection shelf.</fullReview>

She just twirled around in her great clothes and looked really cute. They really have to give her more to do. And Parker Posey was almost totally wasted in this movie.</fullReview>

I agree that this film truly was a two hour AOL advertisement, but that should have been expected. The PG nature of the movie left it in the "cute" category, which is not the same as saying that it is "good," unfortunately.

		<shortDescription>Has What So Many Romantic Comedies Lack: A Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romantic Comedy is a genre that has really tapered off in the last decade or so. The genre has become so dependent on sex, for both the romance and comedy, that watching such a sincere film as "You've Got Mail" makes you realize how sweet and funny movies of this type can be.The film centers around Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), owner of a book superstore "Fox Books", and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), owner of a small mom and pop bookstore "The Shop Around the Corner". Bitter business rivals by day but, unbeknownst to them, anonymous e-mail pen pals by night. Naturally of course they fall in love with each other through the e-mails despite a strict "no personal information" pact. The film uses this setup to use dramatic irony for many of the jokes but also for character development.The key to romance in fiction, comedy or not, is to make it about characters and their relationships with each other. The best romances ("When Harry Met Sally...", "The Notebook", "Whisper of the Heart", and even pieces of "Welcome to the NHK") develop themselves around their characters. But what this type of film needs more than anything but so rarely does is heart and to believe in its characters and events. This is how "You've Got Mail" succeeds, it makes itself about the characters. So while not a deep film, by doing that it allows itself to be sweet, funny, and believable. Funny and romantic (what a movie in a genre called Romantic Comedy should be), "You've Got Mail" is such a nice little film that even us cynics at heart can't help but smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie about fifty times. In fact when I was a younger adult; it was the movie that I was obsessed with. I am not even a romantic comedy type of person but this one totally rules. The script is incredible. The dialogues are so smartly chosen. The general idea is also bright of course; yet I think that it was kind of inevitable too for that time (I mean to make a film about this internet thing). For the people who have not watched the film yet I must say that it's much more than "you getting mail". Of course the idea is used quite beneficially but the movie offers you a lot more than that. There are slight but tasty references to modernity, capitalism, literature and mainly the book "Pride and Prejudice". The movie in general has this great warm atmosphere which makes you get into it so easily. Other than that, be ready for beautiful New York views! (There is no need to mention but Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan again make a nice couple.)I haven't seen the movie for more than a year now but it still reminds me of newly sharpened pencils. It was and is so much fun watching it. Totally recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the way I like romantic comedies to be. "You've Got Mail" slowly builds and allows the audience to start wishing more and more that the main characters could be together. Some romantic comedies jump around too much and make it unbelievable that the guy and girl would fall in love. However, in this film, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan start out as competitors who hate each other, unaware that they are corresponding to each other's emails and are slowly falling in love. Tom Hanks learns the truth first and plays with Meg Ryan for awhile, causing her to wish it was him she was falling in love with, unaware of the truth. The end proves to be tear-jerking and entirely romantic. The music mixes well with the romance in the film as well. Hanks and Ryan do a good job in this film, and so does the supporting cast, including Parker Posey and Dabney Coleman. The film left me satisfied and happy. Almost a perfect film, and it is hard for me to find romantic comedies I really like. This one is worthwhile and fun.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You've Got Mail" Qualifies as a Pleasant, Mushy-Ado-About-Nothing Yarn that Should Offend Nobody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love conquers all between two bad-for-each-other individuals in the predictably saccharine but tolerably entertaining romantic comedy "You've Got Mail" that reunites writer &amp; director Nora Ephron with her "Sleepless in Seattle" co-stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as rival booksellers in the Big Apple who woo each other anonymously via the Internet when they aren't at war with each other in the real world. Sappy cinemaphiles who rhapsodized about "Sleepless in Seattle" inevitably will applaud Ephron's simple but charismatic recoupling of Ryan and Hanks. Discriminating audiences, on the other hand, may reject "Mail" for being manipulatively cute, slowly-paced, and thinly plotted fodder.Ostensibly, Ephron's frivolous but disposable soaper updates director Ernest Lubitsch's "The Shop around the Corner." In that venerable but uneven 1940 comedy, James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan portrayed two clashing curio store clerks who exchange anonymous but endearing letters. Incidentally, not only did Miklos Laszlo's play "Parfumerie" serve as the basis for the Lubitsch comedy, but it also inspired director Robert Z. Leonard's 1949 musical "In the Good Old Summertime" that mated Judy Garland with Van Johnson.Just for the record, "The Shop around the Corner" ranks as no great shakes itself. Maudlin and claustrophobic, with a subplot featuring infidelity and suicide, the Lubitsch comedy is still rather depressing for a film produced during the Golden Age of Hollywood. "Michael" director Nora Ephron and sister Delia Ephron have adapted Samson Raphaelson's "Shop" screenplay, preserving its better parts and contriving a few twists of their own. In their warm and fuzzy remake, the Ephrons have changed the setting from pre-World War II Budapest to contemporary New York City. Not surprisingly, because Nora Ephron lives on the Upper West Side, "You've Got Mail" makes Manhattan look like the better side of the rainbow. The sisters Ephron have expanded the scope of the action, too, so that the principals no longer toil under the same roof with the same tyrannical boss.As Joe Fox, Tom Hanks of "Forrest Gump" plays the son of a wealthy family that owns Fox Books, a conglomerate book store a la Barnes &amp; Noble which swallows smaller stores. Although Joe epitomizes capitalism at its most ruthless extreme, the filmmakers go to great lengths to take the sting out of his villainy. Not only do they show him taking his father's children by a second wife out to play, but they also saddle Joe with a shaggy Irish setter. Can anybody say "Turner and Hooch?" Conversely, as Kathleen Kelly, Ryan runs a quaint little children's bookstore named The Shop Around the Corner that her mother left her. Perky as always with her hair fashionably disheveled, Ryan appears hopelessly adorable in whatever she dons, whether pajamas or pants suit. Essentially, Hanks and Ryan are the whole show, and their cinematic chemistry has not dimmed an iota since their initial coupling in the abysmal 1990 epic "Joe Versus the Volcano." "You've Got Mail" marks the third time that they have teamed up.The conflict is pretty basic. Opening its newest superstore a block away, Fox Books poses a dire threat to Kathleen's livelihood as a longtime neighborhood staple. Unlike "Sleepless in Seattle," where the Ryan and Hanks' characters eventually met at the end of the movie, "You've Got Mail" has their paths criss-crossing from the outset. The premise is that Kathleen and Joe meet in an-over-30 chat room at America-On-Line and have kindled a cozy e-mail relationship under the aliases of 'Shopgirl' and 'NY152.' Agreeing not to divulge any personal details, they have maintained a strictly platonic relationship. Nevertheless, they're so infatuated that they cannot wait for their live-in lovers to leave (they're singles) for work each day so that they can check their e-mail. Actually, Joe and Kathleen live only a few blocks apart, and Ephron shows early on how easily it is for these New Yorkers to walk the same streets without colliding. Joe is shacking up with a neurotic, caffeine-addicted book editor, Patricia Eden (indie movie queen Parker Posey), while Kathleen shares the same bed with a pretentious, bespectacled newspaper columnist, Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear of "As Good As It Gets." Eventually, Joe and Kathleen run afoul of each other at a publisher's party where she learns about Joe's notoriety. Dislike turns to hate when Fox Books lures Kathleen's customers away with its discounted books, cappuccino bar, and chairs to relax in and read. Faced with competition that will likely sink her small business, 'Shopgirl' seeks advice from 'NY152.' He suggests that she go to war. Rationalizing everything in terms of the movie "The Godfather," he refers to the mafia epic as "the sum of all wisdom" and charts his life by it. Meanwhile, she interprets life through the pages of Jane Austin's classic weepie "Pride and Prejudice." Despite the widespread protest that she generates in the media, Kathleen cannot compete with Fox, and she locks her doors after 42 years of business. Indeed, hostile takeovers of this kind raise few eyebrows in today's rabid business climate, but jarring realism of this sort seems distinctly out of place in an otherwise fluffy love story.Although "You've Got Mail" is a tale perfectly suited for today's technology, several obvious consequences have been overlooked. Never mind that "Mail" depicts women as passive and inexorably overwhelmed, makes breaking up appear like a picnic, and condones Republican style capitalism where big company gobble up small stores without a moral hiccup. Presumably, the sisters Ephron figured that audiences will dismiss these uneasy questions without a thought as they purr over the on-screen chemistry between Ryan and Hanks. Formulaic, flighty, flirtatious, and feel-good-all-around, "You've Got Mail" emerges also as a shameless infomercial for AOL, Macintosh computers, and Starbucks Coffee. However, another rather unsettling question lurks in the background. What if that significant other who shares this cinematic experience with you is cavorting on-line with somebody else? Hmm!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out-dated, gentle rom-com that's as inoffensive as a puppy - 67%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been recently introduced to the addictive joys of Facebook, I'm rediscovering the art of communicating via the internet. But back in the day, when broadband was unheard of and online gambling involved wondering if Netscape would crash, it seemed daring and even dangerous because you never knew exactly who you were talking to and it's this idea that beats at the heart of this movie. Turning it into a rom-com with the stars of classic weepie "Sleepless In Seattle" seems like a recipe for a sure-fire hit. Doesn't it? Meg Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, a book-store owner struggling to keep the business afloat in an affluent suburb of New York. Across the street sits the vast corporate bookstore that is Fox's, run by millionaire Joe (Tom Hanks), which threatens Kelly's small-time children's book store. Both are in unhappy relationships which are going nowhere but they unwittingly meet each other online and offer each other support, friendship and the possibility of something more. Yet when Joe and Kathleen meet in real life, they can't help but spit poison at each other. Can they overcome their differences and escape from the business conflict that threatens to tear them apart? Predictable as a Russian general election it may be but "You've Got Mail" has a gentle humour helping us through the sickly-sweet romance. There is a strange nostalgic feel to the thing already, doubtless when faced with the relentless onslaught and evolution of information technology. But even taking this into account, the whole thing feels faintly unbelievable. Hanks and Ryan are (dare I say it) too old to be playing these sort of parts and neither really convince as the love-struck duo. The supporting cast are reduced to bit-players to make way for the two heavyweights (Steve Zahn and Dave Chappelle are both briefly amusing) but in truth, there wasn't much for them to do in the first place. New York, however, looks beautiful and inviting - think what "Notting Hill" did for London and you're there. So what we have is a fairly insipid rom-com with little going for it, yeah? Well, not quite.This is the Toyota Corolla of rom-coms - it doesn't do anything spectacularly well and it's far from memorable but it doesn't do anything much wrong either and it's hard to dislike because of it. In spite of all its faults, I still enjoyed this film even though the ending was obvious and still didn't manage to wrap everything up. My Better Half rates this film much higher, having been badgering me to get it since we first hooked up. As for me, I do enjoy this film but I can think of better rom-coms out there - "There's Something About Mary" manages to be genuinely funny and affecting as well as being a bit more audacious with some of the humour. Here, the most controversial thing about this film is a Hanks monologue extolling the virtues of going into a Starbucks. Watch it with a partner and it improves ten-fold but if you're by yourself, throw a snowball at someone you haven't seen in years on Facebook...</fullReview>

She's carrying no purse, wallet, etc., she's wearing now chain around her neck, and the outfit she is wearing (a lavender sweater set with gore pleated skirt) has no pockets! Where is her key? It could be argued that she pinned it in her to an undergarment, but that could prove embarrassing. How will she get back into her building? Better call the super!

		<fullReview>Rating: 9/10When you look back on this film, you can't help remembering these two in Sleepless In Seattle.Tom Hank's Joe Fox role is completely overshadowed by his Award-Winning performance of Captain Miller in Saving Private Ryan in the same year.However, lets not overlook his performance here. Tom Hanks is one of those versatile actors, not only can he go from a dramatic role in Saving Private Ryan to a romantic role in You've Got Mail, but he can do comedy too.Meg Ryan, the Queen of Romance, stars alongside Tom Hanks. The chemistry between the two in the movie, you'll swear they are married in real life.The writing and directing by Nora Ephron is tremendous once again. Here's a woman who can superbly write men while still knowing how to write the perfect woman.It's great to see not only a predictable movie like this play out so well, but have also a large supporting cast to boot. Steve Zahn, Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton, Parker Posey, and Dave Chappelle provide the comedic relief when Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are lost in each other's constant back and forth emailing.When you finally finish the movie, you'll feel warm, and satisfied. As if you just experienced all the love between them with the special someone you have or met.This is definitely a movie you will not want to pass up. Even guys shouldn't pass up the chance to watch this one.Watch it and cuddle with your significant other as you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a good thing that I didn't know in advance that so many people compare this movie to "Sleepless in Seattle", some even stating that it was some kind of unofficial sequel. I must admit that I didn't like that one all that much and if I had read such comments before watching it, I'm sure I wouldn't even have given it a try, because I'm convinced that there are only few sequels actually worth a watch. But I didn't know all this yet and I was ready to be surprised.Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly have met each other in a chat box on the internet and have never seen each other, but regularly send each other e-mail messages. On the internet their relationship with each other is close to perfect, but in reality they are each others rivals. Kathleen Kelly is the owner of a little, famous bookstore for children's books who is endangered by the opening of Fox Books, a huge chain of discount book shops. While on the internet madly in love with him, in real life she could drink his blood, not knowing that he's the same person. When Joe Fox finds out the truth, he has to find a way to convince her that he's actually a nice guy...Once again the acting in this movie was very good. I already liked Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in "Sleepless in Seattle", but in my opinion they were even better in this movie. And not only the acting was better, the entire story seemed to work better. The fact that it wasn't so obvious how the story tried to get us emotional, gave this movie that little extra that I'm always looking for. Also the entire idea behind it that people meet in chat rooms is nothing new or exceptional and that they want to see each other in real life afterwards is only natural I believe. It's a part of the modern society and I don't think it will go away soon, so why shouldn't it be used in a romantic movie? Normally I'm not too much a fan of romantic comedies, but this time I'll have to make an exception. I liked the story, the humor was good, the acting more than OK. And the fact that it all was a lot closer to reality than what I could ever hope for in the beginning was a pleasant surprise. That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following Sleepless in Seattle, this is not a very good movie. Those who are great fans of the first are not likely to find any magic in You've Got Mail. That said I like this movie better than that other romantic comedy with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. It is certainly a step up from Joe Versus the Volcano (which I also enjoyed, but is no great classic).I am the first to admit that Sleepless in Seattle is a better movie than You've Got Mail. The script is better, and as much as I like both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, they are just not at their best in this film, and the chemistry between them is much more convincing in the first movie. Nevertheless, I liked this movie partly because it illustrates the disappearance of the "mom and pop" type business, yet still puts a human face on the big chain stores that have replaced it, and more importantly, I was more moved by this one.Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan go well together, and have come out with some good movies. Nora Ephron is a good director, and this is a decent movie in that regard, especially considering the script is just mediocre.This film is worth seeing as a romantic comedy, but don't try to compare too much to Sleepless in Seattle or Meg Ryan's movie with Billy Crystal, When Harry Met Sally, or you may be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan deliver excellent performances as they re-team for the third time. Fresh off "Saving Private Ryan" Tom Hanks portrays Joe Fox a bookstore owner looking to take over every bookstore in sight in order to make his the only one in town. He butts heads with Meg Ryan who portrays Kathleen Kelly, a small bookstore owner, called The Shop Around The Corner.One of the many great surprises for me about this film was the performance of Jean Stapleton as Birdie who adds with her witty humor and jokes. Greg Kinnear stars as Frank Navaski, Katkleen's boyfriend and a newspaper columnist, who has the sense of humor that takes this film to a new plateau.Since this movie is so good I don't want to give away many details but I can say when this movie hits its groove it gets better and better and by the time the movie is over people will not want to leave their seats."You've Got Mail" is a brilliantly directed film by Nora Ephron who worked with Hanks and Ryan in "Sleepless In Seattle." It seems as if Tom Hanks took over the role of director in the last thirty minutes of the movie; he does a wonderful job at doing this. The best part of the whole entire movie comes in the final scene and the dialogue between the actors involved with that scene; with that scene the whole movie is tied together. "You've Got Mail" is a tremendously well-done and brilliantly put together film and worth everyone's while to sit and relax for 120 min.</fullReview>

That is really sweet.I was crying!In the end I was in tears. This is such a great movie, you have to see it for yourself! I'm only 14 and I LOVE this movie! I've seen it 20 times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this remake of the 1940's film "The Shop Around the Corner," starring James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Sarah Haden, Inez Courtney and William Tracey. The updating of this classic romantic comedy didn't suffer. In fact, it was enhanced in many ways, as it made its way into modern times.Meg Ryan is her usual sweet, charming self in Margaret Sullavan's role of the young shop girl. Tom Hanks was a perfect modern day model for Jimmy Stewart's role as her love interest.One of the marvelous features about this version is that it was filmed in New York, rather than in the "Old Budapest" section of the MGM back lots . ..One surprise character with no counterpart in the original story is Dabney Coleman - an eccentric corporate executive who plays Hanks' father. An enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isn't it something how you love a movie and are convinced of its beauty and then you read commentaries that are all the contrary. This movie, in my opinion...is wonderful, and funny, and hopeful. What the heck is the matter with that? Some said it was boring.....what?....maybe they were sleepy :). That happens you know....a great movie can be on but you're just not in the right mood, not receptive. You see it on a different occasion and it's another story...like anything. Meg Ryan brings great delight and heart to her character in this film. How you could criticize that I will never understand. Everyone in my opinion is wonderful and hilarious in this movie. Really. The movie is one great moment. And personally there is nothing wrong with an ending that isn't depressing..ok....life is about triumph and joy too you know. All endings are good as long as there is real heart and truth to them. And there is nothing wrong with having fun. Amen. This movie is about everything, about heartbreak, beginnings, endings, middles....my only advice....dig in and enjoy!!! A+ in my book. (The kind of movie that stays with you.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when it first came out and watch it whenever it is on cable. Why? Becasue Meg Ryan is just as cute as can be and I never tire of watching her expressions as she ponders what to compose on her laptop. Also, I feel the need to comment just to voice my opinion that this movie is clearly superior to "Sleepless in Seattle." This story is more believable and Meg is much, much more adorable here. The story is often predictable, of course, but I love the ending with Meg's wonderful expressions. And Harry Nilssen's rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" adds to the satisfying conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>F O X , Fox thats Joe Fox, Tom Hanks' character who wants to rule the world. The Book world at least anyway. This is as fine a Tom Hanks / Meg Ryan film as you will see. Both personalities were made for this script although it is more likely the script was made with then in mind. Hanks' world is dominated with being the 'Book Zsar' of New Yorks West Side but his life is turned upside down after an encounter in a jammned elevator. Meg Ryan is the sugary sweet heroine who falters not and just about keeps it together in the face of personal disaster. The characters transformation from bitter business rivals to the inevitable lovers is both as pleasant as it is expected. This does not spoil the film however as the journey to this end is what makes this film superb. Both Hanks and Ryan seem familiar in these roles and so they should as the characters could be straight out of 'Sleepless' in another timeline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a boring film. There aren't any good jokes, and the plot ispredictable and tedious and unexciting. Nothing happens! MegRyan is annoying. She plays the exact same annoying charactar inevery single silly film, and every single silly film is another sillymindless romantic comedy. (Julia Roberts does this too, but sheis a better actress and her charactar is much more likeable. Plusher roles are generally more serious. Ex: If Meg Ryan had been in"Erin Brockovich" it would have BOMBED.) I couldn't believe TomHanks agreed to be in this, he is usually so good! I guess it wasjust the novelty of appearing again with Meg Ryan. The only thing about this film is the way it ended, it was very wellchosen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love letter to New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a simple rom-com for those of us who don't want a heavy duty thinking session. Hanks and Ryan are great in their respective roles and are supported by a wonderful cast. The plot is fairly simple and is based on the plot of The Shop Around the Corner where two "enemies" don't realise that they are each others pen pals (in the original by mail, in this one by email) and fall in love with their secret pen pal only to find out later that their true love has been right under their nose. A little cheesy maybe but like I said, this isn't heavy duty. Apart from the central love story, there are two other love stories going on here and good on the Ephron sisters for bringing them up. The first one is a love of the printed word. Whether your choice would be Fox Books or The Shop Around the Corner, both are bringing a love of books to the target audience. And even though the Frank Navasky character is not the most endearing, he loves the words that he writes. But the most important love story of all is the love that Nora Ephron has for New York, especially the community of the Upper West Side. The UWS is truly the star of the movie and deservedly so. Watch this film if you have a bit of sparkle and not too much cynicism about yourself and tune out the world for a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I watch it about once a week just to relax. I have seen the original (Shop Around the Corner) with Jimmy Stewart as the main character. Nora Ephron did a great job jumping off from that and adding the modern touch with "old-fashioned" romance. One of my favorite parts is when Joe visits Kathleen when she is sick, fixes her a cup of tea and asks, "Honey?" She replies,"Yes." Then he goes on to finish what he was going to say. The word play here is fun and the timing on this and many other lines makes for a lot of fun throughout the movie. I also love the different suggestions Joe has for the use of 152 as an internet "handle". 152 people who think he looks like Clark Gable. No 152 people who think he looks like a Clark bar. If you are the deeply intellectual, critical, superior type of person then do not see this movie but if you have any soul at all, you cannot help but be touched by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've Got a Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America has watched as Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan lit up the screen in the duo's debut in Joe vs. the Volcano and brought tears to our eyes in Sleepless in Seattle. In their latest production, You've Got Mail, they bring warmth to our hearts. Whoever said three's a crowd never saw the newest edition to the Hanks-Ryan collection. Nora Ephron, producer and screenwriter of Sleepless and Mail, is the queen of romantic comedies. Anybody who can turn a simple overlooked phrase like "You Have Mail" into a symbol of true love, friendship, and happiness is worthy of any moviegoer's seven bucks. Ephron, with her sister Delia, lights up the screen with their subtle comedic antics, such as overanalyzing Starbucks. "The reason there are places like Starbucks is for people with no decision-making ability whatsoever, to make six decisions, just to buy one cup of coffee: short, tall, lite, dark, caf, decaf, lowfat, nonfat," Hanks character says, analytically. Also, anyone who is able to relate life itself to The Godfather or Pride and Prejudice deserves a pat on the back, or a Golden Globe, whichever comes first. "The Godfather is the I Ching. The Godfather is the sum of all wisdom." "Don't you just love New York in the fall? It makes me want to buy school supplies," Hanks' Joe says to Ryan's Kathleen. "I would send you a bouquet of newly sharpened pencils if I knew your name and address. On the other hand, this not knowing has its charms." In real life, Joe and Kathleen are business rivals in the book business. Kathleen runs a second generation children's bookstore, The Shop Around the Corner. Joe is heir to the discount chain bookstore, Fox Books Superstore. The two are at odds almost completely from the start, but despite their unending grudge against the other, somwhere along the way, the audience can feel a spark ignite between the two. The chemistry in this film is natural and, even more so than in Sleepless in Seattle, the two show that, once again, they are America's leading onscreen couple. As Upper West Siders, their characters would not be complete without some assistance. Joe lives with a stone cold, pill-popping book editor. Kathleen lives with the columnist against all forms of technology, sometimes assumed to be the Unibomber. Ephron creates an elegant, charming scene of Manhattan and gives in a small-town, comfortable, broken-in feeling. Joe and Kathleen are constantly running into each other in the middle of a city of eight million, in the grocery store, in the Flower District, and, of course, in Starbucks. Hanks and Ryan were given the chance in this film to prove their chemistry. In Joe vs. the Volcano, their talents were still developing, and in Sleepless in Seattle, they rarely shared a scene. Nearly a decade passed between their first cooperative endeavor and this true masterpiece, and this time they hit it right on target. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan won America over with their "hopeless romantic" view of the Internet, and with their incredible ability to steal our hearts all at the same time. Third time's a charm I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Really Nice Film (Warning: Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really pleasant film and it raises your spirits. I haven't seen The Shop Around the Corner so I can't compare it to that film. The only fault with the plot is that Kathleen's shop eventually closes. Had I been writing the script I would have had Joe rescue it somehow. Tom Hanks is an icon for all us nice guys. He's quoted as saying "anyone who sees my films knows they are going to have a good time" and that's very true. Joe, for all his success, wants to be a family man. He comes from a rather bizarre family where he has a half-brother and an aunt who are only just children but he's evidently one of their favourite relatives. Kathleen has the right attitude to reading and makes out that children should read from an early age. She knows and gets on well with her customers. Joe's Waterstone's style bookstore is slightly impersonal. There are a few very touching scenes such as Kathleen visualising herself as a wee girl pirouetting with her mother. The ending is very touching too. I hope they went on to get married, have a family and Kathleen was able to relaunch her children's book shop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd have to say You've Got Mail was a fun romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now you're saying, wow, it must have taken a long time for you to come up with that. Well it didn't. I had just finished final exams for the semester and my brain was a little fried. But come on, when you have Hanks, Ryan and Ephron together, what do you expect? World War III? Of course it was going to be fun and romantic. Hanks and Ryan have to be the premiere on-screen couple in Hollywood. And Ephron has proven over the years that she can get both a tear and a smile out of you during her movies. Hanks plays Joe Fox, the son of the owner of the largest book chain in New York, Fox Books. Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, the owner of a small children's bookstore called, A Shop Around the Corner. Well as it turns out, Fox Books opens up a store right around the corner from Kathleen's store. Joe and Kathleen run into each other, and its hate at first site. Kathleen thinks Joe is just a money hungry businessman, while Joe just thinks Kathleen is another stepping stone in life. And they're both happy to go on thinking that way about each other. What they don't realize is that they know each other. See, both Kathleen and Joe are having an email relationship online. Every day they email back and forth, saying things most people only dream about, but never saying anything personal. Joe and Kathleen have the dream relationship with each other; they just don't know it yet.So you know where the movie goes. They love each other online, and hate each other offline. When Joe finds out that his online love is Kathleen, he's not sure what to do. Does he tell her? Or does he try and find out how she really feels about him? My only problem with the film was her reaction at the end when they finally meet. It seems to be that in a way he was lying to her about who he was. He knew who she was, and he sort of used that to find out about how she felt about him. I don't know about you, but I think I might have been a little more upset about being used that way. But then again, we were at the 2 hour mark when they met, so I guess it had to have a happy ending. And I'm not saying the happy ending was bad, just Hollywood.If you're looking for a good date movie, You've Got Mail would be the one to see. It's light-hearted, funny, and romantic. But would you expect any less?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YOU'VE GOT MAIL is another one of those different romantic comedies that actually have a good plot than some of those movies where boy meets girl, boy loves girl, boy loses girl. NO! This movie instead has a moral. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks play two business competitors who are unaware that they are both really good internet buddies online. Through AOL, the two interact and chat with each other, sharing different information about their lives. Tom Hanks gives a very funny performance, but the person who I was most suprised by was Steve Zahn. He was an absolute riot in this movie. Since this was one of his smaller roles, we don't get to see much of him, but the parts that he does have are great. Since my friends make fun of me all the time because I watch this movie, I'm not going to write a really long review, I'm just going to say that if you are a fan of romantic comedies, see this movie. Because it is one of the best of the genre. See it if you are a Meg Ryan fan or a Tom Hanks fan. You won't be disappointed......5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually dislike romantic comedies (couldn't stand When Harry Met Sally, which is more about sex than romance anyway), but this one is so far superior to the usual, and so full of subtleties, that it is worth seeing again and again. I'm surprised that so many people find it simplistic or shallow, because it is neither. Rather than the all-too-common scenario in which two people start out hating each other and then realise what they have in common and fall in love, this one uses the device of an email relationship to allow the two people to influence each other subtly so that both of them come to realise their inadequacies. I was particularly impressed by the way Tom Hanks's character, being forced to look at a situation from two entirely different perspectives, gradually comes to a realisation of what is wrong with his treatment of other people and begins to change his own behaviour. The result is thus far more believable than the usual sudden or unexplained changes in these movies. (I thought this was managed far better here than in Shop Around the Corner.)The dialogue is also very good, so the inevitable romantic ending manages to rise above the cliches. Of course, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan both do a brilliant job. And I have to admit I loved the music, especially all the old Harry Nilsson songs).The only thing I didn't like was the assumption, so common in movies these days, that marriage is almost non-existent but people just move in together (especially in New York City). This is so false, and it is especially disturbing in a movie that should be suitable for children. Statistics show that many thousands of New Yorkers get married every year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail is a wonderful romantic comedy, which reunites Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and Nora Ephron. Tom who plays Joe Fox and Meg who plays Kathleen Kelly are amazing as usual and of course they have great chemistry in the movie. With an added extra good performance from Greg Kinnear who plays Frank Navasky, Kathleen's boyfriend. Kathleen Kelly owns a little bookshop called "Shop around the corner", it's been opened for years and used to be owned by her late mother. Everyone loves her shop, until a new bookstore opens up in the same street, called: Fox Bookstores owned by Joe Fox, which leaves Kathleen's business in danger and forces her to close down her store.Kathleen and Joe both despise each-other, but little do they know they talk to each-other every night on the internet and have a great relationship online. The ending in the movie is predictable, but lovely. I give You've Got Mail a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To comment that a movie to be a classic or not differs from individual to individual. From my perception it is a simple, modern classic. The movie tells you about the possibilities and the fantasy which we can embark on, of course you feel a vacuum in yourself that you hardly have even a minimal chance to encounter this in your life. The movie could be a remake of 'Shop around the Corner' that I have not seen, but it matches with the times we are living today.Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan need no introduction, they exemplified the character. Very simple dialogues, a very clean script, and a very decent movie that can be viewed with your family. Being an Indian and brought up in a conservative environment, I was quite surprised that are English movies made like this. I Thank Director Nora for making such lively movies.People are always confronted with moments that you are quite inexplicable and I am not able to explain myself, all I can say is Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have given such commendable performance, that you forget the world around you and wish to rerun the movie.Just view the movie it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film with my girlfriend, and although it was undeniably romantic, it was still hugely enjoyable, with classic moments such as the little girl's singing. Meg Ryan is magic as Kathleen, and both Ryan and Hanks easily draw you into the story. Much better than its still good, but slightly dated predecessor Sleepless in Seattle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strangely compelling movie that I can't seem to stay away from.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "You've Got Mail," I didn't like it as much as I liked "Sleepless in Seattle," so I gave it a 7. But the movie haunted me, so I watched it again the next day, and gave it an 8. It still wouldn't let me alone, so the next month I gave it a 9. So all right already, six months later, I'm giving it a 10.Now why, you might ask, would I give this movie a 10. It is not an action movie. It has no gratuitous sex, no foul language, no senseless death in mountains of living color and tons of gore, and no stunning musical score. It has no visually stunning graphics, and it doesn't have any really compelling or dynamic characters. In short, it doesn't seem to have anything that would make it appeal to the masses. So why a 10. The answer is that the thing just won't let me alone. I keep watching it and watching it. It appeals to the emotional side of me. And any story that can reach down and touch me like that, has to be well written and well acted, so much so that it does it's job and has its subtle affect before the viewer is even aware that he or she has been hooked. That is a rare quality, yet such is the quality of the movie we have before us. That is what makes "You've Got Mail" worth a 10.Perhaps I am becoming more appreciative of romance and simple, down-to-earth characters than I once was. Perhaps I'm beginning to understand that life doesn't revolve around violence, sex, and shock language. Perhaps I'm simply coming back to what I've always known. Whatever the reason, this movie (and movies like it) make it happen for me. They are more satisfying than any I can remember seeing in the past. I hope this is a trend in the industry.A simple boy meets girl, girl meets boy, movie told with elegance and taste. See the movie. Buy the movie. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are both such effortlessly likeable people on screen, it is no surprise they have such an easy chemistry on screen even where - here like in Sleepless in Seattle - they spend much of the movie apart. You've Got Mail is no classic, it's no breakthrough, it does not feature any star turn, stand out, performances - though I liked Maureen Stapleton's part - just very good actors acting very well (Dabney Coleman plays the Dabney Coleman part like it was written for him; Greg Kinnear plays the solipsistic writer with the right touch of egoism and obliviousness). It does not feature a particularly memorable story, and the dialogue is straight from Snappy Dialogues R Us, but you know, it is still a fun way to spend some time being entertained, laughing, and passing your wife a hankie if - like mine - she tends to cry when movies want you to cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A far far better thing than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*warning, there may be an unintentional spoiler here:I avoided this film for a long time, as I generally try to avoid flippant, trite, cotton candy fluff or neurotic-obsessive romantic-comedies, or films which I dread may fall into these categories. But I have to say, I did enjoy You've Got Mail much much more than I ever expected to, having rented it two years after the film's original release while living on the upper east side of Manhattan, partially because I suppose I was curious to see what another New York film would whine about. Sadly, Meg Ryan did not, as usual, stretch her range very far for this film, but once again as far as the demands of her role are concerned, she was well cast. Nevertheless, in this film, she does manage to be charming. There was a moment in which I found myself unexpectedly moved by her for the first time, in the scene where she relives a memory of "twirling" with her mother. Though I was never a Meg Ryan fan before, I found I liked her character in this film and her performance of the stalwart Kathleen Kelly (could she really exist in New York, though?). And though I have begun to feel that Tom Hanks is becoming a tediously ubiquitous face in Hollywood, much like Gerard Depardieu in France, I found his performance intriguing, as he avoided the pitfall of another clean cut Jimmy Stewart type nice guy role and allowed himself to appear as a modest modern villain: the head of a soul-eating big books corporation. Greg Kinnear's eccentric performance as Kathleen Kelly's writer/boyfriend Frank is very humorous and shines within the supporting cast. In general, this film is enjoyable, even though the plot is somewhat predictable. I liked it nonetheless and would recommend it, to sentimentalists and skeptics alike. Tom Hank's partial reformation and quest for redemption and reward is particularly believable and cleverly concocted. This is a romantic-comedy lover's must-see, and others will like it, too. My score: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardly. (spoiler ahead) This is a story of a man who, due to his god-like status and money, manipulates a woman into falling in love with him, while carefully destroying her life. Here we are supposed to assume that the life he will give her will be far greater than the old bookstore her mother left her -- the only thing she actually owns. In the end he succeeds in both and when she learns the truth her reaction is rather bizarrely submissive. It is as though in her helplessness she identifies with the aggressor.I would classify this movie a psychological thriller where romance is the sub-plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like one or two of the other reviewers, I too was almost moved to tears by the end of this movie. I had just witnessed a dreary, drippy, forgettable piece of film-making that cost an obscene amount of money. Apart from the futility of remaking a close to perfect film in the first place (THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER), adding the e-mail element doesn't work because e-mail and the internet play so little part in the romance or the film as a whole. But what really sinks this movie is that the mechanics of the plot are stuck in the syrup of sentimentality. It's so busy being fluffy that even if it was as witty and charming as it thinks it is (which it ain't), it would still need some semblance of drama or believable conflict or just about anything except unrelenting "cuteness". The inevitability of every single detail working out absolutely perfectly for everyone is just too much. I've nothing against fairy tales, but Tom and Meg were already living happily ever before the end of the first reel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd, distasteful little movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is strange. Just weird. It would seem as if it's trying to be a romantic comedy, and indeed that is what it was billed and sold as (And it's based on one of the best - the 1938 film The Shop Around the Corner, starring Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. People, this is an absolute gem, and regardless of how you feel about You've Got Mail, you ABSOLUTELY must see it. See it! See it! See it! You won't be disappointed.)But back to You've Got Mail. Now, I like Tom Hanks. I like Meg Ryan. I loved them together in Joe Versus the Volcano (haven't seen Sleepless in Seattle - and have no intention of ever doing so). But they completely fizzle here. It's not really their fault. The script is so hard-wired to prevent any audience sympathy or interaction. The premise would appear to be golden: two people fall in love with one another via the Internet, only to realize that in real life they can't stand each other. This is an intriguing set-up (and a savvy and intelligent update of Shop Around the Corner's pen-pal conceit); the scenes where we hear (through voiceover) Tom and Meg's communiques with each other are low-key and sweet. But. . . oh, there are so many "but"s - such as:*Did the script really need to pair up the stars with respective live-ins (Greg Kinnear for her, Parker Posey for him)? These characters never get explored in the least, are blatant caricatures (he of N.Y. intelligentsia, she of the brash and crass world of publishing), and are dispensed of without any noticeable fanfare. What's the point? Surely, having the leads be separated by not knowing each others' identities should have been (and is) complication enough.*Why is Hanks' character privy to the secret identity of his e-mail partner so long before Ryan's is? True, this development corresponds structurally to the one played out in Shop Around the Corner, but that's not really a fair comparison. There, the entire movie was more or less seen through the eyes of Jimmy Stewart's character, and our identification with him made us wonder how he would make use of his knowledge. Here, though, Hanks and Ryan are given equal weight and screen time; neither represents the definitive "perspective" through which the film is to be seen. As such, awarding his character knowledge which she does not possess strikes of a desire to play favorites - and wreaks havoc with the trajectory of the movie's second half. It suddenly ceases being a movie about equals and becomes more about the deliberate manipulations and evasions of Tom Hanks' character - making the whole thing seem insincere and smarmy, rather than fun or heart-warming.*And speaking of smarmy, what's with the moral of this story? Is there one?! I mean sure, going in, we more or less figure that there will be a sappy but endearing message about love winning out in the end over personal differences. Which we're prepared for (and frankly, if you're not, you've stepped into not only the wrong movie but the wrong genre). Since, in the film, Hanks and Ryan are the heads of rival bookstores - he a large and impersonal chain, she a small, independently owned neighborhood store catering lovingly to children - we get to see their personal peccadillos played out in the world of business. This is a good idea, particularly as his chain is attempting to drive hers out of business. Problem is, no one really had the heart to make Tom Hanks the yuppie s.o.b. he really needed to be for this story to work (of course, the Hanks of the '80s was born to play just this role - but now that he's graduated to bland "nice guy" parts I suppose all nuance and complexity have gone out of his work). What the filmmakers do instead is truly laughable (and here comes a major SPOILER, so if you don't want to know how this film ends stop reading here) - they have Hanks' company run Ryan's out of business - and then have her fall in love with him anyway. HUH?! Could someone explain that to me? The two don't reach a détente, a middle ground, in their personal and business bickering. They don't join forces, or find some compromise way to co-exist. I was at least expecting some diatribe against big business in favor of small and independent shopowners who truly "care" about their product. Corny though it might have been, it at least would have been consistent with the genre it found itself in. Or the movie might have been truly brave and suggested that, under the circumstances, there was no way Ryan could ever be with Hanks, as much as she loves him in cyberspace, for their fundamental difference in temperament and philosophy would always keep them apart. Then, maybe, Tom would have to undergo some kind of transformation or catharsis or. . . . but, hey, since he's already such a nice guy in this movie, screw it, let's just have him win heartlessly in business, and get the girl anyway. Under all the gossamer and syrup of the ending, it's a pretty mean-spirited and cynical message this movie is pushing. Very distasteful, too. And not at all the experience I had in mind when laying down my eight bucks to see two of the most likable and charming leads working in movies today.But Shop Around the Corner, that's a whole other story. ..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually Worse Than I Thought it Would Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stayed away from this movie before because I really don't care for Meg Ryan and think she is seriously overrated. I rented it because I figured it would at least be sort of romantic, and I like Tom Hanks ok. I didn't read other user comments before I saw it but I read them after and agree on so many points. First, she falls for him way too fast, even though he was responsible for ruining her business. Suddenly, since she has a man in her life, she gets completely over the fact that the business that she put her heart and soul to and was in her family for generations died a slow, painful death at the hands of his chain bookstore. Second, it would have been so much more interesting if it was reversed and the woman was the one with the big business. I'm not saying that to be feminist. I mean, they really made a big deal about how this was an "update" with "a 90's feel" and blah blah. I would have liked Tom Hanks more if 30 min into the film we didn't have this cutesy little montage to the tune of "splish splash" ( Wow! Baby boomer songs on the soundtrack! Bold choice, guys!) where Hanks takes some kids to a street fair and they get their faces painted, bob for apples, try on oversized sunglasses, etc until you want to puke. I mean, Tom Hanks is a pretty appealing guy when he turns on the charm--they didn't have to hit us over the head with it. I can't beleive Ryan's character didn't figure out who her email pal was sooner. An idiot would have been able to put 2 and 2 together and at least suspect. Their love letters they wrote to each other were trite and nauseating, though at least we were spared scenes of them meeting cute in a chatroom or newsgroup (alt.irritatingpinheads?). As far as Meg Ryan, she was as annoying as she gets. Also, she is not aging well, that sounds catty, but she doesn't look too good in this movie (not that I thought she was all that great looking to start with). Hanks has taken off some weight, but still looks bloated, though he can probably pull it off. He used to be a pretty good-looking guy in the 80's. Oh, and I hated Sleepless in Seattle too, but I think I hate this more, because at least Sleepless wasn't a 2 hour long commercial for AOL (notice how they never got a busy signal or had to wait to be connected)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot in my favorite neighborhood in the whole-wide world, New York's Upper West Side, You've Got Mail is an innocuous piece of fluff. Joe Fox (Hanks), scion of a mega-bookseller chain a la Barnes and Noble, is about to open a store on the Upper West Side and devour the neighborhood childrens bookstore owned by Kathleen (Ryan). They obviously have no love for one another. Little do they realize that they are actually newyork152 and shopgirl, their anonymous email names, through which they have been carrying on a cyber-affair. Complicating the affair is the fact they both have live-in lovers.Well acted, with a fine supporting cast, You've Got Mail still is predictable and utterly lacking in drama. Kathleen's store is threatened, it's going to be a David vs Goliath battle, and.....nothing.I don't think You've Got Mail is as good as Ms. Ephron's Sleepless in Seattle or Michael. For fans of romantic comedy it will scratch the itch, but for everyone else, be forewarned. C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time, instead of two people corresponding as pen pals and finding letters in their special post office boxes, we have them using the internet to find romance in cyberspace. And using smart looking New York backgrounds in lush color, upgraded technology to bring two would-be lovers together, and other modern sensibilities to the timeworn plot, Nora Ephron has come up with another charmer.TOM HANKS and MEG RYAN are the couple who can't tolerate each other when they work together but find out that they're actually soul mates when they correspond anonymously through e-mail messages. And in an age where couples are meeting and dating and eventually mating and marrying, thanks to computers, the story works and gets the benefit of a modern look.While it's unlikely that this will reach the popularity of SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, it's definitely worth a look just to enjoy the simple performances of Hanks and Ryan. GREG KINNEAR has a good supporting role and it's all brisk and amusing and easy to take.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks appear to be genuinely nice people, this film is nothing but a disguised attempt to make sexism and multi-national corporations look good.Meg Ryan owns a small store that gets put out of business by a chain book store with severely uneducated clerks who earn very little money. And then she gets her coffee at Starbucks. Yeah right! How dumb is Ryan's character anyway? While she enjoys her coffee she's helping put out of business all the local mom and pop coffee shops.Tom Hanks' character, while becoming more compassionate in his personal approach, makes no change whatsoever in his business practices. Ryan's character teaches him to be kinder, but that's all. And she decides to be with him, even though he'll go on to put other small stores out of business just like her's. What will happen to their happily ever after ending when she sees him do this to another person, except this time he does it with more "compassion?" Because Hanks' character didn't truly change (he would have had to denounce his family's business practices), the message is clear: Give in, submit to big business.Even the very set-up of this film is sexist. Reverse the roles in this film. Suppose Hanks was Ryan and vice versa. What would audiences think of a man who fell in love with the woman who put him out of business? They wouldn't watch it, that's what. He'd be a wuss, absolutely whipped. But because it's a woman being screwed, it's ok. (Btw, I'm a man and I saw this sexism from the get go.)This film, in the simplest terms, is a thinly disguised sexist pro big business fairy tale that's supposed to make us feel better about our losing a way of life -- the "shop around the corner" where everyone knows your name, knows the products and isn't out to screw the small guy.</fullReview>

Look beyond the fact that this movie is one long commercial, no other film has more product placement. The insidious message of the film is the inevitability of corporate domination. Meg Ryan, the small business owner, has her bookstore driven into the ground by Tom Hanks and his Borders type mega-store but all is forgiven in the name of love. I've never known destroying someone's livelihood to be an aphrodisiac. The rest is by the numbers romantic comedy. Trite, shallow, saccharine, completely without merit. Everyone involved should be shot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting rom-com from the late 1990s, when the internet was new and chat rooms were the in thing, when AOL ruled the cyberspace community.Ah, the whine of a 56K modem and the AOL voice, "You've Got Mail" brings back memories.First Impressions: What if you revealed your deepest personal thoughts to someone online, never suspecting that he/she was a person that you had met in person? In this case, Kathleen - Meg Ryan and Joe - Tom Hanks, even though they have mildly interesting partners of their own, sneak onto their AOL accounts and chat about life.Unbeknownst to Joe, Kathleen is a proprietor of Shop Around the Corner, a popular independent bookstore for children. And unbeknownst to Kathleen, Joe is part of the Fox Books chain of books, a family run operation that gleefully shuts down independent bookstores, buy up their stock and then sell it cheaply.Though this is a romantic comedy, it does make quite a scathing commentary on chain bookstores, like Powell's or Barnes &amp; Noble, as these chains buy up independents and destroy the unique atmosphere of neighborhood businesses. They take a stab at Starbucks as well, another well known conglomerate, as independent coffee shops struggle to survive.As an aside, these days this is changing: Barnes &amp; Noble for example, is not doing well while independents are flourishing. Interesting how things can change in 12 or so years.The film's plot is well-run and nicely running along. We have Kathleen and Joe meet, at first not knowing who each other is. Then when they do, they dislike each other because they are competitors.Then ironically they chat about each other and the problems they're having. Joe gives Kathleen advice that actually helps compete with his own store! Hilarious.The movie starts taking a fall for me when Joe and Kathleen arrange to meet off-line. When Joe discovers who his online chat-mate is, he leaves her in the coffee shop and abandons her without meeting.I mean, how callous and shallow can you get? The film took a turn I didn't like at this point.Bottom Line: The film updates and relocates the Ernst Lubitsch classic, The Shop Around the Corner (1940).Overall, great comedy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But for that ending.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this yesterday, having managed not to for about a decade. It's one of those films you'd watch once, just for the plot, most of which is pretty good.The problem is, the two sides of the story revolve around (first) technology that probably looked clever in 1998, when the Internet was fairly new, and most people didn't have it, or certainly didn't use any instant messaging - we are after all talking about life before Facebook and Twitter - so there is this 'different' angle that just isn't there now, and (second) hangs on ridiculous plot ideas like the lift scene, or the end scene.Sorry, but the idea of falling in love with someone, only to find out they are responsible for you going out of business, and not giving them a sharp jab to the nether regions and walking away, is crazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about two lonely people meeting and falling in love with each other on the Internet, only to find that they are business rivals at war.Watching this film feels a little strange. Dial up connections look so out of date right now, but it was only ten years ago. Technology does advance very quickly, making the technology featured in "You've Got Mail" look ancient. Putting that aside, "You've Got Mail" is straightforward and predictable, but the leading characters are likable and sweet. The difference in the way they communicate on the Internet and in real life is quite a joy to watch. It makes viewers want to know whether they will find out about each other, and how will it end."You've Got Mail" is an adorable and sweet film. This romantic comedy works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Duh, why is this guy saying that this is a masterpiece? I know lots of people are going to feel that when they read this review. Let me just say that its not just war movies or movies that depict the struggles of a person that qualify to be called a masterpiece.Everything about this movie is perfect - what can I say about Tom and Meg that has not been said already, then there is good music - I should add lack of music at sometimes is actually good and then there is the whole thing about a great closing scene.People keep saying to me that this movie has too much product placement - someone has gone to the length of saying that this movie is a big political campaign and it is just an insanely long commercial that glorifies monopolies with big bucks. Then, there are people who make a huge list of factual errors that they found in the movie. Duh, it is just a light-hearted feel-good comedy - you don't go to a war movie or a biopic expecting to have a laugh-riot, do you? You need to look at each movie in its own context. Sometimes, people are paying so much attention to detail that they do not get the big picture.It is not a cheesy chick-flick with people touching and kissing and cuddling and too much gallantry. It is smart, witty and well-packaged comedy. This is one of the reasons why many guys, including me, love it.In fact, so many guys love this movie that I feel that this movie and the director need special mention. I think it is a great achievement by the director. Lets think of it this way - imagine some gaming company coming up with a great first person shooter game that most of the women like to play. Hard to imagine, right! I think getting a huge percentage of men to like a rom-com is an equally challenging task and this movie has done it.I have seen many friends of mine who have turned to Meg Ryan's fans for life after watching this movie - I am speaking of guys who always hated rom-coms before (most of them still do hate rom-coms).I would recommend everyone to buy this movie - it is for keepers. I have lost count of how many times I have seen this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one of those girls that like chick flicks, but You've got Mail has been one of my favorite movies since I was a kid. The ending is perfect. A beautiful garden, two foes turning into lovers, a happy ending with a twist. Meg Ryan is perfect for this role, her meek persona combined with her innocent look brings to life Kelly's character. It wouldn't be a 90's love story without Tom Hanks, who brings an undeniable charm and arrogance to his character. This movie is up there with the classics of my generation (i.e When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, Pretty Woman,etc.). I remember when this movie came out, it played on the Chat Rooms that had recently gained so much popularity, not to mention AOL's famous line "You've Got Mail" which still plays almost a decade later. It makes fun of modern society with its new fashioned attraction to massive monopolistic companies that overtake the simplistic charming businesses that dwell below. It has a witty humor about it that makes it so appealing, its this coupled with the "will they or wont they" theme that is so common in most 90's love stories that makes this film a classic. This is one of Meg Ryans, and Tom Hanks for that matter, best films. This will one of my favorite love stories, with its rambling about daisies, senile old men, typewriters, and bouquets of sharpened pencils. Its a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing, intelligent rom com that works, if only that final scene had been developed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've Got Mail takes romance and feel-good film clichés, and handles them refreshingly, intelligently and believably with a witty and bouncy script and style, heavily developed characters and is full of nice details, particularly how in love the meaningless becomes meaningful.The plot is vaguely reminiscent of the 1940 film The Shop Around The Corner, enemies who unwittingly fall in love through the written word, and nods its head to this, but the romance in You've Got Mail is far more central to the plot and the situations and set-up are completely different.Kathleen owns a friendly children's bookshop, and Joe owns part of a big bad chain store that threatens to swallow Kathleen's simple existence whole, causing Joe to suffer for the pain he causes the woman he loves. This makes Joe a fascinating romantic lead. He is a callous businessman, but with depth and humour as a person. His horror at discovering his anonymous lover is his enemy, the inner turmoil bubbling beneath his eyes for what he has done and his desperation to befriend her and be forgiven when he knows it is too late is all superbly acted by Tom Hanks. Rom-com leads usually go from enemies to lovers, and it is wonderful to see the friendship stage actually broached for once.The film balances humour and wistfulness with heartbreaking despair, depths not usually covered by rom-coms, as Kathleen must watch all her efforts fail as she loses her mother's shop. It is also pleasing that Kathleen's relationship with boyfriend Frank comes to a natural end, rather than the usual dumping that goes on in such films, and both this relationship and that between Joe and girlfriend Patricia are cleverly set up to show why the couples are together, but that there is no possibility of the long term for them.However, the ending irritatingly sabotages You've Got Mail's chances of being a classic. Once Kathleen loses her shop, the film switches almost entirely to Joe's perspective, as he tries to become her friend. This throws off the delicate balance that has been the structure so far. And then the last scene, in which Kathleen waits to meet her anonymous lover and is presented with Joe, doesn't work. The 'surprise' tactic is tasteless, as is confirmed by Kathleen bursting into tears, not really the happy ending desired, but instead of these two witty, intelligent and deep people, so recently bitter enemies but now close friends, discussing the coincidence, irony and subterfuge of this situation, they kiss.One of the best rom-coms made, but the ending brutally stops it being perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello! Why did I watched this movie? First, when I heard about a remake of "The shop around the corner", I couldn't sleep until i get the DVD! Secondly, how can you miss a movie with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan performing in it! The answer is in your heart. And well, I've been looking for the DVD for so many hours that I finally found out I could buy it on the Internet on a VOD website... Cool, i thought.No... not cool: AMAZING. Norah Efron has just a gift. This movie isn't just another chick flick story. Norah efron made two comedic performances: Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.Look how she smiles, how he answers her, how he hesitates before writing an email, how she drinks her coffee All in all, this movie is the example of what must be a comedy today.Tom Hanks (two consecutive Oscars for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia) has appeared as a drama actor but is so amazing in a comedic role! And Meg Ryan, so natural.I think i've watched it 20 times. And I am only 17 years old... yep. And this Norah Efron movie must be her best. (actually her last movie HOLIDAY was really disappointing).Go and watch it! Bet you couldn't watch it more than 10 times!! ^^</fullReview>

Tom Hanks is one of my favorite leading men from that time frame. While I don't think he's that high on sex appeal, he is sincere, believable and quite funny. The supporting cast is also quite good in my opinion. I was surprised to see Jean Stapleton, but as always I thought her role was perfect for the movie. What a treat to actually see Dave Chappelle in a movie. I just love his brand of comedy. Dabney Coleman was another surprise. Where had he been prior to this? It had been quite a while since I had seen him. All in all, I really appreciated the cast and the wonderful roles they played in this movie. A must see if you haven't already!</fullReview>

Does anyone else notice that during the restaurant break-up scene when Frank says that nothing has happened between him and the TV interviewer, Kathleen says "oh f*ck", but it's dubbed over as "Frig". Then Frank says "I can't help my bone", but it's dubbed as "I can't help myself". Watch the lips! This realization kind of tarnished the whole fairy tale story for me, to tell you the truth.

		<fullReview>Well, I'm here because I'm doing an English course and they asked me to write on this space of Internet... We saw a part from this movie and then I saw it full at my home. I have to write here to express my opinion about it. After I saw this movie, I think I must be more careful than I am about Internet. Because Tom Hanks was a business neighbor of Meg. If he wanted he could take advantage of that situation to drive Meg to break her business. But it's very romantic, a very funny movie. And after I search for more information about this movie I found this "You've Got Mail is an American romantic comedy released in 1998 by Warner Brothers. It is a remake of the film The Shop Around the Corner (1940), in which two letter-writing lovers are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the co-worker with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. There was also a 1949 musical remake (In the Good Old Summertime) starring Judy Garland. You've Got Mail updates that concept to the use of e-mail. The name of the film is the greeting that American AOL users hear when they receive new e-mail. The film received significant media coverage leading up to its release in anticipation of the romantic coupling of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, who had appeared together previously in Joe vs. The Volcano (1990) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993)."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail is probably the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. It's smart funny, and romantic. The acting is top-notch, what with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks playing the lead roles. Tom and Meg have such a wonderful chemistry on screen; and they are both so cute! All the other actors are cute and funny too! The story is original and ironic. It tells the story of two people who fall in love online but hate each other in the real world. The music is GREAT, featuring fun and groovy soft rock that adds so much to the movie. Probably the best part about this movie is it's ending. It's the most romantic ending ever, it's so touching and funny and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. That's the only way I can describe it, but it's so much better that that! If you love romantic comedies or even if you don't, Watch You've Got Mail!!!! You'll love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining on line romance, but with messages &amp; flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is apparently somewhat a remake of the old 1940 film, Little Shop Around the Corner, updated to the computer age. Having not seen the original, I cannot compare though found this a breezy enough, entertaining little comedy romance. The stars, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, are as usual wonderful here, though for me, this venture didn't measure up to their earlier Sleepless in Seattle.It's a story that contrasts real life with the cyber world. Kathleen Kelly, the present owner of her late mother's little Manhattan children's bookshop, is having an affair but meanwhile corresponding on line with another man. Her e-mailing pen pal turns out to be (though unknown to her) none other than Joe Fox, the rather greedy, selfish son of the owner of a gigantic bookstore chain, Fox Books, which is moving into Kathleen's neighbourhood and putting her little family bookshop out of business. The pair are thus business rivals in the real world, but fall in love through their Internet correspondence. Joe eventually discovers the identity of Shopgirl (Kathleen) but not vice versa, so he sets out to befriend his pen pal in person.Not that this is intended as anything other than a cute little comedy romance, but the movie does have a couple of relevant messages. First, you never really know who's at the other end of cyber correspondence, so, as we're told to warn our kids, beware of who you might be revealing your life story and innermost thoughts to! Kathleen's on line pen pal is (apparently) quite a different person than the real life Joe Fox, and Kathleen of course has absolutely no idea as to whom she is pouring out her heart in these e-mails. Here, however, the point being made is that yes, the two really are one and the same person. Joe is simply revealing his more caring, sensitive side that doesn't normally show in his somewhat ruthless business dealings. He is not a one-dimensional, remorseless villain, thus making him actually quite a believable, realistic character.The other issue addressed is the extremely common tragedy in modern society of mega chain stores (with their huge stock and cheap prices) forcing closure of small family shops with their more personal service, cozy atmosphere, and limited but often more unique merchandise. Sadly, this happens in real life all the time.Of course there's a happy ending for this couple, but is it? Personally, I question whether or not Joe is really that right for Kathleen if, knowing how much her mother's shop means to her, he can still continue with the corporate dealings that force its closure, or how happy Kathleen will be longterm, realizing what her man has done. True, her employees will not be jobless but given positions with the new Fox superstore. However, it definitely won't be the same as the personal interactions they've been accustomed to with their former employer or the genuine interest these loyal folk have had in the success of Kathleen's little bookshop.All this being said regarding any deep meaning and the disappointing aspects of its ending, it is for the most part a pleasant, light hearted bit of fluff. These two stars are great on screen together and make for an entertaining little romance.</fullReview>

Internet romances are rare and certainly not predestined, although I loved this movie I do agree with a critic 'Hanks' acting is a little awkward after a long time between romantic roles but the film is exquisite because it creates empathy. Both the central protagonists's (Ryan and Hanks) are book lovers, so am I. Ryan (Kathleen) is very fond of Pride and Prejudice, as am I. The symbolism reminds the audience of what is important celebrating familial love, festivals and book shops. The songs are also very memorable and Christmasy. I couldn't resist this movie and if you like pride and prejudice or the godfather movies you will like this. There's something for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good-Natured Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoilersI have mixed feelings about the decision to relocate this film, a remake of the 1940 James Stewart film 'The Shop Around the Corner', from Hungary to America. On the one hand, the use of real-life New York locations generates a greater sense of place than was possible on a Hollywood studio set that was meant to represent Budapest but could equally well have stood in for Berlin or Birmingham, Boston or Baltimore. On the other, this relocation seems to symbolise the modern closing of the American mind- the belief that those portions of the world's surface unlucky enough to lie outside the boundaries of the United States are of no interest either to Hollywood or to the American public in general. Indeed, given that most films nowadays are intended for an international distribution, it seems that even non-Americans are expected to agree with the idea that America is intrinsically more interesting than any other country. It has been said that the average romantic comedy can be summed up by the mathematical formula a + b ? c = d, where 'a' equals 'boy loves girl', 'b' equals 'girl loves boy' and 'c' stands for an obstacle (or obstacles) to their love which must be overcome to achieve happy ending 'd'. That formula certainly applies to 'You've Got Mail', but the obstacles to be overcome are formidable; the girl and boy not only love each other, but also hate each other. In addition, both already have steady partners. Kathleen Kelly is the owner of a small children's bookshop in New York named, in homage to the earlier film, 'The Shop Around the Corner'. Kathleen sees herself as being less a bookseller than a woman with a sacred mission to bring the joys of literature into children's lives. (Some actresses might have made such a character seem unbearably priggish, but Meg Ryan is able to invest her with her normal girl-next-door cuteness and make her seem likable and natural despite her high-minded sentiments). Kathleen has begun an e-mail correspondence over the Internet with an anonymous penfriend, and finds herself falling for this man. What she does not realize is that, in reality, the man she is corresponding with is Joe Fox, the millionaire owner of a chain of discount bookstores. A large Fox store has recently opened close to Kathleen's shop, threatening to put her out of business. Kathleen and Joe therefore regard each other as rivals, and when they meet in person they take an instant dislike to one another, not realising that they have been corresponding with each other under pseudonyms. In the David-and-Goliath struggle between Kathleen's small family shop and the huge business empire there is a surprising result; Goliath wins. (Surprising, that is, in terms of movie conventions, if not in terms of real life). Kathleen's shop is forced to close. One might have thought that this would have put an end to any possibility of romance between her and Joe, but from this point on the film becomes increasingly artificial as the obstacles to a happy ending miraculously disappear. Joe and Kathleen's existing relationships suddenly and painlessly come to an end without any hint of bitterness or resentment on either side, leaving our two protagonists free to discover that they really do love one another after all (surprise!) In the song (and generally in real life as well), 'breaking up is hard to do', but in this sort of film it is, when the plot demands it, as easy as falling off a log. Joe's girlfriend Patricia is, admittedly, a fairly minor character, but Kathleen's boyfriend Frank (a good performance from Greg Kinnear) is a more important one. Frank is an eccentric but idealistic left-wing journalist, who seems to have more in common with his fellow-idealist Kathleen than does Joe. The course of true love in romantic comedies, however, is determined less by compatibility than by the box-office, and it is nearly always the bigger-name star who gets the girl.Of the two main characters, it is Kathleen who seems the more satisfactory, largely because she is the more consistent. Tom Hanks is a practised hand at romantic comedy, but Joe's character is an odd mixture of ruthless businessman and likable average guy. 'Ruthless but likable' is a difficult combination for any actor to portray successfully, and Hanks, who always seems more at home with sympathetic characters than with unsympathetic ones, concentrates more on the latter element than on the former. Hanks may have been cast in the role because his screen persona is similar to that of James Stewart, who played the equivalent role in 'The Shop Around the Corner', or at least to Stewart's persona in the early part of his career. (In the fifties Stewart was able to broaden his range by playing characters who are, if not downright villainous, at least flawed or ambiguous- Howard Kemp in 'The Naked Spur' is a good example). There are a number of references in the film to Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' (Kathleen's favourite book), and there is an obvious parallel with that classic novel in that it too deals with love developing between two people who initially disliked each other. The film is no classic- in many ways it is a bog-standard formulaic romantic comedy- but it has plenty of good-natured charm and an attractive heroine which make it worth watching as an agreeable way of passing the time. Among Meg Ryan's romantic comedies 'You've Got Mail' is not in the same class as 'When Harry Met Sally', but is on a par with 'I.Q' or 'Sleepless in Seattle', and certainly superior to the seriously weird 'Prelude to a Kiss'. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've Gotta see this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks has delivered once again, this time he re-joins Meg Ryan for the third time. Fresh off "Saving Private Ryan" Tom Hanks portrays Joe Fox a bookstore owner looking to take over every bookstore in sight in order to make his the only one in town. He butts heads with Meg Ryan who portrays Kathleen Kelly, a small bookstore owner, called The Shop Around The Corner.One of the many great surprises for me about this film was the performance of Jean Stapleton as Birdie who adds with her witty humor and jokes. Greg Kinnear stars as Frank Navaski, Katkleen's boyfriend and a newspaper columnist, who has the sense of humor that takes this film to a new plateau.Since this movie is so good I don't want to give away many details but I can say when this movie hits its groove it gets better and better and by the time the movie is over people will not want to leave their seats."You've Got Mail" is a brilliantly directed film by Nora Ephron who worked with Hanks and Ryan in "Sleepless In Seattle." It seems as if Tom Hanks took over the role of director in the last thirty minutes of the movie; he does a wonderful job at doing this. The best part of the whole entire movie comes in the final scene and the dialogue between the actors involved with that scene; with that scene the whole movie is tied together. "You've Got Mail" is a tremendously well-done and brilliantly put together film and worth everyone's while to sit and relax for 120 min.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rehash of "Sleepless In Seattle"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tuned into this film tonight after its opening titles had elapsed so was not sure of its title.For a while I thought I was watching its earlier incarnation as per my title.Even the walkways of the marina were similar confusing me and of course the primary plot was the same.I do not like films which stretch one's credulity too far unless it is out and out fantasy fiction.1.You have to believe out of all the people in the world these two correspond by internet chatroom to each other but actually live virtually next door to each other - one coincidence too far!2.A woman customer breaks down in tears when reminiscing in Meg Ryan's bookshop about reading "Anne of Green Gables" in the days when Meg's mother was its owner!!3.Tom Hanks gave many clues of his real identity after she was "stood up" at the initial restaurant rendezvous as her internet chat room pal, yet Meg Ryan consistently did not "suss" who he really was until the last scene. 4.Their respective present partners showed no compatibility to each other and it made we wonder what they saw in each other in the first place to actually marry them.In a way I was more interested in their fate as we all knew MR and TH would end up together almost from the off.5.Despite knowing Meg Ryan's love of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" Tom Hanks seemed particularly inept on several occasions even knowing the faintest plot or motivation of the central characters of this book.(I would have at least done a bit of homework first before sending off my latest transmission)This and other irritating events disturbed my sense of logic throughout the film.Yet it is rare for something to be either wholly good or bad and there were a few bright flourishes which amused me.One was the rather pretentious prose used by Meg Ryan's partner when he types a phrase to her on his old fashioned electric typewriter while in her presence.Incidentally by 1998 were not people generally using word processors? And why is it that all film actors in scenes involving typing can do 120 w.p.m.? I thought the plot was just too "pat" for my liking and the finale was telegraphed a 100 miles away.Notwithstanding my criticism, I did enjoy most of it but certainly not as much as the original in my title.Generally I find sequels a let down as Hollywood producers just cannot resist repeating a successful formula, although I do concede the two principal actors do have chemistry together on screen so I understand why it was produced.I rated it 6/10 compared to the present values of 6.7 for SIS and 6.2 for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that the powers that be were trying to create another Sleepless in Seattle. This film doesn't have the chemistry that Sleepless had. The two major stars here, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, work together well and the story is a good one, but this film just lacks the intimacy of Sleepless. On a positive note, the story, as I said, is a good one. Business rivals fall for each other via the Internet, not knowing that they are competitors. The acting is pretty good from everyone. On it's own, it might had done better. Had I not seen Sleepless first, I'd have probably rated this film higher. Overall, a slight disappointment for me but still a fairly decent flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think that "You've Got Mail" is that great of a movie, but it's certainly not as bad as the critics say. The romance gets cheesy at times, but what Meg Ryan romantic comedy doesn't?Besides, there is good comic relief from Dave Chappelle, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey and Steve Zahn. Not to mention some funny scenes involving Tom Hanks' character and his 'aunt' and 'brother'.Still, I thought the ending was too much like every other romantic comedy (the two lovers meet and kiss, the end). Can we just once see an ending of a romantic comedy that doesn't involve kissing and hugging?Probably not, 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gentle, charming little movie, `You've Got Mail' is a comprehensive, original and likeable romantic comedy with a good scenario. One of the better rom-coms as of late and the best film yet pitching Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (not that there's been many). However, there are some all-to-unavoidable flaws. There isn't that much humour present and for the most part, it substitutes charm for wit. It's never funny enough to make you laugh but it's never sentimental enough to really be taken seriously. Also, the film is too long. At 125 minutes, it would have been better had it been re-edited and packed the best bits into a welcome 90-minute fare. Thankfully, it isn't too cushy and sentimental and can be compared to modern life. Who better to cast as the two leads than Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks? They have that easy-on-the-eye quality that makes them a convincing couple. They also seem human in their respective roles and are convincing as business enemies aswell. The supporting cast isn't as fantastic but they hold the film together and most of them are good. Greg Kinnear was well cast as Meg Ryan's nerdy boyfriend. Unfortunately, Parker Posey doesn't really have much chemistry with Tom Hanks. Whether that's intentional or not? I don't know. Steve Zahn isn't usually suited to this sweet style of romance, but he's still a good (if not the only) source of comic relief.Given the scenario, predictability is inevitable but the fact that it takes till the very last scene for the realisation to occur is a bit of a drag. Usually in movies of this calibre, the premise occurs about three quarters the way through the movie. It's even a bit annoying the way it's made so blindingly obvious. But it's still an easily enjoyable and rather amusing little story. It doesn't push the limits of cinematic possibilities, but it's very good for what it's worth. I give it a 6.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite liked some bits and some characters but other bits were cringy, which made it hard to watch. I particularly hated the "clownish" faces from Hanks and Ryan; everyone else acted in a fairly believable way, but the acting and scenarios between the two main characters were just too hard to believe, especially in a fairly 'real-world" context. OK, it's a light comedy probably not aimed at me, and I've never been so keen on US romantic comedy. The email / bookshop approach worked I thought, but it left me with too many questions, and all Hanks' character's evilness and trickery made it hard for it to work with him as the romantic "winner" (is that a spoiler, or is it totally obvious?). All very two dimensional, but maybe that's what light romantic comedies are supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilersTom Hanks and Meg Ryan - the 3rd round. Their first film "Joe versus the volcano" (1990) was an adventure/love- story with a touch of fantasy - a flop, unfortunately. Just for one reason: it came out in summer 1990, and they didn´t have a chance against "Pretty woman". In 1993 they had a 2nd chance in "Sleepless in Seattle" - a blockbuster which was released in the same month as "Jurassic Park". Possibly the most romantic comedy of the 90´s! The movie had its own charme, just because it was so old-fashioned! And now "You´ve got mail" - also directed by Nora Ephron - which continues the tradition of "Sleepless in Seattle". I guess the expectations were high. And these expectations were not ecxeeded - but satisfied! The happy ending of "Sleepless..." was more magic, because Tom and Meg didn´t meet until the end, while the happy ending of "You´ve got mail" in the park was maybe a bit too calculated - but who cares? Nevertheless it´s a damned cute movie! It´s not better than "Sleepless in Seattle" - which had even more "sugar" - but very close too it!Sweet, heartwarming fluff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this romantic comedy, You've Got Mail, I studied the character of Joe Fox, owner of the notorious Fox Books chain store. We are first introduced to the guy by indirect presentation by way of an email that he is writing to some woman. He is a wealthy businessman who lives in an upscale apartment in New York.He is very motivated by making money for his business and is continually stating that in business your attitude should be one of `it's not personal, it's business.' For this reason he is a stock character.After some time he discovers that the woman that he has been emailing, is the same woman who he has put out of business and he plays with her mind not letting her know who he is. In the end he wins her over and they end in a stereotypical happy ending with them living happily ever after.Tom plays an average businessman but comes to realize there is more to life then just business.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You've Got Mail" features quite possibly the greatest screen couple in movie history. With all due respect to Bogart/Bacall, Gable/Leigh, and even Astair/Rogers, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are positively the cutest, most down to earth, and real couple in movies. Their magical chemistry onscreen made "Sleepless In Seattle" one of the most romantic movies in recent memory, and even made a stinker like "Joe and the Volcano" watchable.They reunite in "You've Got Mail", a remake of the 1940's film "The Shop Around The Corner". Hanks plays Joe Fox, a businessman with the family company, Fox Books Superstores, In the business world, Joe is ruthless to the core, savvy and professional, laying waste to smaller businesses without a thought or concern. It's just business, he says, nothing personal. However he has a soft romantic side too, as evidenced by a growing online romance via email.Meg Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, a small bookstore owner who is running the longtime store after the death of her mother. She is both sentimental and timid, openly unconcerned about the arrival of Fox Books into her neighborhood, but privately very concerned that the superstore will shut her down. She too has that romantic side, as her online romance with Joe (unknown to her, of course) continues to grow.Of course, the two cannot stand each other in person, constantly trading jabs and insults anytime they are in the same vicinity.Hanks and Ryan are just so cute, and work together so well, that you let the slightly sappy and weak plot envelop you. You truly relate to these characters, almost as if they are your very own family. Hanks and Ryan have a tendency to do that, they can make you feel like you actually know the characters, and that is why they work so well together.The supporting cast is very strong, and led by the incomparable Jean Stapleton. Her Birdie was a friend of Kathleen's mother, and is still at the bookstore today helping Kathleen through the pains of the job. Greg Kinnear is Frank Navasky, an op/ed writer for a local paper who is more than a bit full of his own self-righteousness. Good characterization though, and you never really wish the guy wasn't there. Parker Posey has a similar role as Patricia Eden, Joe's self-important girlfriend. She works in a publishing house and is little more than a barrier from which Joe has to break through to get to Kathleen. Steve Zahn plays George Pappas, a longtime employee of Kathleen's. This guy could end up being one of the great character actors of our time. Maybe not quite enough to carry a movie as primary star (although "Happy, Texas" just opened here), but like Paul Giamatti, you recognize him the second you see him.There are more, Dabney Coleman for starters, but lets just say that all do well with their parts, and only add a touch of feeling to the whole preceedings."You've Got Mail" is an interesting look at what future romances could be, is a very cute, engaging, and yes, romantic movie.3 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meg Ryan has always been a pretty face. Still you can see the subtle changes of her features over the years. In "Armed and Dangerous" of 1986, her pretty face was more school-girlish. In "When Harry Met Sally" of 1989, her pretty face was radiant and gorgeous. In "Sleepless in Seattle" of 1993, her pretty face was that of a beautiful mature woman. In "You've Got Mail", her pretty face was more angular because she had lost weight. With minimal make-up, she came across as a very fresh, adorable, natural beauty. It is this pretty face that I loved the most.And then those cute mannerisms, she truly captured my heart and many others' too. Many times this cuteness was exaggerated, but hey, it's ok. It's a movie, for entertainment. Enjoy it rather than critique it.I replayed many many times the part starting from Tom Hanks going to Meg Ryan's apartment with the daisy to start "tweaking his project", to the end of the movie. The section was purely one on one between Hanks and Ryan. I wish they lengthened this section. I also wish they lengthened the end where Ryan finally met Hanks the "NY152" email pen-pal for the first time, and of course Hanks the "Fox". I think the writer/director could make the ending more touching, say adding some reminiscence of old email, etc., to show again for the last time the bonding effect those email had on the both of them. They could also show more of Ryan's bitter-sweet reactions/ dialogues for being strung along by Hanks when he hid his "NY152" identity.I enjoy this movie thoroughly. I just hope they will re-issue the film, via videos if not the cinemas, incorporating the above wishes. I think this film, as it stands now, will become a classic. With the additions wished for, I think the film can become a "great" classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Romantic Comedy of the Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This enchanting film staring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks has to be one of the best movies of the summer. Meg and Tom starred in an equally successful blockbuster called "Sleepless in Seattle" Both of these movies have humor and romance. "You've Got Mail" has hidden messages that are surprisingly hilarious. At one point during the movie, Kathleen (Meg Ryan) and Joe (Tom Hanks), are at the market in New York and Kathleen is telling Joe about the man she is talking to through e-mail. Joe asks for his screen name and Kathleen gives it to him, NY152. So Joe and Kathleen spend the entire afternoon trying to figure out what the "152" stands for. Most of their ideas are quite funny. Another chuckle worthy part, was when Kathleen was waiting for her boyfriend to leave the house so she could get on America Online. As soon as the door shuts she goes to look through the peep hole. As soon as he disappears from sight, she goes to the window. She watches him come down the steps, walk down the street, and turn the corner, before she runs to her computer, to sign on, to her those powerful words, "You've got mail!" This energetic film is also very romantic. In the beginning, Joe and Kathleen are enemies because Kathleen owns a charming children's book store and Joe owns a huge discount book store that is trying to take over. Both know there are feelings there, but want to to deny it. Over e-mail one day, Joe sends Kathleen at letter about how he loves New York in the fall and if he knew who she was, he would send her a bouquet of freshly sharpened pencils. You see, at this time, Joe and Kathleen have no idea who the other person it is that they are talking to through e-mail. When they met online, they decided not to include anything personal. Joe doesn't know he's talking to Kathleen, and Kathleen doesn't know she is talking to Joe. Another romantic part is when Kathleen is sick and Joe goes to her apartment to try to apologize and become friends. He brings her a fresh bouquet of daises, her favorite flower, and makes her tea. How Romantic! "You've Got Mail" is a wonderful movie for all ages. It has a simple plot, but has many unexpected turns and twists. It is easy to understand, but everyone applies different feelings towards it. I think it is one of the best romantic comedies of the year and if you havn't seen it, I suggest you do! -Meguire SRVHS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great film and I loved it. I saw it twice at the cinema. The first time with my mum and the second time by myself. I watched it again on August 24th when it came out on video. I always thought it was funny, cute and smart. But also mushy. I have to say it should have been the other way around instead of the guy always being the big one! Also, too much snogging at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The heart of this film is in exactly the right place. You want it to be a winner, and it so nearly is. Meg Ryan is as splendid as ever playing the part of the girl next-door (I bet she hates that label!) and the chemistry between her and the businessman Tom Hanks is both funny and believable. In fact, it is all going swimmingly until the big problem arrives. The plot and the script are top notch, but they can't cope with the big problem. The pace of the film and the directing are excellent, but big problem knocks them down. The whole thing is cruising to its happy ending until BP leaps in. I feel a little guilty saying it because you may not have noticed and, therefore, may have watched the film happily oblivious. But once you realise just how much Tom Hanks is starting to look like the young Richard Nixon the more impossible it is to watch this film as it was intended! Sorry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of such Ephron films as WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE. YOU'VE GOT MAIL left me cold. The two main characters, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have chemistry more like a brother and sister than two romantic leads. The story was rather stilted and the more boring it became, the higher they cranked up the music. I thought the small New York neighborhood bookstore angle was charming,and Nora Ephron has a way with words which made some of the lines funny. I found myself getting restless before the end, a sure sign that this film just didn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film could have been a lot funnier and a lot warmer. With the explosion of the internet and e-mail, the film was perfectly timed. However, the plot could have been better scripted to highlight the humorous aspects of an online romance.All of the characters were too neurotic, including the characters played by Hanks and Ryan. Due to these neuroses, it was hard to judge what the love interests' hearts were really made of? Was it their musings posted via e-mail? Or was it their cold daily behavior?When the big connection came, I was unconvinced that it was true love and meant to be. Entertaining and a great date movie, but this film lacked the substance of Sleepless in Seattle. I rate it a disappointing 6 stars.</fullReview>

"You've Got Mail" is filled with the romance that the typical Hanks/Ryan fluff is missing (f.e. They didn't even kiss in "Sleepless" for God's sake!). It amazes me that after working together on so many projects, Hanks and Ryan can still submit a believable chemistry onto the screen; but boy can they ever! The plot was adorable and the movie itself was a sweet, ironic, whole-hearted romance which finally produced a pairing of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan that is definitely worth watching. It was probably the second-best movie of the year ("Stepmom" of course was first), providing a little joy for everyone. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute but disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meg Ryan remains intensely cute (I don't mean that disparagingly), and Tom Hanks is a fine actor. Delia and Nora Ephron are incredibly funny. While the movie starts well, though, Joe Fox, the character played by Tom Hanks, is too large a jerk to make Meg's love for him close to believable. Maybe the problem is that most of his charming e-mails are things we read early in the movie; by the end, he's spent a fair amount of their on-line time giving her business advice based on the Godfather. (Mattress-talk, as it were, but not pillow-talk.) It is also remarkable, and unfathomable, that at no point does she express anger with the fact that he has known who she is in non-virtual life for months and has led her on in e-mail as though he still didn't know her. That might not be unforgivable, but wouldn't it at least inspire a flash of anger, not a kiss? Maybe that is supposed to be what happens after the movie ends, but it would have been more sensible if she'd been outraged for just a few seconds. . . .Lastly, I found several things ironic. I was watching the movie in my small town in a (chain-owned) movie theater located between a local bookstore and the newly-arrived national chain bookstore. And the AOL and Starbucks logos appear about every 2 minutes in this film supposedly decrying the destruction of small business by big business. I wanted to know whether--and how much--they'd paid the producers for the billing.</fullReview>

(Spoiler Warning) When Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) walks into The Shop Around the Corner a small childern's bookstore run by Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), he tells her that a boy is his brother and the girl is his aunt, "Matt is my father's son, and Annabel is my grandfather's daughter". As the movie opens, Joe Fox's bookstore Fox and Sons is about to open its doors in the state of New York. While on-line Fox has meet Kathleen Kelly but doesn't her name and she doesn't know his, or anything but him, so for Fox. They start e-mailing each other and instant message each other as well. But once they meet, they become rivals. At first Kathleen doesn't know that Joe is the new owner of the new store oepning up as few blocks for her bookstore. Dabney Coleman plays Joe's father Nelson Fox. And Greg Kinnear appears as Kathleen's boyfreind (who looks like Richard Roeper). But remember Kathleen and Joe don't know they have been e-mailing and instant messaging each other. This is a great movie to watch and remember "You've Got Mail". 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen and loved the original movie on which this is based, the amazing "Shop Around the Corner," and being a fan of movies that spoof modern culture, I was prepared to like "You've Got Mail." I wasn't prepared for it to be such a disappointment. There were some enjoyable things about it, which I'm sure you'll read about in other reviews, but far fewer that I would expect for all the star power put into this. In fact, it felt like the author and filmmakers decided that as long as they had the star power, they could cheat a little on the other stuff, and they did - especially if you kept waiting for the wonderful, revelatory scenes from the original that you thought were coming. A funny subplot about both of the stars' respective mates, played by Greg Kinnear and Parker Posey, who are good but wasted, is started and then inexplicably dropped. All the surprises have been taken out of this version -- in fact, when the climactic scene occurs where Meg Ryan discovers her secret pen pal, it's flat, and the way the plot's conflict is resolved feels like one big sellout.There was one thing I respected this movie for, and it was the theme that it never works to be cruel to anyone, even your enemies. The theme is not just stated, it's dramatized well in a couple of touching scenes with Ryan and Hanks. But with that kind of a message, I would expect a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Media say that the film is as good as Sleepless in Seattle (1993), comparing the two films easily since the pair is the same (Hanks and Ryan) and they are both written and directed by Nora Ephron (amongst others also written and directed Michael (1996), This Is My Life (1992) and written My Blue Heaven (1990), When Harry Met Sally (1989), Silkwood (1983)). I am not going to discuss here either Ephron's abilities as a writer or director, or Hanks' and Ryan's acting talents, all well proven. Still, the film is terribly cheesy, unbearably predictable, shockingly boring, JUST LIKE SLEEPLESS !!! So, the comparison stands, YES, the two films are comparable (in boredom) and hugely inferior to When Harry Met Sally (1989) of the same genre, romantic comedy allow me to say, but with much more comedy and romance and an equally clever plot. I guess Tom Hanks will never forgive the superb Billy Crystal in When Harry Met Sally. And a lot of us will still bet it was Hanks in When Harry Met Sally, BUT HE WASN'T!To conclude, if you like the genre see again When Harry Met Sally instead of wasting time and money for You've Got Mail. It will soon be out on video anyway. Because I like Ephron, Hanks and Ryan anyway, 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

I think it's insulting to women today to think she would just cave in and fall in love after he destroyed her life.Plus I didn't think it was very funny about cheating on your mate on the computer. Are we so hardened these days that betrayal is cute?Another thing is the age of the protagonists. Meg Ryan is very attractive, but she is hardly an ingenue. Hanks' face is actually puffy, either from overweight or age. I think the plot would have worked better with younger actors. And the betrayals wouldn't have seemed so awkward if the actors were younger.The other thing that bothered me about the movie was the sad fact that we are so lonely we would actually have a love affair on a computer.

		<shortDescription>Nora Ephron can do better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago I loved the book and film Heartburn. So I was delighted to take my next door neighbour (Laura, age 11) to see this latest effort by Nora Ephron. I was very disappointed. Somehow, I wouldn't have thought this writer/director would make a screen hero out of Meg Ryan's character. So wholesome, so pretty, so polite, and loyal to her staff and her mother's memory. Her biggest problem is that she can't be horrible and stick up for herself, which is of course why she is so lovable. Blecch. Aren't movie-goers generally fed up with female actors who look sexy and adorable even when they have a disgusting flu? This is one of those films where every surface is polished, the children are endearing and cute, and the email connection only ever takes .5 seconds. Mind you, I can forgive Tom Hanks his tedious virtues, largely because I am never going to see Saving Whosywhatsit. He is proof that male actors don't have to be perfectly photogenic in every scene to be the object of my desire. The other male lead got off badly, as did political correctness. The contempt heaped upon his efforts to be ideologically sound was balanced by the best performer in the show, the supposedly bitchy wicked witch of a girlfriend Tom's character dumped. She was great, and all the better for the relief she provided from the worst excesses of American sugar coatings. Come to think of it, I suppose that is the role of the baddie. It's the story that's so mundane. Even Laura thought the film "was missing something". "Dramatic tension" I suggested. She didn't argue. This is a film of NO SURPRISES! There is one great thing about this film. The opening sequence and the introduction to New York felt authentic and I loved the feeling I was visiting the city. This is a pretty dubious commendation, as I haven't even been to the northern hemisphere, let alone NYC.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or a romantic comedy masquerading as liberal garbage? Nora Ephron's ultra-formulaic schmaltz-"comedy" has only Meg Ryan to thank that it didn't turn into an even bigger disaster. Ryan steals the show with her new-and-improved lips, but unfortunately there is very little to steal here ? and it's not much of a show. (And the lips are fake, after all.) Her charm is the only credible and consistent thing in this sickeningly "sweet" tale full of left-wing moralizing. Ephron, the Hollywood Establishment nepotistic moron that she is, just couldn't refrain from contaminating the script with her irrational, dogmatic political views. Hello, this is supposed to be a romantic comedy! All of the cliché liberal nonsense is in here: 1) the Rosenbergs 2) Giulliani winning the election 3) all that boring stuff about Capitalism being so evil... Yeah, Ehpron and Hanks hate money so very much.Yawn!...Ephron is the prototype of a dumb, ugly middle-aged American airhead who thinks that astrology is a science and that Christopher Columbus was an evil Hungarian who ate little children.She makes Ryan's favourite author to be bleepin' Jane Austin, who is one of the most overrated writers in the Western hemisphere. I was forced to read that garbage in school - and I'm still full of hate for that spinster's empty-headed scribblings! But yeah, someone like Meg probably WOULD read Austen in the real world - if only she knew hot to read. "Pride &amp; Prejudice" is the 19th century equivalent of Mexican TV soaps.What is so bad about Hanks's store taking over Ryan's snobbish, over-priced piece of crap little store? Since when is it okay to defend expensive books? Expensive books are the first step towards mass illiteracy. (I know, for I live in Serbia where this is exactly the case.) The movie's already pitiful humour is constantly assaulted and made even more unbearable by Ephron's onslaught of liberal propaganda. To make things worse, that idiot Greg Kinnear once again plays an annoying PC a*****e.Last but not least, there is something inherently annoying about Hanks typing on a computer. I don't know why, but seeing him type made me angry. It made me want to become like that fictional Hungarian Columbus and kill someone. Actually, Hanks doing ANYTHING makes you want to throw him out of the nearest window. This film needs to be nuked. Where the hell is the Pentagon?</fullReview>

From Meg Ryan making funny faces to Tom Hank's attempt at being a charming bastard. It's a film for non-discriminating yuppies whose idea of a hard life would be having to deal with a cafe latte with whole milk instead of nonfat.Absolutely disgusting on every level. I get nauseated thinking about the smugness of the cast and crew who actually thought they made a worthwhile film.</fullReview>

It doesn't show the net's potential for love. But what can you expect if the movie wants to fascinate the group of millions; you tend to forget the truth and even better; the importance of details!

		<fullReview>This two hour advertisement for Starbucks and AOL was not only predictable and boring, I found myself utterly frustrated with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks' chemistry. They seemed to be struggling through much of the movie, especially Ryan, who seemed uncomfortable in her role. It seemed obvious that they were "acting" and that this was a "movie". Most frustrating, however, was the plot and writing. After Tom Hank's character runs Meg Ryan out of business and while continually lying to her, why on earth did Meg Ryan's character give him the time of day?? I found myself wanting to yell at the screen "He's an evil man! Be strong and and fight for what you believe!!". Alas, that didn't happen. One of the worst movies I have seen.</fullReview>

She made me nauseous, she made me irritable, she made me want to haul off and kick something, or better yet, somebody. I saw the equally bad "Hurlyburly" the next weekend and resolved to buy it the second it arrives on video--perhaps I will purchase a DVD player for the occasion--just so I can rewind and replay for hours on end the scene in which Chazz Palminteri throws her out of a speeding car.</fullReview>

Then there's Starbucks, Visa, Borders, and who knows what else. Not to mention that the whole movie was sappy and boring. I can't believe Tom Hanks agreed to take the leading role in this movie. Oh, and did anyone else notice that this is similar to Sleepless in Seattle? Of course you did.

		<fullReview>I'm very hard on this movie, as evidenced by the rating. But don't mistake that to mean that I think this movie is poorly done. On the contrary, Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and Nora Ephron can be counted on to perform very well. The issue here is that this is a movie that does not learn from its inspiration. The film was obviously intended to revisit themes touched on by "Sleepless in Seattle", but goes on to entirely miss the point of its previous incarnation. If there's one thing I detest in a movie, especially one I had to see in a theater, it's a complete repeat experience.My verdict: Skip this movie and watch "Sleepless in Seattle" instead.

		<shortDescription>Sweeter Love Story than the 1940's original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a little ashamed to say that I prefer this version rather than Ernst Lubitsch original 1940 "The shop around the corner". Although I'm an eager old movies fan and usually detest all kinds of remakes, this one is an exception. The Stewart-Sullavan couple does not compare to the chemistry between Hanks and Ryan. James Stewart is a favorite of mine but Sullavan was disagreeable and I despised her. In this lovely remake, I felt sorry for Meg Ryan's character but couldn't help falling for Tom Hank's "Joe Fox" charms. The love story is very sweet and although it's not flawless, in the original I couldn't find a single good thing about Sullavan's character and found myself very angry when she said she had been mean to Stewart simply because "I'd just finished a novel about a glamorous French actress. When she wanted to arouse a man's interest, she treated him like a dog. " In addition, in the original they only mentioned the love-hate bickering while in this one you can fully enjoy the quarreling.All in all, a very sweet modern romantic comedy, not flawless but a perfect feel-good film.</fullReview>

It might be an hour and a half long extension of the London tube dating service advert, with commuters passing each other on an escalator (in fact the ships-in-the-night story is that of an earlier film, namechecked as a shop). It is a franchise sequel to Sleepless in Seattle. It is a little toecurling ('those three little words... You've Got Mail!').But it has a charm, not least through the two leads. It does have an undeniably romantic kick - by that largely due to Hanks suddenly injecting the only note of taking anything seriously (Meg Ryan plays a character whose business is run into the ground - and never gets upset about it. That's fine here though)Despite the 100% expectation-fulfillment there is a lot of posturing to pad out the plot and that expectation requires occasional belief suspension - not necessarily mutually inclusive in a romcom.

		<shortDescription>NYC Tourism, pre 9/11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care who you are.....you cannot dislike Tom Hanks, or even think that this movie is totally a chick flick. It's a whimsical movie that paid a high tribute to NYC. This movie was put out prior to September 11, 2001. It was the kind of movie that you watched, and suddenly wanted to go to New York and take a look around the upper west side and see for yourself it's mysteries, and rituals.Remember when an instant message would startle you? Remember when you wandered into chat rooms and actually enjoyed doing so? Remember when you could spend hours and hours online and not think about the damage to your circulatory system? Yeah, me too! Now post 9/11 and post dial up connection for many of us, we watch the movie and marvel at how stark the AOL program looks. We see them dial up and think.....yeah, once that was the only way to connect.We watch this movie, and we look for glimpses of the World Trade Centers. We know that building them back will eventually happen, but nothing will ever replace the way those buildings stood, and the majestic and formidable skyline that they painted for Manhatten. Those of us who are avid readers marvel at the books that are introduced in the movie, and smile recalling our days of youth when we read those same classic children's books.We discover New York in the fall, and it's crispness. We see New York in the spring, and marvel out how much more alive everything seems no matter what time of the year it is. We see glimpses of winter, but even that does not deter the largest city in the USA from tourism, shopping, and daily strife. We get a sense of career driven people that seem to live, eat, breathe, and sleep work. Even to see them at a social gathering shows that they are there to make important contacts or be noticed in some sense of the word. We see a character who is an absolute introvert--that being Frank. We see the extroverted Meg Ryan trying to hold the relationship together, and not really sure why. Then we see what happens, and because she is not able to write boring narcissistic Frank off, she turns to the "dream of someone else" and discovers that there is nothing more powerful than the written word.Modern technology in the internet has brought us back to the power of the written word. We can churn out notes, and communications quicker this way than by writing and mailing them via snail mail. Still this revelation is not without some hang ups. The internet legally is still etching the boundaries of what is permissible. In addition, there is a whole new breeding ground for trouble and perversion. Still, watching You've Got Mail is a positive and cheerful side to this stunning technology. It is a testament to the ever improving world of software, computers, communication, and life in general, while still holding onto the foundation of strong literary skills and classic books.This movie holds a place of honor on my video shelf!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally had the displeasure of seeing this movie. I waited until it was on TV and thought I might as well get it over with. I'll admit, Tom Hanks is a great actor but his name has carried some awful mainstream movies. This is no exception. Based on the play and subsequent movie, The Shop Around the Corner (1940), the plot and background story is changed drastically. There is little on-screen chemistry between Hanks and Ryan here and even character inconsistency within the movie itself. Then, with this story so different than the original, they copied a couple of scenes almost word for word and it came off so disjointed. Tom Hanks is no Jimmy Stewart and Meg Ryan no Margaret Sullavan. With few exceptions (eg. Maureen Stapleton), the supporting cast offered no help. They were more annoying than the stars. Again, a sharp contrast with the original where there were a couple of very witty subplots and extremely interesting side characters. For the sake of the author of the story, Miklos Lazslo, please see The Shop Around the Corner for some real sizzle and romance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sappy romance with overlooked potential to be charming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nora Ephron shamelessly rehashes her other popular sap-fest, Sleepless in Seattle, which in turn was a shameless rehash of the great neo-classic When Harry Met Sally.Two quick points:a) Tom Hanks is one of the most overrated actors in Hollywoodb) Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks repeatedly team up for hopelessly saccharine romances that never seem to work, mainly because of Hanks' complete lack of appeal.Fact: I have rarely seen a Hanks film I liked. Splash, Bachelor Party, Philadelphia, Sleepless in Seattle, Cast Away to name a few. And those are just the decent ones; he's made a deluge of absolutely horrid films as well (can you say Joe Versus the Volcano? Turner and Hooch? Forrest Gump??). Here he's as unappealing as ever.So why do his movies make so much money? Simple: the average movie-goer sees someone as useless as Hanks getting into Meg Ryan's bed and they figure 'if he can do it *anyone* can!' This film has few saving graces. Meg Ryan plays herself. She's hardly the world's greatest actress (and she'll never top her performances in When Harry Met Sally and Hurly Burly) but her smile could melt steel and her charisma carries her a long way. Also, three strong co-star performances helped to ease the pain of the rest of the poor acting. Always fabulous Jean Stapleton steals the show here; charming, elegant, well- spoken...she's simply a pleasure to watch. Indie-queen Parker Posey (who happens to be one of my fav actresses) also gives a great, though under-cut, performance. Steve Zahn is really amusing in his role as Ryan's slightly spaced-out employee. (Why Posey and Zahn decided to follow-up Suburbia with this film I'll never know...) And finally, the always amusing Dave Chappelle gave another solid performance and outshined Hanks in each of their scenes together.All in all, the supporting cast helped to make this film watchable, and some of the dialogue was quite clever. But the premise was generic, and when the sappiness started my teeth began to ache. (quote: "I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be you so badly!!") Unfortunately, cheeze overcomes any hint of quality. 5/10.</fullReview>

"You've Got Mail" wasn't successful in making me feel depressed.2.

Marketed as a kind of sequel to "Sleepless In Seattle" (which I did like), this one starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan was almost certain to succeed. That it did, and it took no chances, repeating almost everything about Sleepless, but with a far less compelling story. The couple destined to be together begin the film enemies. Ryan owns a small bookstore; Hanks represents a large chain which threatens to put her out of business. After building up this conflict, the film makes no attempt to resolve it. Also, both start out involved with other partners; both Mr. and Ms. Wrong (played by Parker Posey, one of my favorite actresses) are dumped of course, and it's all too quick and painless. I suppose this movie is OK as harmless fluff, but what I saw as the emotional insincerity of it really bothered me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Romantic Comedy that Goes Sour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like romantic comedies and this one had a promising start. The feel of New York during the holidays felt cozy. The characters started out in the usual way in this type of film and felt like an old glove, very comfortable. There is the typical series of coincidences, embarrassing missteps and chance encounters as the romance unfolds. You've Got Mail is well made and acted and was very enjoyable for a while until it went very wrong.At the mid point of these kinds of films there is often a serious sometimes even tragic moment. But it is always a personal tragedy. In You've Got Mail the heavy story involves big business vs. small business. It then slides into lobbying, media manipulation, community activism and preserving old neighborhoods. Yikes! It felt like 60 Minutes.After all this I was waiting for someone in the film to file a lawsuit and a possible courtroom drama. This was no longer a story of romance for me. But the most incredible, grotesque thing is that the victim, the sympathetic character, the person whose life long dream is crushed is somehow made to live "happily ever after" with the eventual villain of the story. Such a thing would not only not happen in real life but would not occur in a romance. It is more appropriate to the cold plot twists in a film such as The Player.After several weeks since seeing You've Got Mail and giving it some thought, I am still amazed that such a confused script with its ridiculous ending was made into a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This cute little romance features Meg Ryan and flavor-of-the-month. In general "You've Got Mail" is warm, amusing, and cuddly. Would we expect anything else from Ryan?The acting is good enough, though honestly Ryan should be able to do this kind of movie in her sleep by now. Likewise, Tom Hanks just acts like his funny, lovable self and it works. Parker Posey deserves a shout-out for her role as the selfish, materialistic yuppie. I admire her for her willingness to repeatedly play negative characters.The plot and characters are somewhat cliche, but I'll admit that there were some nice, funny lines ("Soon it will be something really depressing. Like a 'Baby Gap'").Unfortunately, the last quarter of the movie ruined it for me.**SPOILERS AHEAD**In short, the ending wrapped everything up a little too cleanly. I understand that there was supposed to be a certain time transition (and perhaps the film makers failed to convey this transition), but Maggie overcame her hatred of Joe quite quickly. One second she is determined to beat this sinister, heartless, corporate jackal; the next second she calmly invites him into her house, talks with him, and suddenly starts going on strolls with him to the market and discussing her personal life with him.Yes, we expect these sudden turns in a Hollywood romance and it's true that Maggie's character is supposed to be especially forgiving, but in this case it simply undermines the depth of her character. Just before Maggie and Joe began their tentative flirtation, the movie had culminated in the closing of her store, an emotional blow to herself and her doomed quest. She then gives in to Joe so easily that it almost makes her seem fickle, or that perhaps the store (that her mother had started, and had warmed so many childrens' hearts, and was such a wonderful small business) really hadn't mattered to her very much afterall, that she had already forgotten about it. And I actually thought that the filmmakers did a rather GOOD job of portraying how devastated Maggie was after the closure. I'm not saying the PLOT was outright bad; I'm saying the pacing and transitions need work.I guess I'm more cynical than the movie makers. I find it hard to believe that a small mom-and-pop bookshop could even survive for 42 years in downtown New York. Furthermore I don't believe that a man as caring and conscientious as Joe could be a success in the corporate world. Sure I know that Joe's character was moved to CHANGE himself throughout the movie, but even early on, such as the scenes with the kids, he is shown as a kind-hearted, fun-loving man. To me this characterization just seems inconsistent with his role as a top corporate officer. I suppose a lot of this overanalysis is very subjective and depends on one's attitude towards big business, but hey, I'm just pointing out what seemed odd to me.On another note, why is breaking-up always so easy to do in movies? Half the break-ups end with "well, I don't love you either, so this is perfect!" As long as the protagonist is the one doing the breaking up in order to be with the co-star, it's okay and no one gets hurt. Filmmakers always seem to conveniently avoid the issue of an expendable character being devastated by a break-up (...although I recently saw "Addicted to Love," which explores exactly that issue, and ironically features Ryan again). I'm just ranting about this because there are about 43 instant, guiltfree breakups in this movie.** END SPOILERS **Finally, I just can't stand AOL, and couldn't get over the feeling that the movie was a huge advertisement for AOL. Sure, I know the brandname "AOL" was never explicitly mentioned, but everyone and everyone's mom knows that the featured e-mail sounds mean "AOL" by now. Interestly enough, the network showing I saw featured commercials from both AOL AND rival Netzero.Mind you, I'm not saying "You've Got Mail" was an AWFUL movie. I'm just saying that it was amusing and worth watching but overall flawed, fairly average, and unremarkable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In short, this movie fell short of the expectations one might have put to it. In part, this may be because there are so many similar romantic comedies out there that many of their aspects begin to seem too similar and purposeful to the viewer. One such aspect in this movie was the extended time at the beginning of the movie when the wonderfulness of the characters were introduced to the viewers in a lengthy exposition of Joe (Hanks) taking care of the children and Kathleen (Ryan) doing likewise with another bunch of children.My main problem, however, is with the ending of the movie, so SPOILERS ahead: The beginning parts of the movie worked pretty well until the time came to turn Joe and Kathleen into a couple. The part of the movie with their friendly meetings in cafes and on streets seemed rushed. Likewise, the last line in the movie was awful: "I so hoped that it would be you". If she had fallen in love with our average Joe, why did she go to the meeting place and not just? If she suspected that Joe was the mystery-man, why did she not confront him about it?The fact that Kathleen went to the meeting place should have told Joe that she had fallen in love with a fantasy and not the man that he really was (since they knew each other both ways). Perhaps this would have turned out a bit better with shorter time spent on building up the premise and longer on the actual 'falling in love and finding each other' part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it would certainly be a lie to say that 'You've got mail' is a movie one simply has to see... It would also be a lie to say that it is one of the best movies ever done... To be honest, it's just another romantic comedy and we all have seen enough of them. However, it's a very charming movie. Meg Ryan once again stars as everybody's darling and Tom Hanks is clean and nice as always (you don't really believe him the cold office-guy...). They do what they always do and act as they always act - and I like it. It's one of those movies you watch together with your partner on a cold winter's night, wearing woolen socks and drinking tea. Nothing special, but still very charming...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have great screen chemistry. All of their movies show it. And for the first three quarters of this film, they light up the screen. This is the third time this movie has been made. The first time, it was Ernst Lubitsch' THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER and a delight. The second time, it was IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME and Judy Garland's songs and a brief turn by Buster Keaton made it a delight.This time, however, despite a sharp beginning and middle, the movie collapses at the end. Nora Ephron's movies seem to do this all the time: you start to notice the easy manipulation of the audience, and then she rushes the ending to get it over with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's insanely predictable, overly sugary, and highly implausible, but darn it, You've Got Mail sure is a well made flick.The movie is designed to be pure confection. It's pretty simplistic--the characters aren't very deep, but they're played well by the cast. Believe me, you won't be doing much thinking throughout the ninety-plus minutes of the film.Basically, this is a movie you watch to get that cozy feeling all over. It's like a warm fuzzy blanket. If you want to feel a romantic charge, give this movie a chance. If you want gripping cinema, you're not going to get it here. This is a well crafted romantic comedy, plain and simple.Anyway, give this film a try. True, it works best in date situations, but watching it alone can be a hope-fueling endeavor. Just make sure you brush your teeth after viewing...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie scores points with a fairly unique and topical setting (the lovers meet via Internet chat rooms) as well as hiring the best American actor (Tom Hanks) and teaming him with Meg Ryan, but it promptly looses points by giving the actors sometimes very weak dialog and peppering in irritating product placements. Also comes the sad realization that these two very talented actors are a little too old to be doing this kind of role. Meg Ryan, whom I love dearly, looks silly as a ditzy 40 year old. This film works mostly, and if you want to watch this kind of film, sure, go rent it. So long as you've already seen Sleepless in Seattle and (better yet) When Harry met Sally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've Got Mail is a decent romantic comedy that's worth to watch a weekday night after a long day of work. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan come back on screen together after the succesful Sleepless in Seattle, but the feeling you get while watching the movie is of deja-vu. Same cliches, same plot line, same ending. The plot is simple: Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are huge rivals in business but they meet and fall in love over the internet, without knowing their names. This leads to a lot of pretty good scenes, but also pathetic ones, especially those in which they keep passing by each other or bumping into each other. The destiny wants them together. And nobody can stop faith, right? Vote: 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ephron tries, mostly unsuccessfully, to rekindle her Ryan/Hanks romance from "Sleepless In Seattle," while stealing the entire premise from the '40s film, "The Shop Around the Corner."Although I'm always pleased to see Hanks doing what he does best ~ comedy ~ this one is mis-handled by Ephron, who clearly has no clue as to what happens online...I used to be one of the more popular hosts on AOL ~ in the Flirts Nook ["FlirtDNiro,"] the Romance Room ["RC DeNiro"] and Thirty~Something ["TS DeNiro"] ~ the last of which is where Meg &amp; Tom first meet online in this flick.But instead of keeping up the chat in that room, as most online couples do, they move exclusively to email, never ask one another any personal questions, never phone one another.As if.At least it has some moments I've lived through, but this should have been an original screenplay: there are plenty of online romances which have worked [and many that didn't] and which would have provided much better dialogue here.Hanks and Ryan's scenes to/get/her are still magic... and pretty much seal Hanks as this decade's Cary Grant: his Oscar winning performance in "Philadelphia" was totally undeserved, as was Gump.We thank the Oscar godz that he didn't win for "Savng Private Ryan" [the first 20 minutes were a mesmerizing set~up for the after~story, which was like every decent war film since "Apocalypse Now"].</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, the previous pairing of Ephron, Hanks, and Ryan, but at least that had the dramatic part of Hanks trying to get over his wife's death that was well-handled. This, however, is too damn long and too damn cloying. I did like some scenes, but most of it stunk. Ryan should stop playing these flighty roles, cause she gets too cutesy, and Hanks looks bored at times. And besides, they cut out Michael Palin and cut out Parker Posey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Duplicity triumphs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wears blinders in order to have it both ways. As Joe Fox, a too-nice Tom Hanks is a ruthless businessman who crushes Kathleen Kelly's tiny specialty bookstore (hardly a threat to his mega-chain) apparently without a shred of remorse, then deceives and manipulates her until the very end in order to triumph romantically as well. It's hardly a relationship built on honesty, but perhaps that's to be expected, given that they start the affair online without revealing their real names or saying anything about their lives. This constipated pas de foux is dressed up in a New York City too neat and pretty for anyone who's been there to believe -- but after all, the movie is just a fairy tale. Parker Posey is wasted in her most mainstream role to date and Greg Kinnear proves again that he's watchable in anything, but it's up to the undeniable thespian chemistry between Hanks and Meg Ryan to carry the picture. If you like your treacle thick, you'll enjoy this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With PATCH ADAMS and STEPMOM, YOU'VE GOT MAIL completes a trio of manipulative mediocrities for the 1998 holiday season. Nora Ephron's new film is practically a case study in how they don't make 'em like they used to. In an attempt to recapture the mood (and success) of SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, Ephron tries to shoehorn Ernst Lubitsch's great classic romance, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, to fit SEATTLE's formula: same stars, same delayed meeting, same reference to film taste as a key to understanding the sexes (men are from THE GODFATHER here), same incessant use of instantly recognizable songs as shorthand for real emotional involvement.What makes MAIL bearable is the enduring appeal of the cast, though even that is undercut by a script that asks us to believe that lifelong commitment to anything but love is petty. Pitting the main characters against each other as representatives of the battle between big corporate America and the small entrepreneur is frankly more than this trifling film can handle. Lubitsch knew what he was about when he kept his film small. A focused beam burns hotter.</fullReview>

The movie was not as funny as I had hoped, and at times frankly bored me. I don't regret seeing it but left feeling like it could have been better.

		<shortDescription>Unending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to choose my biggest disappointment as far as romantic comedies go it might very well be You've got mail. In fact my being so let down by this movie has even turned into a running joke with my friends. Anyway.... I saw this for several reasons. First I'll see anything that features the superb Mr. Tom Hanks. That was just one of the reasons I made the mistake of seeing this. And also I liked the premise. It's modern and different and sounds like it had the potential to be very interesting. And let's not forget the incredible chemistry between Hansk and Ryan. That alone is reason to tune in to a romantic comedy they star in. So with all those things in it's favor I didn't expect to be so let down. But I was. The movie was very very slow moving. Nothing happens through much of it. Also it seems..well..overlong. Unending. Yes it seemed You've Got Mail would not end. And the Ryan/Hanks chemistry factor? Way down. And the movie's a bit meaner then I would have thought as well.I expected more from this and maybe it's silly but that is primarily because TOM HANKS stars in it. I absolutely love Mr. Hanks and I assume anything he is in is gonna be great. Pretty much everything he does is exceptional.Not this one. Without a doubt You've got mail is the DRAGGIEST movie out there. You'd think, because this is a story of two people falling in love over the internet(which, in my opinion is a GREAT idea for a movie), that this would be really interesting but it's not. Nothing happens. In fact, I don't even know if I saw the very end, if I did I don't remember much about it. Just goes to show even a great performer can occasionally appear in a really bad movie. Or, to be fair, maybe bad isn't the word just long, so very long and nothing seems to HAPPEN through much of it.I did learn that it's wrong to assume a movie's gonna be great just because one happens to love the lead performer. Sorry but... 4 of 10.</fullReview>

"Hurlyburly" was a pretty bad movie, too, but as soon as it comes out on video, I'm going to buy it and spend a whole weekend watching and re-watching the scene where Chazz Palminteri pushes her out of a speeding car.</fullReview>

They still got me thus far. Here comes the first impossibility: The girl is the owner of a nostalgic little children's' book store, while the guy is a mega powerful owner of a discount book store chain about to drive that little old "bookstore on the corner" out of business. Another cute coincidence: The two mystery lovers live in the same neighborhood and pass each other constantly "without knowing". Come ooooooon!? How "dragged in by the hairs" and far fetched is this story? I admit I was entertained, and the ending is (predictably) bitter sweet. Still "Sleepless in Seattle" is several notches above this one.</fullReview>

(I'm a chick and I was ready to see a good chick flick). I sat down ready to watch Meg Ryan and (my personal fave) Tom Hanks in a shower of chemistry. The shower of chemistry was definitely there. How could it not be? They are probably the two cutest people in Hollywood. But the movie just didn't deliver. I didn't get much laughter. Didn't feel any romance (until the last ten minutes, which I'll get to later). And definitely didn't need my tissues. I sat there, staring blankly at the screen. Following along with the plot, but just not enjoying it as I thought I would. Maybe my hopes were too high. The only part of the movie that really even got anywhere close to actually "getting to me" was the end. We all knew it was gonna be Tom Hanks that she was meeting, but for some reason we were all surprised. And we all wanted so badly "for it to be him". And it was. And I just almost cried. Until I remembered that I had just sat through 2 hours of an unenjoyable waste of my $4.75. I hope there were some who enjoyed it more than I.</fullReview>
