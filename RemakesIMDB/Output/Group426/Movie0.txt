		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a crying shame the studio never released this on video...I have seen this movie and it is easily one of Deanna's best! Durbin comes off with even more of her famous spunk and "atitude" that we all know and love. Her supporting cast is first rate and the songs really add color and warmth to the picture. Set in Vienna Austria,this is the only movie where the storyline is contained fully outside of the USA. It happens to be Deanna's shortest film but it is not lacking in the entertainment department as it will have you chuckling constantly especially the beginning of the movie where Deanna's character Ilonka tries to sell her goat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Durbin films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few Deanna Durbin films, almost all shot in black-and-white, not available on commercial video as of this writing. That's a shame. Universal needs to finally release this film as well Deanna Durbin's HERS TO HOLD, the final chapter in her THREE SMART GIRLS trilogy. SPRING PARADE is a charming and delightfully dated fairy tale-like film and makes a great companion to classics such as Danny Kaye's HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSON, Shirley Temple's HEIDI as well as Sonje Henie's series of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid title- charming Viennese fluff - one of Durbin's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be spring but there are no parades in this film- one of the dumbest titles ever thought up for a film. It has no relation to anything going on. However, this is a most delightful Durbin vehicle, lovely, lilting, sweet and mindless. She is a peasant girl who takes a goat to market, buys a fortune, and then falls into a series of coincidences that seem to support the fortune's coming true. She is whisked away to Vienna and takes up working for a baker (the ever befuddled S.Z. Sakall). Soon she is enamored of Robert Cummings, an army officer who writes waltzes, and is barraging the king with notes smuggled inside salt sticks to get him to recognize the true musical value of her amour. None of it is of any more consequence than schlag, but along the way we have charm, charm, charm. It was a major contender at the Oscars that year, being nominated for four of them: Cinematography, Score, Song and Sound. It deserved them all as well as an additional nod for the lavish Art Direction. Two of Deanna's finest songs - IT'S FOOLISH, BUT IT'S FUN and WALTZING IN THE CLOUDS - are heard here many times over. It swirls, it whirls, it delights. It's also extremely rare - not available on video. Well worth seeking out for fans of Durbin, musicals in general, and VIENNA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Durbin's at her prettiest in this charming tale and the film ought to be more available...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My only complaint is that the film itself needs a good restoration to bring out the award-nominated cinematography of SPRING PARADE--and a minor complaint is that DEANNA DURBIN should have had at least two more songs to sing. Otherwise, it's a complete delight.Her catchiest number is "Waltzing On Clouds" which is reprised at the finale and used for the big ballroom scene. It's a sort of Cinderella story set in Vienna, about a naive country bumpkin who meets her Prince Charming (ROBERT CUMMINGS) who happens to be a drummer in the local band. He's also a musician and love develops when Deanna backs his musical aspirations in a most unusual way.S.Z. SAKALL stands out as the local baker who employs Deanna in his shop. As in most Durbin films, a series of mishaps and mistaken identities run through the story, only to be patched up before the windup. HENRY STEPHENSON, REGINALD DENNY, SAMUEL S. HINDS, ANNE GWYNNE, FRANKLIN PANGBORN and others help keep the story bubbling along with pleasant performances.Henry Koster gives a sparkling touch to all the musical moments and Deanna is in fine voice. Robert Cummings again displays comic finesse as he always does in light romantic comedies.One of Durbin's best films from the early '40s and it should be available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Durbin Film with a Sad History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deanna Durbin sang with one of the most beautiful voices ever recorded. This film generously preserves some fine samples of that fact. But perhaps the prospective viewer should know that its story line is much simpler than film stories today where intricate plot twists and violent thrills are expected. Director Henry Koster crafted a sweet comedy about a superstitious, but strong-minded country girl who is fated to meet a self-centered, but talented, corporal who tries to act like a big shot. Henry Koster proves his craftsmanship in his ability to knit together so simple a story and make it interesting and even, in places, arresting. Durbin plays a Hungarian peasant from Szilagy-Somlyo. (It's fun to hear her say it! It happened to be producer Joe Pasternak's childhood home town. Also, how amusing it is to see Durbin, an "All-American Girl," dressed up rather like Eva Braun! Durbin is so beautiful that it does not matter.) The title SPRING PARADE makes no sense to the story line, and that is a clue to understanding the larger, but sad, history of this film. The truth is that the film was first made by Pasternak in 1934, when he produced movies for Universal Studios in Austria and Hungary. Today the first film is identified by either of two names, FRÜHLINGSPARADE or FRÜHJAHRSPARADE, which mean "spring's parade." It tells a probably somewhat fictionalized story of the composition of a famous Austrian military march, the "Deutschmeister Regiments Marsch" by Wilhelm August Jurek in 1893. In the story Jurek is inspired by the rhythmic tapping of his girlfriend in an open-air Viennese restaurant. The climax of the story comes at the end of the film when Emperor Francis Joseph I praises the march while reviewing his troops. Jurek's regiment plays it while passing by. The title SPRING PARADE in that context makes sense. In the Durbin version, the march is replaced by the composition of a waltz. In 1934, Hitler had been chancellor only a year, and a story about a popular march from 1893 was unexceptional. By 1940, however, a movie about a rousing German march would be exceptional. The year 1893 gives the viewer of SPRING PARADE a peg to hang the story on. Now we know that it comes after the assassination of the Empress Elisabeth (Sisi). It adds poignancy to the scenes of the lonely emperor in his royal apartments. In the 1934 film, Joe Pasternak made a big mistake. The screen credits attributed the story to Ernst Marischka, but, in fact, Marischka wrote the screen play from an original story by Ernst Neubach, who was not credited. After World War II, Neubach settled in France. In 1949, he sued Universal Studios for violation of his copyright, and won. Universal Studios lost all rights to, what was for them, a most cherished film. And it disappeared from the public square. No studio-made VHS, DVD, or Blu-Ray disc has ever appeared. One can reasonably wonder about its current status as a property. Has it passed into the public domain? In 1955, FRÜHJAHRSPARADE was remade in color by Ernst Marischka with the title DIE DEUTSCHMEISTER, starring a young Romy Schneider. Wouldn't it be nice if, say, a manufacturer like the Criterion Collection would release a three-film set with FRÜHLINGSPARADE/FRÜHJAHRSPARADE (1934), SPRING PARADE (1940), and DIE DEUTSCHMEISTER (1955), all restored with extras like sections, subtitles, and commentary? Detailed information about SPRING PARADE can be downloaded in PDF format from the academic journal Modern Austrian Literature, Volume 32, Number 3 (or 4), 1999, Special Issue: Austria in Film. The paper is "Spring Parade (1940): Imperial Austria Lives Again (at Universal)," by Jan-Christopher Horak, pp. 74-86. The Packard Campus of the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center of the U. S. National Archives at Culpeper, Virginia, owns a copy of SPRING PARADE, and they have given it at least three public showings. It is probably a clean positive without breaks. The music of SPRING PARADE is significant, with a fine march, two waltzes, and a comic song by Prof. Robert Stolz from 1934. The talented Gus Kahn contributed new lyrics to the music that Durbin sings. Charles Previn of Universal added his own march, which is very fine and needs to be heard today. Finally, Mr. Kahn wrote lyrics to Hans J. Salter's "Blue Danube Dream," which re-works the "Blue Danube Waltz." Durbin's performance of this is magnificent. Just on the music alone this film has cultural significance. It and its sister films should be conserved, restored, and seen again as they were meant to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purest Enjoyment Available In Cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thought I reviewed this the other day, but apparently, that never posted. This is probably Deanna Durbin's best effort. She is most natural in the role; one suspects that the director brought out the closest expression of the real girl, here. It gains further power from the remarkable performances of a strong supporting cast. For example, the Baker--played by a well known supporting figure in movies over a couple of decades, also seems most natural here, compared to any other role, in which this reviewer has seen him. His story nephews, here, are far more natural, far better developed than they were in a W.C. Fields movie released in the same era. So too, are other familiar performers from the same era. Was Deanna, the Director, or a combination, the spark that brought out the best in almost everyone? Who can say. But the movie, on a modest budget, perhaps, communicates real joy to the viewer--real cinema magic, that has held up for me from the time I saw it first (seven times) at age 6 1/2 and 7, till I bought DVD's for myself and some other members of my family, within the past year.It was my favorite movie in 1941. Viewed again, frequently, over the past seven months, it remains my favorite movie. (And that despite the fact that I am usually not that great a fan of musicals!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only a dedicated Durbin fan would bother with this waltzarama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I am a "Durbin freak", I do bother, but it's never much of a pleasure. The "spoiler" box is checked, but I am not sure there is anything to "spoil". Based apparently on one of those usual mittel-Europa authors' Vienna romances, this glitzy romantic comedy quickly becomes close to farce. Deanna is "Ilonka", a peasant girl from a small village far out in the boondocks, with the "hayseed" still literally sticking to her. A hawker at the village fair sells her a "fortune" which predicts she will marry an "artist" in Vienna, meet the Emperor, and other nonsense which "Ilonka" swallows whole. Arriving in Vienna almost by accident, she immediately starts rubbing her hayseed customs up against the sophistication of the city, with close to disastrous results in some cases, and situations the writers seem to have thought funny in others. Witness the scene in a ritzy Vienna café when "Ilonka" haggles with the waiter about the price of a serving of asparagus, and the waiter gives in! This kind of humour palls rather quickly. One could go on as "Ilonka" pursues her "fortune", but you get the idea. If this isn't enough for Deanna to deal with, there is the constant sabotage from those two most annoying brats of all cinema, sometimes known as "Butch and Buddy". This is something of a departure for Deanna, who tries valiantly against heavy odds, especially having to sing a succession of boring waltz songs! And contend with Bob Cummings boisterous performance at the same time.One doesn't know how well this did at the box office when in general release, but since Universal never issued a VHS or DVD they must have written it off as a regrettable mistake. Not even in the UK, where the rest of the Durbin "canon" is available in PAL format, is a good VHS or DVD available. This is a shame, for the movie is beautifully and lovingly photographed despite its shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2013:With my dad being a big fan of actress Deanna Durbin,I took a look at her IMDb page,and found 2 titles which have never come out on DVD or Video.Tracking down It's a Date,I was surprised to discover that there appeared to be no sign of the movie anywhere at all.2016:Realizing that my dads birthday was about to come up,I decided to do one last attempt at tracking this obscure Durbin flick down.Stumbling onto the page of a DVD seller,I was delighted to finally find the title-with a bonus short!,which led to me getting ready to finally join the spring parade.The plot:Traveling to a Viennese fair, Ilonka Tolnay picks up a card which claims that a number of events will soon happen to her,which will include Tolnay meeting the love of her life,who is passionate about music. Laughing off the claims,Tolnay gets a job at a bakery. Whilst working at the bakery,Tolnay meets Corporal Harry Marten,who dreams of becoming a famous composer,but is banned by the army from doing so.Believing that she has met her dream guy,Tolnay decides to try and make Marten's dream come true.View on the film:Blocked by Universal from being seen again after Ernst Neubach sued them for not crediting him for his role in the making of the 1934 original Frühjahrsparade/Spring Parade.Despite featuring a limited amount of songs,the writers give the title a sweet whimsical spin,where Tolnay's attempts to have Marten's music heard has a sweet folk tale atmosphere. Whilst the poor print quality blocks director Henry Koster's candy coloured sets from sparkling, Deanna Durbin gives a terrific,jaunty performance as Tolnay,thanks to Durbin joyfully casting a fairy tale breeze over Tolnay,as Tolnay and Marten go on the spring parade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title explained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a disappointing movie, even if you like Deanna Durbin, which I do.Two men are credited with writing the script, and that amazes me. The plot meanders from one embarrassing non-situation to the next. The director, Henry Koster, made some very fine movies, such as Harvey. Why he filmed this script in this shape I don't know.Several previous reviewers have wondered about the title, which makes no sense here. The music, and so perhaps - but I emphasize *perhaps* - the plot come from a musical by Robert Stolz called *Spring Parade*. It has some good music in it. Why Universal took just three songs and then repeated them over and over I don't know.If you've seen *The Great Waltz*, MGM's lavish movie from two years before (1938), the big scenes in this will look pretty weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a good movie but transfer needed a better source</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I purchased a VHS copy from Movies Unlimited that was in new condition. The tape however had some flaws, possibly related to the source material. It looked like there was a few seconds missing between a couple of reel changes and a dropout possibly due to missing material or a bad master. It's difficult to tell. The footage/sound was also distorted at times for some of the songs, which could be due to my tracking on my VCR. I had to set the tracking manually to get the best picture and my VCR won't go to auto track once a manual setting is set. My parents have a cheaper VCR and played the tape with auto tracking. The tape had a bit of fuzz near the bottom of it but the audio may have been a little better with worse video. The transfer was produced by some small company with "Hollywood" in their name. It was better than not having access to the title. Of course I wished for better footage.As far as the theme and subject of the movie, this movie is almost in the same vein as the original Good Fairy, in that the actress in both films is playing a country girl with little experience going to the big city. This in a sense is a type of variation in the Good Fairy theme with different typical Deanna Durbin musical twists. If your a fan of Deanna Durbin films you'll find this has all the typical things that happen in one of her musicals. When there's a problem, she'll usually end up singing her way out of them. In this case there are a few minor plot differences and twists that aren't in a typical Deana film, yet enough of the same types of things that a fan will feel at home in watching this movie. This movie might rate as one of the top 5 or 6 of her films. And I give it a high rating, SK "skuddles" is in a typical role as well. I think other criticisms of this film are to harse. I think this is a fine light Deanna Durbin film with enough quality to make it rate highly in a film you should watch if your a fan of her movies. The only problem is the transfer and copy that's available. I own a nonlinear editing system and wonder about the chance of finding a 16mm copy of this and maybe actually making an attempt at a transfer and edit into the other copy giving me a better master for my own home use. I almost feel like going after this as a personal restoration project, but I'm afraid there isn't decent source material to be found and think that the one out there is probably/unfortunately the best source available.These kinds of things happen. Of course you have to rate this within a mindset of when it was produced and the type of movie it is. This is from a different era and to a large extent based on themes in Deanna's other copy of "The Good Fairy" movie theme, mixed in with a little bit of "the shop around the corner". It's a good theme mix. In some ways it's almost a perfect composite of other Deanna and other classic films, because it has so much other little things put in. Having so many little things in it, makes the film appear and actually looser in it's script, it's not as tight a script, but it can't be because it's more of a mix of other film themes all thrown in together. But even with it's loose plot it fits together pretty well.I've put in my opinion without putting in enough to create a spoiler. I think it's worth watching and owning. If it came out from a good copy of 35mm inter-positive, wow I'd be really happy. I don't know if I can find better audio from her "audio" CD recordings that might be edited into a working dub, but I'm tempted to look.Why do I watch these films. Well I put them together for my mom mostly. She likes light musicals with good singing and many of Deana Durbin films fit that bill very well. This film rates up there just below her best films in my opinion. There are 21 of her films out there. Many can only be had if you buy the PAL UK version of the DVD collection and do your own conversion to NTSC using a DVD player that can play Europeon PAL and trans-code it back to the USA standard. Some of the PAL titles have distorted sound as well, probably because the loss of decent film source copies of the movies. Truly a tragedy. Thank God for folks like Keno who try to restore and offer rare films before they are completely gone. Also one more correction. Deanna Durbin films being Black and White are not "rare", all of her films were "black and white" except one. This is due to her high popularity and the studio had to cut corners to afford to have her in the film, so they cut by not shooting in color for all of her films, except one.If your looking for an awesome older musical with charm, check out some of her movies. Totally family friendly with some great film moments in many of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a good reason it's not on home video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some of Durbin's best songs and technical proficiency all the way around, this is a major disappointment for a Durbin fan who adores every film the musical star made up to 1940. It's BORING - poorly paced and dogged by a weak story line. (I was privileged to see a superior transfer, so I attribute my lack of enjoyment to the film itself.) Romance is given short shrift, with leading man Robert Cummings showing up very late in the film.Not as bad as Up in Central Park, which Universal Home Video somehow did release, but not a film one should be praying to see released on home video.</fullReview>
