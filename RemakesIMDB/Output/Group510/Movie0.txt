		<fullReview>A man suddenly finds himself able to read women's minds and actually know what women want from men.Now,what guy doesn't want to be in that position? This was a terrific idea for a film and it was executed to perfection.Who better than Mel Gibson to represent us in this situation? He's the one man women probably wish understood them.At any rate,Gibson really turns on the Gibson charm here and there's not a better film in which to do that.Helen Hunt makes a great leading lady and is her usual charming self.Also,from the supporting cast,it's always great to see Alan Alda,one of the most underrated actors of our time.This film starts with a very unique,funny idea,and it does not disappoint in terms of how good it can be executed.Well casted,well directed and very funny film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious! A laugh a minute!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is known as sort of a macho action hero, and stereotyped into his Mad Max/Martin Riggs persona. But I've noticed (except for "Braveheart" and "The Patriot") he injects comic relief into almost anything he does. So doing a straight comedy doesn't seem like much of a stretch, and as you watch in a movie like this Gibson's timing and delivery is impeccable. On and off the camera, he has an incredible sense of humor, and he probably improvised some featured gags.The premise is very original and interesting. A guy who can hear a woman's every thought? That's pretty much every man's fantasy. And the premise is used wisely. I laughed the whole way through! It's hilarious to watch Gibson emasculating himself by the minute, and the joke never runs dry. I was laughing so much that I was able to tolerate the film's corny ending. I mean, when is a romantic comedy going to come along that doesn't feature a formulaic ending that is supposed to make people leave the theater and go "Awwww"?The supporting cast is full of big stars. Bette Midler has an amusing cameo as a chain-smoking shrink. I only wish she could've had some additional scenes. "What Women Want" is an original, feel-good comedy that will have you on the floor! This not a "chick flick." If you want to laugh--this is the movie to see! No questions asked!My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romantic comedy that a guy can see too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is pretty much the typical romantic comedy, but with an interesting twist; the main character has the ability to hear womens thoughts. The important thing was that for it to work, the character would be placed in a lot of interesting comical situations, where you could laugh at it, without it being too mocking of womens thoughts, or too far-out to enjoy. It succeeds pretty well, however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly. The humor is good, and there is plenty of it, throughout the entire runtime. The characters were believable, and the main character eventually grew to be likable. The plot was good, and the acting likewise. The only thing that brings the movie down, is the poor execution of the gain/loss of the ability to hear womens thoughts, and the sugar-sweet ending, that was too predictable and plain boring, as anyone who's seen one of the hundreds(possibly thousands) of romantic comedies out there. No actual new stuff brought to the table, apart from the interesting and original concept of a man being able to hear what women are thinking. OK for a romantic comedy. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is mind Reading the Only Way for Men to Understand?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film What Women Want is about a man, Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson), who has been characterized as a 'man's man,' a male who is the type of guy that other men look up to. Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) also stars and sends Marshall into a male power trip when she is offered a job position that he was trying so hard to get. Marshall is known for his ability to seduce women and fornicate with them. Most of the women in his life think that he is a self centered jerk, because of the way he objectifies them. Even his fifteen year old daughter feels as if they are not related because of his poor communication skills with women. But an unexpected twist took place one day while blow drying mousse in his hair. While he was going about his business, Marshall tripped, and fell into his bathtub full of water, being electrocuted severely. Oddly enough, what would kill a normal human being did not harm Nick in any way, rather than it mysteriously gave him the power to hear what women are thinking. So, equipped with his new skill, he goes about his day, not knowing he has this amazing ability. Throughout his random encounters with women, particularly at work, he comes to realize that all the women are not very fond of him.In all movies, there is always a message of some sort that the director is trying to express. In this particular film, I believe there is more than one message. One of the dilemmas the movie expressed was women do not know what they want. Throughout the movie, women were constantly complaining about men, or their hair, or their outfit. The truth is that women do not know what they do want; only what they don't want. Another message it displayed is a world renown problem: the concept that men do not have a clue about women. They communicate differently as men, and want different things as well. Is reading women's minds the only way for men to understand? I sure hope not.The technique of this movie is nothing to throw a fit over. The average cinematography isn't dazzling, but it is good enough to keep the viewer interested. The sound track was well thought out, with many famous songs helping out in several scenes and strongly assisting in setting the mood. A few things stand out in the movie that question reality. For example, Gibson falls into a full bathtub, gets electrocuted by thousands of volts, and only wakes up with a headache. At a different point in the movie he gets shocked again, but not by a household utensil. The second time it's by lightning, and again, just a headache. No singed eyebrows or fried shoelaces were to be found.What Women Want is an entertaining movie at the least. Mel Gibson, as always, does an excellent job portraying his character, as well as Helen Hunt. The cast did a well-rounded job, and no one was out of place. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and enjoyed the humor. The film was filled with talented acting, laughs, and lighthearted suspense. It would be a good recommendation for anyone who is bored and desires a humorous, fun movie. The idea of a man being able to read women's minds is clever and amusing. Should this ever happen, would it be classified as a gift, or a nightmare?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Anyone Really Know? Even Mel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie that, to be sure, is part fantasy, part wacky comedy; but to call `What Women Want,' directed by Nancy Meyers, `just' a comedy would be not only inaccurate, but would be doing an injustice to the film as well. Because-- while there are plenty of laughs to be had (especially early on)-- in the end, there is a lot more bite and substance to it than first meets the eye. Enough to definitely raise it far above the `fluff' piece many will perceive it to be, if only due to some shallow reviews and the theatrical trailer currently being shown, which gives only the vaguest notion of what this movie is really all about. In fact, once most of the `cute' stuff is out of the way (about a third of the way through), the film really starts to get good,with a message about decency that is worthwhile, if only it can penetrate the formidable barrier of the viewer with an attention span barely able to accommodate an episode of `Friends.' Beyond the humor, there is a story here about a man named Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) who literally receives the shock of his life, and afterwards must deal with who he is by coming to terms with his past, realizing the truth about himself in the present, and understanding what his future will be if he does not change his ways . It's something of a contemporary take on `A Christmas Carol,' with Nick an egotistical, self-centered, witty (In his own eyes) Scrooge; a veritable legend in his own mind, which is not-- as he comes to find out-- necessarily the way he is perceived by many of those around him, especially the women in his professional life. The screenplay, written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, is extremely insightful and brought to the screen with equal acuity by director Meyers, who goes to great lengths at the beginning of the film to explain Nick's exaggerated chauvinism, what made him the `Man's man' he has become. And while it is clever and effective, closer scrutiny in the editing room may have benefited the overall film, as his character is somewhat `overly' established. But just about at the point when you're saying to yourself, `All right I get it!' Meyers grabs the helm with both hands and suddenly the ship is at full mast and on course, where she keeps it for the rest of the journey. The turning point comes after Nick's visit to a marriage counselor (a terrific cameo by Bette Midler) with whom he had had business some years before. It's as if not only Nick, but Meyers as well, had heeded Bette's advice. Mel Gibson does a good job of getting into Nick Marshall's skin, and he's to be commended for going out on a limb and taking on a character that may not be immediately embraced by even die-hard Gibson fans. It's a testimony to his ability as an actor, though, because he does make Nick the epitome of chauvinism, and except for the few throw-back Neanderthals (women as well as men) still in existence who subscribe to the `Man's man' theory of de-evolution, Nick will effect the same response from the audience that he does in the minds of many of the women who surround him in the movie. It's only when you've had a chance to consider Gibson's performance at arm's length that you will realize how good he is in this film. On the other hand, the real saving grace of this movie is immediately discernible, and that is the performance of the wonderful Helen Hunt. As Darcy McGuire, the professional hired to lead the ad agency for whom Nick works into the Twenty-first Century, Hunt is nothing less than sensational. One of the most gifted, expressive actors in the business, she raises the level of the drama (not to mention the comedy) by succinctly conveying the strength-- and at the same time the vulnerability-- of Darcy, while exhibiting a depth of emotion that adds so much to the impact (and the success) of the film. And, in a notable supporting role, Judy Greer is memorable as Erin, a lonely young woman who works at the ad agency. It's the `Tiny Tim' role of the film, and though a small part, it figures prominently in revealing Nick's inner-most feelings at a pivotal moment of the film. Rounding out the supporting cast are Alan Alda (Dan), Marisa Tomei (Lola), Ashley Johnson (Alexandra), Mark Feuerstein (Morgan), Lauren Holly (Gigi), Delta Burke (Eve), Valerie Perrine (Margo) and Sarah Paulson (Annie). What Meyers has created here is a mixed-bag, sleight-of-hand bit of entertainment that is so much more than what it seems to be on the surface that it is bound to evoke an equally mixed-bag of reactions (positive and negative) from the audience. It's amusing-- downright funny at times-- but also exasperating. To receive the full rewards offered by `What Women Want,' you're going to have to give it something as well. If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get in return. And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all worth it when you see Mel Gibson waxing his legs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie started, I didn't know if I would like it, although it had a very powerful beginning. But eventually (around the part I mentioned) I realized that it's very funny. And you've gotta love the romance!Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, a womanizer who at the same time doesn't understand women at all. When the womanliest of all women, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), starts to work with his company, she assigns everyone to think of advertising ideas for at least one feminine item in the boxes she gives them (pantyhose, lipstick, mascara, a wonderbra, nail polish, etc.). Nick tries to think, but instead gets drunk and paints his nails, tries on the mascara and pantyhose, and yes, waxes his legs. That night, a freak accident occurs in his apartment, and then he can hear what women are thinking. He uses this asset to steal Darcy's ideas, and at the same time falls in love with her.Besides Gibson and Hunt's performances, there are three other reasons I love this movie. One, Marisa Tomei, who is perky and cute as Nick's previous uninterested love interest, a coffee-shop girl named Lola. But just when Nick gets less desperate for her and more so for Darcy, Lola discovers that she really does like him. Two, Ashley Johnson, who is demanding but lovable as Nick's teenage daughter from a previous marriage. He can hear her thoughts, too, and finds out that she's planning to lose her virginity on prom night. Although he tries to stop her, she eventually learns the lesson on her own. Three, it has an awesome soundtrack. Frank Sinatra, the Temptations, Nancy Wilson, and Bobby Darin sing old classics, while Christina Agulera and Meredith Brooks perform fairly new hits.Anybody who likes comedy, romance, or just a great movie should see "What Women Want." I think it's one of the few unisex romantic comedies (not chick flicks) there are, so it's a great date movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It reminded me of one of those late 50's early 60's romantic comedies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new creative director (Helen Hunt) is hired by an ad agency (run by Alan Alda) to bring it up to date by appealing to the women's market. Mel Gibson, an account executive and a real man's man, was slated for that position, and he wants to get rid of Hunt. At her first staff meeting, Hunt gives each person a package of various women's products, and each must come up with a campaign for at least one of the items. At home, Gibson tries out the products in a tour de force of cross-dressing. Funny, if not roll on the floor hilarious, and he does it with an aplomb that makes it look so easy that you at the very least have to admire his skill. In the process, Gibson falls into a tub, followed by a live hair dryer, and receives a shock that alters his brain so that he can hear the thoughts of women. As a result, he bowls everyone over, especially Hunt, with his creative insight into the women's market. Now he's got her right where he wants her...or so he thinks. But creative insight turns out to be a two-edged sword.I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would. It reminded me of one of those late 50's early 60's romantic comedies, at least in its earlier scenes. In fact, I liked it so much that it made me feel sorry for Woody Allen. His "Curse of the Jade Dragon" suffers by comparison. I mention it, because Allen's film also stars Helen Hunt and, interestingly, has a similar situation?a woman is hired on to bring a company up to date, and she threatens to disrupt the man's career. Even mind-alteration is involved, although of a different kind.I think the mind-reading premise is brilliant and is set in just the right context, and Hunt and Gibson played off each other very well. I've seen Mel Gibson on a couple of Jay Leno shows, and he seemed ill-at-ease and sometimes a little abrupt, as though he were either very shy, not too bright, or for some reason just didn't want to be there. But what a difference when he's on screen and playing a role that in bygone days would have been filled by Jack Lemmon or Tony Randall or Rock Hudson. Ok, maybe he's not the all-round actor that Lemmon was, but he fit that particular role perfectly. And he even does a bit of a Gene Kelly routine!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What Women Want" has a unusual plot which also makes us (men) think: what do women really want? The final conclusion is that they want happiness, just like men.Despite being a predictable movie and nothing extraordinary, at least it teaches to us (men) some valuable lessons about women. It's a good way to understand and know them better.The first hour of this movie is great fun, very entertaining and pure comedy. During the first hour we have some moments to give us good laughs. Mel Gibson has never been this funny before. He plays a hilarious character: Nick Marshall, a typical "macho men" or a "men's man". The kind of man that other men admire and want to be like him. The kind of man who doesn't understand a thing about women (although seen as a "God's gift" to women). Nick is proud, rich, chauvinistic, single and loves to hear Frank Sinatra.After an accident with the hairdryer, he suddenly has the power of hearing what women think and what they think of him isn't what he expected. He sees this as a curse, but after being convinced by a psychologist that he could take advantage of this gift, he uses it to manipulate Darcy McGuire.However, in the second half, the movie fails, becoming predictable and somehow lame, losing all its comical side. Some ridiculous and silly things happen in the second half. Also, I rather the "old" Nick than the "good" Nick, because the "old" Nick was much funnier. He becomes the "good guy" in the second half, losing his sense of humor.This movie has some nice songs, such as "I Won't Dance" (performed by Frank Sinatra), "I've Got You Under My Skin" (performed by Frank Sinatra in a duet with Bono) and "Bitch" (performed by Meredith Brooks).Mel Gibson is great and charming as Nick Marshall, while Helen Hunt is okay and pretty in the role of Darcy McGuire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Alcohol is the perfect antidote to estrogen "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1960's, popular writer and psychiatrist, Eric Berne wrote a book upon which this film should have been its premise. The book was called the 'games people play.' This interesting, quirky, comedy movie is called " What women want. " It tells the story of a top Manhattan, executive, Nick Marshall, (Mel Gibson) in the advertising business who experiences a shocking electrical accident which leaves him with the ability to read women's minds. Much like another movie, 'The Misadventures of Merlin Jones.' Although females at his place of employment consider him to be a snobbish, egocentric, male chauvinist and brutish womanizer, he sees himself the opposite. Slated for a promotion, he is dismayed when he is not. Instead another executive, a female, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) is chosen. Believing he is cursed, he seeks a doctor who convinces him it's not a curse, but a blessing. Although, there is much to learn, Marshall soon adapts and uses his power to sabotage Darcy and her efforts. Alan Alda plays Dan Wanamaker, Gibson's boss, with Marisa Tomei, Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine in supporting roles, this movie sails well, until the principals meet to resolve their predicament, which in this reviewer's opinion, leaves much to be desired. Nevertheless, Gibson does a good job and is able to produce many a smile with his feminine antics. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This What Men Want Women To Want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah-yeah. I know that laughs and "comedy" were the intended goal of this film here, but, all the same, aren't us men supposed to be the "shallow" gender of the 2 sexes? I mean, aren't we? Like, maybe I've been all wrong about the female gender, all along - 'Cause if women really do want what this movie says that they want, then what women want seems to be exactly what men want. Which is, sad to say, fairly predictable stuff. And, so, with that in mind, I'd say that this movie pretty much renders women as being just as shallow, if not more, than us men.I find it really amazing that not only was "What Women Want" directed by a woman, but half of the screenplay credit goes to a woman, as well. With the shallow, pretentious, and petty way in which women are portrayed in this film, I was certain that not even one single woman had been consulted in any way, shape, or form to find out what they really want.Anyways - In a non-specific gender nutshell, here's "What Women Want" is all about - Mel Gibson, that big-mouthed bigot, plays Nick Marshall, a vain, womanizing S.O.B. (Hey! You know, that sounds an awful lot like Mel Gibson just playing Mel Gibson to me) One fine morning Nick gets all of his brain-circuits fried, big time, when he falls into a bathtub full of water while in the midst of blow-drying his pretty-pretty hair.One could only hope that being electrocuted in this fashion would kill Gibson/Nick instantly. But, no, unfortunately, it doesn't. And, so, for the sake of the movie, what electrocution does to Nick, instead, is it enables him to hear the thoughts of women. (Now, does that make sense to you?) Naturally, being the slimy prick that he is, Nick uses this amazing ability to his full advantage (of course, who wouldn't?) by manipulating women as best he can. Especially his new female boss, played by Helen Hunt, who just happened to land this very job position that he (being the scoundrel that he is) figured was solely entitled to him.Anyhow - To make a long story, short - If you can believe it, or not, there's actually a "romance" of sorts that transpires in all of this thought-reading nonsense that is even more far-fetched than you can ever imagine.In conclusion - If what women want really is this movie, then, all I can say is, THEY CAN BLOODY-WELL HAVE IT!! - 'Cause, being a man, I sure as hell don't want it! No way, Jose!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nike ad made me feel ill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so the movie was enjoyable, made me laugh a few times, and Mel is still handsome.But the movie was one big Nike ADVERTISEMENT! It's not enough anymore for them to force us to watch the CG coke bears before we even get to the trailers... we now pay $9 for the privilege of watching a 2 hour nike ad.Don't get me wrong, the ad was very well done. In fact it was one of the most compelling ads I have seen in years and that includes all the superbowl ads... but that is why I was so incensed. The screenwriters could have used some unnamed big firm that needs to do an ad directed at women, but no, instead the makers of this film chose to take the multi multi millions that nike offered them and do the ultimate product placement.So as long as you go in completely aware that this is about two ad execs courting the Nike execs (whose professional lives I frankly didn't care about) than enjoy. The rest of it wasn't too bad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of Mel Gibsons best! He is a natural at comedy! For this movie to have such a low rating reflects on the Neanderthals that write these reviews. A few of us modern Homo-sapiens have to set the record straight and be assured my fellow enlightened humans this is a great movie. Mel Gibson does some excellent acting as does Helen Hunt. A great plot, a social statement, and a truly inspiring love story, this movie has it all, including some very very funny parts. This is not a no-brainer slap stick comedy but one that makes you think about our interaction with other people and how it effects them and you. It also answers the question that men have been seeking forever, what do women want! Rent it, you won't be disappointed. I've watched it many times and will do so again as it is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look at another review for plot outline...you won't find one here, just my opinion :) Weird movie. But good, don't get me wrong, I enjoy it immensely and have it in my collection, mainly due to the fact that Mel Gibson is a male actor I made into a surrogate Dad when I was younger, so I always enjoy watching him (much better actor than he is a director, but that's arguable i guess, anyway he's too religiously weird for me to like his "serious" directorial efforts.This is another film I happily watch just for it's "feel" - it's bright, airy and relaxed. The fake-looking backdrops in Mel's apartment while he's spinning in the bowler hat to Frank Sinatra just add to the film's charm, not detract from it. The one prob I have is that, okay, look, we're supposed to see Mel change from this chauvinistic pig into a sensitive guy, yet he TRAMPLES over Marisa Tomei's character, excusing himself as "gay" to her face while he goes and f*cks Helen Hunt's character? I'm a guy, but even I thought this was a b*stardly thing to do to someone. And Marisa Tomei? My god...this is just my opinion but if I had to decide between her (they obviously had great sex, and Marisa Tomei is gorgeous - I'd quite literally kill to get her naked for 40 minutes...the RIGHT 40 minutes) and straight-laced, probably-never-moans Darcy (Helen Hunt) I'd be jamming on into Marisa's bed without a moment's hesitation... That's not to say anything about Helen Hunt's talents...far from it, I think she's a terrific and original actress who isn't in enough movies...and she IS gorgeous too, I just can't past Marisa...anyway, enough of my boyhood fan-crushes (I'm sure you're all REAL interested in who I think is H - O - T lol) This film gives a nod to older romantic comedies from the 40's and 50's, and in a lot of ways it reminds me of those films (the ones I've seen anyway) in that it has a ridiculously far-fetched plot (he gets electrocuted by a hairdryer and then can suddenly read women's minds...) that somehow just seems plausible because the rest of the movie is so silly and fun. Take Bringing Up Baby with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn...perfect example of this.So many movies seem to fall apart by the end and this is no exception. The ending is extremely predictable and emotionally FLAT...I quite literally couldn't care less who ends up with who...they're all attractive people I'm sure they'll do fine lol...but c'mon inject a bit of originally (or failing that, at least some humour) into the ending of the film...it's the final shot that stays with people, and Mel and Helen huggin on the stairs didn't really burn itself into my memory...Mel Gibson/Helen Hunt fans: dig in, you will enjoy this! If you don't like Mel, or can't stand predictable romantic-comedies...steer clear! Oh, definite date movie, just keep the Marisa Tomei comments and drooling to a minimum, or that couch is gonna be where you spend the night! Take care people, TTT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>enjoyable romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson (Braveheart) stars as Nick Marshall, a flirtatious big headed popular sales assistant in this likable romantic comedy about a guy who can read women's thoughts.Through his confident image, Marshall is presented as a stereotyped womaniser in this 2000 hit rom-com and through his character audiences are able to hear what women 'really' think. It's a laugh I suppose that women are stereotyped and are presented through the media as thinking such thoughts in their head such as how they hate guys who constantly ask them out, detest their bosses, think the way they think. By stereotyping these thoughts audiences can accept the roles of the characters and have a laugh about what women really do want.Its one of those films which is easy to watch and have a good laugh with as Gibson tries to cope with the 'calamity' of a situation he is in and Helen Hunt (As Good as it gets) also acts acceptably in her role as the new advertising division leader. The two perform well together although personally the ending was a huge disappointment for me, too clichéd and a tad disjointed, making the rest of the movie appear less acceptable to accept.One scene involving Gibson is fantastic where he is alone in his apartment and dancing with the hat to the music which is great enjoyment and allows audiences to relax when watching him turn on the charm. That scene too dragged for a bit after a while.There are many scenes which are very easy to laugh to and enjoy. Like all other romantic comedies there is a seriousness towards the central plot and also many side stories, one involving Gibson's relationship with his daughter which is portrayed as sweet and heart tearing but personally I wasn't too convinced.The plot moves at a steady pace to begin with but once Gibson has his 'power' and uses it to his advantage does the plot start to push itself and become more interesting. Apart from the ending and a few unrealistic scenes the film is enjoyable and perfect to watch with partner or on a date to laugh at what women and men want from relationships and society.watch it if...you like to laugh at relationship issues and gentle romantic portrayals of men and women</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had me laughing out loud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the most fun I've had movie-watching in at least a year. It had me laughing, talking to the characters (mainly "Oh, no!" and "Watch out!"), and eager to see what would happen next. I guess it's true that women are difficult for men to understand because what we're are thinking often contradicts what we're saying. What DO women want? The casting was wonderful, the acting was superb, and the direction was perfect. I heard that Tim Allan had been considered for the lead role. He would've been a great choice, but so was Mel Gibson. Bravo to one and all! Now how about doing a similar movie with a woman hearing men's thoughts, hmmmm? Just as Shirley Temple helped distract grateful Americans from the Great Depression, we need more comedies like this to distract us from equally-distressing things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Gibson Gets in Touch with His Feminine Side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a blow-drier lands in his bathtub, promiscuous "man's man" executive Mel Gibson (as Nick Marshall) develops the power to read women's minds. A chauvinist by nature, Mr. Gibson decides to use his power to steal business ideas from successful competing female executive Helen Hunt (as Darcy Maguire). You don't have to be Freud to figure out what happens to Gibson and Ms. Hunt.Though tame and predictable, "What Women Want" benefits from good production values and features a strong supporting cast, in showcase-written roles. Director Nancy Meyers and box office favorite Gibson handle several comic scenes amusingly well. There really isn't much revealed about women's secret thoughts. They want to look nice and have good sex, but seem more complicated.****** What Women Want (12/13/00) Nancy Meyers ~ Mel Gibson, Helen Hunt, Ashley Johnson, Marisa Tomei</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What man doesn't want the power to read the thoughts of women? Its probably right up their with the power to fly and make money. But that power doesn't want me to shave my legs and wear pantyhose.In any case, Mel Gibson puts up a good performance. No longer "Riggs" from the all-too-famous "Lethal Weapon" series, Mel wants instead works in a firm that sells women's products. Through some accident (see: "Spider-Man") he has gained a power. Its too bad he loses it.Of all the women, Mel goes for Helen Hunt. While she isn't the best fish in the sea, she fits the role well. And despite finding out, after Mel loses his powers, that he 'stole' her ideas, she still wants him. A fairytale romance, but not always based in reality.But it is a enjoyable film. Very much recommended. "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing fluff that gives Gibson a change of pace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lethal Weapon" superstar Mel Gibson shows his softer side in director Nancy Meyers' "What Women Want," an entertaining but stereotypical battle of the sexes romantic comedy that co-stars Helen Hunt, Alan Alda, and Bette Midler. Cast as ace Chicago advertising executive Nick Marshall, Gibson plays the quintessential man's man: an unapologetic male chauvinist who believes that you can sell anything if bikini-clad babes bedeck it. Success thus far has proved Nick right, so he fully expects his chummy boss, Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda), to promote him as the agency's new creative director. Unfortunately, Wanamakers is in big trouble, and in an effort to save his ailing ad agency, Dan decides to target women rather than men. "Girls born in the mid-1980s control our advertising dollars," Dan explains. "It's a woman's world. You can get into their pants better than anyone I know, but getting into their psyche is something else." That said, Wanamakers hires an outsider, Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), recently booted from a rival agency on the basis of sexual discrimination to fill the spot that Nick thought he had sown up.At their first meeting, Darcy gives everybody an array of feminine products: toenail polish, pantyhose, lipstick, mascara, a wonder bra, and leg wax. She asks them to concoct a campaign that will make these items irresistible to women. Nursing his bruised ego but willing to tough it out, Nick experiments with these wares to find an innovative advertising angle. Meanwhile, Nick's ex-wife Gigi (Lauren Holly) is getting remarried and dumps his 15-year old daughter, Alex (Ashley Johnson), on him while her new husband and she head off for their honeymoon. Nick polishes his toenails, applies mascara, leg wax, and cavorts in the bathroom with a hair dryer. Accidentally, during his fantasy role-playing, he falls into the bathtub and electrocutes himself.No, Nick doesn't wind up with a halo and a harp. Instead, he can hear the innermost thoughts of all the women, especially his prom-bound daughter. Initially, this drives Nick totally nuts. Eventually, he appeals to his former marriage counselor (Bette Midler) and proves to her that he can read her thoughts. "If you know what women want," Bette's eyes bug out, "you can rule!" And rule Nick does. He uses his uncanny talent to read Darcy's thoughts and steal her ideas. Before long Dan believes that he has misjudged not only Nick but also Darcy. Nick's sudden sensitivity even astonishes Darcy, so that when Nike comes to court Wanamakers, the unscrupulous Nick uses Darcy's ideas to land the account.The premise of "What Women Want" is the stuff of classic screwball comedies. Of course, only in a movie could somebody survive electrocution and emerge as a mind reader. If you can dismiss this preposterous plot device, the subsequent comedy and romance that ensue should please both sexes. Predictably, Nick sees the error of his ways. As Mel's first romantic comedy since 1992's "Forever Young," "What Women Want" qualifies as amusing fluff that gives Gibson a change of pace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the concept of this movie is great. A chauvinist male suddenly understands what every women around him is thinking. I actually liked that part. The sound track is also enjoyable.Where this movie falls down is in its portrayal of the actual women in the film. Mell Gibson is very good in his part. Helen Hunt, although a very good actress, has zero chemistry with Gibson. The actress who does have great chemistry with him, Marisa Tomei, is literally written out of the movie with a quirky excuse that defies credibility.I still enjoyed the movie but would have enjoyed it more if someone other than Helen Hunt had gotten Mel in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make-cute,high-concept gimmick as Gibson/Hunt vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ad exec whiz Nick Marshall(Mel Gibson,in a rare breath of comedic air between "Epic" historical/heavy drama films like Braveheart,Hostage,The Patriot,Signs and Passion of the Christ)has loved the ladies nearly all his life. Well,maybe not "loved" them so much as enjoyed their company,and they've been more than willing to return the favor. But his opinions of them lie in the range of "mildly misogynistic" and the one work pal he does have(Mark Feuerstein),shares that opinion enthusiastically. When Nick is trumped in his quest for a promotion by a heady newcomer to the Chicago firm he holds court in,and that newcomer is an attractive woman named Darcy(Helen Hunt,topping off nearly a decade of t.v. and movie success at this point),this puts Nick's figurative manhood in a sling. To make matters even more embarrassing,he has to test women's toiletry products on his own time to come up with brainstorming ideas for the ad campaign for said products.This,of course,greases the wheels for the rest of this plot,which is as high-concept as a movie could get:Nick electrocutes himself in a mishap involving the products,he discovers through this mishap that he can hear into women's thoughts,he(at first)uses this knowledge for his own selfish gain(which includes getting into the pants of a lovely but neurotic barrista,played by underused MArisa Tomei),then finds himself stirred to act to help a lonely and potentially suicidal copy girl(Judy Greer,making the full most of a small part)and his own shy,insecure and pressured daughter(Ashley Johnson). All the while,he's building(see if you can't see THIS coming)a romance with the savvy,smart but attracted Darcy.Directed by charm lord(lordess?)Nancy Meyers,who struck gold with the Father of the Bride movies and 2004's Something's Gotta Give,has laid out a nice,harmless movie for Gibson(regardless of what you think of him personally)to use his talent for physical comedy and personal charisma to full effect. Hunt seems to be almost a backdrop to the action,a mere device to build the sexual tension and "Make-cute" feel of the film. Still,this movie is just entertaining enough to have most who view it(including many guys)to not feel like it was time and money wasted. A previous reviewer summed it very nicely:it is a romantic film that can appeal to either gender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romantic Comedies are a passion of mine, and this one was no exception However, this movie had a element that most don't possess. My father could watch it. Truly a miracle. Nick Marshall (Gibson) is a man who is positive he is God's gift to women. But apparently, not God's gift to his boss. When Marshall doesn't get his wanted promotion he throws a fit, especially when he finds out he lost his opportunity to *gasp* a woman. Darcy McGuire (Hunt) has a reputation, and a bad one at that. Her first act as boss woman is to give all the employees a pink box full of some feminine necessities. Leg wax, lip stick, control top panty hoes and a wonder bra. This is where Marshall's problems truly begin. I seriously fell in love with Mel Gibson during his dancing scene with the top hat, oi vey. Anyway, a freak accident causes him to hear women's thoughts. A somewhat simplistic plot, but definitely not a simple movie. At first Marshall feels "cursed" but, I mean, how bad can it be for a man to hear what women think and what women want? A notch above most romantic comedies.</fullReview>

After a day at work, he accidentally electrocutes himself and conclusively possesses the ability to hear women's thoughts. Along for the ride is the hot-shot business woman (Helen Hunt) who is offered to take the work promotion Gibson has been striving for. The film is played for laughs, and they work out well enough to make viewing rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite part of this great love story is when Mel Gibson grabs Helen hunt as they are walking thru the door of her new house. He embraces her and every time I see it I still get goose bumps. I wish he would do more carefree movies like this. He's so versatile and sensitive in this. And who would of thought he could dance. He was so cute. There was a very intriguing story line with this movie. He's too insightful. The girl that nobody cared for was also very well developed. There are people out there like that everyday who believe nobody cares. It's not one of his greatest technical films but it beats anything out there(as they say) 'on the market today'. Too good.</fullReview>

The two main characters are played by Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. These two are a great actors by their previous movies that they played and they played great together in this movie. This is not one of those movies that could actually happen but its interesting to watch. Mel Gibson character is thrown into a women world where he thought he knew everything about women world. He learned interesting things about women and some parts I think are pretty funny. You sort of have a smile on your face while watching this movie like I did because what the characters does.

		<shortDescription>A Cute Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson goes pure romantic lead for the first time and turns in one of his most charming performances in WHAT WOMEN WANT, a cute comedy-fantasy about a womanizing advertising executive who gets quasi-electrocuted one night and upon awakening, discovers he has the ability to hear what all women are thinking, an ability he initially rebuffs, then abuses, and then runs from with all his might. Gibson is charming and sexy in this film...his dance in the apartment with the fedora to the Frank Sinatra record is a delight and he is well matched by Helen Hunt as his new boss. There are other amusing supporting turns by Alan Alda, Marisa Tomei, Valerie Perrine, Delta Burke, Loretta Devine, and Ashley Johnon as Mel's daughter. If you think Mel Gibson is the sexiest man alive, WHAT WOMEN WANT is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, WHAT WOMEN WANT is a charming, romantic, fantastic, heart-warming, sweet, and funny romantic comedy. After Nick (Mel Gibson) had that little accident, I was amazed at the fact that he could read women's minds. When he heard what the little female poodle in the park was thinking, I burst out laughing! If you ask me, Lola (Marisa Tomei) was an absolutely snobby woman most of the time! It's hard for me to explain why. At one point in the movie, I wanted to say, "What is this? A spin-off of BOOMERANG?" I thought that Darcy (Helen Hunt) was a beautiful woman, especially in the attire she wore for work. If you ask me, she and Nick made the perfect match. When she and Nick danced together, I thought that was absolutely sweet. Also, I thought that Alex (Ashley Johnson) looked absolutely gorgeous in all the prom dresses she tried on, especially the long, black one with the spaghetti straps. If you ask me, the music was very nice. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt have scored big!" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Mel Gibson or Helen Hunt, I recommend this movie. You're in for a real treat and lots of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

I'm sure Astaire would give Mel two thumbs up.And then the pink box scene in the bathroom was memorable. I often find myself using Mel's lines (during the product testing) when I'm experiencing new things. The hot wax job was SO hilarious!The father/daughter shopping spree was humorous and touching. I bet Mel is a great Dad.I have to agree with others that the ending of this movie seemed 'rushed'. It was like the director thought he was running out of time and it was a little hard to follow.None the less--this movie will have you cracking up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful movie to watch with your girlfriend, What Women Want is the movie that all girl-friends wants to watch. For starters, it stars Mel Gibson, which all women want. Also, it is a story about women...duh. The highlight of the film is actress Ashley Johnson who plays Gibson's daughter. If you recall her from her early days on Growing Pains, she is now all grown up and an amazing actress to add. Not only is she as beautiful in many ways as Mr. Gibson (from one straight guy to another) Ashley Johnson is as good an actor. The bathroom scene at the prom is a wonderful scene with the father and teenage daughter. Much of the movie is comedy but at times, the movie is a romantic drama that works. If you are home with the girl-friend, rent this one, it's a winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gibson Charm and Style + Effective Premise - Inspiration = Good Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** "What Women Want" features a supernatural comedy premise: a chauvinistic magazine executive (Mel Gibson) encounters a freak accident and inherits women's intuition (quite literally), and can perceive the conscience of the women around him. This is one of those dynamite, massively appealing premise, that only requires a decent enough execution to be enjoyable. For the most part, there are enough clever ideas to keep this premise alive and afloat, yet not nearly enough to exalt this film into the kingdom of cinematic greatness, as towards the end, the writing loses focus and traffics in sentimentality rather than comedy. The plot revolves around Nick Marshall (Gibson), and his increasing understanding and prerogative upon women, when he hears everything they are thinking, regardless of whether they approve of his awareness of their secrecy or not. The director takes a very conventional approach to this delightful premise: initially Marshall is chauvinistic, pompous, and universally loathed by the female sex, then he inherits the ability to read women's minds (initially shocked and wanting to be rid of this ability), then grows to understand what he perceives, and finally, becomes "one of them", as his masculinity and ego have escaped with his appreciation and understanding of the women around him. And of course there's a romantic interest (who is initially Marshall's corporate nemesis and personality opposite)- Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), as the two initially have a mutual annoyance of one another, then start conversing, working, and relating, and finally are allured by each other's charm and "common ground" (mostly acquired through Marshall's reading of Darcy's mind- for both professional and romantic purposes). For what it's worth, I really enjoyed "What Women Want"- it is a simple, fruitful, funny, and touching experience, and works very eloquently as both an intriguing comedy and romantic adventure. Yet, I had to instinctively question: "Is this what women are really thinking? Are they always concerned with appearances, relationships, deficiencies, acceptances, etc. Sounds like the thoughts a woman might express in a fashion magazine (e.g. Vogue, Vanity Fair) editorial, but are these really the personal, human thoughts felt by a woman on a day-to-day basis? Dubious! Despite some particular flaws, "What Women Wants" is a charming, enjoyable, and rewarding romantic comedy about understanding the greatest mystery of all: "What are women thinking, and what do they really want?" Just ask Nick Marshall, who appears to have learned enough about women to admire and love women for who they are, rather than how they appear. *** out of ****</fullReview>

Because this movie can reflect certain aspect of American culture, such as, working-class people as well as the life of high school kids. Especially, the part of prom in this movie can more or less tell Chinese learners about part of American high school students' life since there is no prom in highschools in China.

		<fullReview>I didn't like "What Women Want" the first time I saw it. Just didn't work for me. I guess over the four years that have passed since it came out I have learned that a WHOLE LOT of what the movie portrays in a jokish sort of way is actually true.Mel Gibson and Holly Hunter are awesome. Not just Mel Gibson, as many reviews seem to emphasize. Stunning as his performance may be, Mr. Lethal Weapon (a different sort of in this movie, well, since you're here you probably already know what I'm talking about) actually comes out this good because of other actors, surrounding him with unbelievably true and real characters, and more often than not stealing the show. We have our "not quite what she seems to be" successful careerist, a "Hollywood actress wannabe" waitress looking for THE guy, an "indeed more than you think" teenager, a "no one gives a further thought about me so I guess I'll just go commit suicide" associate nobody, and a BAD guy being cleansed... by learning to understand women's logic. Oops, I just gave it away. Here's something that will justify your 8 dollars though: unlike in tons of other clichéd romantic comedies, the way these characters are realized is likely to make you care about them.Besides, admit it: you want to see Mel Gibson do Fred Astaire to IL' Blue Eyes against the most beautiful skyline in the world, lie about his orientation, and... epitomize just what most of us men want.You do? Then whatcha waiting for? Go out, like, today and rent it! An unbelievably kind and clever flick, "What women want" does not only make one feel good, in a pleasantly unobtrusive fashion it leads the viewer to reflect on his/her part in this life. For a while. But then, like a good ole record, you can always give it another spin.~O~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What Women Want" was very impressive since it stars two of the best stars in Hollywood as well as the comedic appeal of its stars. There are few comedies this year that come close to the caliber of this film. Without a doubt "What Women Want" is the best comedy of 2000."What Women Want" co-stars a talented group of actors that work really well together. Mel Gibson leads this talented group, which includes Helen Hunt, Mark Feurstien, Marisa Tomei and Alan Alda. It is with movies like "What Women Want" audiences should be honored to see a talented cast at work."What Women Want" contains original and funny jokes that made me laugh and continued throughout the movie. This film works on many levels as well because Gibson's character, Nick Marshall has to mend a relationship with his daughter. I don't think there is another actor who could have pulled off a genuinely convincing performance and make it work at the same time.The underlying storyline with Nick's daughter makes "What Women Want" much more appealing than if it was just a straight forward comedy because it also appeals to a wider audience. The relationship sub-plot made it much more interesting for me because it made it unique because it is not often you see a comedy with other sub-plots going on. Each scene was carefully orchestrated and well-crafted. I was very impressed at how original the comedy was because it is not often that you find good quality comedy that has not been before. Gibson and Hunt sparkle as each bring their own style of humor to "What Women Want." I can not think of another comedic film that all the pieces so original came together and worked. It is a well done work of art to see this film.Helen Hunt has successfully made the transition from television actress to film star with movies like "Pay It Forward" and "Cast Away." Hunt is an absolutely exquisite actress and should be highly commended for her role as the new creative director. The chemistry she has with Nick is incredible and undeniable. Hunt is a fresh sight in Hollywood and I hope she stays for a very long time."What Women Want" is a very funny movie and it will allow each viewer to sit back and relax. As I stated earlier, "What Women Want" is a stylish, well done, well-crafted work of art and MUST BE SEEN by everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am firm that this movie would have flopped without Helen Hunt in the leading woman role. I do not believe that anyone but Hunt could portray the vulnerability and intelligence of today's career before romance women. That being said, I think that Mel Gibson has come full circle in his acting career with this role as well. Gibson shows us all that being a ladies' man doesn't mean you are good at it. It merely means that often times you go through women so fast, that you rarely know whether you were as good as you thought you were. They don't call it a one night stand for nothing!Set in Chicago, I was surprised to see some similarities to NYC. In fact until I really looked at the surroundings, I thought it was NYC. First movie I've seen trick me like that!I believe most men, after viewing this film, will realize they are much better off NOT knowing what women think. We are a very complex gender, capable of thinking 7 or 8 things in a given moment. Men tend to think about isolated thoughts one at a time....we ladies are actually envious of men in that respect, I'll admit it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers*Two years before that tragic accident called Signs, Mel Gibson played Nick, a womanizing advertiser, who is bitter that Helen Hunt got his job in advertising just because she's a woman, and well, he's not.Ironically, Nick gets the ability to hear what women think (after being electrocuted by a hairdryer, no less) but that magic of being able to do so turns out to be more responsibility than he can handle, and crazy events (such as Marisa Tomei believing him to be gay) ensue.This is probably one of the most predictable films I've ever seen. Most romantic comedies are. That said, it's also a funny, interesting and sometimes cute romantic comedy with Mel Gibson Marisa Tomei giving good, comedic performances. Worth checking out.My rating: 7.75/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard people saying this movie was boring and not very funny so when i sat down to see it, i didn't have high expectations. I do like Mel Gibson as an actor and i thought he was very funny as the advertisement agent who has trouble relating to women to other things and sex objects. My favorite part of the movie is when he is trying out the ladies products and hop around a little trying to get into the pantyhose. Although this is a by the book type of film. Something happens to a guy, he gets a new ability and finally learns something from the experience and thus becomes a better man. All in all this is a funny and sweet movie. So bring a date, get the popcorn and have a great time. I rate this movie 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel and Helen know what the audience wants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Women Want" was very impressive since it stars two of the best stars in Hollywood as well as the comedic appeal of its stars. There are few comedies this year that come close to the caliber of this film. Without a doubt "What Women Want" is the best comedy of 2000."What Women Want" co-stars a talented group of actors that work really well together. Mel Gibson leads this talented group, which includes Helen Hunt, Mark Feurstien, Marisa Tomei and Alan Alda. It is with movies like "What Women Want" audiences should be honored to see a talented cast at work."What Women Want" contains original and funny jokes that made me laugh and continued throughout the movie. This film works on many levels as well because Gibson's character, Nick Marshall has to mend a relationship with his daughter. I don't think there is another actor who could have pulled off a genuinely convincing performance and make it work at the same time.The underlying storyline with Nick's daughter makes "What Women Want" much more appealing than if it was just a straight forward comedy because it also appeals to a wider audience. The relationship sub-plot made it much more interesting for me because it made it unique because it is not often you see a comedy with other sub-plots going on. Each scene was carefully orchestrated and well-crafted. I was very impressed at how original the comedy was because it is not often that you find good quality comedy that has not been before. Gibson and Hunt sparkle as each bring their own style of humor to "What Women Want." I can not think of another comedic film that all the pieces so original came together and worked. It is a well done work of art to see this film.Helen Hunt has successfully made the transition from television actress to film star with movies like "Pay It Forward" and "Cast Away." Hunt is an absolutely exquisite actress and should be highly commended for her role as the new creative director. The chemistry she has with Nick is incredible and undeniable. Hunt is a fresh sight in Hollywood and I hope she stays for a very long time."What Women Want" is a very funny movie and it will allow each viewer to sit back and relax. As I stated earlier, "What Women Want" is a stylish, well done, well-crafted work of art and MUST BE SEEN by everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just liked this movie.I saw it twice.I stayed all the time focused on the character played by Mel Gibson.He was funny,honest,caring to others needs(women's needs). The movie makes the viewer(especially the male viewer) to ask himself:"What do women really want"? Do they want only to be loved by us(men)?What do we have to make for them in order for they to be satisfied?No...........?Also i believe that each one of us(men)wants to know for sure how to better understand women!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comic performance from Mel Gibson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually associate Mel Gibson with Lethal Weapon and Braveheart but here he proves this incredible range with his superb comic performance. There are so many funny and touching scenes in this movie. Most of them are with Helen Hunt but the scene with Lola (Tomei) and the one with his daughter and her friends were also really good. The slightly off-kilter subplot with the suicidal intern is the only thing about this movie that could have been reworked or written out. Still this was a very entertaining movie, 8/10.</fullReview>

(spoiler)Gibson just "got the magic", almost got hit by a taxi, was walking along hearing women's thought for the first time and a small poodle hops "master, i need to poop" ^_^ such a cute line.p.s. oh and Judy Greer's character is just adorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Via a Frankenstein-like electric transformation, the excellent Mel Gibson is transformed into the caring, ultra-new Man, with the comedy value accelerated with the sort of hidden insight used to similar effect in the film Roxanne/Cyrano de Bergerac.This film is brilliant with some purely brilliant and sumptuous mise-en-scene, lots of bright colours and the advertising motifs.It has some great themes too: failure, success, office politics, romance, and a nasty guy totally changing and becoming nice to everyone (just like Scrooge!). Really touching, especially the scene where Nick is so considerate towards Aaron, the diffident office drudge.Worth watching twice over, especially with the director's commentary on the dvd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great. It was funny, romantic, had an interesting concept, great music, and of coarse, Mel Gibson.There are a lot of funny lines in this movie. They were unexpected &amp; witty the first time I saw it, laughable. Now that I've seen it several times, they are still amusing and I frequently quote them.The romance in this movie comes mostly from the charms of Mel Gibson.The concept - a man can hear what women think. Now that's an interesting idea! "If I could only get him to listen to what I think!" a thought all women have. Well, Nick Marshall receives this "gift" but what will he do with it? Watch to see!The music is great. It really gave the movie a romantic essence and a good feel.Mel's acting, as well as everyone else in the cast's, was very good. Bette Midler has an uncredited role which is a good highlight.If you haven't seen What Women Want, SEE IT NOW! And if you have, see it again. Its even better 2nd time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I HOPE IT ISN'T (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILER ALERTI am a man. I watched "What Women Want" with a good friend who is a woman (just a friend). There was no subtle hinting about the movie; we each chose two movie at the rental store and had veto power over one apiece; she chose three, and that was the one I didn't want to see least. In fact, this woman, and other women friends and acquaintances, have always praised me as a good listener. I always thought women had something to say. If "What Women Want" is a true look at the female psyche . . . I was wrong.First of all, what women want is a good movie with lots of laughs. Mel Gibson is a man who is given a strange power to read women's minds. And the first thing one notices is that women are basically phony: what they say is invariably different from what they think (this from the gender that always whines about "honesty" in a relationship).Second, women are inveterate games players. Now, I don't play games and don't hang with men who do. They are, believe me, a finite number. But women, all women in this movie, play games _with themselves_, and end up sabotaging themselves in some way.All the women in the movie are unattractive -- not physically, but emotionally. And there's no interaction between the women, and for a very good reason. Another female friend who is an arch feminist told me about that one: women backstab too much. They build themselves up by tearing other women down. Where men are competitive, women are merely vicious. That's because their synapses are wired differently. Instead of trying to bring their own unique perspective to a business world invented over centuries by men, they merely try to out-men men, backstabbing and destroying. William T. Sherman springs to mind. All the women in the picture end up, not only appearing unattractive and phoney, but whiney. One girl (SPOILER) thinks suicidal thoughts. If she was a dumpy guy with spectacles he'd be merely pathetic. Instead, this girl is the movieland version of a plain girl: that is, a beautiful girl with no makeup or blowdry. This girl is moved emotionally by the fact that the Mel Gibson character pays attention to her. I dare say she would not be moved in the same way if the Gibson character was played by Drew Carey. It's just another little hypocritical area in the script: plain girls should be understood and shown compassion by men -- if they look like Mel Gibson.And the biggest problem I had, all the women wanted to be understood. Yet not one of them, not one, made any attempt, at any point, to understand the men in their lives. They could only whine about what they thought of as shabby treatment. They were all self-absorbed, and not one came off with any compassion for anyone. Only Gibson, with his miraculous powers, showed any attempt at. The women were too busy trying to sabotage themselves.I left thanking whatever gods may be that I'm a bachelor, and that I'm short, used to be skinny but getting a little plump around the edges as I enter middle-age, bespectacled, and scholarly; since I don't look like Mel Gibson in anyway, no matter who listening or compassionate or understanding I am, no women, even plain suicidal women, are interested in me past friendship. And good thing, I now declare. Who needs the aggravation?The movie, funny as it was, and good though Gibson was, esp. when he was trying to play gay, seems to have been written by a misogynist. It's fun, and I'd give it five stars. But after watching it I told my female friend that what women want seems to be a man who, without losing any of his masculinity, nevertheless has a feminine emotional and mental appreciation. She said, that's right! Well, GOOD LUCK! If women are such a jangled bundle of psychoses, Mel Gibson can have them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and... boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really, it's hard to find another adjective to describe this "comedy". Boring, and that's really it. It's so boring that it's boring to write about it. The reason I'm writing is that after reading a number of reviews I'm thinking one of my favorite thoughts : "How come the same thing can be extremely funny or deeply moving for some people and totally boring for others?" I think it all comes down to a surprise factor. People who study the anatomy of humor, say that things that are absurd, but bear some resemblance to reality, are humorous. Needless to say, the sense of absurd and reality is deeply individual, based not only on our life's experiences, but also on our temperament, philosophy, outlook - you name it. While first (the experiences) are somewhat correlated by the fact that we live at the same time in the same society (that's why there is such thing as "national humor" - good luck catching some of my favorite Russian jokes), the other factors differ greatly from individual to individual.Let's come back to "What women want". The three (supposedly) funniest moments in the movie, the three "hilarious" examples of female thinking (all covered in trailers or other reviews already, so I'm not spoiling anything here) are: 1) woman taking Advil to fake a headache and avoid sex 2) Hunt being horrified by the fact that she looked (just looked, nothing else) below Gibson's waste (she didn't even stop her eyes there, which would've made her horror understandable - anyone who went through sexual harassment training at work knows what I'm talking about) 3) Gibson's daughter admiring the dress she'll be wearing on the night she's planning to loose her virginity.This is a simple tester. If you find the three above funny - the movie is for you. I don't find it funny. Not absurd at all (especially the Advil one), not very realistic either (except for the Advil one). This is not to undermine anybody's sense of humor: I truly believe in individuality of it. If you want to know what women think: generally we don't tend to believe that our way is necessarily the best or the only way.Speaking about actors: Mel Gibson is not my kind of a guy. He dances real well, and that's it for me. Helen Hunt tastes like tofu without soy sauce or anything else. Served cold. But again, if Gibson is your kind - the movie may be for you.I won't rate this movie. I'd put it this way: I don't have an appreciation for this kind of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great time and a barrel of laughs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guys hate romantic leads, and like action heros. It's genetic. Julia Roberts can kvetch from action to comedy and it doesn't matter, but we usually don't like our male role models to be too funny. Mel Gibson breaks the rules with a master's touch. He is so good at comedy that this movie could have been a one man show, and in some ways it was.He's an overconfident ad executive who sees the promotion he should have had go to a woman (Helen Hunt) so that the firm can court the female disretionary income. But the last laugh, as well as the first and all the ones in the middle, belong to Mel. Due to a freak accident, he can read women's minds. The movies cascades as predictably as a pinball from bumper to bumper, but Mel delights at every turn. Helen Hunt strengthens her stranglehold on the title of Most Annoying Woman on Film as the interloper who rubs your face in the threadbare dogma that women are smart and virtuous and men are stupid pigs. Alan Alda is mostly wasted, but Valerie Perrine and especially Delta Burke are delicious as the stereotypical office hens clucking around the water cooler.If you aren't convinced yet that Mel Gibson is among the greatest talents in Hollywood, in this era or any, then pick yourself up off the floor from laughing, and then pop in Braveheart and allow yourself to be amazed at the range of his talent.If you think this featherweight film will cause you to rethink your perspective on gender relations, think again. But if you want a great time and a barrel of laughs, you won't do much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpectedly good and entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Women Want is a pleasant surprise. It's clever, funny, interesting, and it's well written, acted and crafted. Mel Gibson, newcomer Ashley Johnson playing Mel's daughter, and Helen Hunt give strong performances. Hunt is largely the straight person so her role is more static than others, but she plays it nicely. The dialogue and chemistry between Gibson and Hunt brings to mind some of filmdom's best duos such as Tracy and Hepburn, Bogart and Bacall, and the film's lighthearted spirit likewise reminds me of Hollywood's Golden Age. The plot device of Gibson gaining sudden insight into womens' true thoughts is certainly no more or less hokey than situations Tracy and Hepburn found themselves in. The soundtrack which includes snippets from Sinatra, Christina Aguilera, Meredith Brooks, B*Witched, original compositions by Alan Silvestri is diverse and tastefully effective -- it makes a cool movie cooler.Gibson's charm is really beguiling this time. His acting is tops and Ashley Johnson is impressive too. Johnson does not fit the Hollywood mold, yet she plays the intricacies of her part wonderfully. The rest of the cast is strong too. I liked Mel in the Mad Max series, The Patriot, Braveheart, Payback and other gory, violent action flicks (other than the awful Lethal Weapon series), so What Women Want along with his gentler films proves Mel can play vulnerable and sensitive just as well as mean and nasty. Perhaps solid films like this will let us see more great performances from this very talented, obviously dedicated but critically underappreciated actor.Somewhat of a chick flick, but guys should be amused and may pick up something new. Definitely one of the better movies to come out of Hollywood in recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think most of the other comments I've seen are over-analyzing this light movie. It's a cute fantasy about a male chauvinist transformed into a nice guy by developing (inadvertently) some sensitivity. Women want nice looking guys to be nice GUYS, too. I'm not sure why anyone would need much more in the movie.The humor is good and Gibson does some amusingly self-effacing stuff and some slick dancing. I thought Helen Hunt was quite believable as the climbing ad exec. I agree with some of the other comments about Tomei deserving a better part but she does what she can with her role.I thought the relationship development between Gibson and his daughter was interesting, too (albeit accelerated).Other comments mention the length of the movie, but I was fine with it. It seemed fine to me.If you're like me and you appreciate the "personal transition" type of movie (my favorite: Groundhog Day), then this is a good fit. This is a movie to help you unwind.If you are looking for psychological insight into the unfulfilled desires of women and the blatantly unsatisfactory male response, this will disappoint. But watch it anyway -- you probably need to unwind.</fullReview>

Helen Hunt played her character well, very down to earth and realistic, without pretext. They both had such sincerity.The story was surprisingly touching.

		<shortDescription>A feminist attack on men that backfires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler warning!I went to see What Women Want with good feelings. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt are always a joy to watch and the commercials made the film look funny. For the first half of the movie I "bought the premise," as Johnny Carson used to say all the time, and the "bit" was as funny as the commercials promised. I was unexpectedly delighted by a Mel Gibson solo dance routine to a Frank Sinatra recording that shows he has all the grace and panache of Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain. Mel, who knew?The problem for me arose when the scriptwriter (or whatever script doctor was hired by the fifth's assistant producer's daughter-in-law) traded in comedy for just one more hackneyed, politically-correct attempt by Hollywood to raise the plight of women by dumping on men. Mel Gibson does his best to remain cute and lovable according to whatever feminist standard these people apply; but the fact is, the script doesn't play fair with us. It's a loaded gun aimed at the male gender. Mel Gibson's character is supposed to be a top creative force at a top ad agency -- not the sort of job you keep by failing to be creative-- but all we are shown is that he is so creatively challenged that he has to stoop to stealing the creative ad ideas right out of Helen Hunt's character's head. I suppose the balance the movie gives us is that Helen Hunt's character is the only woman shown demonstrating any creativity or intelligence. But the simple historical fact is that Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Michelangelo, DaVinci, Picasso, Newton, Einstein, and Hawking, have no female counterparts; and I'm just getting a little sick of female-slanted bigotry trying to establish females as morally or intellectually superior to men when there's so damned little reason to conclude it. Equality of the sexes isn't enhanced by replacing oneupmanship with oneupwomenship.Just so it doesn't look like I have something against women directors, I thought What Women Want's director, Nancy Meyers, did a terrific job on her previous film, the superior-to-the-original remake of The Parent Trap. And Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson, contrary to a previous reviewer's comment, do indeed have heat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is bad in so many ways. It has all the depth and insight of a bad 70s sitcom. Its jokes are trite and cheap and some scenes seem to exist only for the purposes of making a good trailer.Wasted performances abound. The leads sleep-walk through. Gibson is charming as always, but Helen Hunt cannot speak a single line without making at least three faces. Her character, described as an advertising hotshot and "bitch on wheels" comes across as a mousy schoolteacher. Apparently HH couldn't or wouldn't risk coming across as unsympathetic.Lauren Holley opens things up with a pointless narration, delivered as deliberately as Al Gore speaking to a special ed class, after which she disappears except for two brief scenes. It's never clear what her attitude is towards Mel's character.Delta Burke (with an NY accent--though pic is set in Chi) and Valerie Perrine serve no purpose whatsoever and whose roles can best be described as "ad hags." Bette Midler's a shrink in a really lame scene, in which the big gag is supposed to be her sneaking a hit off a joint. Talk about cutting edge!Film is seemingly in praise of women, but it fails to support its contention about women's intrinsic wonderfulness.Gibson's character is completely irresistible to women, although, once he can read their minds, it turns out they all think he's jerk. So why do they find him so irresistible?Then he becomes incredibly sensitive to their needs and concerns, and becomes even more irresistible. But he stands up Marisa Tomei after giving her the shtup of her life. Since Marisa's character determines her worth based on her desirability to men--any man--she's crushed until Mel falls on his sword and pretends that he's gay. Still overwhelmingly needy and pathetic, Marisa tells Mel she'll still be available "if things ever change in that department." It's like a bad episode of "Three's Company."BTW, Nike must have paid a truckload for product placement that takes up a third of the movie, plus a built-in ad that positions Nike as the ultimate woman's product.All that being said, I would imagine trailers and promo clips of Mel in pantyhose and eyeliner and dancing around his apartment to Sinatra will make WWW a substantial moneymaker for P'mount.</fullReview>

I loved Mel Gibsons performance and his dance scene to Frank Sinatra's " I Won't Dance" is amazing. I never knew he was that talented! All in all, WWW hits on all cylinders and holds up to repeat viewings as I have caught it many times on cable and no mater where it is in the movie I enjoy it. I know many people have an opinion about Mel as a person but in his acting roles he shines! From MAd Max to We Were Soldiers to What Woman Want, Gibson plays his roles as the character written for the movie and he does it brilliantly. I only wish he had had a chance to play Batman! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really funny and entertaining. Once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie I was traveling on a bus and they played it on the screens. I thought it was a great romantic comedy -- and I'm a man, ya know. Plus I really like Mel Gibson.I tend not to forget almost every scene or the most important ones of a film, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy watching a movie twice or more times. I saw this thing going on on A&amp;E, and "What Women Want" was gonna be on so I decided to watch it, since i remembered it was a funny movie.When the movie was over I realized this: The movie is divided in two parts: the first half, and the second half. The first half is more comedy than romance, and the second half was more romance than comedy. The first half is from the beginning to the sex-with-Marisa-Tomei scene, and the second half is from the shopping scene to the end. After that, I acknowledged this: the first half of the movie is for an audience of guys and girls, and the second half of the movie is for an audience of gays and girls. Ya get the picture? The first time I saw the film I enjoyed it. I put up with the second half because it had caught me from the beginning, plus there were some funny situations, like the last scene with Marisa Tomei, where Mel tells her he's gay... that was really funny, but the rest is just girly stuff. And what more of a perfect way to present this second part if not by a shopping scene.Suming it all up, if you haven't watched it... well I'm sorry for the spoilers, but I mean, rent it, it's a very funny comedy... the first time you see it. 'Course thats for the dudes, ya know, I'm sure women like watching the pinkish parts over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As chick-flick avant la lettre, What Women Want did surprisingly well with me (male, 25) and 3 of my (male, around the same age) friends. It has just the right dosis of humor and romance, and it's main stars (who I don't exactly admire in any other role) do their thing just right.Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) is an arrogant, sexist executive who one day finds Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt) as his boss. That same night, after an accident he suddenly can hear what women think.A nice angle, and it works pretty well until the last 30 minutes or so, when the 'big names' apparently had to hit it off to make it a true chick flick, while all 4 of us were rooting for the Erin character (Judy Greer). But until that moment, many laughs (or at least smiles).6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and amusingly funny. Gibson and Hunt are a cute couple--but a bad ending. *** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHAT WOMEN WANT / (2000) *** (out of four) By Blake French: In the year 2000 alone, Mel Gibson portrayed a colonial-times rebel in "The Patriot," arrogant poultry in "Chicken Run," and now a hotshot chauvinist in Nancy Meyers' new romantic comedy "What Women Want." Mel Gibson has slick, suave charm and electric charisma in the role of a self-confident advertising executive. All of his seemingly natural talents combine to create a funny, entertaining character named Nick Marshall. The adorable Helen Hunt has the same amiable traits as her irresistible co-star as she lights up the screen with a gentle personality and glowing elegance. With a respectable supporting cast, including Marisa Tommei, Alan Alda, Lauren Holly, and Bette Midler, it is hard to imagine how "WhatWomen Want" could have failed to entertain audiences.Nick Marshal obviously does not know what women want. He was raised as a testosterone-based bachelor, with the idea that he is the world's gift to all females. As a rich executive on the verge of a big promotion from his boss, Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda), he is not pleased when a young, ambitious woman named Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) gets the position instead of him. To make matters worse for Nick, his ex-wife (Lauren Holly) has just remarried, leaving him their somewhat rebellious fifteen year old daughter for two weeks, and his attempts to bed a coffee shop employee named Lola (Marisa Tomei) are continuing to fail. Everything changes for Nick after he experiences an accidental electrical shock that leaves him with the ability to read the minds of any female person. He abruptly pays a visit to his former marriage counselor (Bette Midler) who wakes him up on his unique gift that could be used to his advantage. He immediately takes charge of his new gift; it is interesting, funny, and always amusing to witness his reactions to women's personal thoughts and desires. The screenwriters take full use of the comic material, and use it selectively and wisely; the humor never gets in the way of the movie's message about a modern-day ladies man. By the end of the movie, Nick is a much better person than he was at the beginning of the story. "What Women Want" is written with a sharp edge; the dialogue is poignant and sassy, the characters are witty, sexy, and often hilarious. However, there is also a positively sweet sentiment holding all of the material together and helping the story flow smoothly. There is plenty of effective comic content here, naturally revolving around Nick's ability to read the women's minds. The movie also develops Gibson's character well, and the lessons he learns about women are never too preachy or emotional to turn audiences off to the light-hearted humor. I also liked the unique direction by Nancy Meyers, whose style is keen and slick, sometimes taking the point of view of the woman in focus, allowing us to experience a variety of perspectives. She and writers Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa provide the leads with a lot of juicy material, and they take advantage of it all. "What Women Want" falls into the usual pattern of concluding in a conventionally sweet, happy ending. The final romantic sequence feels contrived and unconvincing, unsettling, like a meet cute during a disappointing finally. Even the smiling faces of Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson cannot save a conclusion that is confusing and perplexing. After the movie, I asked a handful of audience members of their interpretation on the closing, and I got a handful of different responses, only one actually cleared up the whole situation for me. What a umbrage to a generally enjoyable romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>21st century variant on the old battle-of-the-sexes theme, naturally spiked with an extraordinary gimmick to put the material over with today's seen-it-all audiences. Mel Gibson plays a womanizing ad-exec in Chicago who--through electrocution!--is suddenly able to read the minds of all females. At first, he uses this newfound gift for personal gain, but soon finds himself becoming a more caring and sensitive man who learns to listen before he speaks. Fast-paced but dim, fatuous comic fantasy of male and female relations in modern times. It purports to be speaking the Truth about the sexes, but in the interim tosses off a lot of snappy lines and superficial answers. Most of the female performers are directed to be hammy and irritating, and nearly everyone in the cast overacts. Gibson manages to retain his appeal, though even he can't save the film from a sour finish. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson finds himself able to read the minds of women after a freak accident. Meanwhile, audiences find themselves able to read plot holes and poor screen writing after being enlightened by this film.Mel Gibson does a decent job in the role, although maybe that's because he's good at being a misogynistic douchebag in real life. In the film, he steps into a stew of women products conducted from his bathtub and gains the ability to read women's thoughts. And what do women think of? Complex thoughts involving life, their emotions and feelings, and/or their roles in society? Nope! Instead, women only think about dieting, being skinny, looking pretty, and smelling pretty. The women are also portrayed as schizophrenic, though this is entirely, 100% the fault of an awful director. It shows that women don't want to be loved, as Mel get's accused of being gay for "being perfectly in tune" with the woman he's dating. Yah, I totally believe woman would hate being cared for. Whenever a woman has a thought tantrum, her thoughts match that of her body movements. If she's screaming in her head, she's screaming with her body too. In one scene, Hellen Hunt accidentally stares at Mel's penis, resulting in her making these over-the-top body language movements. We as the audience can hear her thoughts, but in reality, it would be dead silent while she jumps back and fourth spinning around. This happens at least ten times in this movie.The film is abysmal, as proved by its ending, where Hunt fires Gibson but still wants to have coitus with him...and the movie just stops. Awful, awful experience in some of the laziest filmmaking in history. The film was written and directed by a woman, so I'm not sure what went wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Gibson Wants.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Women Want (2000): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Mel Gibson, Helen Hunt, Marisa Tomei, Bette Midler, Lauren Holly: Effective comedy about understanding genders. Mel Gibson stars as a creative executive. His mother was a showgirl so he has always been surrounded by women. He is demoted at work in favor of Helen Hunt who immediately sets upon advertizing for women. He arrives home to find his daughter and boyfriend huddled on the coach. He dances in a drunken stupor until he accidentally electrocutes himself in the bathtub. The suicidal aspect halts the humour but the biggest issue regards the unexplained mystery of the whole incident. Gibson does a wonderful job reacting to the voice thoughts of women and then using it not only to his advantage, but also to gain greater understanding. Hunt is not the typical romantic interest either. Supporting roles are cardboard including Marisa Tomei as an ex- girlfriend who must live with a lie. Bette Midler also appears although more would have been great. Lauren Holly was at her best in Dumb and Dumber, but here she is merely done in by a cardboard role. Directed by Nancy Meyers who made the miserable remake of The Parent Trap. Thankfully she doesn't stoop that low here. She has fun with the gender theme in this film. Strong theme regarding communication, which is the key in finding out what women want. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's lightweight, yet oddly worth tracking down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(54%) A throwback of sorts to the frothy romantic comedies of the 50's and 60's, only here it stars Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt rather than Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn, or maybe even Marilyn Monroe. And it's not just the inclusion of swing music in the soundtrack, but also the general look and feel in which this is assembled together; also the mostly light- hearted nature and bubbly concept has a trace of a past period's charm. Gibson is on very good form here in the leading role in which he clearly put a lot of effort into, and the premise is used fairly well with enough humour and bite to the writing for the movie to never really bog down or become overly silly. At around 2 hours long it does stretch itself too far, and the parts dealing with a depressed co-worker drags the movie out and poorly fits in with everything else this has in terms of tone. For what it is, and how awful it could have been, this is a perfectly good entry into Gibson's filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: All You Wanted in a Smart Romcom!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Women Want. An out of box idea where Nick played by charming Mel Gibson gets the miraculous ability to hear what women are thinking. As expected, this ability makes him women's favorite and helps him boost his career where he is directly competing with Darcy played by smart Helen Hunt who eventually becomes his love interest. The interesting idea evolves into a number of witty sequences where Nick manipulates the women around him by using their own thoughts and all these women fall for him instantly. The movie is nicely paced to give you enough time to absorb the idea. Pairing of Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt works in right manner where both make you root for them. Although movie seems to fail in exploiting the smart idea to its best of the potential but it still makes some nice moments. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for What Women Want. It will never blow your mind off but it makes for a nice watch anytime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many of the reviews have said, this movie had so much potential that was all squandered. It could have been "comic gold" if the concept were in the right hands, but sadly this was not the case. The movie was too long. The beginning was fast-paced and humorous, but in Act 2 it became slow, tedious and predictable. The end is also completely and totally predictable. This is all quite unfortunate because the premise is great. The "mind-reading" scenes were too few. This was supposed to be the core idea of the movie. Therefore, we shouldn't just have a small smattering of "mind-reading scenes". This should have been a stronger element. If this movie was made by Woody Allen or Wes Anderson, something truly great and hilarious might have been produced, but this turned out to be a big, sappy, gooey mess. Gibson shows us he can dance. That was a plus. The movie also looked good and had a few decent editing sequences (the scene where he gets electrocuted, for example). However, it does feel (by the end) rather superficial and empty. It could have been an intriguing dissection of gender and gender differences, but it ends up presenting men and women in black and white terms. There were a few nice scenes. The movie wasn't all bad (which is why I gave it five instead of one). The scene where Mel breaks down while watching a woman being emotional on TV, for example... or dancing like Fred Astaire. It was also nice to see the toddler from Growing Pains all grown up (and actually acting quite well!). Overall, I would have to suggest avoiding this one. It's exhausting. If they cut out half an hour, cut down on the subplots, made the film much funnier and if it wasn't so predictable and "Hollywoody" this could have been something special. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been the subject of this movie as Mel can heard women's thoughts as well as canine's ones: we never know why and if there's a hidden message behind this. Anyway, he prefers to tune with women and Mel is indeed comfortable in a comedy: his telepathic ability inspire some really funny moments, especially regarding the life at work: now, i understand why we are so tired coming back home: telling something and thinking the opposite is indeed tiring! However, it's true: we must get along all day with people who are sometimes worst than awful! Beyond, this original idea is not used to its maximum as the movie sticks to the credo of American movie: over there, work stops at the manager level and happens in big corporate firm, usually in entertainment (see De Palma's "Passion"): Thus, as real job is a bit more soliciting for people, audience should felt alienated. This was my feeling as I'm really fed up to follow the life of those privileged, living in big condos, needing staff for everything. What's revealing here is that Mel precisely falls in love with his big boss but maybe an humanist consciousness makes him notice the small archivist as well, maybe the only one true character here!In addition, the movie is a huge brainwash for advertising, which is the most devious activity ever, as its goal is to make think that the moon is full of green eye. As they said in Groland, having Nike sneakers, we don't play basketball like Mike, neither having Mont Blanc pen, write novels like Heminghway, etc...At last, i really don't understand the need to take being gay as pretext to end an relationship. So, this movie has really some excellent moment of brilliance but also very disappointing ones. But it was great to see Mel being a cool jerk and for that someway, it was very unusual and refreshing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) is a womanizing ad executive specializing in T&amp;A for men. He thinks he's on top of the world. His ex-wife is getting remarried, and he's expecting to be promoted. The problem is his boss Dan (Alan Alda) is losing accounts for women. So Dan hires outsider Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) as his superior. Meanwhile his daughter Alex (Ashley Johnson) is staying with him for 2 weeks while her mother honeymoons. Then he accidentally electrocutes himself and hits his head in the bathroom. When he wakes up, he finds that he can read women's mind.Nancy Meyers may know the mind of a woman, but I don't know what she thinks Mel Gibson's character is doing. He is going crazy for no reason. First if she wants to have a men's man, why would she have him drink red wine, or watch men's gymnastics? If a straight man lands on men's gymnastics, he would switch channel as quickly as possible. And while it's great that he listens to ol' Blue Eyes, why is he dancing like Fred Astaire? And why does he go crazy hearing women's thoughts? He's completely overacting, and Nancy Meyers shouldn't encourage it. It is not funny. It's just stupid. He's acting like a BITCH....or MITCH.And he has to go to a shrink to realize that reading minds is a superpower. All of a sudden, he's an idiot and a schizo. If you can get pass this, Mel calms down and the movie improves. But then the final dialog is so clunky, that it made me wince. I understand what Meyers is trying to do by switching the gender roles. But a guy would never say that to a woman. So why should Helen Hunt say that to Mel Gibson?</fullReview>

Helen Hunt wasn't too bad, either.Unlike most romantic comedies (most of them are usually not really 'comedies') I've sat through, this one was actually funny... and entertaining. Most importantly, - it wasn't predictable or too cheesy.One thing I did NOT appreciate, was the fact that the theme of the movie was "Nike" -- the whole movie is basically an infomercial for the "Nike" merchandise. Luckily, it does not spoil the film, because it's got an otherwise solid plot, excellent acting, and well-written dialogue.This is the type of movie you'd want to own on DVD and re-watch periodically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Women Want is a romantic comedy that features. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt together with Marisa Tomei,Alan Alda,Lauren Holly,Ashley Johnson, and Bette Midler.The story is about a chauvinistic executive who gains the ability to hear what women are really thinking after an accident.It was was written by the following:Patrick Swidler,Josh Goldsmith,Cathy Yuspa and Diane Drake; and it was directed by Nancy Meyers.The movie is about Nick Marshall, a Chicago advertising executive and alpha male, who grew up with his Las Vegas showgirl mother.He is a chauvinist. He is skilled at selling to men and seducing women, including local coffee attendant Lola. However, just as he thinks he's headed for a promotion, his manager, Dan, informs him that he is hiring the talents of Darcy McGuire instead, to broaden the firm's appeal to women.Also, his estranged 15-year-old daughter Alex is spending two weeks with him while his ex-wife Gigi goes on her honeymoon with her new husband. Alex is embarrassed by Nick, and resents his being protective when he meets her boyfriend.Needing to prove himself to Darcy and Dan, Nick attempts to think of copy for a series of feminine products that Darcy distributed at the day's staff meeting. However he slips and falls into his bathtub while holding an electric hairdryer, electrocuting himself. The next day, Nick wakes up able to understand his maid's thoughts as she cleans his apartment. As he walks through a park and encounters numerous women, he realizes that he can hear their thoughts, even those of a female poodle. This proves to be an epiphany for him when he hears the thoughts of his female co-workers (some of whom have slept with him and regretted it). When he goes to a previous therapist, Dr. Perkins (who also disliked him), she realizes his gift: "If Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus, and you can speak Venutian, the world can be yours."What Women Want has an very interesting plot.Unfortunately,it does not make full use of it in the majority of the film.It essentially turns into a romantic comedy that centered on the love relationship between Nick and Darcy.Too bad that the film does not fully explore what capacity of a man being able to hear what women are thinking.That is the only problem I have with the storyline.With regards to acting,obviously,Gibson was great in his role.Special mention also goes to Hunt,Alda and Tomei.It was rather unfortunate that the film does not center on Nick's "special power" but rather on his character development as a person,a father,an employee and his lovelife.The movie has a lot of promise with its interesting premise.Too bad that it falls into the trap of being an average romantic comedy that has a happy ending.What Women Want is a rather conventional, fluffy comedy-romance that doesn't make good use of its premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Gibson in what amounts to a chick flick with a few laughs men can appreciate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this film in its entirety, but never during one viewing. Just goes on to long, but I have seen the basic premise and get the idea of what it is about and though not a scientist I am pretty sure one can not gain the ability to read the thoughts of only women through electrocution. This film is about an arrogant man who is able to find out how others feel about him after an incident as he finds he has the ability to read only female's minds. He learns that most have a low opinion of him, though I do believe in reality he would be catnip to the ladies and he would be the one they would fantasize about. He is also having to watch his teen daughter while trying to reclaim his old job by using his new found ability to make the new boss look bad. There are a few funny scenes here and there, but one has to wonder who made this film. I find it hard to believe a woman did as if she did, she apparently has no real clue as to what women want. I do not claim to be an expert, but from what I have read most of the time they are thinking about food and things of this nature, not how they hate men as they go on runs. This film was one of the last real hits for Mel Gibson other than the Passion which he did not star in. I really wish instead of this one he had done the fourth Mad Max film as it is sad that this is one of the last films he did that really garnered an audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was actually kind of funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not believe that I actually found this movie kind of funny. I thought it would be a lame Mel Gibson vehicle. I had a nice surprise. From the first opening moments, the movie pulls you in. Helen Hunt is not bad either. Marisa Tomei is perfect for the role. The story revolves around a top NYC advertising executive, Nick Marshall (played by Gibson). He has an electric shock that leaves him able to read women's minds. Sounds lame, right? Yeah I thought so too, but it actually worked for laughs. That's because Marshall is considered to be a male chauvinist and womanizer by all the females in his office. When he finds out his new boss Darcy Maguire is a woman (Hunt), well then the antics begin when he tries to sabotage her in the workplace. In the end Marshall realizes that his new "power" is not a curse but actually a blessing in disguise. He starts to see the points of view of the women he belittled before. It's a pretty funny watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson back before all the trouble he has gotten himself into now a days, the in between days as I like to call them, he was voted as the sexiest man alive. Surprisingly he didn't do romantic comedies, mainly action or epic adventure films. He starred in What Women Want with Helen Hunt. This is also back when romantic comedies actually cared about their stories and the characters and were not just made for a cheap buck, so we have some actual depth to the story here. Typical with a lot of stories, what do women want? As a woman, I can give you an honest answer, I don't know and neither does any other woman. We all want different things and that's what this film is about, the man who thinks that he knows everything about women as most people know someone like that when you know the truth is that they're just clueless. We've had a lot of plots like this where a man has dressed, talked or acted like a woman to find out what we're thinking or why we do things the way we do them. What Women Want takes a different approach in making Mel Gibson actually hear the women's thoughts.Nick Marshall, a Chicago ad executive, grew up with his showgirl mother, and is a chauvinist. He is skilled at selling to men and seducing women. However, just as he thinks he's headed for a promotion, his manager Dan informs him that he is hiring the talents of Darcy McGuire instead, to broaden the firm's appeal to women. Needing to prove himself to Darcy and Dan, Nick attempts to think of copy for a series of feminine products that Darcy gave out. However he slips and falls into his bathtub while holding an electric hairdryer, electrocuting himself. The next day, Nick wakes up able to understand women's innermost thoughts. Nick eavesdrops on women's thoughts and uses their ideas as his own, but also develops real friendships with his co-workers. But as he spends more time with Darcy, he is attracted to her. Nick and Darcy begin to spend more time together, and ultimately kiss. When he manages to trump Darcy out of her idea for a new Nike ad campaign aimed at women, he regrets his selfishness, especially as it leads to her being fired and him in a compromising situation.The film is alright, nothing too special or memorable but definitely more charming than a lot of romantic comedies. My main complaint being is just the story with Marissa Tomei's character, Mel Gibson had been trying to get a date with her as a womanizer, then when he can hear her thoughts she of course thinks he's the greatest man in the world. As soon as he starts falling for Helen Hunt, he kind of just drops Marissa making you wonder if he had really learned anything at all, it was a story that was not needed and hurt the film. Also same with the "nerd in glasses" girl, very dark and again not really needed or could have been a bit lighter. But What Women Want is a crisp and fun little comedy that is worth the watch, Mel and Helen were a pleasure to watch together and had good chemistry. Some very touching moments, even if the script was a bit of a cliché. But it's a harmless movie that I did enjoy over all.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting What Women Want to be as fun as I found it. The premise I initially found rather daft, and some of the subplots are superfluous and drag the film down. However, What Women Want is a pleasant watch, as it has lovely cinematography and the soundtrack has a nice quality to it. The film is wittily written and sharply directed too, while the story is pretty interesting and unique on the whole, like Nick Marshall's gift of being able to hear women's thoughts. The two lead performances are excellent, Mel Gibson can be obnoxious like his character but he is also very charming, while Helen Hunt is great as his far-from-perfect love interest. All in all, entertaining and inventive. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Everyone agrees that Helen Hunt is a good actor, but I've always felt that Mel Gibson has been underrated in the past. He's one of those actors who draws you into the movie with not much of an effort. There's lightness and charm to both actors' acting that the story just feels extremely real and relevant. And it doesn't hard that the dialog are funny and not overdone. Chicago is a charming city with history and elegance. It works so well with this movie. For me, this movie warms my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie was a comedy and had it's small moments it lacked enough funny scene to go down as a classic comedy which is a shame because it's a good idea and a lot more could have been done with it. Mel Gibson's performance was the best with Helen Hunt delivering something pretty ordinary. Although it might seem like the movie to watch as a family it's not. Unless you're family enjoys a petty, boring, poor movie. A good time when this movie would come in handy is if you're possibly struggling for sleep. One thing that was done well was how Mel Gibson's character acted when he found out he could here what women were thinking. This is an area that lets most movies down but it was done well in this case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but overdone, and the ending has a flaw?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally this is an entertaining, fun movie, which is about all you should really expect. The "overdone" comment comes at the beginning, especially the "accident" scene, in which Mel gets electrocuted in the bath by his hair dryer. It's too drawn out and unbelievable, as Mel slips and slides for what seems like minutes on end. The rest of the plot is a bit predictable, but still delivers, as long as your expectations aren't too high. I am troubled though about a flaw at the end. However, description of the flaw may entail giving away too much, so if you don't want to know the ending, STOP READING HERE.The "flaw" has to do with a promise Mel makes to Erin near the end of the movie. Based on what subsequently happens to him in the last scene, I don't see how he can possibly come through with his promise.</fullReview>

Glossy romantic comedy about a male chauvinist ad exec who after getting electrocuted begins hearing the thoughts of every female around him, and that's where he puts it to good use on his new superior (Hunt), who stole the position from him, and makes her fall in love. A tendency for overlength cannot count against a movie this entertaining and funny from the help of a game cast and the attractive Gibson and Hunt (and their congenial smiles). Bette Midler appears. Running Time: 125 minutes and rated PG-13 for sexuality and some language. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was great, but why did it have to be so dirty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson was wonderful in this. I tend to sympathize with the male chauvinist pigs in movies and TV, but Nick was also quite appealing when he learned to attempt to understand women. And he was really funny trying on women's clothes and makeup, and taking the hair off his legs, when he was learning how to advertise products to women. And also when he was terrified by his 'gift'. Of course, this movie was not all funny, and when it stopped being a comedy near the end, Gibson still made his character work. And he did an outstanding job in the presentation of the advertising campaign; this was not merely the work of one of the creators, but worthy of being the voiceover in an actual commercial. The advertising campaign efforts appeared quite realistic, considering I don't know much about the business.There were lots of good acting performances here. Helen Hunt as Nick's co-worker, Ashley Johnson as his daughter Alex, Alan Alda as his boss. I liked Marisa Tomei at first as Lola, the girl who served Nick coffee, but several things happened that I won't reveal here because they would be spoilers. Other people would probably enjoy her performance as a whole.Gibson and Hunt were great together, first as co-workers who didn't really get along because of their different ideas, and later as friends who ... well, I won't say it. You watch to find out if it happens.My biggest problem with this movie was the amount of bad language and dirty talk. Was this REALLY necessary? The movie could have been good without being quite so raunchy. Still, it was a very good effort and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I popped in the DVD expecting a die-hard chick flick. I was pleasantly surprised.Mel Gibson plays a hilarious jerk. He is so selfish, egotistical and male chauvinistic that you can't help but laugh. He carries the movie from beginning to end, and does so with complete success.Gibson plays a marketing executive who is passed up for an expected promotion because he needs to learn to market to the female demographic. While brainstorming an assignment related to this deficiency, he is electrocuted and blah blah you know the rest. What struck me about this movie was how realistic his personal transition was as a result of his newfound "skill". he didn't turn into a completely sympathetic mushmouth right away because that is not the sort of person he was.The supporting cast, especially Alan Alda and Mark Feuerstein are all pretty good. Helen Hunt is adequate, but not completely believable as the tough savvy executive who takes Gibson's expected promotion right out from under him. She just does not come across as a particularly strong character.The movie does dissolve into a cliched romantic comedy towards the end, but the journey up to that point makes it worthwhile. 7/10</fullReview>

Despite being outside the target audience for this movie, I still enjoyed this movie and found it to be a rather delightful comedy. My only real complaint will be that it's too long and drags along at the end. But the majority of this movie is a pleasure to watch.Mel Gibson who starts off a "man's man" is an advertising guy who is about to get promoted to Creative Director - he is a legend in his field and the time is right. But of course, things go wrong. The Board instead hires a woman (Helen Hunt), seeing how the world is now a woman's world and pictures of half-naked women no longer sell the products. So... on her first day on the job, Helen makes everyone come up with some ideas for some female products. She gives everyone a box full of the junk. Mel, trying to be new-age tries all the goodies to get into the mind of a woman. An incident with a Blow-Dryer and Bathtub sets the events in motion.Overall, Great Movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, an interesting premise in a big Hollywood romantic comedy... for women, no less. Nick is a chauvinistic, womanizing pig who works at an ad agency. One day, his boss tells him that he'll now be working for a woman on gearing the company's agenda more towards the female demographic. One night, during a research experiment, Nick is electrocuted and awakes with the psychic ability to get inside women's heads- even his own daughter. Suddenly, he has the power to usurp the ideas and private thoughts of all the girls around him. And he starts by taking advantage of his new boss. Later, he has a change of heart and decides to use it to help others.After one incredible turkey of an opening, Mel Gibson gets the ability to read women's minds and changes into a character that is likeable. Then finally the movie pulls out the big guns and sharpens it's smart edge. Ultimately, the preposterousness of the ending suffers a bit, but the whole movie is definitely worth a watch. If only to see what 'that pink-girl from Jawbreaker' moved on to and Marisa Tomei get dumped by a gay guy. Mel has been working out, and the results are commendable.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny Movie With A Fun Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general terms this is a very funny movie. Mel Gibson is perfect as Nick Marshall, a male chauvinist ad executive who finds himself passed over for promotion because the boss (Alan Alda) decides that he needs to bring in a hot shot female executive (Helen Hunt) to reach the female market. The fun really begins when Nick is accidentally electrocuted and mysteriously finds himself able afterward to read women's minds.We see Nick evolve as a result of his new found ability. At first he is terrified, not understanding it; then he uses the power to exploit women; finally he becomes more sensitive to women (and particularly desirous of being a better father.)I guess it's that last part that bugged me and made me give this only a 7. I was going for higher until the end of the movie. Clearly we're meant to believe that Nick has become "superdad." He understands the needs and emotions of his 15 year old daughter Alex and when he finds out that she has been traumatized by her date's actions at the prom, he rushes to her and spends time with her and comforts her. All well and good. He takes her home, puts her to bed and then - at 1:00 in the morning - he leaves his emotionally traumatized 15 year old daughter all alone in his apartment so he can go and make up with his boss (Hunt)? That left me cold and entirely unsympathetic to Nick, who I was beginning to like up to then.It's still a funny movie. I just didn't like the way the ending was handled.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all. Actually, to tell the complete, honest-to-God truth, it was amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazingly disappointing and rather unsatisfactory. The reviews all clearly stated that this movie was going to be a comedy. Well, it was. Until it sort of forgot what being a comedy mean to the general audience. I believe that the current definition (as the public knows it) of comedy is something that makes one laugh. This movie fit the part beautifully at first, then it turned out to be a, well, dud. It just went flat. It ended up following the definition of comedy that is less popular. The definition of comedy used in some of Shakespeare's works, meaning a story that ends happily. I didn't really like the transition between the two definitions. There were a surprisingly numerous amount of things that I noticed which made the general structure of the story collapse. Most of them are slightly minuscule, but others were fairly large flaws.--~~**Please take notice that beyond this point, spoilers are likely to be embedded in my review, so for anyone who is reading this that has NOT seen the movie, you might not want to read any more of this.**~~--The first thing I noticed was in the first scene (I believe it was) when Nick kept calling his cleaning lady (if that's who she was) "babe". I had no problem with that, except for the way Mel Gibson said it. It was like "Oh, here's a word I've never used before. I'm not quite sure if I like it too much." I mean, it was supposed to be said casually, like if Nick had used it all of his life. Catch my drift? Secondly, I really don't see the significance of the character Lola in the movie. She didn't really seem to be that important in the story at all. In fact, it would have been much better without her in it. At all. You'll find my reasons for saying this later on. Third, I don't think that this movie really gave Mel Gibson a chance to drive in that he was really stuck up and self-centered. Sure, you got the general idea, but it was kind of left hanging. Which is why it's understandable that this movie didn't show a conversion in Nick. There was nothing to convert from in the first place! This was a rather long movie, and I think it would have helped if it had had a little more time to play around with Nick being a real pain-in-the-neck to most women and then slowly turn into this nice, considerate guy. Cutting Lola out would have given the necessary time for this. Next, I'd like to comment on the character of Morgan. First, you get the impression that he doesn't believe a word Nick is saying about being able to read women's minds. Then, he goes and asks the attorney if she really thought he was gay. I mean, it's like, "Come on! Make up your mind already! Do you believe Nick, or not?!?!" Fifth, the last scene was total, utter, and complete CRAP!!!!!!! Terrible scene. It just said that whoever wrote the scene wanted to wrap the movie up, and wrap it up quick. They didn't care whether it was totally bogus that Darcy would believe that Nick had been stealing her ideas without asking even one question as to HOW, exactly, he thought he had stolen her ideas. She just accepted it, and that was that. Also on that last scene was the whole "My hero" thing. Nick really didn't seem the type to be saying that, and Mel Gibson's stage presence wasn't meek enough for the line to fit in. My last comment on the last scene was that it left to many questions for the audience. So she fired him. Yeah? And then...? Nothing! As far as we know, he never got another job and had to live on the streets. And we're not even sure if she actually fired him or not. Maybe she changed her mind later on. Who knows?? Certainly not the audience. Then there was the `I Won't Dance' scene. Excellent footwork on Mel Gibson's part, but I really think that someone should have chosen a different song for him to dance to. This song clearly stated that he wouldn't dance, and then Mel Gibson has to go right ahead and dance to it anyway. That's rather contradictory in my book. And then there's the problem of Darcy getting fired. She'd been there, oh, one or two weeks tops and then she gets fired! I don't think the manager knew enough about her yet to fire her straight off just because he thought Nick might be better at the job. She only had the chance to do ONE project! How could he even think about judging her just form that? Totally unbelievable. Last and probably least, I'd like to say that the names in this movie were awful and didn't fit their owners AT ALL. Nick was a terrible name for Mel Gibson's character, when all of the rest of the character's names were rather absurd and not heard often. I mean, come on. Morgan, Darcy, Lola, and then, all of a sudden Nick! Nick is one of the most common, everyday names for a guy. And all of the other names are rather odd. See where I'm going with that?I guess that's about all. But there's one last thing. Mel Gibson was sooooooo absolutely and utterly sexy in the "I won't dance" scene. Yeah. (Hee hee hee.) Well, thanks for reading my review! XOXOXOXO --Gloria</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hopefully I won't say anything redundant here since I can't read all 250+ comments on this movie.I didn't see this movie when it was released in theaters because I dismissed it as a chick flick. It is. I caught it today on tv and I liked it a lot except for the very end.!!!Spolers ahead, please don't read if you didn't see the movie:O.k. let me see if I got this right. 1)Except for the supernatural thought reading plot gimmick, everything else is supposed to be logical. 2)Helen Hunt IS much smarter than Mel and he tricked her - using his thought reading skills - into believing he just had the same ideas regarding a Nike advertising campaign. 3)In the final scene where he explains everything to Helen Hunt - without giving away the secret that he once was able to read women's minds - she immediately believes it and gets angry. Why??? I mean she is smart and he actually said her ideas out loud before she had a chance to say them. How did he do it if he wasn't at least as bright as her (we only know he wasn't because he needed to use his thought reading powers =cheat). His explanation and her reaction to it is a hackjob from the screenwriters especially because three other plot ends (Mel's daughter, Mel's adventure (Marisa Tomei) and the girl who wanted to be a copywriter) are given rather good conclusions.</fullReview>

But then there's the main plot, the rivalry/collaboration between Gibson and co-star and co-worker Hunt that would do Doris Day and Rock Hudson proud. Hunt's always fine, but I'm missing the chemistry from Gibson to make that angle work, and that's (unfortunately) the major focus of the movie.</fullReview>

But during the film there were times when it got sooo boring! I think, Gibson and Hunt had NO chemistry, they just didn´t look like "in love"; not for one second, sorry. I was checking my watch every 10 Minutes and wondering, when it finally goes good again. Then came some funny moments (just the ones, you´ve already seen in the trailer, but still!) Probably the movie has been much better, when they had cut the endless-boring-scenes a little shorter, 90 Minutes would have done it, i guess. Also, what about the end?! That end totally sucked and was way to cheesy in my opinion. This was the first Gibson-movie which i left disappointed. Í admit, it was not a total waste but not the best either. Although i think of Mel Gibson as a great actor but romance is really not his thing i guess. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the only romantic comedy in the last five years that has the balls to be original. Most others are just the usual "Boy meets girl" plot. (See my comment for THREE TO TANGO if you are interested in the traditional, boring plot of most romantic comedies in about five or six sentences). Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt have good chemistry. They go good together. Most of the jokes stay on the same level. Some are funny and others are the kinds of lame jokes that old people laugh about for hours. This film explores one of the many things man cannot do, but women thinks he can anyway. Only in this film, the man really can. This is a one of a kind work. Sometimes moving, other times....not moving. But, hey no movie is perfect. WHAT WOMEN WANT gets 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie actually has a point to it, a man electricuted himself and no can hear what women think. I laughed a couple times, but in my opinion, I thought it was a bit boring sometimes. I mainly watched it because Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt were both in it. Also, I thought the ending was a bit weak. It's like, he's walking down an alley, sparks shower him and ta-daa! He can't hear what women think. Then he goes over to Darcy's house (Helen Hunt) and talks. I mean like, get real.</fullReview>

Especially the last scenes in the bar/restaurant and in the Darcy's house - I absolutely love them! And I can say it absolutely honestly and impartially because I don't like Mel Gibson at all. But I started liking Helen Hunt from that movie :) Actually there are a lot of such films with the same plot and everything but this one is different because of the actors' performance and just the atmosphere.

		<fullReview>OK I was intrigued by the idea of this film, I don't have much of a clue as to what women want either. Mel gets zapped, hears women's thoughts, and becomes a better man because of it. The problem is that it takes the film so long to finally get there...the back part of What Women Want goes on and on after a spiffy beginning, plus Morisa Tomei is wasted as a gratutious one night stand. This may have worked better as a farce rather than the reformed sensitive man type of picture. Plus lots of tightening would have helped.</fullReview>

And yeah - he is good-looking, he is charming, why not make a movie, were he can read women thoughts!It's all funny and entertaining cause of all the thinking you get the abbility to listen on. Gibson is just walking around - smiling and laughing and having off course, a wonderful time! Nick Marshall works in a company who is working on selling female products. They're not very good at it, so they hire in this professional woman to be a leader. But Nick gets in " trouble " when he falls down in the bathtub and with the hear dryer coming down in the water! He gets a electrical shock! Deadly... But, Nick survives. And when he wakes up - he can hear what women are thinking, 24 hours every day! Now, he can steal ideas, help women, flirt with them and just have complitely control! It's a entertaining and original story so that really does it all much better.

		<fullReview>That's the question all men have asked each other at some point in their life. Especially during sex, which there is a great scene involving that here. Anyway, the lead character played by Mel Gibson takes advantage of his abilities and I for one enjoyed seeing that. And there really is a purpose for why he gets those abilities but I ain't going to get into that. So all I will say is that it's a fun, clever, and funny movie with amazing and funny performances.3 1/2(***1/2)out of 4(****)stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Women Want is Mel Gibson tending to their every need...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) is a gay (as in "happy") divorcee having a wonderful time seducing women and creating very successful T&amp;A themed advertising campaigns. Nick is not an evil man, just your typical selfish bore with drop-dead good looks. Though never overtly stated, Nick sees woman as a means of entertainment, like a TV or a video game. He does not really care what they want nor what they think, as long as he gets what he wants from them: sexual fullfillment. But life in the 21st century demands that one finally realize that women are much more than just playthings, and any advertising agency that does not understand how to market to women is going to find itself a third-rate institution. So Nick's boss (Alan Alda) decides it's time to hire a female creative director to help land some of those lucrative ad campaigns for women's products. Nick thought the position was all but his, so he's just a bit upset at that a strong, high-self esteem, alpha-female by the name of Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt) is brought in to help them find out what women really want. Nick quickly decides he will do what he can to make himself look good at Darcy's expense.But an interesting thing happens while Nick spends an evening trying to understand why women wax their legs: he gets electrocuted by his blow dryer, and the resulting damage leaves him with the ability to read a woman's mind as if she's actually talking to him. At first he thinks he's going insane, but soon comes to the realization, with the help of his former marriage counselor (Bette Midler), the that he's been granted a very special gift.Nick is a guy who's been around woman his entire life, but has never really cared to understand them. As long as he gets what he wants, why should he even care? But now, thanks to his special "gift," Nick gets to "listen" to what women really like and dislike, even if they refuse to admit it to anyone else, let alone themselves! As you can imagine, with a setup like this there has to be some laughs, and "What Women Want" delivers them by the bucketful. Director Nancy Meyers pays great homage to those great old goofy comedies of the late 30's through early 60's that showcased clever dialogue and outrageous predicaments. A knowledgeable student of cinema can see that Meyers has grabbed some of her inspiration from "Bringing Up Baby" (1938) all the way to the original "Parent Trap" (1961), as well as many other fine films from that period. Yet the greatest gift Meyers gives us in the casting of Helen Hunt as creative director who torments, then enthralls Mel Gibson. As far as I'm concerned, anytime Helen Hunt is in a film, they should just take the Oscar for best performance, pack in a box and send it to her. I remember with great fondness and surprise when I saw her on the big screen in the 1996 film "Twister." For a goofy special effects extravaganza, Helen Hunt, playing the role of a meteorologist/storm chaser, gives a powerful and serious performance that even upstaged the tornadoes. In "What Woman Want," Helen again demonstrates why she is the most talented actress to ever come out of Hollywood. That's quite a statement to make, but I can't think of any American actress who is even close to her equal, with the exception of Meryl Steep. No, that wasn't Helen I saw on the screen, it really was a woman creative director newly hired at one of Chicago's high-powered advertising agencies. She just looked like Helen...As for Mel's performance, he pretty much gets to play himself! That's not a bad thing, and it's about time we see Mr. Gibson take part in a pure comedy. He over does it a bit, (as he usually does) but has enough charm and warmth that we can almost excuse the over-acting. (Where's Cary Grant when you need him?) Not surprisingly, his best scenes were with Helen Hunt. There was enough chemistry between the two of them to keep DuPont in business for the next several years.The idea of a man being "forced" to listen to the needs and problems that women face (whether he wants to or not!) is an extremely clever comedic device, but also showcases a simple problem with people in general, both men and women: the inability to listen. The art of listening, not just to what someone is saying, but WHY they are saying it, has been all but lost on a great many of us. It's a rather simple skill that if it were to be seriously sought out, would bring joy and satisfaction to a great many very sad and miserable souls. "What Women Want" shows how the very simple act of "listening" can be a surprisingly transforming experience. You don't have to be a mind reader, if someone knows you are truly listening to them, they'll speak their mind very clearly.My rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neat Plot, Good Chemistry (Little Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a chick flick that guys will enjoy. Why? Well, for one thing it has a very inventive plot. The protagonist, Nick Marshal (Mel Gibson) is a chauvinist ad executive. He's not cruel to women, just old school, like a 1950s Hugh Hefner character. The men in "What Women Want" are not cut from the same bolt of cloth as the monsters in "In the Company of Men", not by a long shot. But when Nick is passed over for an anticipated promotion, and for an outsider and a woman, Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt). Gads, he besides himself. He's going to get that job! He'll act nice to her face, but torpedo her career from behind the scenes. This activity gets an unanticipated boost when a bathroom accident with a hair dryer and bathtub full of water leaves Nick with an unusual power. He can hear women think. After his initial amazement and concern, he harnesses this power to help him in his nefarious scheme (and to become a great lover). But wait! Something unanticipated happens; he becomes sensitive, and falls in love with Darcy."What Women Want" is not too drenched in estrogen, and its companion problem, socio-political propaganda. All too often, this renders romance movies unwatchable. This is more like a 1940s screw-ball comedy, and doesn't take itself too seriously. And finally, and probably most importantly, there is a good chemistry between Gibson and Hunt. They're very good together. You root for them.The bottom line is that I heartily recommend this movie. It's a good rental for the whole family, not just the women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Hollywood Schmaltz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt that this movie started very well, and in the first hour or so there was some great comedy and the story seemed to be developing reasonably well, even though it was a bit predictable and cliched. I thought the way Mel Gibson suddenly developed his gift of being able to hear what women think by electrocuting himself was a bit silly, but then again so is the whole film!Gibson's performance was good, as was Helen Hunt's, who played his love interest. But where this movie really let itself down was in the second half, when it seemed to just fizzle out and drag itself towards a totally cheesy ending with bucketloads of schmaltz. I was very disappointed because at the start I thought it was going to be a good movie, but it turned into a bit of a turkey for me. However, if you're a fan of Mel Gibson and you like romantic comedies that aren't too challenging, then What Women Want is perfect for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an action movie guy, so normally I'm not into dramas or comedy / romances, but I get dragged along by my SO and sometimes they're even worth watching."What Women Want" was one of those. It has something real to say about relationships, but the deep thoughts are worked into a real plot and there's great acting by cant-fail actors Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. I'm not sure I bought totally into the chemistry between the two, and the ending could have been more comic rather than feel-good. But it was quite accessible to me and had a smooth feel to it, unlike the horrid "Tao of Steve". It wasn't quite as deep and original as "High Fidelity", but it certainly rose above the norm.Who should see this film:-- comedy / romance types. This is not a straight comedy; neither is it a teen flick.-- everybody else who occasionally sees a film like this: it's safeI'll give "What Women Want" a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Grace from Mad Max (and some minor points to ponder)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard this film called anti-feminist. You can't get more feminist than I am, and I thought it was fine! I won't spend more time on the Hunt-Gibson chemistry which everyone else has discussed to death, save to say I thought they made a believably flirty pair. On to some small observations:a. anyone notice how similar the scene in which Hunt and Gibson dance in the empty-bedroom of her new home is to the closing scene of "The Big Easy," in which Dennis Quaid dances Ellen Barkin around an almost-identical room? Same chemistry, same setting, same action, similar looks on both sets of protagonists.b. kudos to Gibson on his dancing!!! I never dreamed he'd be so good. His solo to "I've got you under my skin" blew me away. Most people will compare him to Astaire, but a better match is Gene Kelly. Just wonderful. Amazing grace from Mad Max. And his sudden assumption of gay body language as he moves into his final embrace with Marissa Tomei was deftly done, too. Let's see Mel in more roles that allow him to express body language other than "Me strong guy, me kill you, ugh." More dancing, PLEASE! Not, mind you, that he isn't awfully attractive doing the me-strong-guy thing... mmm, mmm, mmm. c. Delta Burke appears in a small role as Gibson's secretary. Not only is she perfect in the part -- no prima donna behavior at all -- but she looks twenty years younger than she is. Good for her!d. nice sub-plot on the character Erin planning suicide after maltreatment by cold-hearted bosses. A good lesson to any boss -- a reminder that a small decision for you may have a huge impact on your subordinates, especially young and impressionable types.e. Alan Alda must have enjoyed yet another chance to play a chauvinist klutz, so very much in contrast to his well-known feminist politics. After being Saint Hawkeye for so long, he's really thrown himself into being Mr. Nasty when he can. "Murder At 1600" and "Whispers in the Dark" come to mind. Ten stars for the humor, the lack of gender-spitefulness in either direction, the lively sub-plots about Erin and Gibson's daughter, and the perfect performances from all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Others have grasped most of what I see as deficient in this film. It is so unmemorable. The gimmick, of course, is that the Mel Gibson character is suddenly saddled with the "gift" of knowing what women are thinking when he is on the scene. This is fun for a few minutes, but when it pushes two hours, it's time for more popcorn. One of the important premises of life is the mystery of not knowing what others think. I can't think that anything but sadness can come from such realizations, and they do in this film. Gibson does so much mugging for the camera and acts in such a foolish way that he becomes a buffoon. Of course, we know from his background that he has been "submerged" in women since he was a little boy, but has turned into the consummate jerk: successful and self-centered. When he uses his knowledge for his own gain, he becomes something of a frantic monster. His love interest and adversary is actually a good person who must play hard ball to survive. He is allowed to show a bit of compassion when he becomes interested in the young woman who he suspects is suicidal, but then goes back to being a silly, erratic, sniveling puppy. Of course, it all works out in the end and all is forgiven. So what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of this film and the script were great. Unfortunately I didn't like the actors. I'm not that much a fan of Mel Gibson but think he's good in serious roles such as Braveheart and Man without a face. In this film I found him far too flippant. Helen Hunt I know less about but the romance between her and Gibson just didn't ring true ! The most touching aspect of the film was that of the young lady who was thinking about committing suicide. The film reminded me in some ways of "Forever Young " but I preferred the latter. I'm sure that better chosen actors would have produced a more emotional film. One thing which did please me was that unlike many modern American films which seem to pour disdain on cigarette smoking as if it were some kind of crime, this one goes the opposite way so compensates this ridiculous anti-smoking bias ! At the end of the film I was left frustrated feeling that a good idea had not been properly exploited to its maximum.</fullReview>

One day though, an accident happens and he realises that he he can hear what women think. At first he's not to sure about all this, so he talks to a strange psychologist (The brilliant, Bette Midler.) about what's going on. She tells him, he could this 'power' to his advantage and he does. This leaves him hearing what women think, including his new love interest, 'work-mate' Darcy McGuire, (Helen Hunt.) who just happened to get the promotion he wanted at work.The cast in the What Women Want is great. Mel Gibson, the star of the movie is really good and proves once again he can do comedy brilliantly. (My favourite movie of his, I think will always be the amazing Forever Young.) Oscar Winning actress Marisa Tomei who plays Lola is brilliant as usual. She's such an amazing actress, (One of my all time favourites.) and shines in everything she does. Helen Hunt gives a cool performance too and of course the small but memorable cameo performance by the brilliant Bette Midler is really great. I liked the idea for What Women Want and the movie was quite interesting all the time. Some parts really dragged on a little bit though, especially the ending. The music/soundtrack is good too, especially the amazing Christina Aguilera's hit single, What A Girl Wants, which went perfectly with the movie. Anyway, see What Women Want if you want to see a cool comedy or if you're a fan of the leads as they all do a pretty good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another movie where they spent more money and time on hype than on scripts and casting. Helen Hunt's character was flat. Mel was annoying. Marisa was underused, so to speak. This movie had funny moments, but then it tried to be serious too. If they really wanted it to be "what women want" they should have consulted a few women. It was watchable as a diversion, but I'd wait for it to hit the $1 rack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie one Saturday at my dad's fiancée's house, and, in my opinion, WHAT WOMEN WANT is a charming, romantic, fantastic, heart-warming, sweet, and funny romantic comedy. After Nick (Mel Gibson) had that little accident, I was amazed at the fact that he could read women's minds. When he heard what the little female poodle in the park was thinking, I burst out laughing! If you ask me, Lola (Marisa Tomei) was an absolutely snobby woman most of the time! It's hard for me to explain why. At one point in the movie, I wanted to say, "What is this? A spin-off of BOOMERANG?" I thought that Darcy (Helen Hunt) was a beautiful woman -- Especially in the attire she wore for work. If you ask me, she and Nick made the perfect match. When she and Nick danced together, I thought that was absolutely sweet. Also, I thought that Alex (Ashley Johnson) looked absolutely gorgeous in all the prom dresses she tried on -- Especially the long, black one with the spaghetti straps. If you ask me, the music was very nice. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "As soon as I can find this movie on VHS, I'm going to buy it." Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Mel Gibson or Helen Hunt, I recommend this movie. You're in for a real treat and lots of laughs, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is based on a simple tag-line, which is also being used for the title. The old theme, that men want to know what their counterpart is thinking at the moment.Mel Gibson (as Nick Marshall) in the main role is playing a successful middle-aged man, who works for a commercial enterprise in the middle of Chicago. His reputation as a chauvinistic 'bloke' and his huge self-esteem make him look like an idiot, like a macho from a 'no-womans' world. Although he is the most suitable man for the job as creative director, he is suddenly outranked by a newly hired manager, played by Helen Hunt (as Darcy McGuire). As clear as water, they don't like each other. As long as Darcy tries to develop a new commercial spot for women's products, giving everyone in her team a box, filled with woman's stuff. That evening, Nick, examing this box, gets an electric shock by falling in a bathtube with a hairdryer. After that, the films main theme is coming to action and Nick hears every single thought in every woman's head. Using this talent as a weapon to get what he wants, he couldn't help himself from falling in love with Darcy. And after many so-called funny scenes, they feel, that they belong together.I don't want and I don't need to tell you more of this love-comedy. The movie isn't very sophisticated or on a higher level of intelligence. Nevertheless another boring Sunday evening at home is well-spent if you watch this video-tape with your girlfriend. Cause she will like it!</fullReview>

He hadn't much material to work with here but he really did look out of place trying to be kind to every woman considering his previous efforts in lethal weapon, bird on a wire. This film dragged on for ever with contrived ways of allowing mel to become free of his gift. The episode in the street at tthe end looked like it was written by someone after 10 pints. Helen hunt was the only brighrt part of the film as she always is. She and mel seemed to connect but alas that was the only point in the film where you could believe that there was some sort of chemistry in mel's character towards the women in the film.Good bye mel.

		<shortDescription>A comic formula to Disclosure, and as good as it comes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson works in advertising, his first challenge we see is to face a new female arrival at work (Helen Hunt), which he assume he would be give the employment role. His second and maybe the worse challenge is his new assignment, to think like a women, in order to promote a product for women. Devorced, and now a playboy, he fines it hard to start with, but accident gives him the ability to hear what women thinks. He first finds it difficult to cope, after a visit to a shrink, female obviously, makes him realise that this is a special gift and should be grateful. It's perfect, and he decides to use this hocus-pocus formula for his new assignment, and maybe gets the job he wants. In the middle of all this is the coffee shop chic, played by Marisa Tomei, who end up having great fun in the bedroom, but he ends up dumping her, in an understanding way. The other person is his teenage daughter from his previous marriage, and his role as a father seems vague at first, but ends up a super-dad, rescuing her from a common teenage crisis.But the only thing hits me is his employment status, as it is so similar to Disclosure, and that dialogue, ?as good as it comes', sound like another Helen Hunt movie.Watching Mel showing his feminine side is perhaps the big comic prize in the movie, but too much of it was reveal in the trailers. Senior audiences would appreciate his dance sequence with the Frank Sinatra song, yet I find it amusing. Helen Hunt look great until the restaurant scene where she kisses Mel, she looks dreadful and old. Some other Hollywood chic should have played the coffee shop chic than award winner, Marisa Tomei.</fullReview>

I think it's great and funny in it's ability to make me laugh outloud as he acquires telepathy geared only for the female mind. It's also filled with stars galore with Alan Alda, Marissa Tomei, Lauren Holly, Delta Burke and Ashley Johnson from "Growing Pains" who seems to be becoming quite a babe herself. Gibson and Helen Hunt have a remarkable chemistry much like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. All I can say is it's a wonderful film !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me start of by saying that this is a great comedy. Mel Gibson fits just in perfectly as the somewhat cocky, macho who does not treat women correctly just as Helen Hunt fits in perfectly as the adorable, warmhearted, smart, career - making woman. But all of Mel Gibson's character seems to change after he get's 'the gift'. The fact that he can hear what women think, provides a number of hilarious scenes, but luckily this film also shows some romance and some emotional which I liked very much. Call me a softie, but I enjoyed myself immensely and found myself smiling after I had seen the film - not really knowing why - but the whole thing was just adorable, as were the Mel Gibson's and Helen Hunt's character.There was just one question that haunted me after seeing the film and the extra features on DVD: 'Who had the guts to make such crappy extra's for a film that GOOD?' I mean come on. Where are the bloopers and stuff. I happen to know Mel Gibson is something of a goofball sometimes and I'm sure there must have been something more interesting than the behind the scenes and interview crap they put on that disc.8 out of 10</fullReview>

I think i have watched it at least 20 times!Mel Gibson did a breath taking job!HE is also a great dancer! i have to disagree with some of yall about who should have played Hunts part i dont think anyone eles could have played it an better then she did. And if she wasnt a good actor then why would there be such a big demand for her! i think she is really working her way up in hollywood! I think she is one of the better actress in hollywood she can play any role. and she dazzles every role she plays! the same with Mel Gibson ya we all think of him as Braveheart! but he can do other roles besides the really mocho one! i think they did very well on this movie! an di think the movie should have been longer i do NOT think it was to long! well that is just me feeling about the movie! i give it a 10/10 its a have to see~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect too much, but on taking ten minutes out of curiosity to check it, I found a pleasantly witty and enthusiastic movie. Mel Gibson both oozes cool and plays the edge-of-sanity thing as required, and the always gorgeous (but slightly gaunt in this movie) Helen Hunt is great as the wholesome all-American career girl.The ending is predicable and a bit flat, but it's the journey there that makes it worth watching, especially for an all too brief appearance by Bette Midler as Mel's shrink.I hate knocking films like this. They don't pretent to be anything more than they are, fun. In short, an undemanding comedy come 'man finding his sensitive side' story that should suffice on one of those days when you just don't feel like thinking too much or watching Arnie flex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundhog Day II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a theory that the writers of ?What Women Want` were fans of the brilliant Harold Ramis film ?Groundhog Day`. Concerning their base ideas, these films have more in common than it seems. Supernatural things happen to both characters, Phil Connors and Nick Marshall, things that are actually never explained. First, they see their fate as a punishment, later they learn how to take advantage of it. In the end, the magic's over and they both got a woman. In one point, the similarity is most striking. They both have a peculiarity no other movie has: During watching, you're getting so terribly jealous of the main character that it's hard to get through the rest of the movie.I don't have to say that ?Groundhog Day` was there first, that its dialogues are brilliant and that the cynical tone of Bill Murray makes the movie enjoyable in every, really every single minute. ?What Women Want` is hilarious at the beginning but towards the end, it develops a sentimentality that is really displaced. I asked myself why they did that. It was not necessary; there would have been a number of possibilities to end the movie differently, without hurting the American happy-end tendency. And with the tone, also the sharpness of the jokes sinks and they become predictable.For Mel Gibson, of course, this movie is an absolute success. He was never so good, actually. And Helen Hunt is a jewel, no surprise. One thing disappointed me: If you consider that the director is a woman, you may rightly hope that, by watching her film, you finally find out what women want. I still don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILER ALERTI love Mel Gibson, and he had his funny moments, but a movie that claims to know what women want has a tall order to fill (and this movie doesn't fill it). Although I don't generally like Helen Hunt, I thought she wasn't bad as a hard-shell-but-soft-on-the-inside career woman. Most of the other female characters were flat, with little or no depth. Bette Midler as a psychiatrist tells him he can now "rule the world" with his newfound ability to hear women's thoughts - so he uses his powers to get Marisa Tomei into bed, which we are told is the one thing he can do before his powers anyway (although maybe now he's a better lover). And are we supposed to think he's doing her a favor by telling the white lie that he's gay as the reason why he didn't call her after their mind-blowing sex? That just proves he's hasn't learned anything about how to treat women right! Here's an example of the film's pretending to be about female empowerment and male sensitivity when it's really just as conventional as "The Rules": Marisa is worried that if she sleeps with Mel, he won't call her, while Helen decides not to ask him over after their date (actually, Mel helps her along with this decision), and lo and behold, what happens? He doesn't call Marisa and the virtuous Helen wins his heart. And what about the poor suicidal geek? Are we supposed to believe getting a job as a copywriter saves her from her misery? This girl needs a shrink to work through her insecurity and depression. I know, it's only romantic comedy, but it tries to have this great insight when all it has is cliches, platitudes and a bad ending. Horrible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Mel Gibson, and I like Helen Hunt (the quintessential sexy girl next door to me), but they don't really go together that well. Part of the problem is that Mel, bless him, is getting a bit too old for romantic roles. (Or "young male stud" romantic roles, to be more precise.) He seems way too old for Helen, but they are obviously supposed to be contemporaries. This is the type of film you really, truly want to like -- but it pushes you away with so much of what is frankly just plain bad writing (the actors try and try to save it too --I'm sure they all had trouble deciding how to read some of the lines!). Marissa Tormei is just plain wasted, and the sex scene with her is distasteful. Then Mel's character dumping her by claiming he is gay -- I was embarrassed for everyone involved in that -- the writer, the actors, the director -- and the camera men who had to shoot it! The absurdity of it beggars description. The way it is ends is pretty predictable too. It should have been much better! (A different writer, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks -- or?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this one a miss in the theater, but it's really not bad as a rental. Having tried valiently to enjoy Mel Gibson in "The Patriot" the evening before, I am delighted to say that "What Women Want" restored him in my esteem; I think that in this stage of his career he should definitely stick with romantic comedy and leave the boys-bombs-and-bombast alone."What Women Want" is perfectly enjoyable popcorn. Are we surprised at the ending? No, but did we really expect to be? I actually laughed out loud several times and it left me in a good mood. I truly don't understand why so many people seem to have an axe to grind regarding Helen Hunt - this seems as inexplicably virulent as the Republican Right's boiling personal hatred for Bill Clinton (even pre-scandal). I thought she was just fine in this, and I bought the chemistry between her character and Gibson's. However, it is true that the female characters are a little flat and predictable, and they probably could have done without Marisa Tomei's character entirely. The writing in general is clever enough; when Gibson's character talks to himself it rings true and is funny. The premise is engaging and despite the Nike product placement, the ad agency scenes were enjoyable. My only real objection is that the ending seems quite rushed.</fullReview>

I did enjoy the notion that being able to hear what women were really thinking basically turned out to be a waking nightmare for the character. Just a couple of comments here...if you're going to use the idea of some kind of magic power in a film, I think you're obligated to have a certain degree of intellectual content (see "Frequency" for a better example of misuse of suspension of disbelief)... no REAL man would ever admit he was gay , if he wasn't. Which leads me to my next point...Men don't really care what women think, they don't really care what ANYBODY thinks. They might be interested to know, but it wouldn't really change their behavior... Finally, how come all the women in mainstream film look like women from porn films of thirty years ago and all the women in porn look like mainstream actresses?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You never know whether they've given you all the good lines in the trailer of a comedy - thankfully, here they didn't. We already knew that Helen Hunt is an actress who can range from comedy to more serious work. And, despite the fact that I believe that Mel Gibson has more range than any actor today (from Lethal Weapon to the best Hamlet I've ever seen), the question was how would he hold up in a mainly comedic role. He was not a disappointment. Like other characters he has played, Gibson made this guy seem like it was his own persona. Hunt acted to exactly what we expect of her comedy, a fine performance. All in all, and I don't glow over many comedies, much less romantic comedies, this was a fine one. It was just plain fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So that's what women want</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely cute movie. Enjoyed it thoroughly, though Mel Gibson's character could have been portrayed just as good by Tom Hanks or Robin Williams. Gibson does the job and is very believable. Helen Hunt is wonderful and her performance is worth just seeing the movie. She has moved into the league of great actresses and can on her sheer beauty and ability carry a movie. The story is cheesy at first and this could be in part blamed on Mel Gibson's overacting, but he may have been pushing it to get the point across about his characters personality. I found it funny that his two assistants minds couldn't be read as they didn't think. There's several little subplots that somewhat resolve themselves at the end, but this does not damage the movie too much and the ending is somewhat sweet. Very tasteful movie and would put this next to the movie "What planet are you From" on the shelf of life for guys like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senseless bashing comes to an end....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the film What Women Want and don't really understand why it has received some pretty harsh comments. Some comment that Marisa Tomei needed a bigger part. As if! Marisa Tomei is not lead female, giving her a bigger part would only confuse the audience.I believe Mel Gibson did an excellent portrayal of a chauvinistic pig with a twist. That twist was, of course the ability to hear what women think. Helen Hunt did an absolutely fabulous job at being the strong, yet feminine leading lady. The chemistry between Hunt and Gibson was extravagant. Judy Greer was also wonderful in this film playing unappreciated Erin.The only bad comment I did agree with was that the ending came a little fast dumping information and then ending, however, this flaw was entirely insignificant to the all over likability of this movie.</fullReview>

Nick(Mel Gibson) uses his powers to get what he wants(into Helen Hunt's pants and an ad campaigne).then realizes his wrongs and runs around making it all o.k. he should have been fired. as far as what woman want, the movie would have you believe it is to be manipulated by good looking men and then forgive the men for their shortcomings. great message guys!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy it for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was surprised at how much disparaging remarks this movie got.If you're stuck on your impressions of the type and personality of what actors Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt have played in previous movies then I think you'll fall into the category of criticism for the two as a romantic couple.I found the chemistry between them believable...Hunt is suppose to play a smart classy woman, strong in a man's world (executive position), but sensitive and that's exactly what I found her to be. I think she delivered her lines quite naturally and simply can't believe how cold and unnatural people say she was, I guess it's in the eye of the beholder. Gibson is an excellent cast for the macho man's man who is also able to be very natural in the sensitive parts of the role (can you imagine pretty faced Tom Cruise or youthful looking Michael J. Fox playing macho men?).Sure I agree Marisa Tomei was excellent in this movie but the comments that she should have had a bigger part, well that wasn't the point of this movie when the final script was set, so there's no point in deliberating on it. The director's message (at least what I interpreted it as) was that she wanted this chauvinistic male to learn to "see" what he was and that it didn't work in this modern world with modern women and finally be "saved" from his faulty character. It wasn't really about "What women want" but about the development and change of one man. If you have access to a DVD player, rent the DVD and listen to the comments of the Director, you'd get a better understanding and enjoyment of what the movie was about and why certain people were cast in the roles they were.The only criticism I really had with the movie was the ending. It seemed too rushed. All of a sudden at the end, everything comes out in 5 minutes, mistakes are forgiven and everything is happy. I don't think they gave Helen Hunt's character enough time to absorb Nick's (Gibson) confession before she forgave him..that was a little unbelievable.Otherwise the movie was a great length, I didn't think it was too long, but then I wasn't bored like others were, and I liked the comedy, laughed in all the right parts and bought into the romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gibson and Hunt Surprise in Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Wow! This has to be the surprise hit of 2000. I passed this up in the theatres, unable to visualize Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt in a Romantic Comedy--("What a case of horrible miscasting"). However, out of curiosity, I did watch the video and found it to be a very worthwhile, enjoyable movie.Can Mel Gibson do it all, or what? Shakespeare (HAMLET), Action/Adventure (BRAVEHEART, THE PATRIOT, etc.), Drama (RANSOM)--we were even treated to a little dance number (a la Gene Kelly)--o.k., so he's no Gene Kelly, but it was still a nice touch.We got to see a softer, more feminine Helen Hunt here--even though that part of her character may have been inappropriate for a "Man-eating bitch, Darth Vader of the ad world." But, if she were totally in that role, a romantic interlude would have been even more inappropriate. I believe this is Helen Hunt's best role to date.The story line is similar to DISCLOSURE, with Michael Douglas and Demi Moore. Nick Marshall (Gibson) is in line for a promotion to Ad Executive, but in a surprise move, Darcy McGuire (Hunt) is brought in from another agency because the company wants to explore the woman's market and they consider her ideas invaluable toward that end.Gibson, meanwhile, is the ultimate charmer, a real ladies' man. Or at least, so he thinks. In a funny scene where Nick is "trying out" several women's products (pantyhose, wonderbra, hair removal, etc.) in order to understand the feminine psyche, his teenage daughter and her boyfriend walk in on him.Nick slips and falls in the bathtub with a hair-dryer, and the resulting shock somehow affects his brainwaves so that he can "tune in" to what a woman is actually thinking--read their minds. CAUTION: Men, don't try this at home. You might actually find out what women ARE thinking, "I wish you were dead, you rascal, you." There are some things we are better off not knowing, trust me. As men, we are just not strong enough to handle it.Nick, as the cad he really is, uses his new "power" to try and usurp from Darcy the job he thought should have been his to begin with. He reads her thoughts, steals her ideas--the company CEO, played effectively by Alan Alda, thinks the ideas are Nick's and not Darcy's. When the agency lands the prestigious Nike account, Nick gets all the credit, and Darcy is fired. But there's one problem. Nick is falling in love with Darcy and realizes what a heel he is. He goes to her and confesses and, well, you know the rest of the story.Good supporting performances by Marisa Tomei as Nick's bratty teenage daughter, Lauren Holly as Gigi, the ever-rejected girlfriend and Judy Greer as Erin, the geek with glasses who carries around all those files. There is even a cameo by Bette Midler as the lady psychiatrist.I'm not even going to comment on the film's constant referrals to gays, I just wish Hollywood didn't spend so much time striving for political correctness.Although this flick may not have the staying power of a WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, or GROUNDHOG DAY, it is a very enjoyable romantic comedy. Guys, rent this one if you want to impress your date on how introspective you are to a girl's needs--just be sure to keep a trigger-lock on your hair dryer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They want Mel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson's a pretty good-looking guy. I feel secure enough in my maleness to say that. In fact, I can say it with pride. He's one DAMN fine man! Woooooo hooooooo! Oops, got carried away there. But it just goes to show you that even we devoutly heterosexual guys realize he's kinda hot. And that's important for this film to work. Mel plays Nick, an incredibly sexist, egotistical, arrogant, womanizing ad-agency executive. He's the kind of guy who guys want to be and who women want to have. This might explain his popularity a little. Nick's all set to get the big promotion he feels he deserves - to Creative Director of his ad agency. His boss and mentor Dan (Alan Alda) calls him into his office for a talk. Nick's all ready for the big news. Can't wait for the corner office on the 44th floor. And then Dan drops the bombshell on poor Nick. Not only isn't he getting the promotion, Dan's hired someone else to take the job! And not only that, it's a woman! So now our poor spoiled boy - who has seen women as either sex objects or hired help, and sometimes both - has to report directly to a woman. Oh, poor, poor Nick. Yes, I can practically hear you ladies out there, just oozing with empathy for this lost soul. A fine comeuppance, you're thinking. He's getting what he deserves, you think. His new boss, Darcy (Helen Hunt), in her first staff meeting, hands out kits to each of the ad people that contain "feminine" products (such as lipstick, padded bras, eyeliner, stockings, and, of course, wax). She wants the company to start paying more attention to the female consumer, noting that billions of dollars were spent by females the previous year, and none of that cash went to their company. So Nick takes the stuff home and, drunk on wine, tries it all on. Has to keep his job, you know. And minutes later, a freak electrical accident involving a bathtub and a hair dryer leaves Nick with the most dubious of gifts: the ability to read the minds of women. Hmm. I don't know about my fellow males, but I'm not sure I want to read the minds of women. As if reading their minds would help me understand anything! But poor, poor Nick. He hears EVERYTHING women (even a female poodle) are thinking, with the predicted madcap hilarity. But it's spooky for our favorite chauvinist. What's he to do? Well, he IS a chauvinist. So he uses his newfound ability to steal Darcy's ideas and present them as his own! What a guy! The movie wouldn't be all that wondeful with only one plot going on around Nick, so we get the added pleasure of him having to "watch" his 15-year-old daughter while his ex-wife is on her honeymoon, of him dealing with a semisweet, semipsychotic coffeehouse babe, of him dealing with a mousy coworker/underling. It's all presented to make Nick's life look chaotic, although there are few people who wouldn't trade places with him in general (except for that mind-reading thing). I mean, let's face it. He's attractive to women, has money, and... well, what else is there, really? So how does this comedy of telepathy end? It's not unpredictable. Knowing that Nick is stealing Darcy's ideas, how do you think he'd resolve his situation? And knowing the peripheral plots, how do you think he'll tie them all together? Because of Gibson's seemingly endless charm (like Cary Grant, he can simply grin sheepishly and win hearts), this movie stays afloat. He has a capable, if not distinguishable, supporting cast. Oh, and check out the six-pack old Mel's sporting. That's what the good life can get you: a personal trainer and a lifetime supply of Tae-Bo tapes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why movies could be too long ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts a little emotional. Nick (Mel Gibson) is so arrogant that he doesn't even notice, what people around him happen to think about him. When Darcy (Helen Hunt) is promoted as his boss, his philosophy of life crumbles ...From this point, the movie makes a very enjoyable comedy. The audience is delivered quite a good insight into his moral -- compared to his workmates, who are astonished, what a man Nick actually can be.Yet, as soon as he falls in love with Darcy, the whole film is drawn slowly but irresistibly towards a drama losing much of its potential. It seems that Nancy Meyers tried to combine the funny plot with an appealing drama. Unfortunately, the movie just can't cope with such a claim.The performances of Gibson and Hunt are remarkable. Particularly the scene he plays Fred Astaire in, made me laugh heartily. Altogether, I give this movie 8 of 10 points, since it _is_ worth watching. But the second half could have been either cut or improved !</fullReview>

The maid and the doorman (who disappear without any fufillment) provide the only real humor. Did I mention four employees each a different female stereotype?

		<shortDescription>The comedy sparkles, the romance fizzles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly what women want is as much Mel Gibson as they can get. This combination comedy and love story starts smartly, but unravels when the love story attempts to take itself seriously. However, that didn't keep the film from topping $200 Million worldwide at the box office.Nick Marshall is a `man's man', a self-absorbed chauvinist who has little respect for women. When his big promotion is given to Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), Nick plots for a way to bring her down. In the course of trying out women's products to get `the female perspective', he accidentally electrocutes himself, giving himself the power to read women's minds. Though highly contrived (why only women's thoughts?), the comedic gimmick is novel and produces numerous hilarious moments. Nick decides he is going to use his special powers to undermine Darcy in her position and seduce her in the process. Predictably, they fall in love, which leads to a soulless, but schmaltzy romance that throws a cold bucket of water on the merriment.Director Nancy Meyers has written a number of successful lightweight comedies (`Private Benjamin', `Father of the Bride', `The Parent Trap'), often teaming with her husband, director Charles Shyer. This is her second directorial project after `The Parent Trap' and is by far the most ambitious project she has undertaken. It is clear here that comedy is her strong suit. The comedy bits are well done and the gimmick is liberally explored with good results. In contrast, the romance is stilted and unnatural (due in part to the abysmal chemistry between Gibson and Hunt) and Meyers doesn't know when to quit, pouring it on ad nauseam.Mel Gibson is the right actor for the comedy and the wrong actor for the romance. He has always done well at wry macho comedy (See Lethal Weapon 1-4), but when it comes to romance, he's a dud. Though intoxicating to the female eye, Gibson is all thumbs when it comes to sensitive and sentimental interchanges. Like Nick, Gibson is a `man's man' and he is unable to bring the character to the proper transition. Helen Hunt often reminds me of Jody Foster in that she seems like a man trapped in a woman's body. However, unlike Foster, Hunt doesn't seem comfortable in that prison and always comes across as if she is having a gender crisis. Whereas Foster is an electrifying actor who is obviously at ease with her no-bull personality, Hunt feels compelled to force out her sensitive side, making her constantly appear awkward and unnatural. This disconnect is particularly grating here, especially given Gibson's handicap in the sentimentality department. The one compensation is that Hunt's deadpan seriousness is a comedic asset in her role as straight-woman (which is one of the primary reasons `Mad About You' succeeded on TV).Once again, Marisa Tomei proves that she is one of the most underrated actors in film with a show stopping performance as Lola. I have often wondered why she doesn't get meatier roles. She has mostly been relegated to quirky character roles, where she invariably outshines the leads. Her confrontation with Nick here is one of the highlights of the film.This film is easy to like. It can be forgiven its abortive attempt at matchmaking between Gibson and Hunt simply because the comedy bits are so funny. I rated it a 7/10. If Meyer had kept the romance light and lively, it could have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong-headed, but still hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard many people complain about how the current Hollywood stars are so different from those of the 40's and 50's. Back then, they had charisma, style and they mostly knew how to act. Now, well, it's all about looks. However, once or twice something springs to life and gives us hope. In What Women Want, Mel Gibson takes a turn from he brutal violence of Braveheart and The Patriot and dances to Frank Sinatra, wears pantyhose and watches Martha Stewart.Gibson plays Nick Marshall, an divorced advertising executive who lives alone in a luxurious penthouse in New York. Nick lives the good, macho live. He flirts with the coffee shop attendant downstairs, he smokes cigars and in general has the whole macho thing going on. One day, Nick meets with his boss (Alan Alda) in the hopes of getting a new job. Instead, he finds out he lost the job to Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), supposedly the `maneating bitch Darth Vader of the ad world'. Darcy gives everyone a box of female products and tells them to think of some ads and tagline that could be thought up. Nick goes home that night and tries to think of them by wearing and using everything in it. He gets drunk and drops a bunch of bath pellets (is that what they're called?) on the floor. He steps onto them and slips into his tub, conveniently holding a blow dryer. The next morning, he wakes up with an incredible talent: he hears what women think.Now that Nick can read women's minds, he can use it to become the ultimate man. Right? The next hour is an uneasy mix of romance and comedy, but, strangely, not a romantic comedy. The tone shifts uneasily from these two and the tone is mismatched. That's not to say, however, that the movie isn't funny, because it is. The script is very well written, and the dialogue is very frank and funny.Gibson oozes charisma as Nick Marshall. This is what I meant by comparing him to the old time Hollywood stars. His character is macho and generally unlikeable, but he makes it worthwhile. We will probably see more of these kinds of roles for Mel. Helen Hunt, as Darcy, shows moderate talent, but she's far from As Good As It Gets. Marisa Tomei plays Nick's girlfriend that he mistreats exactly in the way he promised himself he wouldn't. Her part is relatively small and under-exploited. However, she is great. Other faces in the cast include Delta Burke, Loretta Devine and an unbilled Bette Midler.The biggest problem I had, besides the uneven jokes and shifting tone, is the message the movie gives. By the end, the moral seems to be ?You're either gay or macho'. In a movie that seems to want to decrease sexism issues, this material is misplaced. The ending also disappoints. The movie could've gone a clever, original way but instead it takes exactly the same plot turn as countless loads of crap have before. If the movie wasn't so confused and sexist, it would score an 8 because there is so much funny material in here. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What Women Want" really could have been something. A groundbreaking new comedy about the sexes. Sadly, it is not. There are moments of wit and brilliance, but it eventually screeches to a halt and it never recovers.Mel Gibson stars as Nick Marshall, a male chauvinist pig who works at an ad agency. He is expecting a promotion, but is passed over in favor of Darcy (Helen Hunt), a "bitch on wheels" from another agency.Right here, we have our first two problems. The Gibson character isn't really all that bad a guy. He's kind of charming in an offbeat way and not mean. What would have been welcome here is the Mel Gibson persona of "Lethal Weapon" or even better his Porter of "Payback". If he had been really mean, the film would have been funnier, I think. Also, Hunt's character isn't a bitch on wheels. Her Darcy is sympathetic and kind, which is exactly the opposite of what her character should be. A showdown between two mean, gnarly people would have made for great comedy.As for the film's premise (that Nick can hear women's thoughts), they don't take advantage of it like they should. I can imagine Gibson improvising all sorts of reactions to thoughts he really doesn't want to know. I can also think of some really tight spots that the Gibson character could have been lead into. But the script doesn't do anything a great comedy should.The film's ending is a real mess. Instead of bring it to the conclusion this film really deserves, it wheezes towards its' predictable (YAWN!!!) ending and even that is ended rather abruptly. But predictable endings can work and I don't think any intelligent viewer will buy this one.But there are good things in it, however. The scenes where Nick starts to steal ideas are howlers. Scenes with his daughter are often very funny. Bette Midler steals the show in a funny unbilled scene as Nick's divorce counselor (They should have done more with her character). I laughed a lot in a 20 minute stretch about halfway through and if they had just followed that lead, this could have been one of the Ten Best films of 2000. What we're left with is a funny premise and several promising scenes in search of a better script. Still, Gibson's wonderful performance makes me recommend it, despite my objections.*** out of 4 stars</fullReview>

Well, I think I laughed twice, both at parts that had been endlessly shown on commercials. And I found it creepy, not funny, when Mel tried on pantyhoses and attempted to wax his legs. Helen Hunt was a bore, as usual. Can she never bring emotion to a character? This was worse than her sobbing episode in "As Good As It Gets." Well anyway, this movie is also poorly titled, as no guy will be able to figure out what women want just by watching this movie. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar winner director Mel Gibson (The Year of Living Dangerously, Maverick) plays "Nick Marshall" a very likable guy in this movie. I still don't understand why nice looking guys have to direct to get Oscars. Robert Redford (A River Runs Through It) had to do the same thing as well as many others. I have not watched Mel in those Lethal Weapon movies, and thought that I did not know much about this a work, but actually I have several of Mel's movie in our movie library. An extremely handsome, religious family man, Mel is among Hollywood ?s top role models. The guy has so many kids. I wonder where he finds the time to be so fit... I liked Nick because he used his new found gift in a sensible way. Nick felt that he had abused it but I thought he was a pretty okay mind reader. He became a much better person after he was stuck by a lightning. My husband thinks he should have been able to keep the gift, just learn to control it.Oscar winner actress Helen Hunt (Mad about You, As God As It Gets) is always a pleasure to watch, and I am confident that I know her work. She looks extremely pretty in this movie. Even more than her normal natural beauty.I like the music in this movie and the movie has rhythm. I love that! The cast is fabulous, a real audience grabber. I had no idea that all those famous people were there. Alan Alda (Jake's Women) Beth Middler, Marisa Tomei, Lauren Holly, all those Oscar winner's!!!!!!! I guess no strugglling actor will do much with Icon Entertainment International and Paramount who seem to only want to deal with the big guys. The producers, directors, music are all of the finest of the fine and this movie had everything to succeed. This was not a struggling independent type movie. This is only for the cream of the crop. That I don't quite like, because I think the industry should always try to give chance to the new comers, but that is not true.The movie was very enjoyable, and we had fun watching. I will probably buy the tape and soundtrack. Who does not like Sinatra at his best? Although I don't like to compare, I felt that "Brigit Jones Diary" was less pretentious but a much better over all movie. Not so cliche! Or is Hollywood only after cliches!!!! Just wondering!!!Favorite scenes: Nick Marshall dancing and singing. That was really cool. Well the stair way case at the final scene reminded me too much of "As Good As It Gets" and with all this money and talent the last scene could be a little different. Overall this movie is a winner.Favorite Quotes: Darcy McGuire: What kind of knight in shining armor would I be if the man I love needs rescuing and I just let him walk out my door?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel was hilarious in this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie! Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt did an excellent job, and their chemistry was pretty good also.I thought it was romantic when they were dancing in Darcy's (Helen) apartment with the singer that was next door I believe it was, the end was pretty good when Nick (Mel) said too his daughter at the end 'believe me I know what I women goes through I've been their,' or something like that, I've only seen it once even though I want too see it again.Mr. Gibson did a pretty good job in his first romantic comedy it was certainly a nice change from doing his war drama's, by the end of the movie I was laughing hysterically that tears were in my eyes.Of course though I had too deal with my Mom drooling over Mel.I wouldn't mind seeing this movie again it's really good.Mel probilly had something all guys wish they had to be able too read womens thoughts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very funny. It describes a kind of telepathic quality that I believe many men would like to have. It is an elegant comedy with enchanting music ( I´m 65 ) with Sinatra songs and other mature songs that contribute to a very amusing mood when love takes control. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt are very god in the lead characters and Nancy Meyers directing is also very god. I had great fun! Probably an Oscar candidate in some category nest year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither Freud nor the filmmakers can explain chemistry, or the lack of it, between two people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic story idea must have seemed like a "can't-miss" at the studio pitch meeting: two Oscar-caliber stars answering Freud's famous question. But neither Freud nor the filmmakers can explain chemistry, or the lack of it, between two people. But that said, there is still enough star power here to afflict Freud himself with celebrity envy.Chauvinist advertising man Nick Marshall (Gibson) is passed over for a promotion to creative director at his agency by his boss (Alda) in favor of Darcy Maguire (Hunt), a superstar snagged from another firm. Just as Darcy begins to assert her authority over a rebellious Nick, he has an electrical accident at home, resulting in a sudden ability to read women's thoughts. He uses his new talent to undermine Darcy and to steal her ideas before she can even voice them. He also uses it to satisfy the love longings of Lola (Tomei), the latte lady at his favorite coffee shop. As the romantic comedy genre dictates, Nick and Darcy will eventually become attracted to one another, with Nick using his new skill to romantic and humorous advantage.Hunt, who has risked overexposure this year by appearing in four films, is completely believable as a serious, career-oriented businesswoman, but less credible as the object of Gibson's affection. And Gibson, once voted the sexiest man alive, has the innate humor and convincing screen presence to pull off a romantic lead, even though he has not done one for over a decade.The supporting roles are on the mark, with Alda perfect as the agency boss and Tomei terrific as the hesitant but hot-blooded rejected love interest. Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine are pleasingly vacant as Gibson's fawning assistants--whose minds he cannot read because, evidently, they have no thoughts of their own.The film's production design is flawless. A real life advertising agency often generates its own unique energy, and the filmmakers have successfully captured this--with realistic sight lines, accurate set design and authentic background action. The feeling is one of really being in the offices of a creative ad agency, not just a Hollywood version of one.What makes this film quite watchable is the star quality of the leads, the believable performances of the supporting cast and a great environment in which it all takes place.Rating: 2 1/2 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much when I went to see this movie. Just wanted to have some laughs after a hard day at work. But it turned out to be much better than expected.I thought it would be filled with stupid jokes and slapstick comedies, but it actually has funny dialogs and memorable moments! This is a tamer version of "100 Girls". It's about women and how men can't seem to understand them.But in this movie, Mel Gibson's character just happened to be able to listen to women's thoughts. What if it happened to all men? I guess it will only make the world even messier than before.Mel Gibson's performance is not that good, overshadowed by Helen Hunt, even though she's not the main character in the movie. But I have to give credit to his dancing. It was great!The songs are quite nice, but the plot is not really new. Everybody can guess the ending, but it doesn't stop this movie from being entertaining!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of Tomei would have made this film better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is OK, yet my problem with him in "What Women Want"(as with prior performances of his) is that he hams it up waaaaay too much. He steadily became more and more annoying as the film progressed, and by the time the credits came, I was glad to see him gone.I also question why Marisa Tomei was not utilized more. She has always played indecisive, neurotic women well (see her role as "Maggie" on TV's "A Different World" to see what I mean) and she does not disappoint here. Tomei's on-screen chemistry with Gibson was great, and it would have been a better film if she had been his primary love interest instead of Helen Hunt. Without a doubt, Tomei's scenes were the funniest of the movie, and she steals the show in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Product Placement is Ruining Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was fine if a bit long. I took my wife and she enjoyed it. Now onto the serious issue...Two words spring to mind when watching this film; NIKE and APPLE. This is, of course, no accident. The film industry has always been funded to a certain extent by corporations, but this film takes it to new, unchartered territory. It is clear that the film makers have no problem accepting corporate funding, fair enough, but at what price? Nike and Apple produce the vast majority of their goods in Asian sweatshops in order to generate maximum profit from cheap labour and generous tax breaks. This is old news, but most people tolerate these practices when buying goods, however misguided this may be. Although less damaging at first sight, should we have to accept a corporation's real life intrusion into a medium that is (in most cases) fantasy?As more and more film production depends on corporate sponsorship, we will see the emergence of full-length advertisements, and production values that a heavily geared towards the requirements of the sponsoring brand. Notice that in "What Women Want" there was no evidence of any sports gear apart from Nike, and no computer equipment except Apple. This is fantasy in another vein entirely; a fantasy where the viewer is cocooned into the world that the corporation wishes them to see.The independent producer may become a thing of the past. If their only source of income is sponsorship, freedom of speech and space will diminish, truth will be diluted, and protest will lose one more important outlet.Think about it.</fullReview>

We already knew that Gibson was gifted, but this movie showcases his talents and reminds us that he hasn't gotten older, just better. Helen Hunt has a remarkable sense of timing and she's never looked prettier. Marisa Tomei should be nominated for a best supporting actress role. Ashley Johnson also turned in an exceptional performance, so believable, as the sixteen year old daughter. Bette Midler was hilarious. Alda's dry wit underlies his fine performance. The script is clever, the directing excellent and there are fabulous views of Chicago. It's not rocket science folks, it's entertainment, and how very entertaining it was!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A screwball comedy that stops halfway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder if the makers of "What Women Want" are asking their audience or are presuming to tell them what the fairer sex desires. The movie begins promisingly as a modern screwball comedy with Mel Gibson playing Cary Grant. Here's a guy who an average dude would figure knew all the answers, but when he actually gets the info firsthand, thanks to an electrical conduit to the Twilight Zone, he doesn't know exactly what to do with it. But here's a guy who thinks fast and talks faster so eventually he's able to take advantage of his "gift." One problem with this movie is that it tries to get too politically correct in the sense that Mel/Cary gets spread too thin, not only as the hunk every babe craves, but also as a father becoming newly acquainted with his responsibility as a parent. This is wonderful family counseling, but it makes for anemic cinema. This provides the demarcation between what could have been an okay screwball misadventure into a romantic "chick flick." Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, except that in this case the film changes gears with an audible "clunk" that will get most guys to sniffing for a smoking transmission and most gals for the nearest pit stop. I like Gibson's comedic presence very much and I think the first part of the film came off very well. There were some moments of genuine, side-splitting levity, especially when Gibson experimented with some women's products in the supposed privacy of his home. Then that other part of the film started. One other problem is the lack of chemistry between Gibson and Helen Hunt. Gibson gives and gives during their scenes together, but Hunt somehow finds it difficult to take. We never do figure out exactly what it is that women want, but on second thought, maybe we're just better off not knowing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Serves Up What Women Want</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe this one should have been called "Payback." Do you remember those old teasing, technicolor Doris Day flicks from the sixties (pre-Lib) like That Touch of Mink and Lover Come Back, where Doris plays a perfectly competent career woman who becomes utterly goofy when she encounters Cary Grant or Rock Hudson? The last scene always had her coming completely apart as the big male envelopes her in his arms and utters something to the effect of "There, there, little woman.." Well, this wonderful Sinatraesque movie is a spin on that--- except, to the delight of the distaff side of the human race, it is Mel Gibson being enveloped by Helen Hunt at the end. Before we reach that conclusion we are all treated to Mel dancing, Mel making love, and Mel enduring the rigors of pantyhose. A genie could not have brought three better wishes.Don't expect to learn what women want (as if anyone could tell you that!) The movie offers more entertainment than insight. But it sure depicts what most women will enjoy. Men, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This looked like a pretty cool movie from the trailer. Okay, I laughed a bit and there is some pretty cool things about this movie, but overall, What Women Want is nothing short of a letdown.Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson), Playboy and Hot Shot in advertising, thinks he's God's gift to women. After a little accident, he discovers that he is suddenly able to hear what women really think. First, Nick is pretty disappointed when he discovers that his beloved macho behaviour does not exactly contribute to being desired. Then, his upcoming dream position in the company is being given to a new team member: Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), not only a woman, but a man-eating one, also is a very talented ad expert. So, Nick decides to sabotage his new boss by reading her thoughts and selling her ideas as his own. Unfortunately, love gets in his way.Mel Gibson is very watchable as a guy getting in touch with his feminine side, and the idea is original, but the love story is too soppy, making this far too romantic and not enough of a comedy. It also has an over-long running time which seems to drag on for longer than the 126-minute running time which I was told by IMDb. Still, there's always the interesting characters and a very good first hour to keep you intrigued. (let down by a lazy second hour). Oh, I must mention one stand-out in the first 60 minutes; it's when Nick hears what a female poodle is thinking ("Misuer! I need to poop!")A great disappointment, which is, thank God, not as bad as Mel Gibson's earlier 2000 film, The Patriot, but it isn't extremely far off the mark, either.I rate What Women Want 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expecting to see Mel Gibson strut his funny side, I went into What Women Want eagarly awaiting the comedy. I came out tired and bored. Sure, the movie was predictable. Sure it was another cutsie plot. But when it was funny, it was reeeaal funny. Gibson does a great job with the comedy, along with Marissa Tomei, Bette Midler, and various other cameos. Yeah, some of the writing too deliberate: Look! Now we're poking fun at men! Now we're poking fun at women! Oh god, the stereotypes are atacking me!!! But mostly, the jokes were fun and quirky. That is, until, Helen Hunt appears on the scene. Now, I loved Hunt in Mad About You, and comedy is her thing. But this role was pathetic. What's more fun than watching Helen Hunt play Helen Hunt? The whole relationship between Gibson's and Hunt's characters was boring and expected. The last twenty minutes was frustrating and drawn out, just like the end of a romantic comedy shouldn't be. Show me more laughs, less rolls of the eyes, and you've got yourself a movie. Enjoyable, entertaining, but nothing seems special about this one. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

When he falls in the shower and is electrocuted, he is suddenly granted the power to read their minds. Too bad they had little more to say than, "Sometimes I fake a headache to get out of sex." and "He's so gay!" I can't say it was disappointing, because I didn't go in expecting much. All the same, probably a bad movie to watch unless you are feeling extremely tolerant.</fullReview>

I thought Mel Gibson was fabulous, and who can forget Alan Alda (Hawkeye from "M*A*S*H") in a small but memorable role?I recommend at least viewing it once.

Mel Gibson has many qualities that, yes, make him a sexy man, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't have the ability to be funny.

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of lighthearted feel good comedies (I loved Wedding Singer, Back To School, etc.), but the makers of this film don't seem to have a grasp on making an entertaining comedy film. The idea for the film is nothing original. The idea of a man suddenly being able to hear people's thoughts is from a Twilight Zone episode. (Just like Mel Gibson sidling up to strangers on the street once he realizes he has this power, in the TZ episode a man wanders the streets incredulously, also sidling up to strangers, amazed that he has this newfound ability to hear thoughts).As for comedy, what comedy?? We are supposed to chuckle at rugged good looks type Gibson attempting to wax his leg, dance around his apartment listening to his daughter's Meredith Brooks CD, and becoming embarrassed as the same teenage daughter walks in with her boyfriend and finds her father wearing hose and a bra. Of course this kind of situational humor is the kind we have seen over and over in Three's Company type sitcoms. It may be a big guffaw for trailer park hicks who take their kids to a movie once every three months, but to anybody with an IQ over 90 it just comes off as cliched. We aren't even redeemed by a witty one liner or two.The movie is further derailed by forced and awkward subplots, such as Mel's relationship with his daughter (which for all the praise on these boards doesn't take up enough actual screen time to make us care one way or another about it). We also get uneasy (and UNFUNNY!) subplots involving Mel trying to extricate himself from the aftermath of a one night stand by explaining to his emotional female partner that he's gay, and Mel trying to save a young female worker at his office from committing suicide.The movie's only real high points are the relaxed and unpretentious performance from the always dead on Helen Hunt, and the realistic chemistry between her and Gibson. But as a piece of writing and directing in other areas, all we get is a forced, shmaltzy mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started out really fine. You have a few laughs about Gibson's behavior etc etc. But after an hour or so you start wondering where the speedy entrance went. The story slows down to a crawl and leaves you, the audience, looking at you nails out of boredom.When is Hunt going to play another role than this. She seems to be stuck here, and I believe she can do so much better. Tomei was fabulous but as always she gets the small role in the backseat. Gibson is hilarious in the first half, but then drops into this melodramatic "what am I doing" routine. If he was a real "man's man" he would not have doubted his actions.Two hours was way too long. A lot of the storylines could have been handled way faster or left hanging completely, we wouldn't have cared. Twenty minutes of the final and this would have been a lot more endurable.See it if you want ultimate fluff, if you don't skip it.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lateral remake of "Goodbye Charlie" that provides a moderately entertaining, if unsatisfactory answer to its own question.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have ever seen the 1964 Debbie Reynolds movie, "Goodbye Charlie," you have seen most of the points this movie tries to make. "What Women Want" puts a man into women's heads, rather into one woman's body, but the results are much the same: stereotypical insensitive chauvinistic woman-user experiences a supernatural metamorphosis and learns what it's like on the other side, then once we, the audience have attained enlightenment, the supernatural phenomenon expires.Mel Gibson is the clod who uses women in this one, and Helen Hunt is both the principal victim and primary source of the Gibson character's enlightenment. He is the typical cad who women revile even as they lay down (literally) before him, and other men all but genuflect before his prowess. He is then accidentally and miraculously enabled, for most of two hours in this decidedly chick flick, to read women's minds - even the minds of little girls and female dogs (puns avoided). Initially, he is terrified and overcome, but when he goes to a shrink, played in a cameo role by Bette Midler, who inspires him to exploit his new talent to discover the great mystery of all time, "What do women want?" oddly, Bette's character, being a woman herself, seems oddly intrigued by the prospect of answering this. Doesn't she know? Perhaps that scene itself poses a much deeper question, namely, do women know what they want? And if, unlike Ms. Midler's character, they do, in fact know, why don't they just tell the rest of us? What's the big mystery about, anyway?In any case, Gibson's charmingly boorish character, inspired by his psychologist, sets out to use his new insights to exploit women even more effectively than before. The things he does are unimportant. Predictably, he manipulates himself into their bedrooms and into the Hunt character's job. Gibson's character -also predictably- soon learns that the things he does -or does not do- hurt people. He finds their pain is his pain. Incidentally, early in the movie he loses his anticipated and, despite his personal flaws, apparently well earned advertising firm promotion to Hunt's character, who is brought in to lead the company in its exploitation of the surging female market. Notably, there is little evidence that the filmmakers intended any social commentary on either the ethics of hiring a woman simply because she is a woman, or of using a woman (or man, for that matter) to lead the company in its exploitation of women in the marketplace. The film also buys into the notion that such a man is held in esteem by his comrades, instead of exploring the more typical reality that, while he might be envied for his ability to charm the opposite sex, a man like one Gibson portrays is more often held in contempt by other men. These were glaring opportunities that went unseized.Gibson does a creditable job, as always, in this role, and he gets to play both Mr. Macho and Mr. Sensitive. Helen Hunt is competent, but the role really doesn't have a great deal of meat to it. The writer and director could have afforded the character more dimension, and the dynamics between the two leads more grist, if she had come to the job as a woman bearing the scars of having battled her way up through the glass ceiling. He could have used his insight to help her heal those wounds, soften as he himself softened.When "Goodbye Charlie" made many of the same points 35 years ago, it was a time when they were much more fresh than today. but "What Women Want" is more stereotyping of men and has no one playing the "nice guy" role to lend some balance and reaffirm that some of us -maybe even most of us- see women as real people. While both movies use humor to good effect to soften the edge of their messages, the dialogue in "Charlie" was often more clever, if more innocent, in a more innocent time. And somehow, it came across as less a "chick flick" than an experiment in "what if" with a dose of cummupence. There is little experimentation in "What Women Want" and I'm not sure anyone deserved the specific injustices that were passed around over the course of the movie.One other thing. The bottom line -the answer to the question, "What do women want?"- is, if the movie is to be believed, simply this: Women want their men to be women. I hope not.Three stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect ground breaking insights in this pleasant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok ... so I'd read the reviews and wasn't expecting a great deal (although why people were looking to a movie, a comedy no less, for answers to the age old question "what do women want?" was a little beyond my comprehension). Perhaps the two down falls of this film is that is a fraction overlong and there are a few too many sub-plots running. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find not a bad film!So, Nick, played by Mel Gibson, is a chauvinistic male pig who has little regard for anyone but himself, is a greatly flawed man, had a showgirl mum and women who waited on him hand and foot and didn't have a decent male role model (save for loan sharks and shysters). In walks Darcy, played by Helen Hunt, who is apparently a man-eating ball breaker and has also taken the job that Nick had himself earmarked for. The "ball breaking" Darcy is never revealed, but a soft, unsure but apparently in-control one is. Nick then has an accident and finds that he is able to hear what women are thinking.It doesn't really take a rocket scientist to figure out what's going to happen in the end, but there are some nice surprises along the way. Marisa Tomei does a excellent job, given the limited role of her character Lola (although I was a little miffed regarding the treatment of her character - see above, too many sub-plots). A marvelously hilarious cameo by Bette Midler, was a highlight for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny, lacking in some points-esp. middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie at the theatre, and I really liked it. Gibson is hilarious, as he always is, and I think Hunt did a good job as well, tho I would have rather seen someone else in the role. The premise of the movie is very original...and it's done in an original way. One of the big guys at the advertising firm thinks he is about to get a big promotion, but instead they give it to a woman, because they're not doing as hot as they should be with that particular demographic, and women are starting to make up the biggest group of consumers....anyhow...Gibson is a pig, who treats women like c**p. He lives the rich life, doing whatever he wants, neglecting his daughter who lives with her mother, dating tons of women, and treating the ones he's not dating like servants. He gets into an accident (during a very funny scene) and he has wakes with the ability to hear what women think. He uses this ability to try to get the job he thinks is rightfully his back from Helen Hunt.The acting is pretty good, and the casting of Gibson's daughter is nice...she works really well in the part. Tho, the movie in general is funny, it is also touching in a sort of weird way, with Gibson helping an employee in the firm who has low self esteem..plus the love scenes are somewhat genuine. It has a lot of various elements that come together to make it work. The only problem is part of the movie drags on for too long. There is at least half an hour that could have been cut out, with no real effect on the film and the film's meaning. If not for the long drawn out parts, and if it were paced a bit faster, it would have been a lot better than it already was. Don't get me wrong, it's awesome and very funny...just not completely there. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very obvious that audiences want is more footage of Mel Gibson as a theater film platter can hold,and What Woman Want certainly does filled that void quickly. But some of his biggest supporters may agree that this film is too much of a good thing. Even though it runs 125 minutes,director Nancy Meyers does give Gibson the opportunity to goof off on camera whether he is doing a soft-shoe to a Sinatra LP while putting on women's pantyhose in a drunken stupor,or just sitting around with a smile or a impish grin on his face. Yes,this is not your typical Gibson picture where our hero of righteous and bodily harm inflicts pain and savagely hacking someone to death(like with his last flick,this past summer's revolutionary drama "The Patriot"),but it cater to his iconc stature because it cuts into a good performance on his part and basically throws the movie's rhythms off track and basically loses its critical junction here. I didn't care for much of the women is this movie which some were as droll or incredibly stupid at times,but the film is nowhere near or doesn't approach Dustin Hoffman's brilliance in "Tootsie"(1982),but here it does have a handful of gags and allows for once a game Mel Gibson to show his comedic grace which is very good,but in all aspects it is entirely too long and too suttle. And by the way,how many actors you know of can pull this off? Only Mel Gibson. I would love to see either Russell Crowe or some other Aussie-Down Under Bloke of an actor to reinstated the formula.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had lots of good laughs and a few warm fuzzies.It should be noted that a couple of the "heard female thoughts" in the TV previews for this film were edited for television. In two cases, the language was a little more profane in the movie.Mel Gibson was adorable in this, and there were points during his efforts to get inside women's heads where every woman in the audience was saying, "Yeah!" It was great to see a guy going through some of the painful things we women do to make ourselves "more beautiful."The film dealt with teenage sex and suicide as subplots. Both subjects were kept pretty light, but were still dealt with delicately.The romance in the film was great and very believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RE: Too bad the female characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I too saw this movie. If you are a chick, you can't expect a movie, who's star is a man, to have women who rule and dominate men. If you are a guy, you can't expect a movie with the title of "What Women Want" to tell you the secrets of women when the leading female star is Helen Hunt(who in my opinion is a very head strong actress). So to Mr. &amp; Mrs. "Lissandra", don't go see a movie if you don't like the theme. Maybe you too should try "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". It might be more up your ally. ACTUAL COMMENTS: I loved the movie. To see Mel Gibson in tights, nose strip and eye make-up was great. The thing that topped it off was him sing "Bitch". A definate go see when in need of a laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poor vehicle for Mel Gibson's limited comedic talent. Overlong and suffering from unfocused direction, Gibson himself is the only vaguely interesting character in a movie that insults the very people who will make it a success - i.e. women. It's hard to believe it was directed by a woman when you look at the awful stereotypes presented here - Tomei's ditzy wannabe actress incomplete without a man/sex, Helen Hunt's career girl "I have to be a bitch to be a success but all I really want is love", a suicidal office girl and 2 empty-headed assistants. Gibson's daughter is the only one who attains any level of credibility. Also notable among the stereotypes are the Hispanic woman and the black woman who don't get to work in the ad agency but rather are given the choice roles of Gibson's maid and Gibson's doorperson respectively. Essentially this is a kind of remake of Groundhog Day (Unpleasant man is given special gift which at first he exploits and then learns from) but with none of the laughs or chemistry that Bill Murray and Andie McDowall brought to the screen. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that What Women Want was a riot. Helen Hunt's character was so easily identifiable to me since I have worked so many years...there's one in every office. And there's a guy like Nick in every one as well...at least there was until sexual harassment laws came under enforcement. It was fabulous to see those characters' characters evolve over the course of the movie. Helen Hunt's performance was incredible...I am now a true fan. Lola's reaction after having sex with Nick was great fun, as every woman in that audience probably imagined that she would have the same reaction after having sex with Mr. Gibson! And how many women have not said "They're attached". It was a hoot. Sometimes we need to go to a movie to just relax and enjoy. My life is stress-filled, but I truly came out smiling after this movie. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHAT WOMEN WANT is the new Mel Gibson film and after last summer's lackluster THE PATRIOT, he desperately needed a winner and this is it. WHAT WOMEN WANT is the smartest, most delightful romantic comedy to come out since last year's NOTTING HILL. Gibson is brilliant. He is more than capable of playing light and frothy. In the tradition of a Cary Grant, I think Gibson will be able to play romantic leads long after his action hero days are over.This film has a smart, tight screenplay with wonderfully drawn believable characters. The stellar supporting cast including Helen Hunt, who seems to be everywhere this year, is well worth the ticket price.If you see one film this holiday season, see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel very bad now, because I had to drag my boyfriend into going to this movie with me, and now I feel as if I owe him a movie pass to something more entertaining. I'm sorely disappointed in this film. The previews made it seem (why am I surprised by this?) interesting and fun (guess what? It wasn't!). It started off okay and I even laughed a couple of times, but I was annoyed pretty much the rest of the time.I feel as if someone came along and said: Look, I've got this script for a great premise. The money man said: Oh, okay... let's look at it. He reads a few pages &amp; says: Well... it's already a screaming chick flick, but let's make sure we get Mel Gibson just to make sure it's a big enough draw. So after all the discussions are made, they set to filming this thing, and they go a little overboard with some scenes, and add some other unnecessary scenes in for good measure to feel as if they are really contributing something to the film industry. In doing so they lose the whole intended message of the movie by making women seem more like a pack of silly overworried fussbuckets, or completely without brains at all. It ends with no resolutions except touching on some issues very lightly, with no answer to the title question, and a stupid side plot about a suicidal girl that could have well been a guy and had no significance to Mel's ability to read womens' minds except coincidence that she happened to be female. This movie does not speak for me, as a woman who wants things.My boyfriend said that it was as if they filled a hat with women's ideas of what they wanted, and then turned them into snippets of dialogue and voila, you've almost got a whole movie. I'm afraid I have to agree with him. Too long. Too trite. Too bad. What do women want? A better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Women Want" is a pretty good romantic comedy with an excellent cast. Mel Gibson stars as an ad executive who's usually a jerk around women. Then one night he accidentally gets electrocuted in his bathroom. The next morning he discoveres that he can hear the thoughts of every woman in close contact with him. At first this drives him crazy. Then he starts to accept it and in the process becomes nicer to the ladies. Helen Hunt co-stars as a woman who gets a big job at the company Gibson works at and gets the position Gibson's character was hoping for. Pretty soon the two start hitting it off with business and pleasure. Gibson and Hunt have great chemistry together in "What Women Want" thanks to director Nancy Meyers. Plus there are some very funny moments in the film. Gibson can always play comedy in his movies (his popular "Lethal Weapon" action movies are proof of that), and does it wonderfully here. Besides Gibson and Hunt, the terrific cast includes Marisa Tomei, Lauren Holly, Alan Alda, Mark Feuerstein, Ashley Johnson, Delta Burke, Valerie Perrine, and in a very funny uncredited cameo, Bette Midler. "What Women Want" isn't the best romantic comedy of 2000 (that honor belongs to "Return to Me"), but it's close.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is what everyone wants.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Women Want" is a well-crafted, occasionally touching and always funny movie. This tried and true concept of a man gaining the ability to read women's thoughts (done in a little different method, but to the same end in "Tootsie" and other films) is given a fun new twist and is engrossing to the audience.Mel Gibson is at the top of his game as Nick Marshall, an ad exec with a big Chicago firm. Nick is regarded as a "man's man", which in a woman's mind indicates a womanizing, chauvinistic pig. At first, Nick is exactly that, telling off color jokes to the women in the office and trying to pick up anything in a skirt. Nick is not only up for a big promotion at work, but is suddenly caring for his slightly estranged 15 year old daughter Alex (nicely played by Ashley Johnson).As Nick arrives that day, he eventually learns that he has been beaten out for the job by Darcy McGuire (the wonderful and lovely Helen Hunt). Darcy is hired on because a woman's perspective should help erase the fact that the company is losing the very lucrative women's market. While experimenting with some women's products (and a wonderfully embarrassing segment that is), Nick has an accident and wakes the next morning with the power to hear what women are thinking. This leads him into one adventure after another, some funny, some devious, and another that's just unnecessary.Mel Gibson is wonderful in this role, and shows impeccable comic timing with not only the little bit of physical comedy involved, but with the paranoia that comes with his newfound gift. He shows himself to be quite the dancer as well, in a wonderfully choreographed little dance number to Frank Sinatra.Helen Hunt brings the "slightly-insecure-at-the-new-job" Darcy to life, and is believable enough as not only the take charge businesswoman she is, but as Nick's romantic interest as their relationship unfolds. Coming into a new environment where you know someone who was up for your job and now works for you is horribly uncomfortable, and Darcy is all that. Nicely played.Ashley Johnson ("Anywhere But Here" , "Growing Pains") chimes in as Nick's daughter Alex. She has grown accustomed to Nick being more of an "uncle", by her own words, than a father, but after Nick's accident and a caddish older prom date they grow close and finally solidify their relationship. Ashley is going to break free from the typical child-star syndrome and develop into a talented little actress. Nicely done and worthy of special mention here.Supporting cast is good, although not well developed. Marisa Tomei shows up on radar again as the needy, ditzy Lola, Lauren Holly gets star billing but a small role as Nick's ex Gigi. The always good Alan Alda lights things up as Dan, President of the agency. The only gripe I have in this one was with Judy Greer's ("Jawbreaker") character of Erin. A quiet, nerdy file girl, she is saddled with self-doubt and is suicidal. Nick can hear her thoughts and one day when Erin doesn't show up, is off to do the right thing. Erin exists in every office I'm sure, but this character is simply there as a plot twist and offers little otherwise."What Women Want" is a believably romantic, funny, and well acted movie. The performances of Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson in particular could have carried a weaker script, but we got the best out of all involved and an impossible to dislike movie.4 out of 5</fullReview>

His ending speech could've been better if it were more realistic. Why did she fire him? and while Helen Hunt wasn't a bad choice of a leading lady, we've seen so much her in the past few months, it may have been a little better if we had seen someone new and fresh.It's light and it's fun.

		<fullReview>What Women Want. Hmmmm...Well, this weekend must be a huge one for Helen Hunt. Starring not only in this movie, last week's number one, but also in Cast Away, which will undoubtedly be this week's number one grossing movie.I did enjoy this movie, so much that it prompted me to see a second time. The odd thing was that enjoyed just as much the second time. It is not the world's most heady movie. It contains no great revelations on a woman's psyche or on life in general. It will not change your life. It WILL however make you smile as you leave the theater, and you might even think about it the entire next day. I know I did.I have read other reviews, and they all complain that this flick fizzled- it just was just not as insightful as they would have hoped. The thing is that it wasn't supposed to be. If you went in wanting a guide to a woman's heart, or at least some basic rules, you will be disappointed. But, hey, I knew that before I went into the theater.A movie is supposed to entertain, and one of the most common ways to do that is to show an audience a likeable character with a few faults. Of course, the character is oblivious to those faults, but something drastic happens and the character is suddenly made aware. It's not supposed to educate, but to entertain as the character's arc of change occurs.Mel Gibson is great. Once again, he is his own charismatic self, and you can't help but be interested. Helen Hunt is gorgeous and vulnerable, and I am sad to say that I am in love with her. Or at least her character.I am teenage boy, fickle and cynical, and I loved this movie. I recommend to anyone who would like to see a feel good romantic comedy over the holidays. Don't try to analyze too much, it's bad for your soul.**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that I have to tell you to go see this movie because of Mel and Helen. Their past work should be enough to get you in the seat. No, this isn't a milestone in film. No, this isn't a grand statement on the Mars/Venus theory. Good grief, it's escapist fantasy. Man reads women's minds, hilarity ensues. Women want Mel, men want Helen, end of story. All I expect from a movie is to get my money's worth. My view is that I did. I actually went to see Helen and Tom, but it was sold out and I saw Helen and Mel instead. (I always still think of Helen and Paul) I was much more satisfied that when I saw Helen and Kevin, but not as much as when I saw Helen and Jack. No awards will be won here, but that's not my problem. Those who wish to argue some battle of the sexes point, or bring up Freud, need to get a grip and a life. Movie, people. Just a movie. The deepest thought that occurred to me during the two hours was something about why men and women are such a mystery to each other. If you want to know something, ask. End of mystery? Ha. We are hard wired differently, so we think differently. I guess that's bad, and it's also good. Viva la difference, I suppose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gibson is tops in Romantic Comedy role.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie was wonderfully acted by the talented Mr. Gibson. His portrayal of the "Man's Man" is what one would expect of that "stereotype". Very macho and definitely not PC! While the acting may not have been up to Hunt's "Good As It Gets" fame, she worked well as the strong, yet sensitive executive. And the supporting cast did nothing but round out a wonderfully scripted premise that left men still wondering, "What Do Women Want?"....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was perfect for a light Friday evening. Some time away from all that Christmas shopping. I thoroughly enjoyed What Women Want and will probably go back to the theatre again to see it. I have to first comment on the casting. Whoever casted this movie, did a wonderful job. Mel, Helen Hunt, Marisa Tomei, Alan Alda, (plus FABULOUS cameos by Bette Midler and Delta Burke) were perfectly cast. The only miscasting was Mel Gibson's daughter (Ashley Johnson (Chrissy Seaver from "Growing Pains"))... She was very whiny all the time, and in the scene where she is sitting in the bathroom stall during her prom...I couldn't understand a single word. One thing that was very special in this movie was the scene with Mel Gibson and the suicidal office women. I'm sure many can relate to her. All in all... the movie was very enjoyable. Go and see it for a fun time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Twilight Zone" did it better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was okay. The first hour sails along, and is actually quite enjoyable. But the filmmakers don't do enough with Mel's mind powers. Eventually, this hilarious premise gets lost amid a sea of characters and subplots that add length where none is needed. In fact, the last 30 minutes feel like warmed-over leftovers from another Helen Hunt flick, "As Good As It Gets".Actually, this same idea was done in 22 minutes and 40 years ago. I'm referring to the Twilight Zone episode "A Penny For Your Thoughts," which starred Dick York as a bank clerk who is suddenly able to read minds. Look for it sometime on the Sci-Fi Channel; it's better (and shorter) than WWW.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is WWW entertaining? Sure. It's probably worth the price of admission just to see the Sinatra song and dance number and listen to the sound track. Is it great film? Does it speak to the great issues of our time?I don't THINK so. As a number of others have said, it's at least 2O minutes too long. I don't find sexual harassment particularly amusing, and there was so much of it, M-to-W and W-to-M, in this film that was taken for granted that it really bothered me. I don't take as much exception to the "dumb female" characters because, frankly, most of the guys in this film were pretty clueless, too. Alan Alda deserves to be losing his shirt if his office is that out of control. (Lawyers flirting with the creative types, a suicidal clerk, a hotshot who treats all the folks around him with barely disguised contempt,etc.)Gibson is supposed to be a marketing maven, so how did he sleep through the fact that they lost their audience? He doesn't read trade papers? He grew up backstage in a vegas nightclub and he never saw anyone's legs waxed?Hunt's supposed to be a rainmaker, but none of her former clients followed her to the new job? She quit one killer job to go to another, but has no reserve funds to cover her mortgage for a month? She glances at Gibson's trou and can't pull herself back together enough to make eye contact? How did she survive pitch meetings? Advertising is not a career for the faint of heart or easily embarrassed.One liner....It's a cute date movie, if neither of you take it too seriously. It won't replace the Tracy/Hepburn films on my list of favorites,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"had me at hello"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen The Family Man first and then comparing What Women Want to it, I have to say that What Women Want easily wins as the better movie. But as far as something out of the ordinary interesting concepts, The Family Man had the edge... but it didn't have Mel Gibson.And Mel Gibson really made the movie what it was. His dance sequence to Frank Sinatra was definitely an appreciative physical acting moment equivalent to Jim Carrey scenes and even as nice to look at as a Jackie Chan fight scene. The comedy soared in the beginning with Gibson first taking advantage of his new found gift, but then it becomes a bit lovey dubby (might be enough to make you bite your watch if you aren't into that stuff) revolving around his guilt for using his mind readings on Helen Hunt.And like the Family Man, there is an ending speech made by the main character to try and win over the heart after losing it. And like the Family Man, it comes close... but was unable to really do it right. And I haven't seen a movie done a speech like this that has worked. Mel Gibson comes close to it, like Tom Cruise in Jerry McGuire, and did it better than the not so good writings for Nicholas Cage in the Family Man. But in the end, all three movies had me thinkin' that the female character must've been had at "hello." What I did like was a little bit of the role reversal at the end dealing with who was saving who. Overall, I think the movie works pretty well. Really funny at first for most people, and the rest of the movie will only work if you can handle romantic love stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>half decent exploration of a good premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the spirit of "Groundhog Day" or "Ghost", where a lead character is given a power of some sort, comes this lightweight comedy. When any film presents this premise, it's always interesting to see if the filmmakers are up to the challenge of exploring it well. "Groundhog Day" did an excellent job of that, as well as "Ghost", but here it only half works. Mel is given the ability of hearing women's thoughts, unfortunately what they're thinking is only sometimes funny, and he only exploits his power in one way: to gain an advantage over a female co-worker. After the screenwriters run outta gas with strangers thoughts, they center in on Gibson and Hunt's relationship with slight, but very slow, success. The rest of the film tries to be to be too cutesy at times, with Mel's grin or him hamming it up with a chick song playing on the soundtrack. The ending is way overextended, with a little too much time spent on a sappy supporting characters lousy life that Mel tries to improve. Then the final ten minutes that drag badly, obviosly tipping off the writers problems with ending this thing. I also didn't like the way Mel aquired his "gift", as he's semi electrocuted 3 times(!) in the film. There's a surprising amount of big stars who took small parts in the film, I would guess because they heard Gibson was attached to it. Better Midler's one scene as a shrink sure, but Delta Burke only doing a couple of scenes as an assistant, Alda a small part as Mel's boss. Odd that former kiddie actor Johnson from "Growing Pains" had the biggest supporting role behind Hunt. Even though I only laughed a couple of times, it was good to see Mel get his first real comic role. The "Lethal Weapons" had their humor of course, but were mainly action, as were his couple of adventure/comedies ("Air America", "Bird on a Wire"). After viewing this, I think what women, or any audience, would've wanted was a better script (couldn't resist).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great concept! Questionable casting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is at the top of his comedic form in this cute little film. It's sure to be a hit with females (particularly the lovelorn and the high school aged ones). I laughed out loud at least 10 times - which is about 5 above average for romantic comedies. I think the Julia Roberts-Meg Ryan-Sandra Bullock-etal romantic comedy genre is a bit tired and it needs some new concepts such as this one. For this alone, I think "What Women Want" is worth watching.But I can't get over the casting choices of Helen Hunt and Marisa Tomei. Hunt is cast as a go-getter professional woman who falls for the guy she competed with for an executive position at a Chicago ad firm. But she has real trouble playing both a lovestruck woman and a hard-charging professional in the same character. This is not to say that it can't be done...but Hunt just didn't capture it.Kudos do go to Marisa Tomei for her portrayal of a struggling actress biding her time as a coffee waitress. She had some real chemistry with Mel Gibson and I wonder how she would have done in Hunt's role.I also enjoyed the work of Ashley Johnson as Gibson's 15-year-old estranged daughter. She captures the pressures of coming-of-age very well in the relatively short screen time she was offered.7 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if a man can hear the thoughts of what every woman was thinking. He can understand why they groom themselves so much, why they are so picky with food and clothing, and why do they do "kooky" things like yoga. In WHAT WOMEN WANT, Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall, a womanizer who is with a different woman almost every night. But has faith has it, he is either cursed or blessed with a gift to hear the thoughts of what every woman are thiking. Nick Marshall is a successful advertisement designer who feels that it's about time that he is up for a promotion. Instead his boss (Alan Alda) figures that why not hire the sucessful employee from the competing agency, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt). Darcy suggests that the way to boost sales for products is to focus on the female crowd. So she assigns all of the agency employees to try or sample a box of products that include lipstick, pantyhose, and leg wax. While Nick is drying his hair with a hair dryer, he accidently spills the bathtub beads and slips on the beads and lands in the tub of water, electrocuting him. When Nick wakes up, he goes to work and realizes that he can hear every thought a woman is saying. His psychiatrist (Bette Midler) tells him that he is the luckiest man in the world, Nick has the answer to the question that even Sigmund Freaud asked, "what do women want?" So Nick takes advantage with his new power. He uses it in a cruel way, by getting a coffe-shop waitress into bed (Marisa Tomei). Or he uses it to save people, like realizing that one of his secretaries is suicidal. But Nick uses the power to steal the ideas of Darcy for the ads, and to get the respect of his teenage daughter. Nick does realize that he has been a jerk and it's time to change his tune. I enjoyed WHAT WOMEN WANT, it's one of the few films for the ladies (along with FAMILY MAN) that I enjoyed this year. Gibson as usual is highly enjoyable as the womanizer who has women drooling over him with his looks, but once he opens his mouth, women are disgusted by him. Gibson also uses some very funny physical comedy, like using the leg wax to remove the hairs from his leg. But the funniest bits is having Gibson hearing the thoughts of what every woman is saying. Nick will say something, and the viewer will hear what every woman in the room opinion. And Helen Hunt does a decent job with this film, she does look very tanned and very pretty in this film. Of the four Helen Hunt movies I have seen this year, this is so far the most enjoyable (I'm keeping my fingers crossed for CASTAWAY). But the only thing I didn't like is how her character is just the 'victim' of Nick's dog eat dog world of business. For a strong actress that Hunt is, the role could have used more texture. This is the most enjoyable Nancy Meyers film that I have seen, but it's not a classic. The film does have some great moments, but it also has quite a few slow scenes. I went to the restroom and almost fell asleep twice during the movie, and still caught on to everything in the film. I didn't almost fall asleep because of the quality of the film, it was because I was tired. But that ment for a two hour plus film, it could have been cut down by twenty minutes. Or Nancy should have more scenes of Nick hearing the thoughts of what women were thinking. Some good ideas could have been Nick at a fitness gym, a singles bar, a woman's talk show, a rock concert, the limits are endless. But instead the core of the film is the relationship with the character of Darcy and his relationship with his daughter. WHAT WOMEN WANT reminds me of a apple, the outside is great and delicious, but you can throw the core away. The outside of the film with the hearing the women's thoughts are great, but the core with the relationship with the co-woker and daughter could have been dropped. Oh well, this is enjoyable, and is worth seeing. Women will like it since it has Mel, guys will like it because it will give them a view of how women think. A nice enjoyable film for the holiday season. **** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You must see this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very impressed with "What Women Want" because it has one of the best stars in Hollywood and it is more than just a comedy. There are few comedies this year that come close to the caliber of this film. Without a doubt "What Women Want" is the best comedy of 2000."What Women Want" co-stars a talented group of actors that work really well together. Mel Gibson leads this talented group, which includes Helen Hunt, Mark Feurstien, Marisa Tomei and Alan Alda. It is with movies like "What Women Want" audiences should be honored to see a talented cast at work."What Women Want" showcases original jokes that made me laugh and I continued to laugh because the comedy carried throughout the movie. This film works on many levels as well because Gibson's character, Nick Marshall has to mend a relationship with his daughter. I don't think there is another actor who could have pulled off a genuinely convincing performance and make it work at the same time. The underlying storyline with Nick's daughter makes "What Women Want" much more appealing than if it was just a straight forward comedy because it also appeals to a wider audience. The relationship sub-plot made it much more interesting for me because it made it unique because it is not often you see a comedy with other sub-plots going on. Each scene was carefully orchestrated and well-crafted. I was very impressed at how original the comedy was because it is not often that you find good quality comedy that has not been before. Gibson and Hunt sparkle as each bring their own style of humor to "What Women Want." I can not think of another comedic film that all the pieces so original came together and worked. It is a well done work of art to see this film.Helen Hunt has successfully made the transition from television actress to film star with movies like "Pay It Forward" and "Cast Away." Hunt is an absolutely exquisite actress and should be highly commended for her role as the new creative director. The chemistry she has with Nick is incredible and undeniable. Hunt is a fresh sight in Hollywood and I hope she stays for a very long time."What Women Want" is a very funny movie and it will allow each viewer to sit back and relax. As I stated earlier, "What Women Want" is a stylish, well done, well-crafted work of art and MUST BE SEEN by everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Women (and Men) Want</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Women Want: ***"What Woman Want" is about Mel Gibson's character Nick who can read woman's minds after a hair dryer accident. He then uses his ability to sneak into the woman psyche. The first few scenes that open are really nothing and aren't important to the movie. The scene with Marisa Tomei is the first real scene that is important. Nick thinks he's so sly. But when he gets his ability he realizes that the women don't like him. In steps Helen Hunt. She takes Nick's job so he hates her. He uses his ability against her, stealing her ideas and such. Then, a romance builds between the two. The movie is flawed. Very flawed. But the reason that it's good, is because A.) It's funny and B.) Hunt and Gibson has great chemistry. The movie works on two levels. One level for a woman and one level for a man. The woman level works because, well, Mel Gibson's in it doing what he does best. The men take on it, is they can see how women think. How they REALLY feel about you. Of course, this does not apply to most cases because the movie is far fetched. Men will also find it funny. There was an (about) 18 years old male there with his girlfriend. He seemed to enjoy it, as did I.Hunt and Gibson are wonderful, as always. Hunt makes up for "Dr. T" in this movie. And Mel, well, Mel is always great. So is Hunt, it's just, I don't forgive anyone for "Dr. T." Hunt is bright and sophisticated. She has her own way of acting. Unlike other people. She takes the character and transforms them into people you can really start to like. Gibson is always enjoyable in comedies. And women just love those baby blues. When the two are on screen it's magic. The way they flirt back and forth works so well because the two have great chemistry. I'm not going to go into the details of how it was flawed. Except, it IS a little too long, but that's ok. The way some of the women think in this movie is hilarious. Especially Loretta Devine ("Urban Legend" &amp; "Urban Legends: Final Cut") and Delta Burke (the new show "DAG").The movie is wonderful, except for the many flaws, I have a feeling this will be liked among women (definately) and men. **Note: "What Women Want" opened the same day as "Dude, Where's My Car?" Compared to "Dude," this movie is "The Godfather."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Women Want: I was 20 years old when I learned a very valuable lesson. Darren - a friend of mine, who had been with his girlfriend (Cathy) for four years - came to my room sporting a huge grin and proudly announced that he had figured out women. Not wanting to miss a revelation on par with the meaning of life, I listened intently as he explained that after having studied his girlfriend's responses to situations in the past, he realized that she always came back with one of three responses (I don't recall what they were). He even went so far as to predict what her response would be to that evening's discussion. Two hours later, Darren returned, crestfallen and confused - not only had Cathy not given the "predetermined" response, she came up with a brand new one! His sad deflation only reaffirmed my belief that while men may hear what their partners are saying, they don't understand them (I too have been guilty of this) and vice versa, and we blindly muddle through most conversations and relationships without a clue. I'm convinced that we've managed to propagate the species by pure fluke.Nick is a typical "man's man" who spends the bulk of his waking moments as an obnoxious, insensitive, sexist jerk. His ego is dented when the plumb job of Creative Director is given to a woman, and he is determined to unseat her. Nick's plans are temporarily detoured when he is electrocuted and awakes to find that he can hear what women think. The question is, will his newfound gift be a bane or a boon? Men go to see Mel Gibson's movies for the action sequences, whereas women go to see Mel. Unfortunately, other than his brief flashes of comedic flair in the "Lethal Weapon" franchise, Gibson has never been given an opportunity to display his well-known wacky side onscreen (his practical jokes on set are legendary) - until now. Gibson handles both subtle and slapstick comedy (the sequence where he is trying to come in touch with his feminine side left me clutching my sides) with mastery and you will laugh - a lot. This latest performance has also drawn repeated comparisons to Carey Grant's suave style, not a compliment to be taken lightly. Helen Hunt plays Darcy, Nick's nemesis (unknown to her however), a self-assured go-getter who actually speaks her mind, (an interesting twist given the premise of the film). This honesty however has come at a price - her husband left her, she is referred to as a "bitch on wheels" and she is painfully lonely. Hunt is careful to balance Darcy's power and pathos, elevating her above the glaringly stereotypical writing. I enjoyed her and Gibson's chemistry, especially the awkwardness they exhibit whenever they have romantic scenes. The supporting cast - most notably Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine as Nick's vacuous assistants - adds to the overall silliness.One common thread I've read among the detractors of this film is that the characters are unrealistic (they're too extreme one way or the other) and the situations are contrived. I definitely agree - if you are in search of a movie that gives an unflinching portrayal of the ongoing battle of the sexes, and male/female dynamics, put your wallet back in your pocket, this is not the movie for you. If however you are in the mood for light-hearted entertainment and some laughs, buy your ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very brave in shelling out the GENERAL truth about the core of women's tendency to overblow issues.The bottom line is that women have insecurities regarding all the things they have to do to be considered accomplished in this materialistic plane of existence.Men GENERALLY deal with life's issues better than women becouse nature has meant it to be that way.Nature has set it up for women in a way where they have to worry about being dominated by the generally physically stronger sex.When men say women have penis envy,we do not mean that women want to specifically have a penis.We mean that in the women's subconcious,they know they have some handicaps regarding having to deal with pregnancy,a weaker muscle tone,and estrogen induced tendencies towards more difficulty handling emotion (compared to men).This does not mean to say that men are better than women.It only means that women have issues due to the additional handicaps placed on them by nature as nurturers.As natural nurturers,women have to be set up in a way that they would be more in touch with their emotions so they would be less likely to abandon our offspring.The world has evolved and is very different now from those caveman times but we still carry those traits with us and we are supposed to train ourselves to abandon those old programmed ways.There is nothing wrong with women moving away from those traditional roles as full time dependant nurturers but the painfull reality is that the programmed natural handicaps are still there and women constantly have to deal with them every single day of their life.A lot of women were insulted when they were exposed in this movie.It is embarrasing to women to be exposed that way for humor and I sympathise for those who did not appreciate it.But the truth of the movie about what women want GENERALLY was depicted accurately.Women are very talented,very capable human beings too but please do not pretend those natural handicaps they carry with them do not exist.As a matter of fact,it is very admirable how women are strong enough to go thru this very competitive plane of existence.That is why I snap at men who sometimes think it is easier to be a woman due to their sexual hold over men.Those men better think twice before being too eager to go thru what a woman generally goes thru day by day.The movie's weaknesses was it's political incorrectness,and a miscast Helen Hunt(Tomei was not Anglo-Saxon enough for Hunt's role?).For people who do not mind fact based political incorectness,this movie will be very entertaining indeed.The lesson here in this movie is that for men who want to take their charms to the next level(beyond just physical,mental,spiritual and material charms),they must learn to tap into their inner woman.Study women's core issues and empathise with them.It is not easy to be in their shoes but to truly be a woman's dream man,a man must learn to wear those heels(not literally!) and still be masculinely intact.Men must learn to share women's burdens.This movie delivers that message very well.Peace......</fullReview>

It was a laugh a minute - the idea of being able to read other peoples mind is spooky but fun to think about for a short while, though I wouldn't want to do it for life.

		<shortDescription>not spectacular, but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson was great in this movie, and made it entertaining when just about everyone else was insignificant. I think it's worth the price of a movie ticket, even though it's pretty predictable.Most of the comments seem to complain about reinforcing stereotypes and portraying women as having shallow thoughts. Keep in mind that the character (played by Mel Gibson), who is listening to women's thoughts, is a person who has grown up always thinking of women in a shallow way. Just as he has spent his life being so self-absorbed and tuning out women's conversations unless they directly relate to him, he's going to be doing the same listening to women's thoughts (especially at first). We, the audience, are only hearing the thoughts that he chooses to hear. Otherwise, we'd be listening to a bunch of thoughts that would take the focus away from the plot of the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My local reviewer gave this movie a C- offering the line that this movie "out-sucks every other kind of bad movie imaginable." He justifies this on the basis that the movie "makes an audience laugh but not make them think."Well this was enough to send me rushing to the theater. I personally go to the movies to have a good time and be entertained - I do too much thinking in the rest of my life.I was not disappointed in "What Women Want". Along with the audience, I laughed throughout the movie and was moved by the closing scenes. If you are looking for sex, violence, action, or some redeeming social message - stay away. If you are just looking to have a fun two hours suspending the cares of the "real" world - then go by all means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie a lot! It was entertaining and funny and at the same time mel Gibsons character makes an intrigueing change from charming pig to being caring and thoughtful. At first he is horrified at his ability as well as using it to his advantage. But then he starts useing his ability to hear womens thoughts to help them. It also helps that through the ability he starts to discover that many of the women that he work with didn't really like him but thought he was a real pain. The transition they show him go through is a nice one. THe chemistry between him and Helen Hunt wasn't great but they did well together. His ability also helps to improve his relationship with his daughter who until he was able to hear her thoughts he had no idea what was going on in her life. It was a good movie and of course does not come straight out and tell guys what women want but if they pay close enough attention they may learn a few things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I Was a Woman...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd be pretty damn insulted by this movie. As it is, I find it sad that such cliched female stereotypes still parade around in popular American culture. I hate to restate the obvious, but the female characters in this movie are as nuanced as a brick wall, and their "thoughts" are as profound and shocking as the drivel spouted off by guests of any daytime talkshow. If any man truly believes that this is an accurate portrayal of the thoughts of even the most simple minded woman, he's living in a misogynistic dreamland. Why did the writers feel the need to turn women into cardboard cutouts? Is it to make sure we notice just how charming, energetic, and attractive Mel Gibson is? After all, isn't Mel Gibson what women want? I've seen vacuum cleaners that would look charming and attractive next to the poorly developed female characters Mel has to play against. Perhaps the film makers want to ensure that every single woman in the world can be reassured that she is the intellectual superior of the women in the movie.The general feel of the film reminds me of Liar Liar. The gimmick is that through the main character people get to "say the truth" and avoid the deception that's necessary due to the conventions of society. However, like Liar Liar the conventions of society are just reinforced by the predictable stereotypical truths that are revealed.There's nothing surprising or fresh about the script because its target audience is women who have gorged themselves on ER and Friends and hundreds of other soap operas that hold you by the hand and tell you exactly what's going to happen and exactly how you're supposed to react. Sure the details of the plot are changed to add "suspense", but every change happens in a comfortable little protective bubble of convention. Now, that being said, Liar Liar is much more successful at actually being entertaining. The plot of What Women Want is horribly uneven, Helen Hunt is wasted and Mel Gibson's acting is oddly self-assured for such an awful movie. It's almost uncomfortable watching an actor strut proudly through such a wasteland. The scary thing is that some young girls with low self-esteem might watch this and think "gee this isn't how I think at all, is there something wrong with me?" Or some young oaf will watch and ponder oafishly to himself "women really are as dumb as I thought." For once, I hope that the couples who will inevitably flock to this fluff will spend more time making out than watching the screen.</fullReview>

Then, one night, there's an accident where Nick is electrocuted which gives him powers to listen to women's thoughts.This is a really funny film that has really clever jokes. I like how this film is shown. It's like Chicago-like with great scenery and score to come with it.Although it's kinda long, I still think this film was very entertaining.

		<fullReview>What Women Want is a better movie than I expected. It may well be a "chick-flick" but at least there was enough humor in it to make it watchable for me. The movie contains good, although perhaps not always very original jokes. Still, it made me laugh several times, so that's OK.Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, a "man's man". He's an egocentric career hunter who thinks he is loved by all women. After he gets electrocuted in his bath tub he can read every woman's mind. At first he wants to get rid of this ability, but than he makes the best out of it and uses his hidden knowledge to his advantage. The main storyline is based on the relation between Helen Hunt's character Darcy McGuire and Gibson's character Nick Marshall. But thanks to the underlying storyline with Nick's daughter "What Women Want" may appeal to a wider audience. I guess that a lot of (divorced) parents of young teenagers will see a lot of similarities between themselves and Nick and his daughter."What Women Want" is a funny movie that shouldn't only be seen by women. Perhaps some man might still learn something from it. Don't expect a highly intelligent story, but it's nice to watch, especially if you just want to relax. I give it a 7,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's the contrived and unimaginative script; maybe it's the soap opera mentality-- the lead characters are named "Nick Marshall" and "Darcy McGuire"--or maybe it's the complete lack of chemistry between Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. Whatever the reason, the whole thing plays like a poor episode of "Moonlighting".Worse, it actually manages to condescend to women--no mean feat, considering its intended audience.The only flicker of interest comes from a brief glimpse of Marisa Tomei, who projects more sexual energy and appeal in three minutes than either Gibson or Hunt can muster in the leads.Just doesn't work on any level. Would rather watch two hours of Marisa Tomei walking down the street.In fact, someone should film that.</fullReview>

He's dumbfounded to learn that not only does it go to someone else, but that she just happens to be a woman (Hunt). Then, after a bizarre accident, he suddenly acquires an uncanny ability to hear the innermost thoughts and desires of the opposite sex, and decides to exploit it for all it's worth. The most major criticism of this enjoyable comedy would have to be that it becomes predictable as it nears the finale and lacks a really definitive point, but Gibson is appealing, surrounded by a good supporting cast, and is aided by an engaging script with plenty of laugh-out loud moments. ***</fullReview>

It was incredibly silly. The only funny scene is when Mel Gibson's character is putting on lady's stockings and his daughter walks in on him. They should have hired a writer who knows how to write comedy. This movie couldn't do for Mel Gibson what Twins did for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ashley Johnson who plays Mel Gibson's daughter, is best known for playing Crissy on Growing Pains. She has grown into a nice young women. Helen Hunt was good. she should have given better lines.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, fun, light-hearted, feel-good romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people criticize this movie for a variety of reasons. We just watched it and we loved it. It exceeded all of our expectations. My partner and I did not find the movie too long; in fact she commented at the end that she was disappointed that it was over so soon. I felt the same way.I guess it's all a question of what you're expecting. One board commenter expressed disappointment that there wasn't any real insight into "what women want." Our view on that is that we didn't expect any deep insight from such a movie. We were looking for a light-hearted comedy that entertained us on a Friday night, let us spend some quality time snuggling on the coach sharing a good time, and provided some nice relief from the week's stresses. The movie succeeded.I suppose if I were a professional film-maker or a film professor or something, I could dissect the movie and come up with all kinds of criticisms. I read Ebert's review and he nit-picked on a number of points and pointed out how it could have been better. But you know what? Roger Ebert has trouble enjoying a movie the way it's intended to be enjoyed because he earns his living criticizing movies! He *HAS* to find fault with a movie. He can't just write "Hey, it was a fun movie. I enjoyed it. If you want a nice romantic comedy, you'll enjoy it." He'd lose his job! He's a professional critic and doesn't just enjoy a movie, he has to figure out how he would have made it better. Fortunately, I'm not burdened by that.One last note. I've read several critiques of Helen Hunt being inappropriate for the part. Again, whether someone else would have been better or not isn't the point for me. I thought she did well. I thought the movie worked. Yes, I didn't think at first that they had a natural "chemistry," but that was the point. They started out as competitors for the same job and the situation was naturally antagonistic. Through all of that, as Mel Gibson developed his "insight," they grew closer together. I thought the romance worked, at least well enough to make us smile and to not be distracted at all. (Besides, I wonder if people who expect "natural chemistry" between an actor and actress expect the same in real life. Just because two people instantly "click" doesn't mean there is going to be a deep, lasting relationship there, and the converse holds as well.)I've written before that one of my acid tests for a movie is whether or not I check the clock (or VCR timer) to see how much longer before the movie is over (and if I do check it, why). I found myself checking the VCR timer only once on this movie, and it was because I did *NOT* want it to end. For me, that's a simple measure of enjoyment. The movie took me on a trip I wanted to go on, it lived up to my expectations, even exceeding them, and entertained us both for two hours.Don't rent it expecting to find a treatise on what women want. Rent it to be entertained. If you approach it that way, it's a very enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strangely enough, for a film written and directed by women, this film seems to really hate the female gender. Mel Gibson gets the ability to hear the thoughts of women. It turns out that most women are apparently shallow and stupid. Anyway, Mel Gibson gives a very good, comedic performance that is done in by an awful script and terrible direction. As his love interest, Helen Hunt defines the term shrew. As an added bonus, this film features a commercial for Nike that'll make you long for the days when it was socially acceptable to wander about bare-footed.</fullReview>

Make Mel Gibson goof around a little, add a sugary storyline about father and daughter coming closer, and top the cake with a love-story so overtly tacky that it makes you gag.

OK, the character is _meant_ to be obnoxious, in order to give the film its comedic spin, but boy does Mel smarm and squirm his way through the role. As most other comments have said, the women characters, particularly Tomei, are woefully underdeveloped and underused, leaving the film to stand and fall on Gibson's performance.The plot lurches along too: Tomei is written out with an unbelievable plot device, the 'daughter' sub plot is predictable and the ending just doesn't convince.As said, you like Mel, you get Mel. But if you're looking for sensible plot and believable characters, try elsewhere. It's almost as if the great Mel decided there just wasn't enough room in the film for anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Marshal has it all. Money, charisma, looks, power, and the ability to sleep with any woman he desires. One night in a freak accident the chauvinistic Nick Marshall wakes up to learn he has the ability to know what every woman is thinking. Nick uses this gift for his own advantage. A woman named Darcy (Helen Hunt) works for the company, and Nick misses out on his promotion. Nick goes for revenge with his newfound abilities, but winds up falling for Darcy. Romantic comedies are considered to be chick flicks to many. I'm a guy, and I actually enjoy the romance genre. They tend to get a bit derivative and uncreative at times, but I still watch them as they come out. This movie is the epitome of a romantic comedy done right. Let's face it. If you're a guy, you've more than likely been confused with how a woman does things. Not only does this movie ingeniously explore that, but it does it such a smart way. I can't remember the last time I've laughed that hard in a movie. People can say what they want about Mel Gibson these days, but he was perfect for this part! He oozes charisma, and he is an absolute blast to watch. It was a lot of fun to watch him go from a cocky business man who womanizes to a person slowly, but surely becoming a regular human being with this newfound power. Mel Gibson dancing around in women's clothing, putting on makeup is unforgettable and had me howling with laughter. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt make a great pair, and there chemistry was top notch. Helen Hunt is terrific herself, in a more subtle way. She's an ideal chick for any guy with a solid head on his shoulders, so guys should love her. Alan Alda doesn't have much to do, but Marisa Tomei is very funny in a supporting role, whilst Judy Greer steals every scene she's in as the girl nobody wants to hang around. The ending actually had me well up with tears a little bit. Laugh all you want, but its true! It was just so heartwarming I couldn't help but love it. Gibson's monologue in the ending is a knockout. Is it clichéd? Of course! It's a romantic comedy, what do you expect? Do people really have to be this fickle? Don't be such a cynic! Sit back, relax, and turn your brain off. You'll be so glad you did. It's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen, and a perfect film to watch if you have a date at home!9/10</fullReview>

Helen Hunt plays his romantic insterest while Lauren Holly is his ex-wife and Marisa Tomei his one-night stand. Ashley Johnson is also on hand as his daughter, who is shocked when she sees her distant father showing signs of really caring.The ending gets a little too mushy, but "What Women Want" is consistently entertaining throughout. It's basically a story of redemption -- a chauvinistic man learning the error of his ways in a fun way, and changing.The film runs 127 minutes and was mostly shot in Chicago with some senes in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Viewpoint - Men Gain Virtue As They Become More Feminine In Outlook.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mel Gibson character Nick Marshall was the son of a Las Vegas showgirl . He grew up hanging around with the showgirls backstage instead of normal boyhood activities. He had no father, just a succession of his mother's paramours. In such a deprived environment, he latched onto Frank Sinatra as his male role model. In moments of stress from females, he turned to his estrogen antidote : Frank.Growing up around women, Nick soon learned how to manipulate them to his advantage. He could put on a false front that would appeal to just about any woman he set his sights on. Nick was all about the conquest not about establishing a relationship with a woman. He married a beautiful woman named Gigi and fathered a daughter Alexandra, but soon tired of a marriage that interfered with his opportunities to attract new women. As a boy, Nick needed a strong father to learn how to be a man; instead he became a shallow mockery of what a man should be.Nick prowls around a coffee shop near his office every morning before work. We see him spot an attractive young woman carrying a tray of coffee cups and deliberately collide with her to allow him to break the ice and begin a relationship.The Marissa Tomei character Lola works behind the counter at the coffee shop. She aspires to become an actress, but realizes that she has little chance of success and is mostly resigned to her fate. Nick hits on Lola every time he comes into the shop. Lola feels an attraction to Nick but she is wise enough to realize that getting involved with him is a recipe for disaster.Then Nick suffers a near electrocution in his bathtub and acquires the ability to read the female mind. He turns this ability to evil ends and seduces Lola by anticipating all her needs and soothing all her well-justified fears. Marissa Tomei really brought the Lola character to life. She was a struggling young woman who needed a man to fill the emptiness in her life, not clutch the viper Nick to her bosom. I really despised the Nick character for his ruthless exploitation of Lola.Nick is hoping for a big promotion at his advertising agency, but is passed over for a woman, the Helen Hunt character Darcy Mc Guire. He uses his ability to read minds to steal Darcy's creative ideas and interfere with her ability to manage her department. Nick never stops to consider that if Darcy is dismissed, he will never have her creative ability on tap to cover his deficiencies in that department.The Nick character is already very advanced in his understanding of women. He can read a lot about them from body language and their actions. When he gains direct access to their thoughts, they are putty in his hands. Somewhat unconvincingly, Nick starts to develop a conscience when he realizes how many women despise him.The women in this film are all portrayed as noble characters. There are some really nasty women out there in the business world. Not every woman who advances does so on sheer ability. Advertising is savagely competitive and to rise to the top sometimes requires stepping on a few bodies who get in the way.There was some chemistry between Nick and Darcy in this film. Darcy really never realized how unsavory was Nick's past. In real life, some of the women at the ad agency would have filled Darcy in on some of Nick's exploits with his women coworkers. Darcy should have been wise enough to ask around when she started to feel an attraction to Nick.In short, the film is amusing and uplifting if you watch it without thinking too deeply about the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What Women Want" was very impressive film which starred two of the best stars in Hollywood; Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. Gibson and Hunt have great comedic appeal. There are few comedies this year that come close to the caliber of this film. Without a doubt "What Women Want" is the best comedy of 2000."What Women Want" contains original and funny jokes that made me laugh and continued throughout the movie. This film works on many levels as well because Gibson's character, Nick Marshall has to mend a relationship with his daughter. I don't think there is another actor who could have pulled off a genuinely convincing performance and make it work at the same time.In fact, the underlying storyline with Nick's daughter made "What Women Want" much more appealing to me than the comedic aspect. If it were just a straight forward comedy because it would not be as unique. The relationship sub-plot made it much more interesting for me because it made it unique because it is not often you see a comedy with other sub-plots going on.Each scene was carefully orchestrated and well-crafted. I was very impressed at how original the comedy was because it is not often that you find good quality comedy that has not been before. Gibson and Hunt sparkle as each bring their own style of humor to "What Women Want." I can not think of another comedic film that all the pieces so original came together and worked. It is a well done work of art to see this film.Helen Hunt has successfully made the transition from television actress to film star with movies like "Pay It Forward" and "Cast Away." Hunt is an absolutely exquisite actress and should be highly commended for her role as the new creative director. The chemistry she has with Nick is incredible and undeniable. Hunt is a fresh sight in Hollywood and I hope she stays for a very long time."What Women Want" is a very funny movie and it will allow each viewer to sit back and relax. As I stated earlier, "What Women Want" is a stylish, well done, well-crafted work of art and MUST BE SEEN by everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute, fun comedy romance, but not for young teens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a great, mindless way to spend a couple of hours. Plenty of comedy and a lovely romance, though I do have a couple of morality disclaimers for the younger crowd. The handsome Mel Gibson (sigh!) very deftly and humorously pulls off the role of the playboy jerk, and Helen Hunt, always a great leading lady, is convincing as his brainy colleague. The premise of this movie paints a picture of the inevitable comedy to follow. An egotistical, playboy advertising exec, Nick, suddenly through a fluke accident (pseudo electrocution), acquires the ability to read women's thoughts. Hilarity of course ensues, as this guy's a chauvinistic egotist who thinks he is God's gift to the female sex, for whom he has virtually zero respect. It's quite a wake-up call when he learns that women don't always have the stellar opinion of him he's always assumed. Meanwhile, he decides to use his newfound abilities to essentially steal advertising ideas from the brain of a smart colleague named Darcy, who has just gotten the promotion he himself had sought. However, he develops feelings for this woman he is so callously using...I admire Mel Gibson for the general decency of his movies, relative to the modern norm. Of course it's stereotypical Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus thinking, but some good basic messages (respect for women, paternal responsibility, and the general evils of using people) come through as loud and clear as the women's thoughts come to Nick. However, I do have a few morality qualms for younger viewers, having just read a comment to the effect that Nick has no problem when he intrudes into a scene with his bra-less 15 year old daughter and her 18 year old boyfriend. I don't recall (it's been awhile), but maybe I need to watch the movie again. One would hardly expect (or want) most dads to approve of that scenario. At least Nick does come to regret his woeful inattentiveness to his daughter, try to assume his fatherly obligations, and develop a genuine relationship with her. In fact, Nick starts out pretty despicable in general as a seductive womanizing worm, particularly the way he takes sexual advantage of a coffee shop waitress (Marissa Tomei), who has zero self esteem and is really flattered by his attention, then sleazily weasels his way out of a relationship, breaking her heart. (Incidentally, I didn't think the gay joke here added to the plot or the comedy.) Some commentator noted that the sex scene is vulgar for a PG-13 movie. Again, I don't recall, but maybe I'd better watch that one again, too. Also, Nick unfortunately doesn't come through with much genuine repentance for the way he's treated this poor girl. Can't make comedy out of it, I suppose, and need to use the film time to get on with the Darcy romance.Lots of laughs though...wait till you see Nick wearing his black pantyhose and dealing with hot waxing his legs! And of course, once he starts reading the ladies' thoughts, it's one hoot after another.The romance between the 'cad turned sensitive' and the 'vulnerable corporate executive' follows a not surprising but entertaining enough path. The chemistry between Nick and Darcy is fabulous. Nice dance scene, but I won't give the ending away.I agree with the reviewer who stated that the first half of the movie is mainly comedy and the second half romance. However, I don't class this as a chick flick. I admit that while I can't read MEN'S minds, I think they'll enjoy it as well. My own husband did. It's basically just an enjoyable, carefree movie, though I wouldn't recommend it for young teens due to some of the reasons mentioned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea fluffed hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surprisingly engrossing film. Well, actually, the premise is a great deal of fun and the characters that Mel Gibson is set against are disparate enough to cover most comic situations. I was reminded of both As Good As It Gets and Something's Gotta Give, both studio based romcoms but well-wrought and witty enough to carry off their narrative onto which the humour gets grafted: as in the latter, What Women Want begins to stretch out into the denouement - I was restless in the last 20 mins.That said, Gibson is good fun, the first dance-to-Sinatra sequence apart. Helen Hunt is a good foil, if a little stiff in an urban-woman role. I particularly liked the contributions of Ashley Johnson as Gibson daughter and the small diamond of Judy Greer's put upon office geek - I saw her in a similar sized role in Adaptation recently. Almost too much charisma. Watch her red-headed space.As I say it's a bit clunky moving from the style of the first 3/4 to the substance of the ending but the execution has enough panache to carry the film to its lukewarm end 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.These movies are all cookiecutter projects. There's supposed to be some stuff to occupy us until the end. In this case, it's Mel's facial expressions. At the end is a running of the guy to the girl to reconcile whatever problems were created. This must hold the record though for the import of that journey. Along the way, our man Mel (radical religious chauvinist) gets his girlfriend rehired, becomes "restored," saves a redhead girl's life, becomes a Dad again by rescuing his (also redhead) daughter, and finally resolves what we knew was coming from the very beginning.Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good plot for a movie. Mel's acting felt a little inconsistent to me with the changing situations, but maybe that's just me. Helen was great and so was Marissa. I don't know if too many men would want to be in this situation, but it could heal the world, lol. The music was very old school with a lot of Sinatra and jazz type movie. It made me feel excluded like it was beyond my age to watch or something. I think a guy could learn something from this movie though. There's a way to treat women. All you have to do is pay attention. You don't need mind-reading abilities. The constant electrocution in order to read women's minds is a little to comic-book for such a grown-up movie, but whatever works. It's the usual adversarial relationship between a man and a woman and one schemes to hurt the other but in the process falls in love and tries to redeem themselves. There's always a formula. I liked how he worked out the issue with the girl who wanted to kill herself without being able to read minds. That was a neat angle. Every woman has a different problem and there ain't enough mind readers in the world. The cinematography was great and worthy of a view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a cute premise and some of it is quite amusing. Gibson is a creepy guy and you know once he gets the power to read women's minds he'll get a rude awakening. But it also pure Hollywood tripe. While it does make Hunter an integral part of the ad campaign, it's still a movie where a man with insight into women can understand women better than they understand themselves. Also note that Gibson really doesn't need this mind reading power. All he needs to do is treat women decently, and really, just because he could hear women's thoughts would such a creep really turn around and start being so sweet and understanding? Does the movie suggest that in all his years on earth he never conceived of women as feeling beings who he should be nice to? And when it comes right down to it, he's still a creep at the end, although that pays off with an amusing sequence.In spite of being a model for product placement and a prime example of Hollywood hokum, it's generally watchable, and if there's nothing else on TV you might want to take a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Moral story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This skirt flick has its ups and downs. One of its ups is Helen Hunt who saves this picture with her strong performance. If this flick was supposed to be funny I didn't find anything to laugh at. And its premise that somehow Gibson acquires the quality of being able to read women's minds as a result of falling into a bathtub of water with a hair blower is so phony. In reality it would have killed him. Couldn't the writers find a better way of giving him this special quality? Then it he could read the minds of women, why couldn't he read every one's thoughts?But the upside of the movie is the fact that men and women think differently and men are usually insensitive to what women think. It is not always a purposeful insensitivity because it most of the time men just don't get it as hard as they try. I think most men would love to be more sensitive to women if they could figure them out but I can tell you that after over 50 years of trying I still cannot figure women out even though I am much better at it than when I was young. I honestly wish that when I was young I could have known what the women in life were thinking because it certainly would have made life more enjoyable. And I never was a male chauvinist. That is why I would recommend all men see this flick.One downside to the flick was Ashley Johnson who played Gibson's daughter Alex. She was badly cast as a sophomore. She is such an unattractive girl that it is inconcievable that any boy would have dated her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amiable little screwball comedy with a unimaginative climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Marshall is a successful advertising executive who lives a bachelor life of flirting and being selfish. He thinks he has every woman eating out of his hand but his life is complicated when he is turned down for promotion and a woman, Darcy McGuire, brought in from outside. However things get worse when he has an accident at home that results in him being able to hear the thoughts of women. After initial panic he consults a psychiatrist who advises him to use the ability to his advantage.I ignored this at the cinema ? I think that it was released around the same time as Euro 2000 and it appeared to me to be there to `give the women what they want' ? that is, to get away from the football. The trailers suggested to me that it would be quite an average and lightweight screwball comedy. I watched it recently and I feel that the trailer sold the film perfectly. For the most part it is simply a lightweight screwball comedy ? not too removed from those of the 40's except with modern day irony thrown in. It isn't hilarious but neither is it dull. In fact it's quite amiable the whole way through.Only the final 25/20 minutes are a bit of a drag. I knew that at some point the film had to try and have a logical conclusion. At this point three `serious' plot strands get sown up and the film gets a little serious. It takes much of the energy out of the film and leaves you remembering the more sentimental side of the film and not the sparky energy it had at one point.Gibson is pretty good. This sort of fare is right up his street as it doesn't demand too much apart from Act 1 ? Mel being cocky, and Act 2 ? Mel learning and being a nicer person. Hunt is quite good but is stuck in the straight man role here, as a result she plays second fiddle to Gibson and it does show at times. The support cast are all pretty good I suppose. Alda and Midler are nice additions but neither really makes a lasting impression.The film goes just where you expect it to and you can probably guess the final shot of the film just by reading the plot summary, but for the most part it does have an energetic screwball comedy feel to it that is only let down by the major gear change (into `serious') in the final quarter. Does exactly what it says on the tin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Answer: a man who can read their minds!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 2.5 (out of 10)How many times have you said it: "I'm sorry, honey, I can't read your mind". Well, the answer behind Nancy Myers' "What Women Want" is that she expects you to read her mind. This movie could have been a great satire on perceptions between the sexes if it didn't take itself SO seriously. WWW is a particularly dumb movie in a long line of sexist Hollywood cliche romantic comedies that panders to this idea that women don't really want to see smart, strong women on screen as much as they want to see the men portrayed as stupid, bumbling cliches inferior to them. Mel Gibson's Nick is a jerk so in typical movie fashion he's going to get in touch with his feminine side which will "make him a better man". There isn't a logical, realistic or new idea in this movie. It's really bad, shallow, long, dull and not effective. This is one of those turn-off-your-brain-and-enjoy movies that people seem to love when it's in the form of a romantic comedy, but hate when it's a monster or action movie. I don't mind turning off my brain at all, but I don't want to do it before I walk in the door. A good turn-your-brain-off movie sweeps you up into it's world and in it you are having so much fun you don't even think about questioning it's logic. That's totally different from being forced not to think by the sheer dumbed own of the whole plot. WWW never exactly grabbed me, but the concept is an interesting one. Mel Gibson gets the power to read people's thoughts. Not everybody, just women for some reason. The trade-off is that he gets this power in one of the stupidest most contrived scenarios I have ever seen. He gets electro shocked. Simple stand-by plot devise. You want your character to get any sort of magical power- just shock them. Eventually the power reverses itself and I'm still not sure how. Anyway, imagine if this concept was handled by, say, Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman- talent able to stretch into something fully realized and imaginative. Or imagine if the guy getting the power was, say, a regular or geeky guy instead of a chick magnet like Mel Gibson. Such creative possibilities, but this movie settles for having Nick do the simplest, most basic things with it: Nick steals and idea right out of a woman's head and takes the credit advancing himself in the company, he manipulates her into thinking he is exactly what she wants, ect. There are a couple of compelling little vignettes in here. The first and hands-down most compelling element of the movie is Nick's attempt to reach out to a women whose thoughts appear suicidal. The second is when he tries to save his daughter (a very good Ashley Johnson) from loosing her virginity at the prom. But in well over 2 hours (it feels like 3) WWW stretches itself thin and well beyond the point of being tolerable. Was it a comedy? I barely mentioned the Gibson/Helen Hunt romance which really takes over this movie in the 3rd act. It's really not worth talking about. Standard stuff. Surely there will be a sequel- "What Men Want" about a women who gets the ability to read men's minds and learns they think about things over than sex, wanting things that are not dissimilar from women and gets in touch with her masculine side making herself a better woman. Yeah, right. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women Want to be Talked Down To?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Mel Gibson is a handsome man. During the press junkets for this film, so many fluff entertainment reporters would question Mel, "so what DO women want?" The actor would laugh, the reporter would smile, and Entertainment Tonight would lead off with a cute story. It is obvious that the marketing department for the studio thought they knew what women wanted and gave it to them. Just look at the poster and video box- 'WHAT WOMEN WANT,' and a picture of an adorable Mel grinning from ear to ear. This film plays it so safe, I thought a minor trims could have turned this into a G-rated film.Mel Gibson plays perhaps the nicest, sweetest, most likeable womanizer in film history. I was ready to see Mel treat women like cr@p, and get his comeuppance when he began to know what they were really thinking, but I was wrong. He stretches credibility by trying on women's products on the orders of his new boss Helen Hunt, and electrocutes himself in a bathtub with a hair dryer. Suddenly, he can hear what women are thinking. He uses this to begin to take down Hunt, who got the job he wanted, and beds the pathetic Tomei, knowing her every sexual wish. He also begins to read the mind of his daughter, Ashley Johnson, who is blossoming into womanhood (and he cannot do anything about it), and the mind of a suicidal mousy worker at his ad agency. You would think this kind of can't-miss set up would really score some points for relevance. I was wrong. Helen Hunt plays the exact same role she played on "Mad About You." I kept expecting everyone to call her Jamie before she went home to Paul Reiser. She comes to the agency with "b!tch on wheels" rumors swirling about her, but she turns out to be nice. So nice. Too nice. Couldn't we see some kind of emotion from this character besides sheepish smiles?Mel beds down Marisa Tomei's character in one embarassing scene. He has been asking her out for months, gets her into bed, decides he loves Hunt, so he gets rid of Tomei by telling her HE IS GAY. Where was the outcry from the homosexual community over this little bit of stupidity? Here is Mel, using an easy out (so to speak) to dump a character the writers should have trimmed in the first place. And why would a gay man spend months asking a woman out, sleep with her, and then admit he's gay? Does anyone else see the logic behind this, much less the fact that Tomei buys it and promptly removes herself from the film? I kept hoping she would pop up later and tell Hunt this little gay fact, but nope.Ashley Johnson is wonderful as Mel's daughter who has obviously picked the wrong guy she plans to lose her virginity to on prom night. Thank God some casting director did not go cast Denise Richards or Jessica Biel in a role that required a substantial amount of teen awkwardness, and Johnson is great here. Bette Midler also has a completely unnecessary role here, in a cameo as a psychiatrist. Her role also seemed to be cast, and then written. If you are a known womanizer who can suddenly read the thoughts of the very women you pursue, do you really need Midler to tell you that you can use this power to get more women into bed? That would be my first thought! Midler also disappears, and I also kept waiting for her to pop up later. Never did.Finally, the mousy suicidal clerk. Mel reads her mind. She is unhappy at work, no one would notice if she just died. Mel gets this constant vibe, is nice to her a couple of times, realizes he is partly to blame for her depression, and goes to see her when she does not show up for work one day- something she has been promising to do through the whole movie. Mel goes to her back alley apartment, gets showered in sparks, and loses his ability to read thoughts. He goes up to mousy girl's place anyway, breaks in, and finds an empty pill bottle and a suicide note! Oh, no, Mel's too late! The film does have an edge!...no, mousy girl pops out of the bathroom, Mel offers her a copywrighting job, and he leaves to win back Hunt, who was fired by sensitive Alan Alda, and the job given to Mel. I thought, well, what about the empty pill bottle? After Mel left did she dial 911, tell them about her fabulous new job that cured her suicidal depression, and request a stomach pump?The finale, involving Mel and Helen reciting what seems to be rejected Hallmark cards to each other is a letdown. When Mel is alone onscreen, he does that irritating habit where he has complete conversations with himself, like the dolt he played in "Conspiracy Theory." I wanted him to just shut up so often. Well, one of my longest reviews concludes, but there was a lot wrong with this film. This really is not a film, it is the result of test audience samplings and opinion polls. This is easy film making by committee, guaranteed to make money and not harm anyone's career, although if you have an inkling what Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine's purposes were here, you are smarter than I. This is lighter than a large cotton candy, and about as satisfying. I cannot recommend "What Women Want." This is rated (PG13) for some physical violence, profanity, some sexual content, strong sexual references, and some drug abuse.</fullReview>

Then somehow the movie completely shifts gear and loses steam, discarding all aspects of comedy in this romantic-comedy and crawl into this slow, nothing much happening mode.The ending seems to be very Hollywood, redemption (Gibson admitting he stole every idea, a highly unlikely possibility given the situation,) forgiven (Hunt accepting his backstabbing, a even more highly unlike possibility) and happily ever after. All wrapped up nicely for the audience to walk away with a smile. I guess the real way a person would have acted, in which Gibson's character would have made some excuse to hire Hunt's character back and keeping credit to himself would have made his character unwholesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Best: the satire that is present throughout the whole film; the always dazzling Helen Hunt and the stunning performance delivered by Marisa Tomei. The Worst: As one starts watching the movie, one knows exactly how it is going to end, sooner or later.Nick Marshall is a rude successful advertiser who is loved by ones, and hated by others. He has this one `gift' to get girls into bed, and next day, he completely forgets them. One fine day (night), he's at home testing some products given by a newcomer `enemy' Darcy, and all of the sudden he falls on the bathtub with a hair heater and gets electrocuted. When he wakes up he starts hearing what is going on women's heads, starting by her troubled daughter. The movie has a somehow good, although completely fictional premise, staring a promising cast led by Mel Gibson, the dazzling Helen Hunt, the hilarious Marisa Tomei and two very interesting cameos by Bette Midler and Lauren Holly. It has also some very funny sequences, and some that don't go straight to the point they were supposed to. Hey, it's not American Pie, nor Scary Movie nor Airplane! But it still as some funny sequences and you will soon realize that the movie wasn't supposed to be as funny as the other mentioned movies, it doesn't take it too serious, it just wants the viewer to get inside it and have a good time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with ?Bridget Jones's Diary', this isn't a chick flick. A fair few chaps I know had been put off both movies from what they'd heard from women that they knew. Bridget Jones became empowered and in this offering we see an already empowered woman who is also vulnerable, as are most women in this picture, to Mel Gibson's mind-reading prowess. It only works on women, by the way. True, it is a moralistic tale, no matter how it may try to hide it. Gibson's character had been brought up in Vegas and his mother was a showgirl. As the film states, very early on, this is no the ideal upbringing for the feministic male. Not surprisingly then that he turns out to be as close to a gigolo as you can get without actually breaking the law. A serial abuser of women in relationships, he discovers his new boss is indeed a woman and his first thought on hearing the news is that she must be a hard-faced bitch. Suffice to say that he is proved wrong by the end of the picture as it desperately tries to educate men that there is more to women than what underwear they are wearing. It makes its point subtly and with feeling. Gibson's character, with this insight of being able to read into the minds of women everywhere suddenly gains new perspective on the people around him and subsequently, we are led to believe, becomes a better person for it. He doesn't, however, go slightly bonkers, as would seem far more realistic and appropriate. This movie is as harmless as it is thoughtless. This is a poke in the eye for men everywhere who are threatened by their female boss, their partners that earn more money than they do. In fact, it represents women in a very good light. Men, alternatively, do not come off so well. Men could do worse than to watch this movie and see what they may be missing. The more astute men amongst us are already aware of what we are missing and we have our heads down, hoping it will pass us by without spotting us, cowering in the corner. Both Hunt and Gibson are very good at this relationship stuff and they work very well together, the Casting Director can feel suitably chuffed at a job well done. I watched this film without prompting of any kind, from any woman. Does this mean I am a well-rounded new man? Nope, I fancy Helen Hunt, so I would have watched it anyway, never mind the content. Ouch, smacks of male chauvinism there, I think. If they'd cast an ugly old boot to play Hunt's role, would it have been so successful? Would the message have been lost for the sake of the ?right pretty face'. It's an admirable attempt at making a perfectly legitimate point, but falls at the first hurdle. That being, it is easier to be a successful businesswoman if you are also gorgeous to boot. Men will endure more hardship if they can get into bed with a beautiful woman, no matter how bright, funny or good at her job she is. It's a sad fact of life, however, that if you don't look as good as Helen Hunt, you may find your man is not always as patient.</fullReview>

The good thing for Gibson is he's got the part in which he can develop. I actually like the way is doing that. It's just great acting.

		<fullReview>I'm not going to get too excited about this. It's pretty much average comedy material with some slapstick, some decent humour and some jokes that just aren't funny.Problem is there's little to no chemistry between Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, which somehow spoils the whole movie. Decent acting from both, though Gibson is a bit too much into slapstick on this one.Had some laughs, left the movie theater, and had forgotten almost everything the very next day. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If they want contrived romance, bingo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had only two minutes to pick a rental movie, so I grabbed What Women Want. It turned out to be better than what I expected, but still no better than a 6.Gibson is fine, Hunt is fine, Alda is fine, everybody's fine. Some of the jokes are cute-funny, and even though I grow weary of stereotyped jokes about gender differences, WWW escaped my complete wrath by at least looking at these issues with a modicum of sensitivity and respect.The plot is completely predictable, the elements are formulaic, and there is nothing extraordinary about the movie. Those attracted to Gibson will love the scene specifically designed for those attracted to Gibson, where he dances to Frank Sinatra and plays with a hat. It is unbelievably contrived, but since he does a pretty good job acting sexy, it goes off without too much of a hitch. I could imagine the women of the theatre swooning and thinking to themselves, "That's what I want!" Ah, the bean counters in Hollywood must have been smiling big smiles...At least the movie doesn't really try to answer the question of what women want. Even though the movie seems to suggest at times that women want someone who can read their mind, it becomes obvious that what is really sexy and desirable is just having men actually listen to them and not be obnoxious jerks whose idea of gender equality is patting both cheeks of the ass. And that's if they even want to bother with men at all--most of what is going on in their minds, according to the movie, is the same as in mens': Work, family, health, paying bills, trying to look good, just getting by in life. It's not really profound, but maybe it needed saying.All in all, the movie is pretty average stuff. It's worth a watch if you only have a few minutes to pick something up at the video store (hey, like me!), but only if you've seen the other gems out there first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light fluff - some clever twists.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much for situation comedies, and with a touch of reticence, I allowed my wife to coax me into watching What Women Want. I'm glad she did. Though not one of the great comedies, it was light fun and worth watching for relaxation.My assessment was not felt in the beginning, however. Much of the opening scenes were "run of the mill" character and plot development. But one standout scene was Mel Gibson's dance routine - a sort of Astaire/Sinatra tribute. That ended up as a highlight for me.Other than that one bright spot, most of the opening humor was almost cliche. Mel Gibson's character (Nick?) did some slapstick in drag which is terribly worn out. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in "Some Like It Hot," Dustin Hoffman in "Tootsie," and Robin Williams in "Mrs. Doubtfire" were much, much better and left very little for recent actors to explore. Nevertheless, I understand that it was necessary because it provided Gibson a means to acquire his "magical power".With the introduction of Gibson's "superhuman" power, the movie finally took off, and it was fun the rest of the way. Some of the dialog and situations were a bit lascivious, so it may not be appropriate family fare, but overall, it was pretty tame and funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny with a Weak Close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did laugh out loud many times at this film. Mel Gibson does have some good comedy chops that for the most part, go to waste here. He has no supporting cast, as Helen Hunt plays once again the forlorn, lovesick, teary-eyed injenue, who is about as convincing as a hard-nosed business woman as Bill Clinton would be as a spokesman for celibacy.Marisa Tomei does wonders with a bad role a ditzy sex-starved coffee shop girl.The tragic flaw here - way too long. A film like this should wrap in 100 minutes tops and leave us wanting more, not leave us checking our watches and yelling at the actors to get the ending already.Much like Castaway, another film where Hunt plays an unconvincing love interest, the final act of this film drags on and on and leaves you unsatisfied.All that said, a mild recommendation. It is funny - Bette Midler and Lauren Holly have small but great roles, and Gibson is always fun. Put it at the bottom of your rental list. **1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wouldn't all of us males want to be like Mel Gibson and be a mind reader of women.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After just viewing What Women Want last night I was not greatly impressed but the movie gave an interesting concept. I know that many movies have given us the story of a male womanizer who sleeps with woman after woman, but with What Women Want it explored the strange concept of mind reading. Mel Gibson stars as an executive who's divorced and all of a sudden obtains the ability to read the minds of women only to meet his match with another executive played by Helen Hunt who's also a mind reader. This movie just gives a lesson that we all have people out and about like this who are needing each other. What Women Want falls below what is most of the time associated with Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt but give it a try if you find the topic of mind reading entertaining and interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Women Want? Hopefully, Nothing This Insipid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Women Want" is frequently amusing and entertaining. Unfortunately it is also overlong, giving it plenty of time to be overly simplistic, "politically correct" and condescending to both men and women.Mel Gibson is very funny (and a very good dancer), but he is waytoo soft and squishy to play a ruthless, chauvenistic advertising executive. Helen Hunt is also entertaining and attractive (in a "school marmish" sort of way) as the advertising guru who is brought in by agency head, Alan Alda, to find out "What Women Want"). Hunt has a great body, but, as I said, is too "school marmish" to use it to full advantage, and fails to create the kind of chemistry needed to make this romance even a bit convincing. Worse, she is way to "nice" to be even slightly convincing as a ruthless "bitch" senior advertising executive. Hunt would have suspected SOMETHING, even if she didn't realize Gibson could read her mind. If you want to see this kind of character done extremely well, see Jennifer Anniston in "Picture Perfect". Hunt's character, as written, is a complete washout. None of the women in this movie are particularly well written. Especially wasted are such fine actresses as Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine. At worst, it is a crying shame to see such as talented and beautiful actress as Marisa Tomei being so ill treated by her role. Tomei (and the character) are too intelligent to talk herself into tosuch a ridiculous fantasy explaining Gibson's treatment of her.Perhaps the truest scene in the movie occurs when Gibson, first using his ability to read women's minds, overhears how one of his female associates uses Advil instead of Aspirin or Tylenol when she doesn'twant to have sex with her husband. When Gibson broaches the idea ALL of the women deny they would EVER do such a thing. And there lies the truth of it. Reading a women's mind (or a man's mind, for that matter) wouldn't necessarily help, BECAUSE WE ALL LIE TO OURSELVES, SOMETIMES.The "woman as victim" plot has been around at least as long as "Broken Blossems" (1919). Dean Martin certainly used it a lot when he was still Jerry Lewis's sidekick. It reminds me of the bad feminist joke "If they can put a man on the moon, why don't they ALL go?" To which, I reply, "Then on WHOM would you have to blame all your problems?" Men and Women ARE different, just as ALL individuals are different. However, this insipid movie sheds little light on our differences. Fortunately, by the end, it redeems itself somewhat, by exposing those needs that are common to ALL individuals. We ALL need to be respected, valued and loved.</fullReview>

But when Mel Gibson enters I realize that this guy is not really made for the role, although being a woman´s dream I feel that he is better off in the Lethal weapon films. The plot is really see through, a man has a hard time with relationships but then starts to hear what women think and suddenly he becomes the nicest guy in the world with a happy ending. In spite of that, the film has many funny situations, although silly, it is very amusing, especially for the women in the audience who laughs the most! It is also a very sensitive story with lots of emotions e.g. when Mel saves a girl from taking her own life due to nobody noticing her. But Mel does of course :)After the film I walk the streets with a nice feeling, knowing a little more what women really think...rate 6/10</fullReview>

It starts off hilarious as Mel Gibson hears everything the women are thinking. However the writers quickly drop this in favor of the budding romance between the two main characters, add on father daughter relationship trouble and boring subplot about marketing for women. This movie really leaves those who expect a comedy hanging out to dry. Had the writers stuck to writing a film about the star characters unique gift, it may have been What I Wanted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be a lot of bashing of movies that are taken from old TV shows. But now the movies are being based on single plots from episodes. I'm pretty sure there was a Bewitched episode where Darren could read the minds of people (I know there was one where he was forced to tell the truth ala "Liar Liar"). What Women Want is pure fluff with Mel Gibson doing his best to hold it together, and does a fairly decent job of it. Helen Hunt is her usual dry, unapealing, self, and no supporting characters of any interest except Marisa Tomei who's character is the only one with any real emotion. I could picture the writer pitching this story to a movie exec in 30 words or less, "Mel Gibson's a chauvanist pig, and suddenly is able to read womens minds. Hilarity ensues, and at the end of the movie Mel's character is an incredibly sensitive man." To me, the movie would've been much better if the chauvanist pig, became an even bigger pig as the movie went on. How could someone spends 40+ years being a chauvanist, and become Phil Donahue after only a week of reading women's minds? I don't get it. It's a one gag stream throughout the entire movie and never takes a chance. Personally, I would be trying to figure out any and every way I could make money off of my new-found talent, not figure out my new female boss' advertising ideas to steal. Total waste of opportunity. 3* for Mel, 3* for Marisa, = 6 of 10.</fullReview>

Now comes a film that has one man with an extraordinary gift of being able to read a woman's mind. Even though it has a very peculiar premise, this movie does disappoint at times. The romantic scenes between Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt have the same old familiar romantic- comedy diamond ring I mean `ring' to them. And speaking of Hunt, someone should have cast her away from this one because she was not as good as she usually gets. The filmmakers should have also `shopped' out some of the way-too-long weary scenes. However, I was `engaged' by the witty dialogue coming from the various female characters that Gibson comes in contact with. `What Women Want' should fulfill some of your needs, but it might make you look elsewhere.

		<fullReview>There was so much hype about this movie, I couldn't wait to spend 2 plus hours with Mel Gibson. Besides him being easy on the eyes, this movie sucked. It was cutesie and sleek, but it tried too hard in some places and not hard enough in others. The idea was cute but the film makers failed to use all the potential. Marissa Tomei, as coffee house vixen-wanna be actress, Lola, had no point except to proclaim that "Nick Marshall{Mel ,of course} is a sex god." Helen Hunt's character, Darcy, was luke warm. You almost felt bad for her, but not bad enough. I was mainly distracted by her weird closed-mouth smile. Mel Gibson, himself, was funny a few times, but after his amazing dance with Sinatra playing in the back ground, and an almost-naked bathroom shot, he was BORING. If you enjoy Mel Gibson chick-flicks, check this out. If your looking for substance or laughs, head for the theater, I hear The Family Man is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few laughs do not a comedy make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now, you should already know the basic plot: a male chauvinist pig-slash-advertising-wiz has an accident that gives him the ability to hear the thoughts of women, a gift that helps him in his quest to get the new boss lady fired. If you've seen the previews, and I'm sure you have, you've just seen the funniest moments. So...WHY exactly does this movie not quite work as it should? The blame must fall squarely on the shoulders of its director, Nancy Meyers, and leading man, Mel Gibson. Meyers, who wrote this as well, directs this with a heavy hand; subtlety is thrown by the wayside and every gag is telegraphed well in advance, a habit not helped any by music that practically bonks you over the head to either laugh, smile, sob or go "awwwww, isn't that cute?" If this were a book, an appropriate title might be "Romantic Comedies for Dummies" - at every point Meyers makes it clear what reaction is expected, instead of letting us find it on our own. As for the writing, well...let's just say it won't be winning any awards. The story is a mishmash of every battle-of-the-sexes film ever done, and it's apparent all involved were hoping to achieve not only a wry comment on that very subject, but to emulate the Hepburn-Tracy classics; it fails on both levels. How? Believe it or not, this film is incredibly sexist; one scene that is particularly disturbing in this regard is a scene where Gibson sees a former marriage counselor (Bette Midler in a cameo), to whom he reveals his secret; the filmmakers would have you believe that a TRAINED BIG-CITY PSYCHOLOGIST could be instantly transformed into a melting puddle of girlish enthusiasm with a few pathetic compliments AND THEN would GLADLY volunteer the information that with this gift, he could rule women. I'm not a woman, but you don't have to be to find the scene nauseating. And then there's Mel. Throughout his transformation from jerk to future president of the ERA, he's never really convincing; he says the lines but doesn't feel them, no matter what face he's making that's supposed to punctuate the emotions that just aren't there. That's NOT to say Gibson is without his charms or that he can't act, but this isn't his finest moment - he overplays nearly every scene, mugging shamelessly, convinced, like the film itself, that every glance, every gesture, is a laff-riot. As for his fabled good looks, it's hard to tell if time has not been kind or if it's just poorly shot. (Or both.) His face, accompanied by five o'clock shadow, looks haggard and worn, with pores you could drive a truck through, and his voice, stripped by years of cancer sticks (if not booze), seems gravelly - you almost wish he'd clear his throat. He doesn't fare much better than his co-star, Helen Hunt, who deserves better than this: she, too, is shot rather cruelly, with black circles round her eyes and her face looking emaciated. She looks as if what THIS woman wants is not a good Mel but a good meal. As well, her winsome, natural style of acting fails to mesh with Mel, with whom there is little - some, but little - chemistry. You just don't believe they'd be together. Who DOES work well with Gibson is the pitifully underused Marisa Tomei as a coffee slinger Mel takes advantage of: she's flat-out terrific and neatly steals the film from right under Mel's nose. In the end, she, and a suicidal character (in a subplot that seems thrown in to help make Mel even more sympathetic), is the only one you REALLY care about. As for the other performers, they are entirely wasted, most especially Valerie Perrine and Delta Burke, as his secretaries, whose minds he cannot read. Why? This is never explained, giving their brief scene the inescapable feeling of having been sliced in the editing room; in fact, much of this movie has that very same feeling: that it's missing something vital. Is it a total loss? No. There are a few laughs. But it's hardly the success that everyone involved would have you believe.</fullReview>

Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall an advertising executive who receives the "gift" of hearing women's thoughts. He can even hear female dogs thinking. This is really cute. Nick thinks he flipped and visits a Psychoanalyst (Bette Midler). The scene in the doctor's office is funny and almost works.Meanwhile, back in the office, Nick is passed over for a promotion. This promotion is given to Darcy (Helen Hunt). Nick sets out to undermine Darcy hoping to get her job. Nick and Darcy start off not liking one another, and no one cares if they ever get past that stage.Beautiful and talented Marisa Tomei is relegated to the minor role of Lola, while Helen Hunt, who is neither beautiful nor talented is the love interest for Nick. Go Figure. The consensus among my friends is no normal man would be interested in Helen Hunt when Marisa is even a remote chance.What Women Want is a cute premise, but it just doesn't work.I give it a 6.

		<fullReview>Or so one surmises is the thinking of all involved here. Mel and company come up with a fine not distinguished movie. (Mel has done distinguished. See "Gallipoli," "Mad Max," even "Braveheart," and, of course, "Chicken Run.") This is Mel in a comedy. It is better than "Air America." It has memorable scenes involving Tomei, Hunt and Ashley Johnson. But as men-getting-handle-on-women comedies go, "Tootsie" has this beaten by several miles. If Mel was going for that, he successes as well as he did running those last miles in "Gallipoli."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amusing, comfortable, and sometimes funny (Mel trying to think like a woman!) Problem is that Helen Hunt is playing the same character that she has played since "As Good As It Gets" and including "Cast Away"...a woman left or hurt or done wrong by a man; who can and will stand on her own; but there is a sensitve side; and yes! the right man can peal back the layers and make her his! YAWN!!! Mel's antics are great and his relationship with his daughter show that he has alot of catching up to do as a dad...but this film is convoluted by the fact that we never really focus on any one thing as a theme. Case in point: the employee that is suicidal...Mel could have had a real moment. I'm not sure if it was a faux pas by the director or the editing group, but what the hell happened? What a letdown when the storyline was working. I highly recommend this film for a cold Michigan winter night when you are waiting for Saturday Night Live to come on. This is definitely small screen material. Save your movie money for Oscar material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see a fun movie. Hey, how about this one with Mel Gibson... Save your time and cinema choice. You will go home empty. Why is it accepted wisdom that a Euro-heritage, middle age man must go from an intelligent and interesting character to a goof? Is the only catalyst a strong female? Dull stereotypes abound. It was a wonderful formula in the late 1930's. The actors probably found it fun then, too. (Yes, I know that Gibson is from "down under.") There's better entertainment out there now.</fullReview>

The only interesting characters in the movie where Mel Gibson and Alan Alada . Both were great. Marisa Tomei was the only woman in the movie that held my interest at all. She is always under used in any movie she doesn't star in. I will not write about the plot I never do, it is redundant to do that here. But just to say less Mel's naked butt on screen and more of Marisa's. And maybe the men will come back to the theater with out having their dates dragging them there.</fullReview>

It took way too long to develop the characters and then carried them too far. I feel it needed a few more characters in it to round off a much needed diversity.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...a little in your face! Especially during the last 20 minutes or so! The whole idea of becoming a better man by understanding women is pure myth and somewhat politically-correct. Individuals become better people from learning from other individuals- regardless of sex!(Spoiler: Alert) Mel Gibson's character, Nick, was way too sexist for a person who was raised solely by his mother- even if she was a flamingo dancer in Las Vegas! In the film, his values are extremely chauvinistic until he is electrocuted in the bathtub where he discovers he can read women's minds! He uses this power to extract ideas from Darcy (Helen Hunt), and explores his mind-reading abilities with his daughter (Ashley Johnson) and a coffee-shop attendant (Marisa Tomei). Nick soon learns that reading women's thoughts gives him the opportunity to improve his own character, as he eventually falls in love with Darcy and attempts to reconcile with his daughter.The premise is great and the 'battle-of-the-sexes' theme works considerably well in this film as certain characteristics of men and women are explored. Mel Gibson is utterly hilarious as the chauvinist Nick who explores his feminine side. There is a few great laughs within this film and a great dance by Gibson to Frank Sinatra. Helen Hunt was also very good, as was Marisa Tomei in her role (even though it was limited). There was a great cameo from Bette Midler, but unfortunately Alan Alda's character was wasted.'What Women Want' are very similar to films like 'Cleo/Leo', 'Tootsie' and 'Switch' where the basic plot is a 'man' explores the concept of women by becoming them- this time the 'man' can read women's thoughts! It's basically political-correct fun and probably a great date film! I must admit, I squirmed a couple of times thinking: is that really what they think? Unfortunately, 'What Women Want' drags on towards the end, and over-kills it's message slightly especially during the final act (which was my least favourite scene) which became almost too righteous and P.C.- but then again, I guess the irony was funny!'What Women Want' seems to forget that essentially women are individuals and each one of them thinks differently! Saying that, I enjoyed this film, especially Mel Gibson's performance and it's a nice romantic film that has a positive message, although slightly shallow- and they just needed to edit it a bit! Anyway the positives outweigh the negatives for 'What Women Want'- especially in the first two thirds! *** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great premise, but falls flat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson plays a chauvinistic ad exec who finds himself suddenly able to hear women's inner thoughts. Helen Hunt is the woman who beat him out for a promotion, hence Mel befriends her to steal her best ideas out of her mind and pass them off as his own. As the plot progresses, Gibson begins to feel guilty over his idea theft, plus, he starts to fall for Hunt, even as she is falling for him. The premise is good, and Gibson appears to really enjoy his role. The "inner thoughts", especially of his daughter (played by Ashley Johnson), and of coffee house employee Lola (the always delightful Marisa Tomei) are a laugh riot. Of course, we all know that the movie will take more of a serious tone once Mel's conscience starts to bug him. But the ending wraps everything up so abruptly, that you sit and stare at the ending credits in disbelief! It really seems that there should have been another 10 minutes or so between Gibson and Hunt that ended up being compressed into the last 60 seconds.Several decent subplots float around as well such as as Johnson's preparation in going to her prom with a much older guy, Tomei's internal reluctance to be hurt again, and Judy Greer's role of Erin, a quiet coworker of Gibson's that is contemplating suicide. It's also nice to see Alan Alda and Bette Midler in unexpected cameo roles.It's a funny film with good acting, but the insultingly goofy explanation for HOW Mel obtains his powers, and the unlikely romance between Gibson and Hunt, coupled with that abrupt ending, makes the movie fall flat in my eyes.</fullReview>

After Mel discovers that he can hear what women think the filmakers play that joke til the end of movie. Mel Gibson gives does a good job with the material he has. Tomei is wasted in a bit part. Helen Hunt is the leading lady in another movie starring a big name actor this year (Dr. T and the Women,Pay it Forward,Castaway). She does a decent job, although I think other actresses would have been better. Maybe they were too smart to take the part. There is a subplot about how Mel's daughter (little Crissy from Growing Pains)hates him and plans on losing her virginity on prom night. There a many useless subplots that make this movie clock in over two hours which is way to long. Well, as you can see I didn't like it. 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 Oscars in this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is a two time Oscar winner as producer and director of 'Braveheart'. Helen Hunt won an Oscar for best actress for 'As Good As It Gets' and most forget that Marisa Tomei won a best supporting actress Oscar for 'My Cousin Vinny'. How did these three people with four Oscars among them end up in junk like this? First of all, how do writers Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa know what women want? Women are individuals and should be treated as such. To make a generalization that they all want the same thing is ludicrous. Mel Gibson plays a chauvinist in this film and a man who got to this position by being an overbearing jerk isn't about to get in touch with his feminine side just because he SUDDENLY cares what other people think. To make things even more unpleasant, there are many amounts of typical office politics thrown into this film and while the politics of the advertising industry are right on target here, every scene involving it is directed the same and the wooden direction of Nancy Meyers is the worst thing here and there is no chemistry at all between Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. Instead of the three leads mentioned in this review, these roles should have gone to ex-cast members of 'Beverly Hills 90210' because the subject material is right about at their level and it's a low one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson can act, period. He can do comedy and this film affirms that. What Mel and Helen couldn't do is make a horrible script into a good movie. I sat watching this movie waiting for something original, something I had not heard before, something that was not mere cotton candy comedy. I never got what I was looking for. Nick Marshall is a male chauvinist who has no idea or care for how a woman thinks. Gibson does a nice job with the hand he is dealt. Darcy Maguire is Nick's new boss, an intelligent woman who is a genius at marketing. This just happens to be Nick's occupation as well and Darcy has the title that Nick himself wants. Fate allows Nick to begin to hear what women are thinking and thus the title of the film. Knowing the premise I could tell where the movie was going and where it would end. Would Nick learn his lesson? Would Darcy fall for Nick? Would Nick fall for Darcy? What do you think? What this movie is trying to do was done much better in 1982's Tootsie. Hoffman and Lange with Pollack directing a great script runs circles around this film and gives a much more realistic look at chauvinism in the work place. Unlike Tootsie, this movie makes me have little to no care about what women want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a 28 year old man. I wanted to like this movie. I love Mel Gibson. I love Helen Hunt. I liked the premise. I liked 80% of the movie. But.... There were some major plot problems in what could have, with just a little tweak here and there, been a darned fine movie. My biggest problem is in the way the end was fashioned. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!Why would Mel Gibson's character say he stole all the ideas from her, when he didn't? He stole parts from her, and parts from every other woman whose thoughts he was hearing. He came up with the Nike concept and at best all she did was come up with part of the punch line. They never really established that he actually really sabotaged much. Why would she fire him? That part MADE NO SENSE! He wouldn't have said he stole the ideas, because she would buy that. There was nothing to steal! He came up with the idea and they finished it together. Now he did seem to steal the VISA ad, but that was such a small little piece in comparison to saying the NIKE ad was hers. Since he wouldn't have said that, and he couldn't try and explain that he could read women's thoughts but the ability has suddenly left him, he would have to take the she was the other part of the team route. I just don't see a reason to fire him. The movie just fell into little bitty smoldering pile of rubbish at the end.END SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!Other than the ending, I thought the movie was funny, creative, and very good. All but the last 10 minutes gets a 8/10 and the last 10 minutes gets a 2. Which brings the overall score to 5/10. Average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Helen Hunt did darn well as a smart and capable executive taken by surprise by a personal life that snuck up on her. I'm not a big fan of hers, so *I* was taken by surprise by liking her. Early in the movie, rumors abound (among the "man's men" - we never do get to hear what her peers of more open mind thought of her) that she's a "maneater"; then she shows up and is full of energy and good professional judgment, is generous in giving credit where she believes it's due, and (in her inner voice) has some ambivalence about her role in the company and her abilities. It rang true to me; I've known many women in this situation.NOT A TRUE SPOILER BUT A HINT ABOUT A PREDICTABLE PLOT POINT: I thought her action at the end in responding to Mel Gibson's confession was absolutely right on and I applaud the writers for giving her character the guts to do it.I thought the start of the movie was slooooow... Mel was more of a caricature than a character for a good long time. But once he started hearing women's thoughts he seemed to me to hit his stride. I quibble with the affair with Marisa Tomei, though I recognize why it was there. And I thought its resolution was clever, though a little too convenient.Clearly a "feel-good" movie with all the (minimal) depth and heft that that phrase implies, but this I liked particularly: from time to time, Mel would "overhear" a thought that gave him pause, and he'd stop in his tracks, bemused. Sometimes he was charmed; sometimes he was shocked. While the thoughts he overheard weren't particularly earth-shattering to a woman, many were echoes of what I sometimes hear in my own head, and it was nice to see a man's reaction to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the better efforts at romantic comedy in recent years (but don't get the impression you'll walk out of this movie knowing `www' because women's thoughts in this movie ARE pretty superficial).Mel Gibson was excellent. The comic side that he displays in his action movies works well. He plays a believable sexist and does a good job segueing from Mr. Pig to Mr. Sensitivity as he learns `what women want' (even though part of that segue - an affair with a coffee shop waitress, Marisa Tomei, which is helped by his supernatural power of hearing women's thoughts - goes against the grain of his mid-movie conversion). Mel's effort at repairing a damaged relationship with his 15-year old daughter, however, is a fine addition. As the father of a 15-yr old girl, I can relate.Most of the women in this film are two-dimensional (although the roles of Gibson's two secretaries are a scream BECAUSE of their air-headedness), but you need to remember that this movie is about Mel Gibson, not Helen Hunt. Hunt is ok, but her role is shallow. Alan Alda (my, is he getting old!) hires Hunt because she's a shark, but she turns into a pussycat. And there simply is no chemistry between Hunt &amp; and Gibson. They come nowhere close to matching the George Clooney-Michele Pfeiffer chemistry in `One Fine Day.'Lots of laughs; great soundtrack: 8 of 10 stars.Now, in the spirit of Election 2000, I propose a recount:If you have seen the trailers to this movie, subtract one point. Just like the interstate freeways have become the scourge of small town America, so, too, have trailers become the scourge of good movies. You might recall `Bicentennial Man' with Robin Williams (although it WAS a very forgettable effort). The trailers had ALL of the funny lines in the entire movie, and you were left mouthing lines as if you were at your favorite music star's concert. The trailers for WWW had many of the funniest lines, just not all. But the movie trailers DID lessen the viewing enjoyment of WWW. 7 starsIf you have a difficult time believing that office romances are romantic, subtract another point. Again, `One Fine Day' worked better because Clooney &amp; Pfeiffer were not working in the same office together. When will movies and TV get over the fact that potential sexual harassment in the workplace is NOT romantic? Bad ending. 6 stars.Hurry and pick your rating before we call in the Supremes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're in the mood to spend two hours (maybe even a little more) with Mel Gibson, then this is the movie for you. He's intelligent, he's funny, he's sexy, and you even forgive him for playing a man's man (borderline mysoginist). It's unfortunate that the female characters are not up to par. Helen Hunt was a terrible pick as Gibson's love interest since there is no chemistry between the two of them (not to mention that she looks so much like a man). Now the chemistry with Marisa Tomei is out of this world, but once again she gets stuck in the ditz role (what a waste of talent).The movie starts strong and for about an hour, you're really enjoying yourself. Then things start getting fuzzy in the script and the end is just thrown together haphazardly. Not to mention that the movie is way too long. They could have cut at least 20 minutes of bla bla bla. I left the theater wondering why a movie about what women want had such pathetic female characters... and why is it that what women want is not really a secret? The guy I took to the movie had been expecting some good insight, but he left with no new information on the female psyche.Overall, this movie will draw you to the box office with false promises, but will leave you wondering where the time went. Mel Gibson will rock your world, and Helen Hunt will give you nightmares. It's fluff, which is to be expected, but I'm getting sick of half-ass scripts and poor casting choices. Bottom line, it's a date movie that will give you plenty of time for making out (if Hunt doesn't break the mood).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson plays an advertising executive who suddenly becomes able to read women's thoughts, which he uses to his advantage until he become a reformed character and starts wanting to help women instead of taking advantage of them. Too sweet for words. The women in the film are a bunch of hopless losers, all of whom need the help of a man (Gibson, of course) to help them out. Helen Hunt plays Gibson's boss, and she's so sweet and helpless you wonder how she ever got to be a tea-lady,let alone a top executive in a ruthless business like advertising. Gibson stitches her up by stealing her ideas, and naturally she can't do a thing to help herself, poor little thing, until he takes pity on her. His daughter spends most of the film slavering with lust over her boyfriend, then suddenly she inexpicably goes off the idea of having ... with him (why?), but she can't get out of it herself, oh no, Daddy has to come and rescue her. And the girl in the office who's going to commit suicide because she can't get promoted (yes, honestly) guess who comes to her rescue. ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A patronising, politically incorrect mis-mash - 60%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something I'm often found to be saying is that if the great Albert Einstein couldn't figure out how the female mind worked then mere mortals like myself have no chance. However, I have my doubts that it rarely works as it does here in this modern update of your classic battle-of-the-sexes rom-com. However, before you find yourself reaching for the nearest remote or Van Damme rental, you might be inclined to persevere with this fairly middling effort. It might have a few snappy one-liners here and there but I frankly felt a little surprised that such an old-fashioned movie like this had been made. It felt stereotyped, deeply implausible and left a nasty taste in the mouth.Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall, a womanising advertising exec who considers himself the ultimate player. Over-looked for promotion by his boss (Alan Alda), Nick's day gets even worse when he finds himself now working under a high-powered female rival - Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt) - and forced into focusing his energy on developing a campaign for women which he struggles to do. Then, after a freak hairdryer-in-the-bath accident (bear with me), he suddenly develops the ability to hear the thoughts of all women. Naturally, Nick decides to use this to his advantage and strives to get McGuire dropped as soon as possible but the more he hears her thoughts, the more attracted to her he becomes.Now, I realise that women are far and away the more complex half of the species but watching "What Women Want" was either a startling education into how shallow a lot of women are or grossly inaccurate. All women are either shameless flirts inside, emotionally crippled or vicious hard-nosed bitches ready with a snotty aside at a moment's notice, according to this film. Some mistake, surely. Gibson actually has very little to do besides swagger and strut - not exactly a stretch for Hollywood's favourite ladies man - but Hunt leads the disappointments among the other performers. But I don't blame them - there is only so much life you can breathe into a walking two dimensional stereotype and despite pretending that this is contemporary and "new man", this is actually about as politically correct as a Miss World contest. Even the gimmick of seeing Gibson in tights trying to wax his legs is hardly original - anyone not yet seen "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"? And yet, I still enjoyed "What Women Want" though it is hardly an Earth-shattering moment in movie history. Despite the lack of any respectable acting or consistent comedy, the story made me stick with it to see if it all came good in the end but by the time of the final credits, I realised that it had gone on for far too long. The premise is just about entertaining enough but again, I felt that it just wasn't explored enough. Once Gibson gets around to trying to trump his boss and sleep with the good-looking waitress at the local coffee joint (a wasted Marisa Tomei), it seems to run out of ideas. Trust me, I'm grateful that it isn't as bad as other gender-swap comedies I can think of (Rob Schneider being one of the few men in this world I would happily like to lock in a coffin full of cobras) but this isn't as riotous as it might have been. Pity - I'm sure Gibson's humiliation deserves a higher score than a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What Women Want" is one of the few feminist but male-friendly romantic comedies that have some soul whilst making an uncompromising laugh out of both of the sexes. It never seems to take itself real seriously (and I think that's because the writers knew that they couldn't come up with a more interesting/original twist with how Mel acquires his secret power). Nevertheless, a guy could really learn a thing or two about how women think after watching this. It's not the gospel, but there's a little room for tact in every man, and this movie delivers it while entertaining you at the same time.Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, a CEO of a Chicago advertising firm and a pompous, arrogant, superficial, Frank Sinatra-loving playboy/bachelor/jerk at the same time. He is accidentally electrocuted when "sampling" some complementary women's products only to be able to hear the mind's voices of what every woman is thinking when he comes to. He's terrified at first, but after seeing his shrink (a cameo from Bette Midler), he embraces his new power. It helps him compete in his job with rival Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) as well as construct a relationship with his estranged daughter (Ashley Johnson), and land the cute aspiring actress-turned coffee shop barista Marisa Tomei, into bed.The film is light and funny throughout, but begins not to know what to do with itself within the final twenty minutes. Basically the first half is cute, but then it seems to get over-sentimental and sappy. The love theme between Gibson and Hunt works off their chemistry, but it is also a tired and contrived requisite in today's romantic comedies. I love the stumbling in the park and the different thoughts to every female (along with the poodle and her French accent). And the scene where Mel and Marisa are going to get it on is a hoot. I love his mannerisms when he tells Marisa later that he's gay. Little touches like this also include Mel imitating Sean Connery's way of saying "adversary" when channel surfing. And later, Gibson sobs while watching Richard Simmons. And I know Mel had to be the sensitive, caring, good ole dad to his rather unattractive daughter (I just don't buy that Gibson and Lauren Holly could have a kid that ugly), but that's when the story began to derail.There are many rising stars who have gone on to other projects since, like bits parts from Mark Feuerstein, Sarah Paulson, Judy Greer, Lisa Edelstein, Loretta Devine and others. Former TV army surgeon Hawkeye Pierce even has a few scenes that really anyone in his age bracket really could of played.Since watching this though, I learned a few do's and don't's to say to women (this was one of the first movies my girlfriend-now-wife and I watched together). And to know that women are about as neurotic as men is comforting thanks to this film. Like I said, this is a great date movie as well as one of those gems you always leave in your DVD collection when there's nothing on cable one night.I would of given it a higher rating if its ending was as original as its beginning. No movie's perfect...</fullReview>

The female cast on other hand, ie- Helen Hunt, Marisa Tomei and the teenage daughter were far more natural and outdid Mel. They saved the movie while Mel sort of ruined it.

		<shortDescription>Well-played for laughs - even if they are -predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics have, in my opinion, been unduly unkind to this Mel Gibson comedy about a macho man advertising executive who suddenly, by a freak accident, can hear women's thoughts. Predictably, this makes him into the ideal "new man." The movie is utterly predictable, even down to the exact lines of dialogue used (towards the end I was guessing the next line with my friend by whispering quietly to each other the "next line" - which was quite easy.) Having said that, I enjoyed it immensely, as have most people I know who have been to see it. Gibson plays the comic well, has almost learnt to dance, has absolutely know chemistry with his opposite number (Helen Hunt), but this is straightforward entertainment, accurately contrasting the extremes of how men and women think differently and playing the audience for laughs. Believable? No. Good light-hearted entertainment that doesn't take itself seriously? Yes! The addition of a competent song-and-dance routine probably would have earned it very minor classic status rather than just popular fun.</fullReview>

The fact is that the main plot was good enough, but what makes you leave the cinema, after watching a comedy, with a smile on your face are the details that make the movie last 2 hours. If they are not able to fill the movie with such "details" then it's time to edit scenes. It was actually loooong and boring 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, to start off with, I'll be very realistic and tell you why I hate this movie. But first of all, Gibson was born with a talent, which he hasn't used very well throughout his career. He made Gallipoli and Braveheart, the only good movies he ever made. Now, this movie is a bad movie because the storyline is dumb, although someone may say it was original, but it was still dull and boring. The acting was horrible, especially by Gibson. Mel has to make some kind of a better body language motion in the movie than just swallowing after being scared. Helen Hunt was horrible, and the only movie I like of hers is this old series, but I forgot the name. The directing is simply the worst and thank god Gibson didn't try to direct this movie. I thought Gibson was something, I admired him a couple of years ago. Now I know what kind of a man he is. What kind of a man takes this kind of movie in his filmography?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have nothing nice to say about What Women Want. I thought the movie was tasteless. It was humourless. It was boring, it was long, it wasn't clever, and never was it ever interesting. Gibson may have been at his all time worst here. Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson have as much chemistry as oil and water. The main character was manipulative and not worth any sympathy ever. When he got struck by lightning he should have died. At least that would have made the movie shorter. I really hold the female gender in fairly high regard, but if this is what passes for romance to women, and men for that matter, I have lost respect for almost everybody. And really, the last scene between Hunt and Gibson was a huge cliche. Helen Hunts character should have kicked him to the curb after all the s**t he did to her. Instead she plays the heroine. Just horrible. Nothing in this movie was remotely half decent, except for the fact that I never ever have to sit through it ever again in my life. And I won't. A big fat ZERO out of ten. Negative points if its at all possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2/3 Great !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's in the script, and I mean it in a good and bad sense. First of all this is unique movie, since it's a romantic comedy with supernatural case as well. And what a supernatural it is : reading the mind of the women (the dream of all the men!). The movie's first 2 thirds are super; everything looked masterful, hitting the mark brilliantly. But the third act wasn't the same at all. From the moment of the unexplained matter of losing the superpower till the laconic end is nothing but a dismal, especially when all the good funny memorable characters that we saw before got no chance at all to have a final statement or a reasonable end or anything equals their earlier nice noisiness. (Josh Goldsmith &amp; Cathy Yuspa)'s fantasy factor wasn't built on solid ground or even got its own fantastic logic, which's something you'll going to witness again and clearly at their next project (13 Going on 30 - 2004). The storyline of (Marisa Tomei) was trivial and just for assuring how the lead's character, by his lie about himself as a gay, will go straight in his new relationship. It didn't also give us the great chance to see how the man's man would do when he got faired at the end, or how he would work under the authority of his woman lover; a never done anticlimax. Obviously we have a very smart script as a criminal here, which mistreated the third act. Though : this is one enjoyable movie, got the esprit, rhythm, and the glamour of Sinatra's songs (something not existent in any of today's movies), it even managed somehow to be a very rare superhero movie where the main idea is so cinematic and not based on a comic. (Nancy Meyers) handled the job of directing so fine, I think it got something to do with the fact that she's a screenplay writer herself. She knows the good script when she sees it, still in love with the intelligent determined working women like her movies as a writer (Private Benjamin, Jumpin' Jack Flash, I Love Trouble), and she's capable as a director of transforming the witness into image, performance, and lovely pace. Look at the movie's smooth status like a dream, no, it is a dream comes true. It has some amusing moments that all the elements succeeded in giving it a tasty flavor : the scenes of the lead alone in his apartment (talking, dancing, waxing !) there is so serene sense about them, the photomontage of the daughter trying to select the right dress with (Christina Aguilera) singing What a Girl Wants, the shot of (Gibson) standing in the face of fate asking to take his gift back; that was the top of them all summarizing the movie's distinctive talents and its magical personality in general. (Mel Gibson) looks great in his very late first romantic comedy (or his first pure comedy without action), the 44-year-old star used all of his real gifts to dazzle us with some brilliant performance that I didn't expect it to be as very good as this. He owns the role as if he is Nick Marshall in his real life ! (Helen Hunt) is a mine of live emotions, she can deliver at least 10 different reactions in one scene so simply, also her vocal performance was perfectly sharp, confidence, and sentimental exactly like her character. The writing mastered all the scenes that got a mind reading to be one of the movie's treasures. The too many characters made such a wonderful world around with fancy details. I loved the basic wicked idea of it where the man is just intimidated by the woman's intelligence. The message of a more sensitive man, or a more feminine one was well put, where the whole thing is about how he must "Listen carefully", yet not in a deceitful or manipulative way. Actually (What Women Want) has the rare ability to attract men and women equally, believe it or not my most male-fanatic male friends love it so much !! It will live long as a classic example for a highly entertaining meaningful movie that we wouldn't have many of it along the years, a solid romantic comedy where there is some analyzing for its 2 main characters, and as a movie where everything is great except its third third ! Although this makes it not on the top of them, but it's definitely one of my favorites.</fullReview>

That's if you want to spoil the fun. On the D.V.D you can also pick a different language. I give it two thumbs up for its comedy and graphics.

		<shortDescription>Groundhog Day without wit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie I was reminded of the plot similarities to Groundhog Day made 7 years earlier. Both have an oafish lead character who by means of a miracle gains an insight into others' thoughts and in the process becomes a transformed and better person. In fact What Women Want on the face of it has a stronger idea: the lead character can actually hear women's thoughts.But although these two movies at least at the concept stage are level-pegging it is the realisation in screenplay, casting and performance that make one a revered classic and the other a lead balloon. Bill Murray had a vehicle worthy of his great talents in Groundhog Day. Here though the match is of an entirely different kind: a pretty witless and clumsy script gets a pretty witless and clumsy rendering by Mel Gibson. Whereas Murray was subtle indeed deadpan yet unerringly accurate, Mel Gibson thrashes around wildly trying to raise a smile. The fact is that it is a role for a comedian or at least comic actor. Comedy's funniest moments are often moments of extreme seriousness - even slapstick at its most hilarious, as Laurel and Hardy showed, was when those involved appear to be in deepest earnest. The appearance by (an uncredited) Bette Midler - like Murray an accomplished stand-up comedian - gives things a welcome tremendous lift but this is only a brief light in the otherwise rather irritatingly wasted good idea the movie represents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>clichéd American comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably American humour does not cross the Atlantic well, but this followed the depressing trend of exploiting American men making fools of themselves for laughs. I suppose its kind of chic and a counterbalance to 50s themes of women being dumb dolls who basically need big strong men to look after them. But it palls very fast unless you like humiliation as a gag. In some sense it is a comment on the dismal relations between men and women in East coast America. The women are painted, self-centred, ambitious and ultimately as useless as Gibson's main character.Interestingly the film starts off by presenting Gibson's character as a 'man's man' (quote). In the short scenes that follow the 'man's man' is portrayed as a total jerk. The implication is that what men value in men and admire is crass and useless too. The alternative models of manhood (and there have been very many great men) are reduced to this shallow portrayal. In that sense the film is an accurate portrayal of a society that has lost touch with male values. But that is a comment on the film rather than the message.The rest of the film follows a predictable course of Gibson's redemption to a sanitised version of the modern male. If you can stay up to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Setting the scene, Mel Gibson's character is introduced in a pointless flashback that sees his childhood self being raised in exceptional circumstances. Why? I would have thought that the idea behind the film is that most men don't listen to women - whatever their upbringing? So why make him exceptional? The film only really gets going once he's been "gifted" with the power to read womens' thoughts. Then it becomes interesting. Though I'd rather have seen Bruce Willis play the lead. He's more of a man's man than Mel ever will be. Helen Hunt is adequate. And the daughter was forgettable. (btw Why was it portrayed as unreasonable for the Mel character to get angry when he found his 15 year old daughter bra-less and canoodling with her 18 year old boyfriend when he walked in unexpectedly. Like "Hey, Dad. That is like soooo uncool!" No it's not - it's normal!) The film is a fairytale. A piece of fluff. And unlikely to change the planet as we know it so why worry. Okay with pizza and wine on a cheap date, I imagine - especially if the guy wants to impress his girlfriend with his metrosexual credentials.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out well enough. In fact, it is very promising, at least in the first half. There are the great gags with Mel trying on pantyhose, using a blowdryer improperly, etc. And then there is the event, the event that changes his fate. Mel's character is about to learn a lot. And Mel Gibson is the man to watch. I love to watch Mel Gibson in this film.I love the comments on women's place in society, though I am dismayed a bit by the nature of the women in the movie. It seems these women choose as though programmed to want what they want. It seems too controlled. More oddball, out-there women would have made this film better for me.DEFINITE SPOILERS: I absolutely love the lightening strike, not one, but a few. And the women's thoughts are relevant to Mel's character, Nick. But I am not sure that those are the thoughts I'd be having, exactly. There is a kind of lack of realism in the content and narration of the thoughts, though a definite honesty. The honesty is what prevails.I am also touched that Nick helps a very troubled girl, but was quite troubled by my second viewing that he couldn't possibly in the end.What made me most annoyed was the ending. It was a typical romantic comedy ending. Nick gets what he deserves for misusing one lovely and good woman's thoughts. However, he still gets the girl. It isn't quite right. It's too sweet. Is this really what a man should get when he's tried to ruin someone's reputation? Is the woman, a seemingly independent woman, going to take him back like that? This was all a little too sweet for me.Nick learns, but what does this say really, about how much men can learn when reading a woman's surface thoughts? Especially when some of these thoughts are a little too simple. Are thoughts to be read to get women ("get" having many meanings here) and then have things turn out? I like Nick less as the film goes on, but like him because he's played by Mel, but not convinced he deserves what he gets. And I'm not convinced that even if this woman loves him, this is how the film's last encounter would go. Sure, it's possible for a woman to accept him romantically, but what moral message, or even message about reality, is sent here? It's not quite right to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quintessence of what I don't want in a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of reading the minds of females offered so much potential sexism that I immediately wrote this off, but my family wanted to see it, so I came along. A friend had said to watch it for one particular part. We never figured out what the one part was, but no combination of parts made it worth the ticket price to us.Mel Gibson does a fine job as usual; his early attempts to understand women without supernatural aid made my mom and sister laugh the most. I don't fault any of the other actors either. The problem was in the sequence of events. Now, I must have been doofy to expect any logic to the absurd premise, or any realism to the characters' actions. Maybe I'm silly for hating that deficit. But I had greater reason to abhor the predictability of it all -- how many times have I seen that formula, with only the main premise to differentiate the movies? Certain parts went on too long for comfort, the ending especially being a drag. And maybe this had to happen, but the makers barely touched on some of the humongous implications of female mindreading (e.g., it applies to female animals as well).There was filmmaker prejudice even aside from the sexism, like in the thoughts of the one black woman in the movie. On the rare occasions that I laughed, I felt ashamed of it because the jokes were far from clever.Despite the title, men left the theater saying they still didn't know what women want. My family was not convinced that Gibson's character had learned much either. The title may hark back to the words of a psychologist nearly abandoned in the scientific community, but I suspect the makers wanted us to think of sexual intercourse. If so, we had a single non-expository scene to pander to our lecherous desires.In short, the only basic negative elements I did not see in this movie were inappropriate violence and bad acting. It was Mel Gibson who persuaded me to give this movie as many as 2 stars out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Women Want had the charm and good looks of Mel Gibson, the beauty of Helen Hunt, and an interesting idea going for it, but didn't hit the home run I was looking for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall it had some funny and touching moments, but meandered at times, had subplots that weren't necessary, and an ending that left me wondering.Gibson stars as Nick Marshall, a good looking ladies man who works at an advertising agency. When the job he thinks he's supposed to get, ends up going to a woman named Darcy (Hunt), he gets a little annoyed. That night he ends up almost killing himself by electrocution in a bathtub, but instead ends up with the amazing ability to read women's minds. This of course freaks him out, but after a trip to a family psychologist (Bette Midler) he realizes the possibilities. He decides to try and undermine his new boss Darcy and get her kicked out so he can take her job. Along the way he starts to find out what everyone really thinks about it, and he finds out he's not as well-liked as he thought. From co-workers to his own daughter, people see him as a male chauvinist among other things, and women generally don't like him. He starts to become more in tune with what women want, and starts to change and care more about the women he used to just sleep with and kick out. Soon he realizes that he's in love with Darcy, but it may be too late. He nailed a big account, but he used what was in Darcy's thoughts to get it, and she might be out of a job, unless Nick can come in and save the day.What Women Want had a lot of potential for some great comedic scenes, but instead sort of floundered between comedy and drama. Mel Gibson is a very engaging personality (as well as being my favorite actor) and could have easily made this into a very funny movie, but instead the plot went dramatic. There was a story line that dealt with one woman feeling un-wanted and considering suicide. I'm not sure what role that played in the movie, other than helping to make the film much too long. If I (or any other man) had the ability to read women's minds, I don't think my first thought would be to undermine my new boss and try and take her job. I'm not sure what my first thought would be, but it probably would include the removal of women's clothes or something. There were a lot of things that weren't very necessary, like the scene with Marisa Tomei (who by the way has never looked worse) where Nick admits to something that isn't true. Scenes like that seemed just thrown in there, and weren't needed. The movie clocked in at over 2 hours, and could have easily been made in an hour and a half and still hit all the points it needed to hit. As much as I enjoy Mel Gibson, after a while I just kept waiting for a point to be made. As I said, Gibson is one of my favorite actors, so any movie he's in immediately gets a thumbs up. In this role he was able to use his charm and likeability well. Helen Hunt manages to play her role well enough, but I'm starting to notice that every character she plays is almost the same. Same quirky smile, same "hmm", same looks. She needs to start branching out a bit more as an actress before she starts to get stale. The supporting cast was good, but not a huge part of the movie. The soundtrack was great, where else can you get Frank Sinatra, Christina Aguilera and a song named "Bitch" all in one movie? The idea behind the movie was a good one, but not used as well as it could have been. Had the writer and director decided exactly what they wanted the movie to be, a comedy, drama or dramedy, maybe it would have been better, but it went back and forth too much and lacked focus. If you like Mel Gibson (even if you don't like him as much as I do), you'll like What Women Want. He's got charm to spare, and carries the entire movie on his back. It's got some funny moments, but also some serious ones. The story jumps back and forth and needed to be centered a bit more, but in the end, I thought it was enjoyable. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uneven and a bit stretched out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In `What Women Want,' Mel Gibson plays an ad exec so misogynistic in his outlook that he makes Henry Higgins look like Richard Simmons. A confirmed bachelor, he basically sees women as little more than sex objects to be wooed, made love to and discarded at his own convenience and pleasure. Suddenly one day a freak accident occurs, allowing Nick the ability to overhear what women are thinking. First he is stunned to discover that many of the women around him find him to be a crass, obnoxious male chauvinist. Then he realizes that knowing what women want beforehand might come in very handy in helping him in his conquests. Finally, he comes to empathize with the struggles women face in their lives, particularly having to deal with boorish oafs like him. Like most movies based on a gimmick, `What Women Want' offers both good and bad elements in about equal measure. On the positive side, the gimmick itself is a clever one ? as long as it remains fresh that is. It's fun watching Nick get his comeuppance as he comes to learn that what he thinks is attractive behavior to women is actually the very thing that turns many of them off. However, as is usually the case in these films, the gimmick eventually begins to wear thin, and when Nick starts going the reform route, becoming, in effect, a `sensitive man,' the film loses its satirical bite and becomes soft and squishy. (Actually, this theme was explored to much sharper and more hilarious effect in `Tootsie' almost 20 years ago). This kind of plotting was a staple in the TV series `Bewitched,' but there it was forced to wrap itself up in less than 30 minutes, thus avoiding the problem of diminishing returns. This film, which runs a needlessly long 126 minutes, ends up exhausting the possibilities of the premise quite early on. We always know where the story is headed so we simply wait around for the events to play themselves out. Moreover, the filmmakers want to cover far more ground than they are able to in one film. Time and again, we find ourselves deflected from the core element of the film ? Nick's romance with a fellow advertiser played by the always wonderful Helen Hunt ? by side forays involving his teenaged daughter, a coffee shop employee, and even a suicidal clerk at his office. I suppose this is an admirable attempt to give a fuller dimension to Nick's life and character, but the strands are never very fully developed and they end up attenuating the romance at the film's core.Gibson does a very fine job parodying his macho tough-guy image and Helen Hunt brings her unique glow to a woman who, though she finds herself at the top of the corporate world, still yearns for the peace and serenity that only a life of casual simplicity can bring. In an amusing casting coup, Alan Alda, long associated with `sensitive man' roles in the 1970's and ?80's, appears as Nick's boss. `What Women Want' offers some excellent performances and a few funny moments ? but the limitations imposed on it by its gimmicky nature ultimately do it in.</fullReview>

Ultimately it succeeded in d) none of the above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same concept with a twist falls flat on its face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past six years, Mel Gibson has played plenty of ho hum efforts. The ratio to that and box office receipts have kept in business for a very long time. WHAT WOMEN WANT, is very much another mediocre effort but with a different appeal. Like PAYBACK, THE PATRIOT, BRAVE HEART and a few others, WHAT WOMEN WANT is another personal vendetta movie but aimed at and about women (hence the title, of course). The script is sort of solid in this one, except that most of the meat in the middle should have been wiped out and put in the end when Nick is face to face with Erin. That's exactly why WOMEN fails: it is boring. Typical romance fare (this time, between Hunt and Gibson) should have either been worked on harder with less minutes and more feeling or completely taken out. More on this as it develops, but first, let us go to what we already know.Mel is Nick Marshall, the man every woman loves to hate yet he does not know it. Thinking he is God 's greatest gift to women, his ego takes a major blow when a woman takes his most sought after position. Frustrated, he grudgingly does a humiliating job of trying to enter women 's minds by trying on their products. A mishap in the bathroom shocks the daylights out of him and flattens him out for the rest of the night. Awakening the next day, he suddenly hears what women think. He does not know how to take it, until his former marriage counselor informs him of the benefits of reading women's minds. He then uses what women want from him and life to get what he wants. Particularly the job he coveted in the beginning.This was one of the few movies that drove me away from watching and reviewing movies. (The others being ANGEL EYES, MISS CONGENIALITY and ENEMY AT THE GATES). WHAT WOMEN WANT is a long movie indeed and a few times you will probably be either watching the clock or need a bathroom break. Nothing wrong with acting, surprisingly although both acting leads felt very much mediocre compared to the overall hype the movie generated (something like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT syndrome albeit where the hype outdid the movie). Everybody loves to beat on the script, and so do I this time around. Yes, the movie was too long. Ten minutes in the middle could have been scrap where another twenty from the mid section could have been put in an emotion filled climax with Nick facing up to Erin and Darcy at the end. Poor dialogue and an overall dull feeling make WHAT WOMEN WANT fall flat on its face. You will probably see it, but after the first half hour, you will probably want to do something else till the end comes.</fullReview>

Um, yeah, right. Well, that's the premise of this so-so typical Hollyweird love-story of sorts with Gibson playing the love interest opposite Hunt. The film takes a full hour for the setup making it a slow starter. And, the Gibson character is too likeable in the beginning...do we really need to see him dance solo ala Gene Kelly? Nah, I don't think so. The climax works but the denouement is awash in Kodak moments. The film does push the right buttons, however, which makes its poor craftsmanship easy to overlook. An enjoyable watch but best saved for broadcast unless you're gaga for Hunt or Gibson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and annoying comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nancy Meyers' What Women Want is another much-hyped and heavily publicised success at the US box office. Having arrived in Luxembourg for the ridiculously expensive Valentine's Day premiere at Utopolis, it is now expected to take our cinemas by storm too. And it undoubtedly will, because on paper this is very promising stuff indeed: Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt top the bill, Alan Alda supports, and the synopsis is interesting, to say the least.Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall, a successful advertising executive and notorious `ladies' man' who, after a painful incident involving a bath and a hairdryer, finds he can read women's minds - a welcome gift in theory, but one that turns into a bit of a nightmare and gives our hero his timely come-uppance. His new-found ability (Didn't he realise that men have always been able to read the thoughts of the opposite sex? It's just that, having tuned in, they've never found anything worth listening to ..) initially brings him further success in his job and - more important to the storyline - helps along his romance with his new colleague-cum-rival Darcy McGuire, played by Helen Hunt. But then it all goes pear-shaped as Nick has to cope with the downside of his life as an incorrigible macho.Gibson's influence on this comedy is obvious: his very own production company Icon is involved, and there are numerous references to earlier roles of his. And the screenplay gives him plenty of opportunity to show off his real comic talent and the quality of his interplay with Helen Hunt, who gives another solid performance after her parts in Dr T. and the Women, Cast Away and Pay it Forward - all three of them currently enjoying successful runs in Luxembourg's cinemas. (How about spending a whole Sunday afternoon and evening in a darkened room watching a Helen Hunt quadruple-bill?)So far, so satisfactory. What is disappointing, though - and intensely annoying - is the ending, yet again. This is another example of Hollywood just not knowing how to end a movie nowadays. Only recently we have had the embarrassing efforts of Pay it Forward, Cast Away and Harrison's Flowers lingering in the mind long after the final credits, and all for the wrong reasons. But What Women Want not only has a bad conclusion - it also starts off on the wrong foot. Strangely enough, though, the ninety minutes in between are hugely entertaining: a spot-on romantic comedy. The jokes work and the love story rings true. Gibson and Hunt make a great couple - they not only look good, they act well too.The film also features a couple of secondary plots - one involving Gibson's screen daughter, the other focusing on a suicidal office-worker. Both of these only come into their own in the final quarter of an hour, by which time I would humbly advise you to have left the cinema unless you want to emerge cursing either the director for not shouting `Cut!' in time or the editor for not getting rid of the superfluous footage. If you do leave early you will have seen a far better movie that anyone who sits it out through the painful last act.But don't get me wrong, because even if you stay to the end, you will undoubtedly have been entertained. Good actors, screenplay, editing (apart from the last bit!) and, crucially, superb comic timing combine to produce a refreshing film, one that stands out from the monotonous run of romcoms made in the US of A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started quite interesting, but not dramatically great. But then it turned to be really funny, really great ... and then...Well, actually, Mel Gibson movies are very good ones. He is a great actor and deserved the Oscar. And there is Helen Hunt. Well, she is a quite good actor, but she didn't deserve the Oscar. Since then I am always very careful, when I watch a movie with her.Like I said above, the movie started with nothing spectacular. Mel Gibson plays a pure macho. He is the "men's man". Sexy. Smart. And he is successful in his job. He is actually awaiting a promotion. BUT, then this happens. His Boss tells him, they want the women, they want this target group. So the poor Nick (Mel Gibson) doesn't get his promotion. Even worse, a woman gets the job, he should have get. This makes him very upset, very. And it gets worse. Darcy (Helen Hunt) gives ever employee a "woman" package with articles which are made for women. At home Nick tries to think into women, tries all the articles and then it happens. He slips fells in the bath with a turned on hair dryer. Luckily he doesn't die, but then he finds out, he can hear what women think...Sounds like a nice plot. Well it would be, if they didn't screwed it all up. After half of the movie, it got very very boring. They weren't able to get it right. They lost the drive. It turned out as "08/15" (very very VERY typical) love story "made in USA". It could have been better. Much better.</fullReview>

Basically, Nick Marshall (Golden Globe nominated Mel Gibson) works for a company, and they are letting male employees shortly experience what it is like to be a woman. Unfortunately, Nick has an electrical accident in the bath and he notices his change the next day. He discovers that he can hear womens thoughts. He uses his special talent to charm the women and give them exactly what they want. He uses mostly on his special interest, Helen Hunt as Darcy McGuire. The film is mainly about him uses his talent to woo women, particularly Hunt, until je somehow loses it and he tries to get her with his own ways.

The women are portrayed as pathetic in this film - they don't have an ounce of intelligence between them and don't come up with one interesting or intelligent thought. Basically though they shouldn't worry because a man is all they want to make them complete and happy.

Well right there is a great premise for a romantic comedy , you know your gonna get something funny. And you do.This is a very cute movie that is at times touching, at times sugary sweet, at other times just funny. It also stars Mel Gibson as the male lead and he's pretty good in this role. One thing about many romantic comedies is that the female all to often, carries the movie while the male lead can come across as pretty generic. Not here. Nick, the male lead, is very real and a genuinely interesting character as is Hunt's character.Helen Hunt was the perfect choice to play the Corporate executive and Nick's ultimate dream woman. Her chemistry with Gibson, while not being in your face hot, was subtle and interesting and somewhat more realistic then many on screen couples. All performances were good and the movie, while being another thickly formulated romantic comedy went about it's formula in such a fun imaginative way, it was nice. This is not a great movie and not one that will make my list of must Sees. It is however a bit more clever then some movies of this genre and it's a good choice for a rental. This is a fun movie, a romantic comedy done in a surprisingly clever way that rates about a 6.5 but I'll Give the acting a higher score. Not a must see but in a world of sometimes VERY bad romantic comedies one could do worse.</fullReview>

They think like little schoolgirls. If a man is not interested in women, but men instead (= if he's gay) he thinks and acts like a woman, because being gay means to be less of a man than heterosexual guys.

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from this movie and 'much' is something that we do not get. I was kind of interested by the trailer at the concept of mind reading but like UNBREAKABLE there is not enough of it.The plot is schmaltzy and clichéd and is presented in the most boring and unoriginal way. Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, an executive at an advertising company (lead characters in these type of comedies are always high-fliers, think of Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, Tim Robbins in Nothing To Lose, Anne Heche in Six Days Seven Nights or even Nic Cage in Family Man) who is very male-chauvinistic and is generally disliked by women. Then one night he is electrocuted in the bath while wearing panties and make-up, he wakes up the next morning with the ability to hear women's thoughts.This could have been cool but in a 127 minute movie (overlong) there is a window of about 40 minutes in which Mel is able to read minds and only 10 minutes of that is devoted to actually doing it. What a waste, it turns the movie into a totally pointless experience. If it had been different, if the main characters were younger, didn't have the clichéd 'high-flier' jobs or if the plot had more on it's mind than a man and a woman falling in love there could have been a cool movie here. Even the photography is bad, too many shades of brown and most of the picture out of focus with exception for the actors.Marisa Tomei is criminally underused. She is shunted into a sidecar role that fades further away as the movie progresses more and more into schmaltzy cliché. I know there are crappy sub-plots about Nick's estranged daughter (clichéd) and his attempts to abuse his 'powers' to better himself at work but these are really just there to boost the 'man and woman falling in love' story. Let's be honest, how many movies are out there are about a man and woman falling in love? Too many. Do we need any more? No. But because Mel is in it WWW has become a success.If David Schwimmer played Nick Marshall??</fullReview>

After all, he kicked the English out of Scotland and was a flying rooster. As for 'What Women Want'.... urgh.It's an interesting idea - giving a man the ability to hear women's thoughts. After this idea though you are left with Mel Gibson and the Helen Hunt flirting their way through a not-terribly-well scripted cigarette advert. Seriously, Mel Gibson seemingly chain-smokes through several packets of Marlboro in this one.I used to respect his work, but for Mel Gibson to star in what was nothing but a long cigarette ad was grossly irresponsible. He has forgotten how many young people he influences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why oh why do they make these types of film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I'm from another planet; perhaps I'm too much of a thinker; perhaps it's a date flick and I'm happily married, perhaps...There are some movies where I have to work hard to follow it through, but this one doesn't even give me a reason to want to do so...think of the time, money and energy invested in modern films like this one, and think of the poor kids the money could feed. Okay, I'm taking it too seriously, but in simple terms: The movie is not funny nor entertaining...ask for your money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too boring to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recorded this just to see if it was any good as the idea sounded amusing. I endured about 5 mins of drivel. I moved forward quite a bit, still drivel, and the guy who was I assume going to do some mind reading hadn't yet it seemed learned how and also he was a complete anodyne bore so far. The "conversation" and general events were mindless boring too - nothing much at all was happening.I flipped on once more to way into the movie. Still no sign of mind reading or any action of any interesting kind and the boring so-called mind-reader was still on the screen apparently doing nothing much still. So when does he manage the mind-reading which was the only reason I recorded the movie, ie hoping for some laughs? I'd had enough of the uncharismatic "hero" Was he Mel Gibson? If so, no wonder. I never noticed until this website for my comment that Gibson was in the movie. If I'd realised I wouldn't have wasted my time recording it, as I can't abide Gibson. I didn't recognise him.I didn't even bother to watch the ending which I usually do with movies I record that are too boring to keep watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the great misfortune to be trapped on an airplane playing this movie a few years back. It was a horrible experience. Seriously, if I hadn't been at 30,000 feet I would have run, not walked, for the exit. Even so I was seriously considering it.Though I'm a guy I don't actually mind the occasional "chick flick" when they're competently made, but I can't even begin to imagine what these people were thinking. At some point didn't somebody in the cast or the director or SOMEONE realize what an incredible crap-fest they were filming? This film is so bad that it's impossible for me to look at any of the actors the same way after seeing it. I lost all respect.I am forced to write at least ten lines for IMDb to accept my review, but the best review of this film I ever read was two words: "Not this."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad! Bad! BAD! Did I mention this film was BAD? Ok then. What troubled me a little is, who is supposed to like such a horrible movie? The only answer I can come up is some elderly females who think Mel Gibson is "cute". And guess what: If you think it's only Mel who sucks, the female characters are even worse! I mean with such an idiotic plot and cliche jokes, you would expect a visual redemption. But all females were UGLY! I think this has become a common recipe: When you want to address a female audience, put ugly female protagonists beside the handsome guy (see also Harrison Ford movies). Avoid at all costs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what women should not want...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...is to watch a movie like that. Every stupid banality is in this stupid movie. When it tries to be fun it is pathetic. When it tries to be romantic it is just boring. When it tries to send a message it is obvious. It sends us back to the 50's where people of soap operas are glued from ever. Also the notorious Notting hill looks like an intellectual and underground movie in front of this jurassic way to make a show. Unfortunately a lot of those old fashion and fatuous movies has been made during the last 2 years. I try to make a list: Runaway bride- Notting hill- Return to me- The next best thing- Message in the bottle- If you did not like those movies, don't go to see this last one. If you did, you have to go...you deserve it. But if you are a person over 12, Q.I. over 50, and you work to find your money,save it. I was forgetting the music. Classical evergreendisgusting old songs Perry Como style are played every 10 minutes. Horrible. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What love story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Women Want" is one film I could have lived without seeing. The characters are devoid of human feeling, and they have zero motivation. And its weak story could have made nearly enough material for a half-hour sitcom. I could barely stand watching Mel Gibson's performance as a man who obtains, through accident, an ability for understanding women. He learns to use his talent to spy on the private thoughts of women, essentially becoming a Peeping Tom, as it were. Helen Hunt did nothing to convince me there was any chemistry between principal characters, Nick and Darcy. Instead, I watched uncomfortably as these two stumbled and balked over what could have been very moving and romantic scenes. Director Nancy Meyers's approach was off target, and I never believed the two could ever hit it off.Gibson, who has become increasingly credible in dramatic roles, seemed to be out of his element within this context. His mannerisms gave me the impression that some scenes were shot only once, and barely rehearsed. And the lack of chemistry between him and Ms. Hunt led me to believe they had only seen the script a few hours before shooting and had only just arrived on the set.I was truly disappointed when the film dropped the ball on the relationship between Nick and Lola (Marisa Tomei). I thought this was a much better matchup. The audience is given a taste of something sweet, only to discover bitterness underneath. We are never completely satisfied.This film was really a waste of time and effort. I do not recommend it. Perhaps Ms. Meyers's talents are better suited for production and writing; however, "Private Benjamin" is nothing to brag about either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once and a while there comes a movie of which you really regret the fact that it's premise is just fiction? Life would so much easier if this was true. Dig this: Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) gets electrocuted by a hairdryer and when he comes to his senses again, he can actually READ women's minds!! What a treat that must be! Last time I suffered slight electrocution I was shivering for 3 days and Gibson gets to understand women??? Anyway?about the film. It all may look fresh and light-headed but in fact it's pretty routine and annoyingly superficial! We learn that the stuff women think about is actually ordinary and rather obvious (they don't want to get hurt emotionally, they want to prove that there's more to them than just a pretty face etc etc?) The screenplay contains a few major clichés, like tremendous emotional speeches and Gibson who automatically gets mistaken for a gay man. Or that dreadful moral about waiting for your `first time' till you're ready for it yourself?? Yuck! As far as I'm concerned, they could have done much better things with this basic idea. There are a few positive aspects to discover as well, of course. The acting for example. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt are a terrific on-screen couple and I really wish they had been given a better script to work with. Some good acting by familiar faces in smaller roles as well, such as Alan Alda, Lauren Holly, Marisa Tomei and even Bette Midler. `What Women Want' has got a high level of feel-good moments and feminisation message, but it's overall pretty neutral. Good, smooth soundtrack though?Lot's of Frank Sinatra oldies!I tend to know what women want as well?: this kind of cinema. Watch it with your wife/girlfriend/mistress and you'll definitely get lucky tonight ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly the worst movie ever made. The characters are too unrealistic for a cartoon. Mel Gibson's and Helen Hunt's on-screen interaction was nauseating and difficult to watch. There was no chemistry at all. Appearances by Marisa Tomei and Alan Alda offered no credibility to the script. Some characters' actions were so unbelievable they seemed to be under the influence of some chemical, unable to make sound, rational decisions. Gibson has done much better work, and Hunt had previously held my respect for her performance in "As Good as it Gets." Nancy Meyers, writer and director of "Something's Gotta Give" and producer of "Father of the Bride" can't make it work here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two words....."don't bother."Unless she's a die-hard Mel Gibson fan, NO woman wants this movie! It's a total insult, chock full of sexual innuendoes. When Gibson uttered "I'm gonna be the one who knows what they [women] want, and why they do those cookoo things they do", I reached for my car keys. "Cookoo things they do"?? Give me a break!Next time, how about "What Men Want"? Picture it, 90 minutes of non-stop crotch grabbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insulting to the intelligence of women and men. Way behind the times in its fantasies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Mel Gibson fan going all the way back to the first Mad Max, I thought this movie would be entertaining. The trailers shown in previews make it look like a light-hearted comedy. And with all the hype in newspapers,magazines, and late-night talk shows, anyone would think this movie marks a breakthrough for Gibson. What a joke! I don't know anyone -- woman or man, of any age -- who thinks this movie is even slightly amusing (with the exception of seeing Gibson wax his legs). The attitudes toward women all the way through the movie have to make any mature person cringe. For example, one of the awful subplots (and there are several that make the movie seem longer than Tom Hanks' four years on the island) has Gibson involved with a coffee shop waitress. He doesn't care 2 cents for her, goes to bed with her to prove his "manhood" (in one of the most vulgar sex scenes in any PG -13 movie!), then totally forgets about her. A week later, she shows up at his apt. house, out of her mind because she can't stand the thought that he doesn't care about her. Of course, he doesn't care about her -- he has a whole new life as "Mr. Sensitive," which apparently doesn't include ever having to say he's sorry for grinding women under his heel. The movie lets him get away from her by saying he's gay -- and supposedly that's all she needs to hear for her insanely obsessive world to be all right again. Why does this movie include so many women with such inane ways of dealing with real life? When we left the movie, everyone was saying how stupid it was -- because it DOESN'T have any insights into what women or men want. You would think this movie was put together by men who hate women -- and themselves. Don't be taken in by all the hype about this movie. It is one of the worst movies ever to pull people in by trailers!</fullReview>
