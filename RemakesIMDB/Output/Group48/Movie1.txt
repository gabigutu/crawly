		<shortDescription>The Hit-man And The Schnook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For what turned out to be his final film, Billy Wilder decided to adapt the French black comedy L'Emmerdeur to America and he and his writing partner I.A.L. Diamond came up with Buddy Buddy. As it turned out I saw this film back to back with Wilder's Kiss Me Stupid. In that one, a whole lot of talented actors couldn't raise it above mediocrity. But in watching Buddy Buddy I failed to see why this one was slammed as bad as it was. It's not anything close to what Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau did in The Fortune Cookie or even in the remake of The Front Page. Still Buddy Buddy does have its moments.Of course the film does hinge on the incomparable chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau and they save the film essentially for Wilder. They are two total strangers whom chance throws together at a most inopportune moment.Matthau is a professional hit-man who's been given the job of killing three stoolies who are to testify at a mob trial. He's got the first two and has a plan set for number three.Then of course he meets Lemmon who is despondent over his wife leaving him for a fake sex therapist. He checks into the same hotel in the room next to Matthau who is readying his hit and tries to commit suicide. For the rest of the film Matthau is forced to take an interest in this schnook's marital problems to keep from committing suicide and bringing a swarm of police to the hotel. Matthau and Lemmon get into some pretty funny situation as there seems to be no end in sight to what can go wrong with a well thought out plan. Lemmon's wife is played by Paula Prentiss and their marriage seems very much modeled on the one Lemmon had in The Fortune Cookie. Things work out just about the same way for the unhappy couple.Things kind of work out for Matthau too in a rather unbelievable way for which you will have to see Buddy Buddy. And while it's not like some of the great Wilder classics of the Fifties when Billy was at his creative best, it's far from the worst film he could have gone out on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An often over-looked classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buddy Buddy," although not the best film ever, is definitely a comedy classic. It took me a while to find it, which surprised once I had finished watching. The chemistry between Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau is amazing and it is as strong as ever in this film.This is the film for everyone who has that one person in their lives that somehow manages to appear at all the wrong times and become more and more annoying with each visit. It's been said that we laugh because things are true, not because they're funny, and this film proves that. Sure, we've probably never met a suicidal television censor while trying to kill someone, but we can most likely all relate to how Walter Matthau feels always running into Jack Lemmon.I tell everyone I know to watch this movie, and I've yet to hear anything bad about it. If you're in the mood for some good laughs and a classic comedy duo, then you must give "Buddy Buddy" a watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's last laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all watch films for different reasons. In 1981, it was a new film by film great Billy Wilder with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau after 1974's "The Front Page". But for me it was a new occasion to see the elusive Paula Prentiss on the big screen. She returned to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio where she made her first motion pictures, under different conditions, for the studio had been sold in the 1970s. An adaptation of Francis Veber's play "L'emmerdeur", previously made in France by Edouard Molinaro, the resulting screenplay by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is as offensive as a sexist joke, but that's no news in Wilder's movies. The film has a fast pace and funny moments, mostly sustained on the verbal interplay between Lemmon and Matthau as two misogynists typical of Wilder's cinema. Prentiss plays Celia Clooney, a TV reporter who has abandoned husband Lemmon for Klaus Kinski, a sexologist who runs a clinic to improve people's sexual life. Lemmon goes after Celia, but he gets into trouble and gun-play when he meets Trabucco, a hit man (Matthau). All men in this film are so dumb that it seems almost logical that by the film's end Celia has run away with another woman (the receptionist at Kinski's clinic, played by Wilder regular Joan Shawlee). After the indifferent reception to what was to be Wilder's last film and joke on male sexual fantasies, Prentiss retired from films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In memory of two classic comedians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "Buddy Buddy" is yet to be regarded as a modern movie classic, no other films have made me realize the art of comedy such as this one. Walther Matthau is hillarious in his portrayal of Trabucco the assassin who is constantly being interrupted from doing his dirty deeds, by an even more astonishing and suicidal! Jack Lemmon. Director Billy Wilder has captured moments on tape that we all seem to relate to one way or another. Together with german actor Klaus Kinski, who more often played deeper roles than this, Lemmon and Matthau gives a performance one would normally find on a broadway theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as you've heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to find this movie posted on that famous video site, and sat down for what I thought was going to be a disaster. Billy Wilder's final film, as I've read and heard, was a disaster. Awful, a terrible end to the most brilliant of film careers. Well, after watching "Buddy Buddy" I find that I don't agree with that harsh assessment. Jack Lemmon plays his usual role, the put on Everyman. But to say that in a negative light is wrong. He played that character so well, that it is a pleasure to see him do it again. This time, he is trying to win back his estranged wife of 12 years, who has left him for a sex clinic doctor. Playing against type, is Walter Matthau playing a hit-man who has one last job to complete before retirement and a life of leisure on an island near Tahiti. As fate would have it, both men find themselves in the same hotel with much different objectives. Lemmon to end his life, and Matthau to end a mob snitches life, before he's able to testify in a big trial.Needless to say, hijinks ensue, and in my opinion, some really funny scenes. I won't spoil it, but give Buddy Buddy a chance. Is it "The Odd Couple"? No. Is it worth a watch for some harmless entertainment? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder-wise, a non-Wilder: amusement-wise, barely adequate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buddy Buddy", the final film of the genius that was Billy Wilder, is a decent comedy but not a worthy ending to his career. It's a remake of the French film "L'Emmerdeur", but I haven't seen it and am therefore incapable of comparison.Someone pointed out that the movie looks a lot older than it is. I very much agree.It is sad to see geniuses like Wilder and Diamond putting something as awkward as genital jokes into their script. Surprisingly, there is one clumsy slapstick moment. There are genuinely funny scenes and lines, too ("Father, you said the F word"), but they are a minority. Some attempts at creating humour fail terribly, as if made by amateurs (Lemmon chair-bound); most merely produce nods of acceptance.Matthau is good and Lemmon is amusing as expected. However, Paula Prentiss's performance is really disturbing, intentionally or not, and Kinski's character is just annoying - and I mean written that way.Overall the film, entitled here "Varsinaiset kumppanukset" ("Some Buddies"), isn't nearly as embarrassing as I'd expected; a mere shadow, nevertheless, it is of its director's previous masterpieces - if even that. But be not fooled: Wilder can't go bad (granted, I still have a lot to see). A few, pardon my French, comedy nuggets make this decent as an entertainment, and its two stars are okay. "Buddy Buddy", then, as a title... Meh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest Matthau/Lemmon buddy up. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the extensive list of team-ups that actors Walter Matthau and comedy pal, Jack Lemmon have done, this is not one of the best. It certainly isn't great material from the divine works of director Billy Wilder. But, it does have those off-beat misadventures moments that can make you laugh every now and again.Buddy, Buddy is the story of a mismatched duo, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon in their usual form with Matthau as the serious cynic, and Lemmon as the worrisome moralist. Lemmon plays Victor Clooney, a man depressed by the fact that his wife of twelve years wants to divorce him and instead, carry on the rest of her years with a deranged German sex-therapist doctor (complete with nutty German scientist garb including bleach blonde hair and pink lens glasses). Clooney takes a room in the hotel where he proposed to his wife, and happens to be staying next door to hit-man Trabucco (Walter Matthau), who can't seem to believe his luck. He's been hired to kill a Mafia witness, but in trying to complete the contract, he keeps getting involved with all of the idiocies of Clooney and his wife and the crazy sex clinic. For me, Matthau as the unshakable serious hit-man is what makes this movie so funny. It is as though he can't believe what he's gotten involved in and how idiotic the other characters are--Clooney, his wife, and yes, the sex therapist. What's more, is he can't seem to liberate himself from the likes of the incessant Mr. Clooney. The things that Trabucco does to (what he thinks) get himself away from Clooney and get his job over with are quite amusing. But only in slight. But, as I said before, this certainly isn't the best of the Matthau/Lemmon duos (the greatest probably being the classic, 'The Odd Couple,' and 'Front Page'; and of course, this movie pales in comparison to many of the great films in Billy Wilder's catalogue--some of which even include Jack Lemmon in starring roles). Moreover, given that it was released in 1981, this movie seems much older, like it was made in the late 60s or early 70s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Lemmon is Victor Clooney, a man who wants to commit a suicide and Walter Matthau is a hitman called Trabucco.When these two run into each other in the same hotel it can only mean lots of funny moments.Buddy Buddy from 1981 is an excellent Billy Wilder comedy.Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are amazing together and they always were.Unfortunately Mr Lemmon passed away last week on June 27 on cancer.He was 76 years old.That made me and many other Jack Lemmon fans very sad.Walter Matthau died last year.We never get to see this great comedy couple together again. But you can always watch their great movies on TV.This movie is a must see for every Matthau and Lemmon fan.There isn't a dull moment in this movie.Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Able to endure this rotten egg solely for the cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, tastes differ on films like this. A few reviewers like "Buddy Buddy," but others don't think much of it. Even those who enjoyed it didn't score it very high. The fact that so few people have commented out of the number who have rated it probably says as much. I think it's a dud for several reasons. First, it's not very funny. A couple of chuckles are the most I could manage. The plot idea is OK, but the screenplay with so many goofy aspects (the psycho-love palace, etc.) is way overboard. There is very little witty or clever writing for a Billy Wilder vehicle.Then there's the complaining persona of Jack Lemmon's character, Victor. I know there's a movie following that thinks "The Out of Towners" of 1970 was a very good movie. I can't seem to appreciate movies like that and this one that have nagging, whining characters who carry on throughout much of the film. I just don't see the humor in that. If it were a single short scene or two, perhaps. But that type of film soon wears very thin on me.I wonder if Wilder and/or MGM had their heads on, if not their hearts in this film. The stereotyped stupid cops and murderous use of clichés make it seem like they just wanted to toss something together and get done with it. Another reviewer noted the tedious repeats of Walter Matthau's Trabucco. He opens his suitcase, takes out and sets up his assassin's rifle, scope and tripod, and then takes them apart and puts them back in the case. Not once, but several times. Who, unaffected by mind-altering substances, would think that was funny, or interesting? Someone obviously thought it must be good, because it repeats so often. Well, that must answer my question, indirectly.On top of all this, the screenplay is quite crude and crass. I wanted to laugh, because the idea for the story had real possibilities. It just falls flat. My four stars are solely for a fine cast of wonderful entertainers who probably gave it a good shot, considering the rotten egg they were handed. That includes Paula Prentiss, Klaus Kinski, and others besides the leads.I'm a viewer who thinks this film is as bad as one may have heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Lemmon does some very funny over-playing as a suicidal man in a southern California hotel who makes friends with his neighbor, a grouchy hit-man on the verge of retiring after one last job, but the picture is botch. American remake of the 1973 French-Italian black comedy "L'emmerdeu" ("A Pain in the Ass") re-teams Lemmon and co-star Walter Matthau with director and co-writer Billy Wilder, but results aren't even sporadically funny. Wilder's witless script (with writing pal I.A.L. Diamond) is a wet noodle: there's no snap, just caustic flapping and nagging. This is also one of worst-looking major studio films of the 1980s, with lemon meringue color and cheap process shots. Matthau, constantly opening-closing-and-reopening his suitcase, looks terrible throughout; with his hair dyed too black and the color of his skin a sickly white pallor, he resembles a waxwork figure. Lemmon sticks close to his proved formula--his nervous/neurotic Lemmon-isms--and survives the morass, but everyone else in the cast has been prodded to play these gross jokes to the hilt. It's a pushy, ugly piece of work. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an unduly ignored comedic masterpiece. In his last movie, Billy Wilder went all out and showed that he still had it in him. Not that I'd had any doubts beforehand. I usually don't obsess about the cast, but in this case I'll make an exception: Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Paula Prentiss and Klaus Kinski make a memorable (and unlikely) lineup of some of my favourite actors (with the comedic couple Lemmon-Matthau adding up to much more than the sum of its parts). I wonder how Wilder and Kinski got along on the set.This is the English-language adaptation of French comedy L'emmerdeur (The Bullshitter), which I'm now really looking forward to see.The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lemmon and Matthau strike again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film features another brilliant performance from the veteran comedy duo, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau (sadly, both recently deceased). I shouldn't have to say anymore to sell this film to you. If you're a fan of Lemmon and Matthau then you'll love this film, if you're not, then you're philistines and who cares what you think anyway?This lovely example of early 1980s comedy features Matthau as an assassin who's been hired by the Mob to "off this stoolie". During the execution (no pun intended) of this task he bumps into Victor Clooney (Lemmon), a weird little man, whose wife has left him and joined a sex-colony.I can honestly say that I feel no need whatsoever to elaborate any further. As I said, Lemmon and Matthau's names in the credits was enough to make me watch this film and I'm so glad I did. It's hilarious! If you don't find this film funny then check your pulse because you're probably dead.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's no SOME LIKE IT HOT, but what is?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's last film is not a classic, but it's still highly enjoyable. Is it as funny as SOME LIKE IT HOT or as wicked as THE APARTMENT? No, but what is? A remake of the French film A PAIN IN THE A..., Walter Matthau is a hit man who has the misfortune of checking into a hotel room next to wacky suicidal Jack Lemmon. Lemmon goes from trying to kill himself to driving Matthau absolutely crazy. There no laugh out loud sequences, but Matthau &amp; Lemmon are priceless. Matthau, with his affected Brooklynese, is hilarious. And who can beat any film that features not only Matthau &amp; Lemmon, but Klaus Kinski and Paula Prentiss as well?!? A wonderfully entertaining film and a real bounce back for Wilder after his inert version of THE FRONT PAGE and his cryptic SUNSET BLVD-like FEDORA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God They Made "Grumpy Old Men"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic example of a film being produced simply because of the names involved. The plot is a weak attempt to make a Billy Wilder comedy in the eighties. I can almost hear how this was pitched to studio executives; "It's the Odd Couple meets Porky's"! Look, anytime the script invokes the clichéd name of Kowalski (always a cop, soldier, or construction worker)for a subplot character, you know the film is in trouble. This thing proves that without an original and inspired story, it's just a waste of truly great talent. This is the only film by Lemmon, Matthau, and/or Wilder that I cannot recommend. The only reason is gets more than a vote of "1" is that I reserve that number for the truly complete pieces of garbage, such as "Battlefield: Earth", "Ishtar", and "Can't Stop The Music".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddy Buddy is kinda cruddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buddy Buddy" is one of the biggest disappointments in film. How could they go wrong? Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, two of our best actors re-teaming with Billy Wilder, one of greatest directors. The result is a sloppy mess.Jack plays a man who loses his wife and decides to kill himself so he checks into a hotel. So far this is a complete copy from the classic "Odd Couple." Sadly that is where the comparison ends. Walter plays a hit man who happens to be in the same hotel preparing his next hit. Naturally he runs into the hapless Lemmon and can't shake him.Even with the familiar story you'd think there would be plenty of laughs. Sadly this is not the case. Major opportunities are blown as the film descends into a series of tired clichés and predictable bits. There are a few laughs (there would have to be with these two great leads) but they come too little and spread out.By far this is the worst film these two appeared in (though "Odd Couple 2" comes a close second). Happily we have many other of their works to view and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "Odd Couple" Teaming -- Billy Wilder's Swan Song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Matthau as a resourceful mob hit-man who is hounded by a suicidal Jack Lemmon who is desperate to win back his sex-cult-obsessed wife. Their paths cross constantly, culminating in the final scene's extremely far-fetched reunion. Billy Wilder's final film as director shows the master pushing the envelope, including gratuitous foul language and brief nudity, along with matter-of-fact handling of murder, vandalism and ridiculing the effectiveness of law enforcement.The scene where a hotel maid ignores the plight of a bound and gagged Lemmon is painful to watch. The woman "chats" with the victim without once considering that he needs help, bidding him good day as she eventually exits. This could be seen as an insult to Hispanic Americans, portraying the maid as a bubble-headed idiot.The way Matthau and Lemmon play-off each other is fun to watch. The many reckless ways of making fun of life were not always humorous to watch, but at times disturbing. This is not the kind of fun I expected from the "dream team" of veteran film makers. This is no "Seven Year Itch". With low expectations you may find a little joy in this rather desperate attempt to deliver laughter.</fullReview>
