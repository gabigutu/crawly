		<shortDescription>Finally a coherent film version of the Tarkington classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it; Orson Welles's movie of The Magnificent Ambersons is a magnificent mess through no fault of its highly regarded director. Cut and edited to pieces by studio hacks (Robert Wise!!!) with the excised material now lost, the movie exists as a mere torso rather than a whole experience. So much is missing, that the movie is hard to follow unless you've read the book. The movie is certainly not what Welles wanted and it is unrepairable; a great tragedy in film history.The new version on A&amp;E may not have Welles's unique directorial ability or atmospheric lighting in black and white, but it does tell Tarkington's story coherently and on the whole, quite successfully. Director Alfonso Arau has purposely avoided the look of the Welles film, opting for a rich, epic color palette. The art direction is beautiful and you really get a flavor of turn of the century midwest American life.Many reviewers have complained of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers performance of George. Frankly it is a brave and quite accurate portrayal. Tim Holt in the Welles film was hopelessly too mature looking to play Tarkington's headstrong brat. Georgie is not a very sympathetic character in the book and Rhys-Meyers studiously avoids turning him into the bland leading man that Welles allowed Holt to portray. Those that take issue with Rhys-Meyers don't know the book. He is the right age and certainly the right look for this difficult character. He is a dynamic actor that isn't afraid to be true to a character's inate nature. He's not easy to take at times, but Georgie isn't either!Many have also criticized Jennifer Tilly's Fanny as not being the equal of Agnes Moorehead. Again, Tilly is closer to the book. Fanny is a hapless character which Tilly invests with a wonderful degree of humanity coupled with her unique brand of eccentricity. Moorehead had not not an ounce of charm and frankly was miscast. Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, and Bruce Greenwood are all excellent as are the supporting players.Is this the ultimate version of this classic. Of course not. It is, however, a well made, BBC style television movie that is very true to Tarkington's novel and tells the story clearly, unapologetically and with some amount of panache. I give it an enthusiastic recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Jonathan Rhys Meyers performance as the snobbish, bullying, insecure Georgie was great. This guy bases his whole life on being the scion of a wealthy, upper crust family. When his family status drops, Georgie must find himself to escape from his arrogant dependence on his family name. I found the romance between Bruce Greenwood and Madeline Stowe somewhat tepid. Stowe looked old, and hardly the radiant beauty that Greenwood remembers. However the critics who say that Georgie shouldn't have been able to break up his mother's romance don't understand the social climate of the time period. The turn of the 19th to the 20th Century was an interesting time in America. Tarkington's book is about the changing social order, by showing the rise of self-made men over old money and lineage. I thought that was done very well in this production, but based on the other comments I appear to be in the minority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any time that A&amp;E makes any minisieries, I am very curious because the company makes really great things. Well, I've now seen "The Magnificent Ambersons" two and a half time. It's wonderful. Every character is fully dimensional. It's a new trend I've noticed that not too many films are picking up on, but the dimensionality of characters adds to the richness of the film. There isn't one character that you don't both like and also get irritated with. I am especially impressed with Tilly's performance as Aunt Fanny. I enjoyed Fanny because she was such a person; irrational, concerned, and nosy. Amazing. Madelein Stowe is a favorite actress.But the real reason to see this film is for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' performance. As Georgy, Rhys-Meyers could have easily played a cold snob unattached to anyone. But he doesn't. Rhys-Meyers' George is cold, but he's also vulnerable. He's bold, but he has so many moments where he relates to everyone he deals with in either a friendly manner or otherwise. Even when throwing out his mother's boyfriend, there is cold assurance in his eyes, but only someone with something to hide can act so rigid. He makes a safe transformation in the moments after his mother's death. Maybe it's too sudden, but nevertheless it's convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like I have to comment on this movie because of the rather indefensible comments of several reviewers. "The Magnificent Ambersons" is one of the great American tragedies; and its translation to the screen still remains a tragedy. I thought this A&amp;E version was a lovely attempt although as Madeleine Stowe reportedly said before the production aired, they still didn't do it justice. If my understanding is correct, they were working from Orson Welles' original script which he was not allowed to bring to the screen in 1942. The tragedy of this production is that it is never quite as great as that flawed 1942 version, and so the informed viewer is left wondering what it would have been like to see Agnes Moorehead and Joseph Cotten play the final tragic scenes instead of Jennifer Tilly and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. I didn't think either Tilly or Meyers were particularly perfect for the parts; but they were neither as bad as many reviewers make them out to be nor as great as I remember Moorehead and Cotten to have been. So watch both screen versions, combine the two in your head, and you'll have one of the greatest movies never made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stand Alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having read the book, nor having viewed the original Welles version, I watched The Magnificent Ambersons based on it being a period piece. I was also slightly intrigued that it was supposed to be a remake of what is considered a Welles classic. I watched the movie and found it stood well on its own. I was surprised to find it aired in 2002, as it is avant garde in form and has a fresh creativity, and even a daring in its approach that I would expect only of more recent films. The assembled cast is brilliant: Bruce Greenwood is the upbeat, returned prodigal, accompanied by his equally winsome daughter Gretchen Mol; James Cromwell is the patriarch, and Madeline Stowe is the many layered woman torn between her old flame and her ever present love for her son, Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Jennifer Tilly as the spinster aunt adds to the ensemble quite nicely. This was at times painful to watch, since Rhys Meyers's character, George, is so absolutely obnoxious in his arrogance, but this is can be overlooked as George's behavior and personality is what makes the piece tick. Some have criticized Rhys Meyers, yet I found it a very convincing performance. As the uncle put it, "Georgy, I've always been fond of you, but I haven't always liked you." I couldn't stand George, yet there was something that almost made me root from him. A long movie, 150 minutes; however, good acting,creative filming, and a fascinating plot make it worthwhile viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguided Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of Orson Welles, I have only one word of advice for you: avoid. This is a truly dire and misguided attempt to 'correct' Welles' masterpiece by including passages from Booth Tarkington's novel to make up for the long lost sequences cut by RKO in the 1940's. What the filmmakers have overlooked, however, is to include modern equivalents for the innovative direction, lighting and great performances that make the original version (even in its forever truncated form) one of the most eminent masterworks in American cinema. Although I will refrain from going into length here about its many shortcomings, the main detraction (even for curiosity's sake) is the (mis)casting of the wooden Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as George Amberson Miniver. No match for the wonderful Tim Holt, Rhys-Meyers pouts and whines his way through the film with seemingly no understanding of what the story is about or is trying to convey. Taking the shallowness and pomp of the character too literally, this vanity performance shows no inner life and, as a result, the character arc is practically nil. For those of you who want some idea of what Welles had originally shown that ungrateful audience in Pamona, track down a copy of Peter Bogdanovich's book-length interview with Orson ('This Is Orson Welles') and refer to the appendix which contains stills and script pages that reconstruct the missing scenes. Beware though, it just might make you cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third time's the charm?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd always heard that "The Magnificent Ambersons" was Orson Welles' masterpiece, but had never seen it until I got the two versions out of the public library. Now I'm even MORE curious about both the novel and Welles' screenplay. Welles' may have been ahead of his time cinematically, but the current version lacks bite largely because the storyline is outdated.Lacking a narrative voice-over, the remake presents events and motivations more clearly through visuals and dialogue. I thought the new casting was near-perfect in terms of character types, and the settings were visually stunning. In th A&amp;E version the viewer comes to mourn the loss of old- time aristocratic splendor, which in the Welles' version has a vaguely Gothic feel. Both versions, however, fail to absorb the viewer emotionally completely. Georgie definitely deserves a comeuppance, but neither version carries the full impact or allows the characters to grow to tragic stature.</fullReview>

And, JRM, portrays characters like Georgie to perfection. The whole cast played their parts well. As I mentioned before nothing is perfect in any film, but Myers is in his role here. His character really angered me at times, but hey isn't that what a movie is suppose to do? Evoke our emotions? I loved the movie. Worth watching 3 times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A disgraceful disservice to the memory of the creator of "Citizen Kane."RKO executives mangled the original Orson Welles masterpiece, leaving in its place a very flawed but interesting work with trend-setting photography and a roster of superb performances. But the numerous plotholes sank it at the box office.I had high hopes that the A&amp;E mini-series might be able to capture some of the promise of Welles' vision. Instead of filling in the story gaps intelligently, this version drags in some sly Freudian references with mommy/son (GASP!) bedroom monkeyshines to explain the still-inexplicable behavior of scion George.Making matters much, much worse is the hysterical, bug- eyed hamming of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in the central role. Not much better is a very silly Jennifer Tilly as Aunt Fanny, a meaty role which earned Agnes Moorehead an Academy Award nomination.This misbegotten, three-hour mess is a disaster for all concerned--especially the audience. And WHAT was with that insane snow-dance with the umbrellas?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply: an atrocity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and most atrocious? The DVD package's false advertising: "After 60 years, Welles' (sic)...vision has finally been realized." In a pig's eye. "Using the original shooting script, director Alfonso Arau...has re-filmed every scene according to Welles' (sic) directions." (The possessive of "Welles" is "Welles's," not "Welles'". Cheez.) And yet somehow without reference to either that script or those directions. Scenes are shuffled irrationally, others are missing, banal dialogue is added, there is an omnipresent, banal, and thoroughly unhelpful musical score, and the consistently perverse, absurd casting is compounded by equally consistent pathetically obvious bad acting. It is hard to say who is worst, but Jonathan Rhys Meyers is certainly the most insufferable, with his perfect and perfectly awful American accent, his ugly pouty face, and his complete lack of nuance. Jennifer Tilly -- an actress who, like Meyers, has done excellent work with Woody Allen -- is so lacking in any of the depth that Agnes Moorehead brought to the same role that -- well, it is criminal. Almost everyone in this has done better work -- but in contemporary material. (I needn't name names, EVERYONE is terrible... though the actor playing the 19-year-old Fred Kinney is handsome and has no chance to do any bad acting. He gets my vote. Also uncredited in the IMDb cast list!...Oh, alright: I will admit that Bruce Greenwood, Gretchen Mol, Dina Merrill and David Gilliam at least do play as though that had seen Welles's masterpiece and have some respect for it. But what can you do with direction like this???) No one seems to have even the vaguest notion that looks, behavior ... LIFE, was any different a hundred years and more ago from what it is today. Which difference, unfortunately, happens to be the very subject matter of Booth Tarkington's thoughtful, beautiful novel on which this horror is based. Both script adaptation and direction have proceeded with no sense whatever of what is most touching about the source material and the Welles film: their discretion. Compare the famous scene in which George learns that Fanny is penniless. The Welles version (and the superb acting by Agnes Moorehead and Tim Holt) is about the inability to tell the worst until there is no getting round it. The TV version is all about throwing plates and screaming. I will leave it to you to decide which is more effective. The suggestion of incestuous desire between Isabel and George is as loathsome as it is ridiculous. George's screams after the car accident: compare the absolute silence of George in the Welles film. By all means read the book, watch the Welles picture (a very model of adaptation from novel to screen), then watch this only if you want to experience genuine aesthetic pain.Why my comment is not ordered "worst" is beyond me. I could not be more disdainful of this hideous travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story and some good performances can't hide one essential weakness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Make no mistake, there is much to like in this remake of the classic Booth Tarkington story of the rise and fall of a powerful turn-of-the-last-century mid-western family and Orson Welles' classic film thereof. The scenery is some of the most beautiful seen in a made-for-TV film. The camera-work, in general, is outstanding. And there are some fine performances. Madeleine Stowe and Bruce Greenwood convey believability as the two lovers reunited after so many years, Gretchen Mol makes a fetching Lucy Morgan, William Hootkins (That's Lieutenant Eckhardt for you "Batman" fans.), rivets your attention every step of the way with his bluff, hearty Uncle George, and James Cromwell brings his usual understated warmth to clan patriarch Major Amberson. And the overall production his the usual A&amp;E understated glitz.So much for the good.Now, it's an old maxim in the entertainment world that, if you don't have a lead who generates even a little sympathy, the audience you hope to reach won't respond as hoped. In other words, they ain't gonna like your movie. And there's the rub: Jonathan Rhys-Myers not only overplays George Amberson to an almost comic degree, but plays him as such a spoiled, unsympathetic little creep that you almost want to give him a bust in the mouth on general principles. Nowhere, not even in the scenes of his supposed reformation, does he ever generate sympathy of any kind. In Welles' excellent 1942 film, Tim Holt played George Amberson as a rich brat, but he was, at least, a vaguely sympathetic rich brat. Now, granted, Holt wasn't much of an actor, but, at least, his understated approach was far better than Rhys-Meyers' overplaying. All that was missing from the latter's interpretation was a top hat, cape, and handlebar mustache. This is what Snidely Whiplash must have been like as a kid!In other words, you could do worse that the 2002 "Magnificent Ambersons," but you could do much better, too.Like renting the far superior 1942 original, for example, which does a better job in half the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' portrayal of George Minafer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In response to those defenders of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' portrayal of George Minafer in A&amp;E's "Magnificent Ambersons", I can only say that watching JRM in this role is just plain painful. I suppose the director gets to share responsibility with his leading man, but at what point do we just chalk this up to a bad job? All actors and actresses have "off" films. Perhaps this is that "bad day at the office" for JRM. What he's done before, or will do in the future has little bearing here. This role calls for a subtlety that did not show up in Rhys-Meyers' performance. Calling this an "interpretation" makes intelligent film lovers scratch their heads; and I believe even the professional critics had problems with this bizarre display. This "Ambersons" is destined for the ash heap, unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Staggeringly bad TV movie is an insult to Tarkington &amp; to Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This clumsy catastrophe is NOT made from Orson Welles' screenplay for his genius 1942 version, though it uses bits of it. The creators of this remake do everything wrong. The unforgettable prologue and narration are dropped entirely, important scenes are cut to make room for stupid new ones, others are shuffled and rewritten so they no longer make sense, and banal, foolish dialog is added.Tarkington's story is deeply grounded in a particular time and place: a century ago in the American midwest. Welles, a midwesterner born in 1915, knew the place and the people well. This version's Mexican director, Alfonso Arau, shows so little understanding of his characters and story, you wonder if he's ever met an American.Arau's choice of an isolated Irish country house to stand in for the Ambersons' urban mansion, located near the downtown of a city based on Tarkington's native Indianapolis, shows how clueless he is. That's like filming HUCKLEBERRY FINN in Vienna, with the Danube as the Mississippi.Every choice is as wrong as the mansion. There is no sense of place or period. All of the leads are grossly miscast. The speech, the manners, the attitudes, the tone, the bad acting, the cheap suggestions of incest ... nothing in this remake rings true.For George Minafer, the most American of protagonists, Arau weirdly goes to Ireland again, casting the amateurish Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who overacts like crazy in a phony, inappropriately-contemporary accent. Where Tim Holt was subtle and low-key, Rhys Meyers shouts, leaps about, and twists his pretty lips into sneers and scowls worthy of a circus clown.Granted, the 1942 cast was perfection. Arau's casting makes you wonder what he was smoking. Madeleine Stowe is nothing like Isabel, but she comes off better than most of the others. Morgan is the bland Bruce Greenwood, whose wrongness reminds one how profoundly sensitive and right Joseph Cotton was in the part. Major Amberson looks and talks like an ex-hippie; and the frail, sexless Wilbur is played by a handsome, hearty actor who has way more sex appeal than Greenwood, which makes nonsense of the love triangle.In the crucial role of Fanny -- the prim, plain-faced, repressed spinster aunt -- Arau casts (I am not making this up!) the vulgar, sexy Jennifer Tilly. Agnes Moorhead, heartbreakingly memorable in the Welles version, is rolling in her grave.When Arau tries to get arty, he falls right on his face ... turning George's birth into a 1960s acid trip and adding an absurd scene to the ball sequence, where Morgan waltzes with Isabel in the snow while two butlers try to hold parasols over their heads. This sub-Fellini touch is so idiotic, like much of the movie, it becomes unintentionally funny. Blunder piles on blunder. Isabel, Fanny, and George all appear to have collagen-injected lips, which sums up director Arau's apparent belief that Indiana in 1900 was exactly like Beverly Hills today. The dancers at the ball do the tango (!) as if the story's set in Buenos Aires. Nothing here seems to be happening in the United States, let alone Indiana.If you know the novel or Welles' flawless, if studio-mangled, adaptation, you will shake your head in amazement: how could this remake turn such wonderful material into such an embarrassing train wreck for all concerned?PLEASE don't let this inept, tone-deaf mess be your only acquaintance with THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. See the brilliantly written and directed, perfectly acted Welles version or read Tarkington's masterful Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Completed Magnificent Ambersons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version appeared on television three years ago, and was supposedly based on Welles' completed script. It got roasted by the television critics (probably unfairly) because it wasn't directed by Welles - lacking his great narration and touches. But it is not a bad film, and it does have a coherence that the other film lacks because of the truncated cutting.The only thing I disagree with is the emphasis on Welles' script. Welles planned to close the film on a down note with Lucy rejecting a crippled George, and Fanny living in a boarding house as the cook. This is not like the television version where an unrepentant, still arrogant George has to be accepted by Eugene as his son-in-law.But it was well acted and directed, and if not as great as Welles' work, it was entertaining and thoughtful. It also explained some of the problems linked to the plot that the truncated version did not go into. For one, why the collapse of the Major's fortune? The Major (John Cromwell) has to sell off his property to support Isabel and George (Madeleine Stowe and Jonathan Rhys - Meyers) on their prolonged trip to Europe. Don't forget, Georgie never had plans for a career, and he is depended on money from grandpa. As Cromwell says, "Does he think I'm made of money?" It also has the real moment of comeuppance that is not found in the Welles' version (in so outwardly a manifestation). George can accept the loss of outward possession, because he knows who he is and what his family was like. But he sees a book on sale in a local bookshop about the first families of Indianapolis. He sees it's expensive, but he buys a copy. He is shocked to find no mention of the Ambersons in the entire book. He is a little less arrogant after that.No, it is not the controversial classic of 1942, but it is - on it's own terms - a worthy film version too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting originally, if slightly disappointing...but getting much better with time (updated 8-3-08)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to watch this twice before I could finally settle down and enjoy it calmly. The first time I was so disappointed because it didn't begin the same lovely way that the novel &amp; Wells's film did: with that wonderful sentimental prologue of the fashions and the times gone by. (And I would like to know...why didn't it? Is it a tribute to Wells that they didn't feel talented or inspired enough to "pull it off"?)The second time around I "got over that", and managed to keep an open mind. Overall, it was alright, but somewhat stiff and cold. Did they ever consider using at least some of Bernard Herrmann's inspired score? Because the music used was definitely not memorable.Maybe in the end, this makes a better novel than a film; and maybe it was a mistake for Orson Wells to attempt to film it in the first place. As a free TV movie I give it a 7+.It was interesting to see the scenes that were cut in the Wells's film, and the original ending that Tarkington wrote. Much more coherent overall. They made Aunt Fanny more intense than the Wells's version. Apparently, the 1942 preview audience laughed at her hysterics, so some of her scenes had to be re-shot. The farewell walk between George &amp; Lucy was especially well done, and actually better than the Wells's version. Suffers from the apparent overseas location (Ireland). We are obviously not in the Midwest!(Update 8-3-08) Took another look today, much better this time around (a 9). Part of the problem is that us old timers still want to hold on to the myth that Orson Welles's version was a masterpiece...which in reality it wasn't. One thing you do notice is what a dry, quaint tale it really is. More of a "little old lady story" of wayward youth and ultimate redemption, mixed with the changing times of 100 years ago. Very good this time around...enjoyed it a lot...good production values and acting. How could I have been so blind the first times around? Surpasses Welles's version by a mile...!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Defense of Jonathan Rhys-Myers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps "Magnificent Ambersons" should have been left undisturbed in its first screen adaptation. A&amp;E certainly does not have the integrity or vision of, say, HBO, to undertake the kind of "restorative" project this billed itself to be. Their invariably insensitive and consistently maladroit placement of commercial breaks during their "fine arts" programming alone merits eternal damnation. In this instance, in spite of all the hype, there was no reason to expect anything of worth from them. (Let's not forget that Pride and Prejudice wasn't really theirs).Reading through the reviews posted I feel compelled to defend Jonathan Rhys-Myers as an actor. He is a very fine one, and has given many compelling performances, e.g., Gormenghast, Velvet Goldmine, Ride with the Devil, The Governess, etc. Much can be expected from him. Perhaps he needed a stronger guiding hand in Ambersons. Let us not forget that a task of the director is to ensure performances play off well within context..... there are dailies where certain things should leap as obvious. This does not invalidate JR-M's obviously controversial interpretation, but it does definitely place blame on the director for allowing incongruity of such high order. Jonathan is a talented man. This movie is but a blip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Added scenes from Welles' script clarify the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The viewers of the original Welles 1942 production of "The Magnificent Ambersons" were no doubt often mystified as to the plot line because so many scenes were cut by RKO. This newer version restores at least three episodes to flesh out the plot. The first shows Aunt Fanny and the hapless uncle actually putting down their money in the lawyer's office for the doomed headlight shares and the second actually portrays the accident which took Georgie to the hospital rather than simply showing the audience a newspaper clipping about the affair. And the final scene at the hospital bed was nowhere to be found in the original.As to the ending, the makers of the newer version definitely did not (despite the advertising) follow Welles' script completely since OW's own ending was a downer with Georgie being rejected. Both RKO and the 2002 remake both agreed on supplying a happy ending which I understand corresponds to Tarkington's own novel. To rationalize this one might agree that despite all of Georgie's vile behavior and misdeeds, still he was the son of the woman Morgan had once loved and to forgive and afterward see Georgie would always remind him of her. So it's not completely illogical and sentimental.The one definite miscasting I found was that of Jennifer Tilly as Aunt Fanny. She was nowhere near old enough to be anyone's aunt, compared to the original's Agnes Moorhead who was just about right.I found Johnathan Rhys-Meyers fascinating in his vivid overacting. He was the one you didn't want to stop watching. In contrast I found Tim Holt's version of Georgie in 1942 rather stiff and wooden compared to JRM's lively impersonation of a highly despicable character who made you want to jump onto the screen yourself and teach him some manners. The 2002 version brought out the Freudian Oedipal aspect of the mother-son relationship much more strongly than the original as well.By the happiest of coincidences I saw TMA just after watching in a theater the movie "Me and Orson Welles." In the movie, based on Welles' production of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" at the Mercury Theater in New York in 1937, Welles is shown studying Tarkington's novel in his spare moments and underlining important passages from it as well as quoting lines from it during one of his radio dramatic appearances. Welles explains to another character that Tarkington was a friend of his family. I'm sure that Welles, the spoiled son of an adoring mother, found Georgie quite autobiographical even though he appears in another man's book. By adapting Tarkington's novel into his own screenplay Welles certainly found a character in Georgie with whom to identify.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched Welles' original more than a few times, and so approached this 'made-for-tv' attempt with much apprehension. I was pleasantly surprised at the lush cinematic treatment and the superior acting. The treatment of the mother to her spoiled child gave just the right hint of their unhealthy and unconscious Oedipal situation; the mother even lying in bed in a black nightgown. I remain confused as to why the majority of bad reviews. Half the critics indicate the story is a "downer," but that IS THE STORY! You can see why Rys is tapped for the lead in Woody Allen's Match Point years later, and I recommend this film for anyone capable of enjoying objectively a well-made piece of film, and not pining away for the "happy ending" you've been taught to expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of redoing a classic movie is an intriguing one and the idea of doing one that allegedly got chopped by unfeeling studio hands, such as purportedly happened to Orson Welles and his version of this, is provocative, especially if they say are actually going to shoot from the original precut screenplay. At first, things seem promising and there are some fine actors doing some interesting things, and the production is handsome. But I could not figure out why I was not enjoying what was obviously a well- intentioned and lavish production. Then it dawned on me -- Rhys-Meyers performance was not simply of an unpleasant character, but a callow-seeming actor frowning and grimacing his way through an entire movie -- poisoning the drama at its core. It is truly the most painfully misconceived performance I can ever recall seeing in a major serious movie. It sinks the entire enterprise. The casting director and overall director must take responsibility. How could they not see at least halfway through the shooting of this that Rhys-Meyers work was an empty annoying hole at the center. Was he cast a a personal favor to someone? It seems inexplicable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rented this movie online reading it was using Welles' original screenplay, thinking it was his directors' cut. Got it and learned it was an A&amp;E remake for cable TV. Have not seen original, but watched this one anyway, and the acting was truly awful. The dude playing the grandson George was over the top and since his character is in almost every scene, it made watching this painful. There are few movies I won't sit through, but because of this guy, I kept asking my wife if she wanted to continue - which she did, though she agreed with me at the end. Close second to him was the acting for his aunt's character. For the rest of the characters, the acting performance was inversely proportional to the number of lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read Orson Welles' book or have seen the 1942 movie, but have seen this A&amp;E adaptation of The Magnificent Ambersons. This movie was almost painful to watch. Even though this was an all-star cast, I only felt that Madeleine Stowe (Isabel Amberson Minafer), Bruce Greenwood (Eugene Morgan) and James Cromwell (Major Amberson) were a credit to this movie. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (George Amberson Minafer) and Gretchen Mol (Lucy Morgan) may have looked their respective parts, but little else. Both Rhys-Meyers and Mol tend to overact their parts to a fault and Jennifer Tilly (Fanny Minafer) is outright hilarious, and not in a good way.This movie adaptation has been butchered in the worst way in that I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It's one of those movies that you see and tell yourself, "Well, that's 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best advice - see the 1942 Orson Welles version instead. The acting was terrible (I'm being kind). Sometimes I felt that the actors thought they were on a stage rather than doing a movie. "George" and "Aunt Fanny" were the worst offenders - they did some serious over-acting. "Aunt Fanny's" Melanie Griffith-type voice was annoying and half the time I couldn't understand what she was saying. Skip it - or watch it AFTER seeing the 1942 version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Re-making a so-called flawed masterpiece must be a very daunting task. For anyone who's seen the original 1942 version, I'd have to believe that this 2002 attempt is a mixed bag, at best. Technically, it's a pleasure to look at: the time periods are represented beautifully; the costumes and sets are perfect; and many of the memorable scenes are recreated word-for-word. But when you get down to the acting, different things begin to happen. Madeleine Stowe and James Cromwell are adequate in their roles, as is William Hootkins. Bruce Greenwood and Gretchen Mol fare much better, in my opinion, bringing real depth to their characters. I'm sorry to say that Jennifer Tilly as Aunt Fanny and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as George Minifer are so overdrawn that I had difficulty caring about them at all. George is so cold and calculating in this version that his character is almost one-dimensional, the same for Tilly's Aunt Fanny, and it hurts to state it, because I dearly love the story of the Ambersons. The '42 version, "flawed" as it supposedly is, has pure magic in it, from its unusual editing, its excellent cast, and its Wellesian pacing and dialog. I'm not so sure we needed an updated view of the Ambersons. 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, even watching the Wells' version was like watching a completely different story than the actual Tarkington novel. The novel is so full of subtlety and nuance (and narration) that I suppose it would be hard for any film to capture it. But this TV flick seems to have been bourne out of some sort of bizarre class called Freud 101. A protective son, yes, but incestuous overtones??? By the way, where is the Midwest? It may have been an affluent family, but early-20th century Indianapolis bore no resemblance to this. Misty moors? Grand hilltop vistas? It's the Midwest for crying out loud! There were wooded estates then as now, but the book is rather specific in describing very public homes that were not removed from the peering eyes of the masses. It was kind of a main point.Now, if one were to simply avoid comparison with the book, I suppose it could have worked rather nicely as a Lifetime/Harlequin movie. The settings, scenes, and costumes were all rather pleasant in an escapist way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good A&amp;E pictures movie about a wealthy 19th century American family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magnificent Ambersons is one in a long line of A&amp;E TV movies that have been done well, to very well. The cast including James Cromwell is impressive and essentially makes the movie. The acting, with the exception of Cromwell, is a bit sophomoric at times, but overall is very good.The movie's theme is a bit like a Dickensian novel with the son, and his journey through life as the focus. It story plays off of the character traits of the family members, and how they impact this well-entrenched and highly interdependent family. It follows like a Dickens story from start to finish, with the very best traits of the protagonists being shown in the end, even if not apparent at first. It also had some elements of Titanic in it, in that it showed America's Gilded Age, and some new technologies that were transforming the nation. The scenery is excellent and is accurate of the late 1800s through early 1900s.The cast is really what makes this version of The Magnificent Ambersons. The directing is good as well, and brings out the best of the story. I would give it a 4 out of 5 for TV movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of The Magnificent Ambersons certainly has a lot going for it with wonderful sets and cinematography. Color also gives I think a picture of Booth Tarkington's Indiana during the Theodore Roosevelt years. I agree with another reviewer that the celebrated version done by Orson Welles has a more Gothic look to it.Whatever Orson Welles did had to have his personal imprimatur on it and this one does not have that individual stamp of anybody in terms of the performances of the players. The story does stick pretty well to the one Welles gave us 71 years ago.Before The Magnificent Ambersons is anything else it's a Hoosier romance. Back when Indiana was in its frontier days the Ambersons were the local Cartwrights with a Ponderosa like estate. James Cromwell the current patriarch is like Ben Cartwright if you can imagine Lorne Greene aged and infirm. But instead of useful sons, the family line has watered down to Jonathan Rhys-Davies an arrogant twit of a grandson who expects to live the life of leisure and deal with 'riff-raff' as little as possible. A job, a profession, heaven forbid.Into the lives of the Ambersons comes Bruce Greenwood who has some history with Madeline Stowe, Rhys-Davies mother. So the young man develops an intense dislike for Greenwood who is a self made man who has invented his version of the horseless carriage and making good money at it.As in the Welles version the story of the one way antagonism of Rhys-Davies to Greenwood is the story. This version does not have the stamp of an auteur like Orson Welles, but I think this one has its own merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph of art over administration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find this version of TMA much better than the truncated Welles production. The cast is much stronger throughout.In 1942, only Cotten and Moorehead were really good. Holt was a total stiff, and Costello was barely part of the set furniture. In this new production, every role is played memorably by a strong performer. Of course each role is acted differently than in 1942, but even so, this one's much more memorable and detailed. The story is much livelier and compelling. Costello was especially disappointing in the original, whereas Stowe really brings Isabel to life. You can sense the tragic waste of a truly beautiful relationship that never happened because of George's selfishness and sick fixation on his mother and her mutual fixation on her son. In the 1942 version, George's tantrums are all about reputation and public scandal. In this version, we get a much deeper and more complex insight into their tragic relationship. Greenwood is no Cotten, as he would undoubtedly be the first to proclaim, but Morgan's character does not require the genius of a Cotten. If Cotten had been young enough, George's role would have been much better for him. There is no way that Tim Holt could ever hold a candle to Jon Rhys Meyers. Meyers is captivating and relentless. He keeps you guessing about his character's development to the very end of the film. Mol is also better than Baxter, but they are close. James Cromwell especially brings a whole new dimension to Amberson. Richard Bennet was another stiff piece of set furniture in 1942. Hootkins and Collins are a draw.The set design and production value are voluptuous and fantastic in this film. Ditto for costume design. But dittos for the 1942 version as well.All-in-all, I find this version much more satisfying. It boasts a much stronger lead and strong casting at every level and every station. Even the flashbacks are done well using the same actors.I especially favor this version since it fully realizes Welles' own script without truncations from meddling producers and studio moguls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film, like classic literature, provides a window into human nature, motivation, and behavior. A valuable reason to watch serious films or to read good books is to vicariously live through an extraordinarily wide latitude of human behavior which one has no opportunity to experience directly. Balanced people in relatively stable circumstances are usually capable of reasonably normal behavior. This is what a normal audience expects to see in a dramatic show. This is not a normal story. Its two sets of characters display opposite models for behavior. The tragic decline of one family and the counterbalancing rise of the other is intended to be instructive.This story deals with the tail end of the rags to riches to rags in three generations scenario. As the story begins the Ambersons have reached their peak. They possess an aristocratic status and lifestyle in the Midwestern United States at the beginning of the twentieth century. The film has a period "Upstairs, Downstairs" quality. Principal family members have acquired and cultivated aristocratic values. The family is protective and supportive of its upper class stature but has become maladaptive and has turned inward. They are firmly in denial that economics and demographics are changing, which could upset their social position. Although they see change coming, none of them have learned to recognize opportunity or how to adapt to it. Repeatedly, when they embrace change, they fail. The youngest child, the lead male character, manages, with the invincibility of youth, to multiply the attitudes and beliefs of his immediate ancestors and magnify them by three, adding several affectations of his own, which leads him to become sheltered by those who love him while behaving unbearably toward most outsiders. As the story unfolds the family becomes like the frog in the frying pan, oblivious that the heat underneath it has been slowly turned up. The world has changed but the family is blinded by what it fears. Their fortune becomes dissipated. Their static inertia is unchanged until reality, delayed, intrudes at the bitter end.Wealth, fame, and power may corrupt. Two significant but deeply flawed romances tie the plot together. Isabel Amberson Minafer is the mother of young George Amberson Minafer. Eugene Morgan who loves Isabel is the father of Lucy Morgan who loves George. Yet Isabel and George who are wrapped up in their cold, calculating aristocratic habits, don't share a common mindset with their potential mates although there is a mutual attraction. While they are judgmental and demanding, their opposites are tolerant, patient and forgiving. George is at many points visibly socially deranged and is capable of contemptible behavior and extreme rudeness even within view of his family. Lucy and her father Eugene not only are capable of absorbing the abuse and neglect delivered by their respective love interests. They, the Morgans, behave magnificently by returning poise, tact and charm in the most stressful and demanding circumstances. Lucy wants to marry George but wisely will not until he demonstrates a potential to succeed on his own. Hers is the voice of moderation and reason which he defiantly refuses to accept. This is a study in contrasts on several levels. To make the contrast complete, the Minafers and Morgans financial and social circumstances become exactly reversed. The wealthy, famous, and powerful Amberson/Minafers become destitute, forgotten, and powerless. The young, struggling and modest Morgans become successful and wealthy. But at their zenith, father and daughter share an intimate moment together. In the final scene Lucy shows signs, for the first time, not of embracing change but of retreating into the isolation which their new wealth can now provide. Will the full cycle displayed by the Ambersons be repeated by the Morgans?Abstracting the central ideas a bit, this story becomes a commentary on certain of "life's lessons". People with advantages and resources are not necessarily happier than those without, because they may develop more sophisticated ways to screw things up. American aristocracy, in contrast to earlier European aristocracy after which it has sometimes tried to model itself outwardly, is not entrenched. Wealth and incomes are fluid. In order to maintain wealth one must be prepared to adapt and change as the Ambersons/Minafers were not. There are moral examples for those with closed vs. open minds and for those who are loving vs. judgmental. Children may be strongly influenced by and model their lives via emulating the habits and attitudes of their opposite-sex parents. Too much inbreeding can destroy a family or an entire social class. Good personality or appearance does not trump bad character.Moral truths are often difficult to understand and accept. Human behavior is complex. Often there can be a long chain from cause through a variety of circumstances to ultimate effect. Learning such truths is a process of trial and error. Social experiments cannot be precisely duplicated like simple laboratory experiments. Early actions can have much later unforeseeable and unintended consequences. Observation and ultimate conclusion is only attainable by those who have lived long and experienced much. Moral truths cannot be easily explained to the young whose unchecked passions and impulses can easily lead them astray. Morality is culturally transmitted. It is not, itself, the product of legislation and statutes. Successful statutes are the product of a moral tradition and positive social institutions including the family. Laws cannot be summarily reversed with good effect.In the laboratory of literature, art and film, life's lessons can more readily be compressed, illustrated, or acted out. The film viewer can observe behaviors without having to relive painful mistakes first-hand. Those who "get it" have their principles and core values affirmed. Those who do not should dig deeper by questioning their values to see whether their discomfort is due to self-destructive habits. This story brilliantly encapsulates human experience, even though one particular film production of the story may lack perfection. The central themes of "The Magnificent Ambersons" are powerful and timeless. Who knows how many opportunities there are for it to be remade?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic novel by Tarkington. A classic (albeit incomplete) film by Welles. If these happened to fall in the lap of your average tax accountant, said accountant could easily direct a better version of "Ambersons" than the mega turd I just witnessed.Anyone who's seen this atrocity knows how bad it is. We know it was filmed in video on a cheap back lot somewhere. We know it looks less realistic than the average Lifetime issue-of-the-week movie. We know that the little letter-writing interludes where the actors face the camera don't so much resemble cinematic art as they do an Allstate commercial. And most obviously, we know that the acting is universally putrescent. The performances aren't just stagy. They're middle-school-production-of-Death-of-a-Salesman stagy. That's some pretty bad stagy, if you ask me. I pity all of the actors involved, but especially young Mr. Rhys-Myers. I know he can and has turned in a decent performance. However, I say in all solemnity that his portrayal of George made me want to find a time machine, travel back to the 2003 Oscars, join the voting committee, and convince my colleagues to bequeath the Best Actor statuette to Hayden Christensen for Star Wars: Episode II. As bad as that performance was, it far exceeds Rhys-Myers' George in every dimension. I never thought I'd live to see acting this bad.And I've seen some stinkers, dammit.All of this, we know. But the question still burning in my mind is, HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN? My only explanation is one I cribbed from Ebert, of all people, in his review of some other celluloid disaster. According to the Fat One (and I for once agree with him): Bad filmmakers can only go so low. When a bad director makes "I Spit on Your Grave Pt. IV", you know it's gonna be bad, and it's a kind of bad that you've seen a zillion times. But when a well-respected auteur makes a bad film, it somehow manages to plunge into depths of badness never before reached or even thought of. Thus, when you team a good director like Arau ("Like Water for Chocolate") with a dependably professional cast featuring Stowe, Rhys-Myers, Mol, and Cromwell for heaven's sake, it oughta be good. But they managed to create a new level of bad. So I guess the best thing you can say about this "Ambersons" is that it's unique. I certainly didn't see it coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One would think that, given the way A&amp;E was touting "The Magnificent Ambersons," the actual film might be something to sit back and take note of and maybe enjoy just a little bit. The truth is, I've had bikini waxes that were more enjoyable, if only because they didn't last for three hours, like this incessant piece of drivel.The film is marred by five lackluster performances. The unfortunate thing is, they also happen to be the ones with the most screen time. Madeleine Stowe is supposed to be the intriguing, haunted heroine Isabel Minafer, but the only thing that haunted or intrigued me was wondering how much Collagen she must inject to make her lips looks so pouty all the time.Jonathan Rhys Meyers, as Isabel's spoiled son Charlie, is over-the-top and extremely annoying, a little rich boy run amok. His performance also runs amok, to the ruin of the film. You not only want to slap his character for being such a little snot, you want to slap Rhys Meyers for acting so poorly.His obnoxious character makes you wonder why in God's name Lucy Morgan (Gretchen Mol) would even be interested in him. After all, she's the spunky daughter of a self-made man and plays hard to get with all the other boys. But that's about it. Mol gives the character little depth or spark. It's not that she's as bad as Rhys Meyers, but like all of the other performances (save the glaringly bad ones), she's just forgettable.The same could be said for Bruce Greenwood's work as Lucy's father, entrepreneur Edward Morgan. As the man who falls in love with Isabel, Greenwood certainly looks dashing. He's a handsome inventor working in the automobile business, which stick-in-the-mud Charlie thinks is just a passing fad. The forbidden love between Isabel and Edward is supposed to evoke pathos and haunt our souls, but passion never ignites, and though the actors make googoo eyes and send each other love letters, which are ridiculously read straight into the camera by the characters, they never really convince you that they are madly in love.I thought Jennifer Tilly's turn as spinster Aunt Fanny Minafer might provide a respite from the other boring performances, but all she does is further annoy you, if only because of her obnoxious squeaky voice. Aunt Fanny, played by an actress of greater ability, could have been one of the more complex of the film, as she has led a disappointing and unfulfilled life. But like the rest of the character, you find you really couldn't give a rat's about her, either.It seems that Booth Tarkington meant for the title "The Magnificent Ambersons" to be ironic. While they may have loads of money and live in opulence, the Amberson/Minafer family are by no means interesting, exciting, intelligent, or worthwhile, much like most of high society today. They fall from riches to insolvency, while the entrepreneurial class represented by Morgan gains prominence and wealth, which only emphasizes the irony of this title. It seems that Tarkington may have meant his novel to be a commentary of the constant state of flux in which societal structures often are found. But then again, that probably didn't cross the director's or the actors' minds. The film never delves deep into any of these issues.There's nothing magnificent, even mediocre, about this film. It is a waste of time, and A&amp;E is probably realizing, a waste of money as well.</fullReview>

It is about a young man named george amberson minifer and his family. his family is very rich because of his grandfathers sucsess, but george has let it go to his head. he was greatly spoiled when he was child, so he grew up to be arrogant. george meets a young girl at one of his family's partys and really likes her until he finds out that she is the daughter of eugene morgan. eugene and georges mother go back a long way from when eugene wanted to marry georges mother, isabelle. eugene still has feelings about isabelle. after george's father died, george felt that eugene was really interested in his mother, and was very jealous. george and his mother are very very close to each other and george would do anything for his mother and vis versa. this story is very exciting and emotional. it is amazing how attached george and his mother are to each other, but i feel mostly his mother's fault. she will not let him grow up and let him live a life of his own, and will do what he wants her to do instead of what she wants to do. because of george's family's power, george acts like he is some what better than others. he also refuses to let his mother go and live her own life. I find this movie very interesting because it shows three different generations living in society during the early 1900's and facing many drastic changes in the economy and in their family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how a network which produced "Longitude" would even air this horribly directed movie. I only kept watching because I believed that it had to get better. It never did. Booth Tarkington wrote a great story. Somewhere along the way a great story got mutilated. No wonder Ms. Stowe spoke up about the quality of the movie. I would have spoken up if my name was attached.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off it was a pretty good story with some good acting. Bruce Greenwood as Eugene Morgan gave this film a big lift with an inspiring portrayal of an aspiring "Henry Ford". Madeleine Stowe gave her usual fine performance along with James Cromewell solid as the family patriarch. But from here it is a downward slide. Jennifer Tilley as Aunt Fanny only is capable of an unrealistic crying in every other scene,usually for no apparent reason and Jonathon Rhys-Meyers acting is non-existent and totally non-believable. I watched this on A and E cable so I guess I got what I paid for. With a better Director and more actual acting this could have been a much better picture. I am sure that this screenplay written by Orson Welles has him turning in his grave!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faithful rendering of a magnificent novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well-acted with the only flaw being the somewhat unbelievable interest of Lucie for George in the opening scenes. His unbearable rudeness should have turned her away, yet she seemed fascinated by him in spite of his behavior. Once the film moved beyond this point it improved immensely, and faithfully told Tarkington's tragic tale. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was brilliant in a sensual performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, sadly, awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with some of the others who've commented on this movie, I was very disappointed. The production values were high. Technical work was pretty good. The directing was the worst I've ever seen in a movie of this caliber. A&amp;E wasted a lot of money on what should have been a good film.I can't really fault the actors; I'm sure they did their best with director they had to work with. But the result was painful to watch.This director appears to be a rank amateur. I think a film student could have done better. Here's an example: There's a flashback 20 years to when Isabelle (Madeline Stowe) and Eugene (Bruce Greenwood) were courting. The transitions to and from the flashback were so amateurish that we were 10 minutes into the flashback before I figured out that the timeframe had shifted! I've never seen a movie before where that was handled so badly.The movie was so bad, that at no time was I able to relax and watch without wondering what crap the director was going to dish up next. Rhys-Meyers and Jennifer Tilly were so badly directed that they were painful to watch. George (Rhys-Meyers) character was such an obnoxious, immature, a**hole, that it was not possible to imagine that anyone would take him seriously or that Lucy (Gretchen Mol) would fall in love with him. I kept expecting the people around him to slap him silly.Bruce Greenwood and Gretchen Mol struggled valiantly and were occasionally able to make something work, against all odds. Rhys-Meyers and Tilly were apparently out of their depth and without direction and they always pulled the movie back down. Madeline Stowe was lovely to watch, but she was doomed because she had to play off of Rhys-Meyers.Rhys-Meyers and Tilly may have been mis-cast.Hopefully the director, Alfonso Arau, will find another career or at least will abstain from movie-making until he goes to school and learns how it's done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How To Ruin A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director of this rubbish completely missed every single moment of drama in the magnificent Welles screenplay. It doesn't help that they cast a young man who has absolutely no acting talent to play George. This role is central to the drama of the whole piece. The casting agent who found Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, a high-school drop-out in Cork, Ireland, said "Jonathan Rees-Myers(sic), from County Cork apparently, who looks like a young Tom Cruise. Comes into the casting session with alarming certainty. Obviously gifted." Just because you look like Tom Cruise doesn't mean you can act. This kid nearly breaks his face mugging for the camera. I don't know why the other truly gifted actors in the sames scenes (James Cromwell and the wonderful Canadian Bruce Greenwood who did such a terrific job in Thirteen Days) didn't throw things at him!Between the director's ponderously slow pace and Rhys-Meyers' putrid performance, this movie is an excrutiating experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably it's a butchering of Welles and Tarkington, but still enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That this basically tragic story should have a relatively happy ending for the monstrous kid-from-hell who was the root cause of the tragedy is the major defect of the film. Was that the way Tarkington and Welles wrote it? Not having read either Tarkington's novel or Welles' original script, I can't say, but considering that opinion is fairly unanimous that the 1942 version was a butchering of Welles' script, I have my doubts. On a positive note, this film at least emphasizes the almost incestuous relationship of Isabel to her son. That important detail is touched on only very distantly in the older film. Director Arau is quite a different proposition from Orson Welles. While Orson introduced much in the way of new camera angles, Arau is very much into the "modern" approach favouring many extreme close-ups. It adds spice, but can easily be overdone. In spite of all these cavils, I did actually enjoy the film on its own terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Nice and Enjoyable TV Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film had it's strong and weak points. I feel that a different actor should have been used to play George. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' acting seemed fake at times and he wasn't that good looking. The casting people should have casted a better looking actor with more films to his credit. Over all this film was a very good drama, I really enjoyed watching it. Jeniffer Tilly did a wonderful job playing Aunt Fanny, she was an asset to this film. She portrayed Fanny very very well, made it seem like Fanny was a real person. What a great actress! The best in this film, next to William Hootkins, Bruce Greenwood (I) and Madeleine Stowe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scenes with George in it were a little too frantic for my liking. He appeared to be over-acting on numerous occasions and it was uncomfortable to watch. Overall the film had the aura of trying to cram a ten hour film into three hours. It just wasn't very satisfying. I think the acting by Rhys-Meyers (playing George) was very good when he was allowed to be more normal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificently Boorish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Face it - Orson Welle's should have stuck with "War of the World's:had I know this piece of magnificent tripe was written by the author of "Citizen Kane" (a very very bad bad bad horrid film) I would have passed.But I was duped into the "3 hour tour" -- The plot went no place -- infact the whole movie could have been condensed into about 45 minutes.If you've NOT seen the movie bow out now:"Spoiled young rich kid forbids mother to marry automobile tycoon."that's the plot. Not very original huh? And it took 3 hours to develop that theme. The acting was bad, but only because the original source material was bad.Unlike movies like "Les Meserables" which does spend a lot of time developing the character - (Victor Hugo COULD write), this movie developed plot and character at a snails pace, andthe actors, stuck with a very poorly written story, could only follow suit, with a very poorly acted story.Pass on this tripe - pass on anything written by Orson Welle'sWayno</fullReview>
