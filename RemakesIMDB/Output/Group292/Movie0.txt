		<shortDescription>Welles' slicing look at the downfall of a careless family parallels the film's treatment in 1942...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People may initially be thrown by the title MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. Some may consider it a stuffy period piece before seeing it if they know only of the novel. Don't make this mistake if you have not witnessed this cinematic milestone. The title, of course, is caustic and refers to the 19th century family sarcastically. Who else but the great Orson Welles could follow up a masterwork like CITIZEN KANE with such a cynical and important drama. The "magnificence of the Ambersons" is neither grand, nor respectable. It is tragic and doomed, epitomized by young "Georgie" (played by Tim Holt), whose main ambition in life is to be a yachtsmen. He is buried under the lore of his family name and he is headed towards his well-deserved "comeuppance".The film itself, like many of Welles' great pictures, was absolutely butchered by the studio (RKO Pictures) and destroyed the credibility of the young auteur. In many ways, the mess surrounding the film's release, the tragedy and loss of the Ambersons, and the theme of modern technology "taking over" all come together to leave all parties disappointed. Disapproving moviegoers miscalculated the message, led the studio to make the cuts behind Welles' back, and placed a lot of artists in some bad situations. (For an excellent account of this truly remarkable story behind the film, read Joseph McBride's bio "Orson Welles") 50 minutes of film were burned, however, the 88 minutes left for us to see contain some incredible, even revolutionary moments.Joseph Cotten plays his consummate "2nd place" character, a man unable to have his real true love. (See THE THIRD MAN, NIAGARA) He is in love with an "Amberson" (probably the only righteous family member played by Dolores Costello) but loses out to a more "respectable" man. The essential themes of industrialism and change that will ruin the Amberson family stem from Cotten's position as an inventor. He has created the horseless carriage, or automobile, however primitive, which is continuously trashed by the hateful "Georgie". Cotten's invention is part of the growth and change that many families of the late 19th century may have ignored, only to have their lives passed over and fortunes lost. Plot elements aside, this central theme is the powerful backbone that leads to the inevitable destruction of the narrow-minded Tim Holt.The latter aspects come across on screen so memorably because of Orson Welles' continued experimentation with film. Incredible b &amp; w photography, at first a hazy glow depicting the early prime years of the Ambersons, then a stark, dark force portraying shame and sadness, is amazing to see. Overlapping dialogue is used even better here than in KANE and Welles' narration is so omniscient and on the mark, relaying the town's thoughts on this once grand family. Long tracking shots throughout the constantly changing town go unnoticed unless seen a couple of times. When you realize the passage of time through these devices, you will be in awe.Again, there is tragedy in both the film itself and its shoddy release and treatment in 1942. If only Welles stayed in America at the time and protected THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS from the long arm of the near-sighted studio system, he may have had #'s 1 and 2 on the AFI's list of 100 Greatest American films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent is right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I'd give just about anything to see a restored version of this film, like "Touch of Evil."Its reputation is quite justified, however, and the top critics of today have generally agreed that it's one of Welles' best efforts as director. Some have even said that, scene for scene, it's a better film than "Citizen Kane."The opening montage, set to Welles' narration, is as good as anything of its kind that's been done before or after -- brilliantly, and I hate to use that word because it's so often overused, it achieves two things: 1) it sets up the dramatic side of the story, with Eugene's fawning for and losing the affections of Isabel, and 2) putting us in a specific, historical time and place. The story of George Minafer's downfall parallels the changing times of America during that time, as well as American aristocracy.Then there's Agnes Moorehead, who does the most amazing work as Fanny Minafer, George's aunt. She's a pressure cooker to begin with, but when the Ambersons hit rock-bottom she lets go, in a torrential, hysterical performance that's still getting praise today."The Magnificent Ambersons" also carries an equally dramatic story of Hollywood's assault on artistic expression; almost everyone knows that RKO seized the film and cut it to pieces while Welles was out doing his documentary "It's All True." Today there's other ways for great directors (Kubrick, Altman) to dodge the system, but film stock and equipment in those days could only be procured from big studios, and for the remainder of Welles' career his genius would only be seen fleetingly (his adaptations of Shakespeare, Kafka's "The Trial"). It's a story as tragic as George Minafer's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fate of this almost magnificent film must rank as one of the greatest tragedies in the history of the cinema. viewing it in its present state is like looking at the Venus Di Milo, or at a beautiful Greek vase that has been shattered. One can only admire the fragments...and what gorgeous fragments they are: Major Ambersons heartbreaking meditation by the fireplace,the quarrel between Eugene Morgan and Georgie about the Automobile, Isabel's death, Agnes Moorehead's magnificent performance, the splendor of the Amberson mansion, and the ballroom scene. Perhaps someday, some powerful computer might be able to reconstruct the missing footage from stills and from Welles script...perhaps. Until that almost impossible moment, one can only envy the handful of men and women who were able to see it whole, and to understand what they were seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Beautful American Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one could have a single wish regarding movie history, surely it would be the rediscovery of the nearly one hour cut out of what seem to be all existing prints of this! Even with the tampering, it is a gorgeous movie. To me, it is superior to "Citizen Kane." Wells himself was partially at fault for its being butchered: Had he stayed in the United States and not pursued a new, eventually unfulfilled dream, he surely could have fought RKO.The narration by Welles at the beginning is like the dream storytelling of any child or young person. The words so beautiful, the tones so calm and mellifluous! And the final credits, in which he reads the crew and then the cast, are astonishingly moving.In between is a touching story that is acted and filmed with rare integrity. Dolores Costello is a haunting presence. Agnes Moorhead, as the Neurotic aunt, gives a performance rarely equaled in movie history.Stanley Cortez was cinematographer for three great movies (and many other fine ones): "The Magnificent Ambersons," "Night of the Hunter," and "The Naked Kiss." Each relies strongly on its look and Cortez created three very different, memorable canvases.One fan hope against hope that the lost footage turns up in someone's basement, unlikely as that is. Even so, once seen this movie is never forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvellous portrait of a by-gone era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most reviewers have stated, Welles' film suffered at the hands of studio interference and it is to the film's credit that, despite such butchery, it still remains a marvellous piece of entertainment.The emotional story revolves around family relationships, about love denied, unrequited or made to suffer. It is also a social portrait of the failure of one family to come to terms with progress (symbolised by the motor car in the film).Tim Holt is excellent as George Minafer and I think we are meant to view him ambivalently: he is both a loveable ne'er do well as well as a spoiled egotist who puts his emotions/feelings before everyone else's. Agnes Moorehead deservedly won praise for her portrait of the plain Aunt Fanny. Her final disintegration (blackly comic when George thinks she's scalding herself at a hot boiler only to be told that there's no water due to their reduced circumstances) mirrors the descent of the Ambersons into obscurity and genteel poverty. The only memory of their faded glory is in the names they give to the new roads leading to the suburbs.As with ?Citizen Kane', wealth does not always protect people from unhappiness. And it's interesting to note how the Amberson's huge mansion, once the social centre of town with its balls &amp; serenades, becomes an empty derelict monument to a by-gone age. In a sense, the whole film is ambivalent. You can't stop progress as Eugene (Joseph Cotton) states in the dramatic scene where he &amp; George clash over motor cars, but Gene is also aware that things might not necessarily change for the better. Life will become faster etc. After George receives his comeuppance, I quite liked the symbolic irony of him falling victim to a car accident. Finally, it would be nice if production companies could have the courage of their convictions and actually left capable, intelligent directors to make films without interfering with their vision. Prod companies are still obsessed with preview viewings and initial reactions to films. Yes, sometimes a film might need altering, and most studios want a decent return on their investment but it would be good if they could keep faith even if a film receives an initially hostile reaction. Many great works of art have been initially misunderstood; and great films, like great art, stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irony in the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film, one of great pathos and sensitivity. Orson Welles was drawn to Tarkington's novel because Tarkington had been a friend of Welles' father and Welles identified strongly with the story, seeing something of his own family's history there.Whether it is better than Kane is a fun question for film clubs to debate (I did once but I don't now), but it is interesting to note that while Orson Welles was particularly bitter that RKO re-shot his ending to make it more appealing to audiences, if you read the novel you will see that it is the novel's ending that RKO tacked on. Welles' ending was of his own invention and would have given the film a completely different tone.So it is ironic that Welles always seemed to claim that RKO had destroyed the integrity of the novel's story when they only preserved it, if rather poorly in execution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A treasury of characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think Citizen Kane is wonderful, then, if you haven't already seen it, find a copy of "Ambersons" as soon as you can. To me, "Ambersons" surpasses "Kane" in complexity and perhaps richness of characters. The story of the long-term results of love deferred, unrequited love, and long-suffering love, are even more interesting with Welles' direction using overlaid dialogue and odd camera angles. My favorite part is when old Major Amberson speaks to the camera and it becomes apparent he's lost his mind. Chilling. The Ambersons captures a time more than a century ago in America when passions were suppressed and civility masked a boiling interior. This film was edited severely, I've read. This is another mystery, because the remaining footage is superb. We can only wonder what the original "Ambersons" might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvellous work, but sadly suffers from limited time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the tale of a well-known and respected American family - "The Magnificent Ambersons" and their rise and fall. The movie is not bad at all, there are some superlative performances from stars and character players alike. However, it is a sad fact that this, Orson Wells second masterpiece, suffered from the scissors in the cutting room. Being an RKO/Mercury Theatre production, executives reduced the picture from a much-required 135 minutes to a satisfactory, but a speedy 88 minutes, therefore, not giving satisfactory time for the viewer to understand the masterpiece fully.Now, for my review of the players. Joseph Cotten gives an irregular performance as the romantic lead, silent star Dolores Costello is very much underused, as is then very young Anne Baxter, who would could onto bigger stardom in the next decade. Stealing the acting honors throughout the production are Tim Holt with his superb portrayal of the spoiled brat heir-to-the-throne, so to speak and Agnes Moorehead as his Auntie, who put their plan into action to sabotage a relationship between the widowed Isbabelle Amberson and charmer Eugene Morgan.Overall, lives up to it's expectations of success, but suffers due to limited screen time and a very confusing plot for audiences of our generation.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Cast, Characters, Setting, &amp; Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an excellent cast, interesting characters and setting, and a thought-provoking story, dramatic cinema does not get much better than "The Magnificent Ambersons". No one will ever know what it would have been like if Orson Welles' original version had been allowed to stand as it was, but what is left is still extremely good despite the missing portions.The story of the leading residents in a turn-of-the-century town combines some interesting themes. The snobbishness of the Ambersons, and its effects on their lives and others' lives, is illustrated alongside the ways that increasing industrialization is changing everyone's lives. The period setting is also quite interesting in its own right, and very nicely done. The characters are all convincing and well-defined, and are matched nicely with fine performers who bring them to life convincingly. Welles regulars Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead are especially good.The only real disappointment in the movie is that, due to all the cuts made against Welles' wishes, there are times when it is obvious that a scene or information is missing, since characters at times refer to events that are not quite familiar to the audience. It is fortunate that the acting and writing are good enough to help us fill in the blanks to some degree, but it is really too bad that we can never see the whole picture.As it stands, this is a fine film filled with good scenes and memorable characters, and a movie that will be much appreciated by fans of classic cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magnificent Orson Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One wonders what movie would have resulted if Orson Welles would have been able to get his own cut, as opposed to what RKO Radio decided to show to the world. In spite of what one sees on the screen, even a chopped up film by the studio and directed by Orson Welles is better than no Orson Welles, at all!Booth Tarkington wrote a novel that reflected America's entrance in the industrial age. Mr. Tarkington being a good friend of Mr. Welles' father, must have been an early influence in young Orson. We can see that in a way, both men were interested in the changes America went through in the XIX century."The Magnificent Ambersons" presents the saga of a prominent family in their spiral downfall. At the same time, Eugene Morgan, a revolutionary inventor is laughed at because of the contraption that will change the face of the country: the automobile. While the Ambersons lose their fortune, Eugene Morgan makes his own. In the end, it is sad to see how Morgan with all his money couldn't have Isabel, the love of his life, or his daughter, for that matter, couldn't make the snobbish Georgie care enough for her.What Orson Welles can't be fault on is the impeccable performances he got out of most of the Mercury Group. Joseph Cotten, as always, projects an elegant figure as Eugene. The gorgeous Dolores Costello is seen in all her beauty. The young Anne Baxter was perfect as Lucy. Ray Collins and Richard Bennett also do an outstanding job, as well as young Tim Holt. The best of all is Agnes Moorehead, who makes Fanny a creation. Ms. Moorehead is in fact a luminous presence in all her scenes in the movie.Robert Wise, who went to become a film director, is credited with the original editing, although two others were not credited, who could have been instrumental in what RKO did to the picture, Mark Robson and Jack Moss. The original costumes by Edward Stevenson are incredible.One could only hope that somewhere, hidden in a vault, a director's copy will be found as Orson Welles directed it and then, hopefully, we shall see the marvelous movie Orson Welles intended to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent (Lost) Masterpiece. (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best films ever made. Or at least, it could have been. This drama adapted by Welles, from Booth Tarkington's novel about a troubled family at the turn of the 20th century, contains great characters, set-decoration and cinematography. By watching it I'm both stunned and sad at the same time thinking about what this movie could have been, if it hadn't been taken out of Welles' hands. Re-cutting and re-shooting this film is probably the greatest mistake a studio has ever done. The remaining pieces ( 88min. out of approx 145min.) still has a great punch to them. Welles' clever camera-setups and powerful direction, matches his previous film, Kane, in every way. The conflict within the family are explored by great dialog and acting by it's cast. Don't miss this one. ps. sorry, my English is not that good......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fractured Magnificence; one of the great tragedies of cinema (not the film per say, but its history)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost common knowledge in the realm of the film world about the history of the Magnificent Ambersons, which leaves a minor problem when trying to criticize it. Orson Welles made the film's final running length at around two hours and fifteen minutes. While he was out of the country filming 'It's All True!' (another doomed film in the Welles cannon), RKO pictures, the studio that had granted Welles total freedom for Citizen Kane and a few future projects, cut out fifty minutes (mostly of the last fifty), put a happy ending, and released it on a double-bill with a B movie. Although it's attributable in retrospect to the War starting up (after all, who wants a -downer- period piece) and to the difficulty the studio had with Welles' reputation, the fact that the 90 minute version that now exists is the only version available is a tragedy in and of itself. Unless if someone follows the wild rumor that a print was dumped by the studios into the ocean and pulls it up, this is all we can get.Still, incomplete Welles is more satisfying than no Welles, or most other studio product of the period. Welles takes Booth Tarkington's novel (inspired in part by Welles himself as a child- George being Welles' name) and makes it into a sumptuous, striking, and altogether unique drama of the changing of the times, and how people cope with changes or go with them. The story is one of those involving the minds and hearts of the upper class. Joseph Cotten (as usual charming &amp;/or cool, dramatic) is Eugene, the man who wanted Isabel Amberson's hand in marriage. She married another man, and their child George was early on a hard-head case (these scenes are some of the best of the film, with deliberate staging of close-ups, medium shots, and basically setting up the technical style of the Wellesian cinema). As he grows up, he's still a little hard-headed (played in one of the top, intense performances in any Welles film by Tim Holt), as he is against the changing of the times, in particular of Eugene's re-founded courtship of the mother following his father's death. There is also the character of his Aunt Fanny, in another perfect performance from Agnes Moorhead (the mother from Citizen Kane).Alongside this examination of a family's downfall amid the changing of personal relations, and of George's own complex emotional problems, and of George's coming-of-age, there's also the examination of the transition from the horse and buggy to automobiles, to the heavier boost of the industrial age. Welles as a narrator is somber, observant of it all, and mostly leaves the film to his actors. There's some real thought put into the issues, and not just through the realistic (though of course theatrical) dialog, but more specifically through the style. 'Kane' introduced audiences to Welles knack at long-takes, deep focus, unusual and expressionistic close-ups, heightening the drama that unfolds. 'Ambersons' is no exception, and there are some very memorable scenes where the camera just stays on people, and then when it moves it makes the mis en scene more concentrated, direct. The use of light is also equally impressive at times- like in interior shots of a staircase when George and Fanny are in an argument, it's all encompassing, and not distracting enough from the story. The best consistency of any Welles film, even when it has some flaws, is the control that can be seen through much of it (there's also a very spooky shot that stays with me towards the end, as the camera pans across the town's buildings, Welles' mournful narration over it).But then we come to the ending, where things come to a screeching halt. I'm not against happy endings, they can be almost mandatory in certain formulas in films. However, it sort of takes an excellent film dealing with strong, novelistic issues to a bad place when things are resolved in the way this film does- George gets in an accident, he loses the use of his legs. But then a scene comes (and one can tell the immediate change in the style from Welles to the studio's) where loose ends get made, and without anything leaving curious for the viewer. I'm still not sure if anything else within the film was cut-out too, or if even I might have been fooled at another time by something not of Welles in the picture. It's depressing to be sure, but at least there is enough left to analyze and contemplate in the Welles' oeuvre- in some ways it goes more ambitious than 'Kane', at least in its period realm, the questions it raises. The lessons the history behind the scenes gives for future filmmakers and studios should be remembered, even as mediocrity (like RKO tried its best to make this film as) continues today in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Space Jazz, Mind Dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this part of his career, Welles was interested in a few things. Thankfully we don't need the completed project to at least see what they were. And the understanding of them is probably more important than experiencing a coherent survey, as this was.He's interested in surrounding a narrative, in giving it to us from all sides. He does this in narrative styles. In "Kane" he had narrators inside and outside the story, newsreels, newspapers, mysterious unfoldings, anticipated long events, and anticipated short ones.He does it in the eye as well, having the camera surround and probe. And he plays these two off of each other, creating one sort of rhythm in the eye, another in the shifts of narrative, yet more in the physical movements on screen and finally in the emotional tides. Each of these is innovative, but together they become metacharacters in a sort of cinematic jazz. Oddly, the metaphor doesn't include the score itself for Welles, the one thing that has become a common skill today.Now if we had the whole project, we'd get all the variations and pace in his jazz composition. As it is now, all we get are phrases, some broken a bit. Just settle on one that you suppose hasn't been tampered with, say the sleigh/car encounter in the snow and revel in that for a few viewings, one after the other. It is absolutely amazing what interplay these elements have. And in this case we really do have some music: the players singing.I suggest you play it again and again until you get it. Believe me, it will change your life when you can see this mind dance.I would rather have the pieces because they have such a perfect logic and dance, you can imagine the rest. It baffles me that some people think Welles just innovated in camera angles and lighting. No, he created a whole higher level of drama.Van Gogh painted a starry sky. It is, in effect two paintings in one. We have the beauty of the sky. And we have the beauty of the dabs and strokes of paint on the canvas, a sort of metapainting. The two dance around each other in a way that is magical. Welles did the same here and in "Kane." Afterward, he busted other walls.Oh, and within the story, he uses automobiles as a metaphor to muse on the effect of this new metadrama compared to his home in the simpler theater. He wonders if we will be better off once what he does catches on.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ambersons Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is where Welles came apart and is mirrored in the actual lopsided film itself. I remarked in my first viewing that the film attains a unique eerie quality exactly because so much of it is missing. Heresy! More on that in a little while.This was an important time for Welles. The debacle is well documented elsewhere, but a few words for my benefit. He was in Brazil when it happened, doing It's All True and women. For the past few months, Welles had been juggling three projects at once. Filming Ambersons by day, indirectly shaping Journey to Fear by night, originally intended for him to direct, and preparing to embark on the Brazilian adventure for the government at the behest of Rockefeller. A composite print including music was finalized on the run, in the Miami studio where Popeye cartoons were made. The voice-over was recorded overnight by Welles exhausted from a Washington trip. A few days later, he was on a boat to Rio.So it was all or nothing. It was nothing. A butchered Ambersons was dumped in a few LA theaters and forgotten. Journey was similarly botched. It's All True was abandoned. He was effectively fired from his job. Hollywood would have nothing to do with him, still bitter over the Kane contract and the man's ambitions. It was revelling time as the privileged youth was getting his comeuppance.Now the film was conceived on the scope and innovation of Kane, but that version - 132m - is already myth. A print of that version, probably the Miami print, was sent down to Welles in Rio for revisions. Did Gonzaga, of Rio's Cineda company where Welles was working on It's All True, destroy that print as per the imperative of RKO's New York office? There is at least one report from Cineda that the cans of film were still in existence by the mid-50's.For the foreseeable future, we have this. A curious thing happens here that I believe opened portals for narrative. That wasn't going to take off until fresh eyes saw reruns of the film in the 1960's TV. Welles himself wasn't going to see the film again until that time.At the time, it was bleakly received. Too bleak for wartime. A few flaws persist to this day; Tim Holt is an onedimensional whine, Aunt Fanny's scenes are hysterical, the reshot finale is atrocious.A handful of people perhaps recognized what it was all about; it was Kane with a big qualitative difference. It was also about childhood loss but more somber, less precocious. It was every bit as autobiographical as Kane, but this Kane never tried to shape the world to his image. It was about time and beautiful things vanishing, thought to be beautiful when they were young. It was about dual worlds at crossroads.The famous story goes, that Welles was in Bogdanovich's LA home one night when the film came up on TV, it must have been the early 70's, so when Welles was puzzling about a modern narrative in film. We've yet to see his response, which I presume is tucked inside The Other Side (until then, we have F For Fake). That film was about an aging filmmaker reminiscing about a life in movies, that much we know. So the film comes up and this aging filmmaker immediately flicked the channel. His company insisted they sit down and watch the film. Welles left the room in a huff, but a little while later came back and quietly sat down and they did watch. According to Bogdanovich, Oja Koddar nodded to him that Orson was crying.It was not the brutal treatment of the film at the hands of philistines, relates Henry Jaglom from a later chat with Welles, that just made him mad. The tears were for bygone times.The film was, at the heart of it, a grown man's lament about a world that came apart before he could hold onto any part of it, a world that Welles intimately knew and cherished from his own childhood and probably correctly assumed was written by Tarkington around him and his mother. It's about a story that collapses around the protagonist. Now it's safe to presume that Welles' version would have fleshed everything a bit more, sketched transitions a little clearer. Fractured memory but with a clear design, like he had done in Kane. Enter RKO. In most eyes, the last third that is the most clearly botched part of the film is hideous. I see a more peculiar effect at work; instead of the collapse given to us in ordinary terms, with a dramatic weave, the actual film is falling apart before our eyes. It's shattering left and right. The solid floor of the story is suddenly concave. Anchors that made the world coherent are pulled out and in rapid succession. This is the most clear in just two scenes, Major Ambersons monologue before the fireplace and cut to the mother's death as a single hallucinatory flow of the camera.It feels choppy as you watch it, because it was not intended and you can clearly tell parts are missing. But the notion has tremendous power.It involves narrative structure on the backend of us splicing it together. The film empties of images as the man does. We know there is more to it - finer shades - but just can't know, can't remember a thing beyond impressions, beyond snippets of memory.Welles, at the time, was a dramatist blessed with a keen visual eye, putting cinematic 2 and 2 together using story-space. This is something altogether different. It's subtraction from reasonable causality that we assume works in life but most of the time doesn't, so that mostly space remains floating with the essence of broken bits.</fullReview>

First of all, I'd like to point out that the quote mentions "quicksilver," which of course is Mercury. The Mercury Players are the stars of this film and "Citizen Kane" --- coincidence?There are at least 2 books that deal with the relative merits of film adaptations of novels -- which is better, the novel or the film? Both of these books that I read seem to think that the film of "Magnificent Ambersons" is better than Tarkington's novel. I read the novel -- it is not written in a wordy old-fashioned style typical of novels of its day (1918) -- it's a "good read" by today's standards -- even a "great read" -- I'd say that the novel and the film are co-equals in terms of artistic excellence. Factory soot and general air pollution is a prominent theme in the novel, as in 2 other novels by Booth Tarkington (he collected the 3 novels together in one volume under the collective title "Growth"). Tarkington was also concerned about what we today call urban sprawl.In both the film and novel, the name of Georgie's horse is mentioned several times -- "Pendennis" -- the title character of a 1850 novel by William Makepeace Thackery (who also wrote "Vanity Fair") -- "Pendennis" is a novel about snobbery (and surely Georgie is also a snob). For what it's worth, in my opinion, Tim Holt's portrayal of Georgie is just fine. And isn't it ironic that Tim Holt, son of cowboy actor Jack Holt, returned to the family business of B-Westerns (along with his sister Jennifer) after he turned in good performances in 2 of the greatest films ever made (his other major role was in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" -- he also had a minor role in "Stagecoach")?Read the novel if you want a full explanation of how the Amberson family lost its fortune. Also, the film mentions that Aunt Fanny lost her money by investing in a "headlight company" -- the novel makes clear that this company is NOT connected with Eugene's automobile company. Finally, as another reviewer pointed out, the non-Wellesian tacked-on studio ending for the film, though abrupt, is fairly faithful to the novel. I, too, wish I could see the 53 or 55 or 58 minutes of Welles's footage discarded by the studio, but I am not prepared to heap abuse or ridicule on the studio ending.When A&amp;E cable network commissioned a remake of Welles's film, it's too bad the expanded 150-minute running time was not better used to clarify the plot. The same thing happened when TV produced a miniseries remake of "The Long Hot Summer," loosely based on Faulkner's Snopes Trilogy (especially, the first novel, "The Hamlet") -- instead of restoring some of what's in the novels, the TV writers were asked to confine themselves to expanding the original screenplay. Another lost opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles' second attempt at making a feature is probably known more for its having been butchered and drastically altered in Welles' absence than it is for the actual quality and content of what remains. Welles himself said that, had it survived intact, The Magnificent Ambersons would have been better even than his acknowledged masterpiece, Citizen Kane. We'll probably never really know, but looking at what we have been left, he may have been right.Like Citizen Kane, Magnificent Ambersons mixes drama with an informative, historical, almost documentary style. Once again he contrasts the quick cuts and to-the-point imagery of a documentary with the long takes appropriate to drama. This approach is ideal for this kind of story of individuals within the context of historical fact, and although the content is totally different, it's not unlike the way in which Martin Scorsese would construct films like Raging Bull and Goodfellas decades later.The opening sequence of Magnificent Ambersons, in which Welles narrates the changing fashions of the 1870s and Eugene's courtship of Isabelle, is this film's equivalent of the "News on The March" sequence from Citizen Kane. Here however many of the similarities with the earlier film end. Ambersons is overall a much more relaxed piece compared to Kane. Welles relies less on rather obvious cinematic techniques, and more on subtleties of staging, shot composition and lighting. He really handles the mood and tone brilliantly here, with a fuzzy, rose-tinted view of the past, and an encroaching feel of disturbing darkness as his characters' worlds begin to fall apart. Of course, he was doing something similar in Citizen Kane, but here it's much more polished and effective.Although Welles himself does not appear in Ambersons (although he does a narrative voice-over), the acting is on the whole a notch above Citizen Kane. Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead in particular really get to shine here, giving standout performances they never quite achieved in Kane, where everyone else was dwarfed by Welles' gargantuan performance. Welles as a director here also shows off his actors' abilities with the way he focuses on them in some incredibly long takes, letting the drama unfold naturally.However for all the excellence of its individual elements, I have to judge Magnificent Ambersons on what it is as a whole today. The fact there is an hour of missing footage is painfully obvious. The drama lacks depth due to the overall story being pared down to its barest bones. You can tell an effective thriller or horror in an 85 minute film, but you can't do the same with an epic. Ambersons clearly has the same qualities of epic dramas like Gone with the Wind or Giant, but truncated as it is we get neither the sympathy for the characters or a real sense of the passage of time that we need. At least it's possible to ignore the travesty that is the studio-approved happy ending, but the same is not true of the glaring gaps in the story arc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Wreck a Masterwork - Hollywood Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the destruction of Orson Welles' second "Mercury" film THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is pretty well described in these remarks on this thread. Although it is extremely doubtful (as doubtful as ever finding traces of the missing holy grail) I too wish that a longer version that was similar to Welles' vision did turn up. But if it did, I wonder if we would end up siding with the powers that be at RKO or with Welles.About three or four years back a television version of THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS was made on cable television, which contained far more of the novel than the deconstructed Welles' film currently does. The critics were not too happy with it. They found it too long, and they seemed to stress the need for cutting it to a shorter length. My guess is that Welles would have had to cut the film too, though not as much as only 88 or so minutes. KANE had been 119 minutes long (only one scene - in a brothel - was cut). That was a pretty long film for 1941. My guess is that a 120 odd minute AMBERSONS would have been too long too.But of course, Welles would have been in a position to judge what cuts would not destroy the film, and what cuts would. He did not like the cuts that reduced the Ambersons ball sequence (a seemingly meaningless passage about olives). Was that really such an important passage? More important is how the role of Wilbur Minafer was reduced, as were passages concerning poor investment recommendations to Wilbur, Fanny, and Jack were cut (one would have thought they were important).Was it done as part of a plan to make the movie salvageable, or to destroy Welles' bank-ability in Hollywood? One suspects the latter. KANE made a small profit, but was no blockbuster. The powers that be in Hollywood saw Welles as a threat to their system of control, as his style of contract made him both director and producer. It was not just the attack on Hearst in the first film, but a general assault on the studio system that brought the Hollywood honchos down on Welles' head.It is interesting to note the degree of defensiveness that has crept up in the years since Welles' death in 1985 regarding the fate of his various projects in Hollywood. Robert Wise, who edited AMBERSONS, came out with a statement that he did not think the present film was so terrible, as it is considered a classic. Wise was assigned to finish the film with new scenes he and others directed, and to cut the Welles' material. It was in Wise's interest to deflect any negative views about the butchering of the film for the sake of his own reputation (and it is interesting that in the years after he made that comment, Wise was given an Oscar for his life's contributions to movies - he gave some good ones, but he helped to destroy one great one).I think that if AMBERSONS had been a comedy Welles would not have had the same problem. Instead, it was a bitter tragedy, for Welles did not end the film version he shot with George being united to Lucy with Eugene's blessing. Lucy rejected the impoverished, crippled George at the end of Welles' version, and Eugene visited Fanny in a boarding house where she was reduced to being a cook. Hardly optimistic fare in World War II America, and all the studios wanted optimism then. Another reason to change the film to the idiotic conclusion we have today. Interestingly the recent television remake follows the novel - Lucy unites with the unrepentant, still arrogant George, while Eugene has to accept this. Even that would not have been acceptable to the studios in 1942.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Loose Quicksilver In A Nest Of Cracks"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a Mid Western town at the turn of the century, an ostentatious family lives in an ostentatious house and arrogantly considers itself superior to all the other folks. Isabelle Amberson is the doyenne of the family, and is courted by Eugene Morgan, a bright young engineer. Isabelle rejects Eugene because of an imagined slight, and marries the worthy if unspectacular Wilbur Minafer. This sets in train a tragedy of unrequited love as Eugene continues over the years to yearn for Isabelle, while Isabelle's plain sister Fanny carries a secret flame for Eugene. Isabelle's imperious son George grows up and, thwarted in his own love for Lucy Morgan, develops an intense antipathy towards Eugene, the ever-present guest at the Ambersons' dinner table.Welles' affection for the Booth Tarkington novel which inspired this masterpiece is easy to understand. It is set in the snowbound countryside of the northern Mid West, the very place where Welles was born and raised, and the Ambersons are just the kind of upper middle class family from which Welles sprang. More than this, George Minafer IS Welles. Spoiled and deferred to as a child, George grows up knowing no bounds to his whimsy. The monster that he becomes is oddly attractive, partly because of his utter self-belief. Welles himself was such a man. He must surely have contemplated casting himself as George: Tim Holt, who actually appears in the role, resembles Welles uncannily, with his pudgy good looks and resonant baritone speaking voice. Welles had an inordinate fondness for strawberry shortcake, and so does George.The sombre, brooding atmosphere of the film is reinforced by its symbolic scheme. It is a film of departures and sunderings, with characters forever disappearing on long vacations, dying or merely vanishing behind closing doors, as when Fanny scurries away, devastated by the courtship joke.As with "Citizen Kane" in the previous year, the film's stylistic approach is to show groups of interlocutors as ensembles, without the camera moving in on the individual speaker. Some of the faces remain in shadow or are otherwise obscured. The viewer works out from the context whose words he is hearing. In "Kane", the device helped to show the many-faceted nature of a human life. Here, it underscores the centrality of the family. Each of the Ambersons is subordinate to the family itself, and the family is the continuum, the amber in which these characters are trapped. Another of the "Kane" themes is developed here - that wealth and status cannot protect anyone against unhappiness. Welles' fascination with mirror images, indulged here in the brief bathroom scene, was to emerge again in "The Lady From Shanghai".George Minafer and his "grand, gloomy and peculiar way" is at the heart of this film. He clashes unpleasantly with Eugene for two important reasons - George, the classic 'mommy's boy', sees Isabelle's lover as a rival, and Eugene is despicable because he is 'in trade' - and therefore far too vulgar a man to be lounging around the Amberson drawing-room. George's excuse for the confrontation is his ostensible desire to protect his mother from scandal, but this convinces nobody. In the climactic scene where George refuses Eugene admission to the house, we see George first through etched glass, emphasising his emotional aloofness, and his essentially defensive posture. Mrs. Johnson addresses George as "Mr. Amberson", then corrects herself and gives him his actual title, "Mr. Minafer". The error is significant, because George is the archetypal Amberson - sneering, haughty and strangely dissatisfied with life. In the scene where George and Lucy sever their connection, George protests indignantly that the emotional stress is going to make him faint. He doesn't collapse, but Lucy does. This is typical of George - he is quick to make his own selfish position clear, but does not in fact share the emotional vulnerability of the rest of humanity. His arrogance seals him off. Lucy's discourse on indian names throws up 'Ven Do Nah', the legendary hero whose name means 'Rides Down Everything'. It is, of course, a veiled allusion to George. Perhaps 'They Couldn't Help It' is a reference to the decline of the Ambersons.After the death of Wilbur, and a seemly period of mourning, Eugene tries again to court Isabelle. In this saga of lost love, Eugene's suffering is the most acute. When he writes to Isabelle after the rift with George, he pleads with her most touchingly not to "strike my life down twice". Eugene's forbearance and dignity are ever-present. Joseph Cotten plays him as a man who endures his misery with stoicism. His speech at the dinner table on the dubious benefits of the automobile is powerful, generous - and a classic Welles creation.It is Lucy's fate to repeat her father's tragedy, growing old in the absence of love. Ann Baxter is charming as Lucy, and the ageing process is convincingly depicted. Her forced levity in the scene where George breaks with her is very moving.Welles' record is unique: two years, two films, two masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trust Fund Baby Gets His Comeuppance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his second feature film directorial effort Orson Welles assembled a lot of his Citizen Kane alumni, Joseph Cotten, Erskine Sanford, Ray Collins, and Agnes Moorehead, for this screen adaption of the Booth Tarkington novel The Magnificent Ambersons. He didn't bring Gregg Toland along to film the thing, but Stanley Cortez definitely learned how from Gregg as to what Welles wanted. The Amberson mansion sure looks like a lost relation to stately Xanadu and the same deep focus photography is present. And those fill the screen closeups and telling shadows, still there and used to great effect.Richard Bennett is the head of Amberson clan and he's got a lovely daughter in Dolores Costello. Joseph Cotten is the hardworking young man who desires her hand as do many. But he tries a bit too hard and she coquettishly rejects him and marries good and dull Donald Dillway. The have a son who she spoils rotten in the person of Tim Holt.Tim Holt as George Amberson Minafer would today be called a trust fund baby. The thought of work or some kind of profession is alien to him and he has an intense dislike for Cotten as much as he'd like the daughter he has from the marriage he made after Dolores rejected him. My favorite scene in the film is Holt with Cotten's daughter, Anne Baxter, in a carriage where Holt is telling her about his disdain for any profession let alone any manual labor. But while being a person of leisure as one in Holt's class is born to be, he'll use his money in various charitable enterprises to benefit the less fortunate. Sounds like a budding Michael Moore.Holt got great reviews for this part proving here as he did in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre that he was capable of being more than a B film cowboy. But that's where he returned to and probably of his own choice. Also about that time war service interrupted his career as well.Joseph Cotten belongs to that vanished race of gentleman players that used to grace the screen. They don't write parts for people like him, William Powell, Don Ameche, Ronald Colman, etc. But being a part of these two immortal Orson Welles creations assures him a place in cinema history forever.The saga of the Amberson family covers a slice of American social history from the Gilded Age to the Progressive Era. Besides the editing that Welles claimed butchered his film, The Magnificent Ambersons failed to find an audience in 1942. America's entry into World War II was on most people's minds then. A story about a bygone era just didn't sell. Citizen Kane which also had a bygone era story was also about a guy still very much on the scene. All the controversy about William Randolph Hearst sold a lot of tickets for Citizen Kane. The Magnificent Ambersons certainly didn't have that kind of a built in publicity gimmick.Even with the cuts that Welles objected to the film still has great merit, a fine group of players telling a good story. Tim Holt got his comeuppance, but not quite the way he expected. Then again so did just about everyone in the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles's flawed and troubled film The Magnificent Ambersons is in some ways just as great as Citizen Kane. Filled with wonderful set pieces, the front door opening into the ball and Agnes Moorehead on that great staircase screaming at Tim Holt are just two that come to mind immediately. Surprisingly the film was nominated for a best picture Oscar, even in its butched state, and Moorehead received a well deserved supporting actress nomination losing out to Teresa Wright's stilted boring performance in Mrs. Miniver. Amberson's is also noteworthy for its great art direction, the beautiful cinematography of Stanley Cortez &amp; the lovely performance of Dolores Costello. This is a film that holds up on repeated viewings, and one can only wish that the cut footage is lying in some vault waiting to be discovered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been a film that ranked right below Citizen Kane; or maybe, even above it. It is an outstanding period piece of life at the turn of the century.The Ambersons represent society that existed before the industrial age and those who hung on to face ruin, and those who joined the revolution brought about by the automobile and prospered. George (Tim Holt) rejected modernization and kept his mother (Dolores Costello) from the man she loved (Joseph Cotten), who invented automobiles.This film is a beautiful example of Welles work, especially how lighting changes as the movie progresses. I said it could have been his best work, but the studio cut 50 minutes from the film and the result is a little jerky. Welles was not around to fix it and, while the film is still great, it could have been fantastic.Watch it to see a great man's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many way this is a more brillant film than Kane. Kane was technically advanced, but somewhat distant. This is a much more intimate story. The romance between Eugene and Isabele is one of the most wonderful tales of unrequinted love ever put on film. I especially love the opening sequence which introduces us to the life -styles and habits of the Ambersons. I like the way Wells dwells on their array of evening wear, summer wear etc... He creates a great sense of calmness in a timeless era.Agnes Moorehead is incredible in the role of Fanny. She has to scream for attension every time, like her character in the film. Tim Holt is great as a young Orson Wells (who was still young at the time). This spoilt brat was I'm sure very similar to Wells, or so he'd have us believe.Obivously we all know what happened to the final cut. It was, and probably still is the greatest crime in cinema history. Its like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa. At the end of this version when Eugene and Fanny are walking off into the sunset, and Eugene looks down at Fanny and says that he was "true to his own dear love" (meaning Fanny), its so absurd. Its the worst tacked-on ending I've ever seen. Eugene was never in love with Fanny, it was always Isabele, but Fanny loved Eugene. Hollywood made a joke of it. The Amberson family had finally got their comeuppance only for hollywood to decide it was too grim, and put on an ending that looked like ot came from another movie.Initally it was such a piece of genius from Wells to film a story about the downfall of a family rather than their or rise to power, to tell the story in reverse.Its so sad that we can never see the real version. I really feel that we are missing out on what could have been the greatest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Magnificent Ambersons"(1942) is a magnificent film even with its 88 min running time that was left after RKO took advantage of the director/writer/narrator Orson Welles absence by editing down the film from its original 131 minutes. Why or why did they have to cut it so mercilessly? The film still remains a brilliant and ironic portrait of a declining aristocratic 19th century family but the final part feels like a lot's been taken from there. At least, the unique end credits when Welles introduces the cast and all members of the crew were left alone. Still, it is an awesome film with every scene arranged and shot like a rare painting. The one which is imprinted in my mind is the scene when Eugene is leaving Isabelle's (the love of his life) house forever and Isabel's arrogant son George (who will finally get his come-uppance) is watching him through the window in his mother's room. I am also impressed by Welles's narration - he had a very nice voice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen the appeal of Citizen Kane. I can understand why the critics keep picking it as the Greatest Movie of All Time, because technically it is way advanced in its years, but the film itself is dull and very boring. Which is why I went to watch The Magnificent Ambersons with a tentative approach. But I was pleasantly surprised.This is a far more interesting movie than Kane. A story that is both moving and funny. I loved the opening sequence with the look at the change of fashion (and using Joseph Cotton as the model works wonders). But it captured the mood of a time when the automobile was an unknown quantity, as well as a story of family and personal jealousy.The cast is excellent, especially Tim Holt as George, a character who is so nasty, he makes the current screen evils look like teddy bears. The scene when he turns Joseph Cotton away from seeing his mother was magnificently played.Technically it's as interesting as Kane, but Orson Welles holds back, doesn't need to be so flashy, but instead, lets the story do the work, and it works. The title sums up the movie. Magnificent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With The Magnificent Ambersons Welles's completes the greatest one-two punch in cinema history, the only other contender being The Godfather's I and II. At first, the film can be seen as a fairly straight-forward rendering of unrequited love and the dissipation of an American family. However, the story and execution is so dense the viewer has to see the film numerous times to catch all the subtlety, innuendo and profoundity that exists in this Greek tragedy come-to-America. Each scene propels the story forward at a volcanic pace while beguiling the senses with complex, often overlapping dialog and images that at times seem to have been created by such masters of photography as Lartigue and Steichen. At once reverential to the elegant beauty of the past while dooming those who live in it, Amberson's creates in the viewer a nostalgia for a time no living person has experienced yet the motivations of the characters apply to life today, tomorrow and always, as long as lust, vanity, greed and selfishness exist in the human condition. My personal nomination for the villain of the work would be Isabelle Anderson whose concern for propriety and willingness to indulge her son even at the expense of her own happiness dooms her to death and the family to destruction. The road to Hell is indeed paved with good intentions. Like the Venus de Milo or Da Vinci's Last Supper this masterpiece not only is awe-inspiring in it's present state but benefits from "what might have been". Such discussion is useless and unnecessary. Amberson's stands as a towering achievement in all it's elegant and fractured beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magnificent Ambersons is Orson Welles' follow up to Citizen Kane. The film deals with the rise and fall of a well to do Midwestern family at the turn of the century. Welles captures a forgotten time in America. He shows us the customs from seranades to grand balls. Men were destined to be gentlemen and women were courted in manners that suited the town. But, as Joseph Cotton brings in his horseless carriage towards the first half hour, we can see that Welles is signalling the end of the 19th century, and the beginning of the 20th. Young George Minifer is a brash, arrogant youth whom the townspeople would like to see get his "comeuppance." As he grows into adulthood, his manners have not changed. He rooted in the customs of the past, and as the years progress, things get harder and harder for George. In the end, everything that his family had is gone. The wealth and prosperity all go to people who work for their dream, not just live off a name. The final shot of George in the darkness and Welles' narration gives the film a great ending. Everyone who wanted to see George's "comeuppance" has either forgotten about him, or is dead and buried. In the end, George is left alone in the world. The film also showcases Welles' usual flair for cinema. The Amberson mansion is the highlight of the film and it captures a grandness not seen in many houses. The camera work rivals Citizen Kane and the actors are from the RKO Theater. On the downside, RKO destroyed this film. It could've been on par with Citizen Kane, but because of bad screenings, the film was re-shot, and re-edited against Welles' wishes. As a result, the film was reduced in length to 88 minutes and the footage was destroyed. The film feels like there should be something more to it. Scenes don't get a chance to play themselves out, and at the studio's request, a happy ending is tacked onto the end. A shame. The Magnificent Ambersons could've been a great classic, but it will be the classic that could've been. Still, it's a great film to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably Welles' best film, though the ending mars the tonal effect considerably. Read a reconstruction such as James Naremore's in his book, THE MAGIC OF ORSON WELLES -- you'll get an idea of Welles' vision. (Not only was the ending reshot by another director, but occasional scenes throughout the film, too.) One can only hope that someday, somehow, the original footage will be found, though my understanding is that it was destroyed. Too bad.The narration is wonderful, and Agnes Moorehead deserved an Oscar. She is astonishing; one can see the cracks in her poise, until the inevitable breakdown occurs in the boiler scene. It is simply one of the best performances in motion pictures, and as convincing as Doris Day's breakdown in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH; so real it frightens me and certainly frightened the studio heads, who requested that a toned-down version be shot.Tim Holt, I think, isn't very good. In some scenes, he manages well enough, but I don't share the enthusiasm for his performance which most reviewers do.Beautiful direction and photography. Welles is one of the true geniuses -- up there with Ben Franklin, in my book. I hope he knew Christ, because I'd love to see him in heaven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"George Amberson Minafer had got his comeuppance. He got it three times filled, and running over."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before he had even produced a feature-length film (having only two amateur shorts to his name, 'The Hearts of Age' and 'Too Much Johnson,' in addition to a hugely-successful radio programme), Orson Welles bargained a two-film contract with RKO Pictures. The first film to be made under this agreement, 'Citizen Kane,' was a controversial cinematic masterpiece, and is often held as the greatest of all time. The second film was 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' which was reportedly butchered by the studio (something that would become a saddeningly frequent occurrence in Welles' career) and was received poorly by both critics and audiences. Though the director's original vision has long been lost, with time, critics have discovered a streak of genius shining through 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' and the film's stature continues to grow.Orson Welles wrote the screenplay himself, based on Booth Tarkington's 1918 Pullitzer Prize-winning novel, which traces the descent of a respected American family into poverty and obscurity. The film was seemingly quite a personal project for Welles, and his decision to produce a period-piece could perhaps be described as a bit unusual. The role of George Amberson-Minafer ? the arrogant, conceited young man from a proud and wealthy family ? seems positively perfect for Welles' smug boyish charisma, but, for this film, he appears only as the narrator, casting B-movie Western actor Tim Holt in the aforementioned role (this was one of only two "serious" acting performances from Holt, who also starred in John Huston's magnificent 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948),' opposite Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart). Regular Welles-collaborator Joseph Cotten is excellent as Eugene Morgan, an admirable but unpredictable entrepreneur who has never really recovered from being rejected in love by George's mother, Isabel (Dolores Costello). Meanwhile, the selfish and rude George falls in love with Eugene's daughter, Lucy (Anne Baxter).There is much to be admired about 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' but I don't think it worked quite fully as a film, perhaps due in no small part to the intervention of the studio. We'll start off with the many excellent things about the production. Stanley Cortez cinematography is absolutely phenomenal, perhaps even improving upon the achievements of 'Citizen Kane.' Of particular note is the lively party sequence during the opening half of the film, employing the use of smooth, deeply-focused tracking shots, gliding gracefully among the dancing party members and catching snippets of conversation from several groups of people. The film has a dark, very bleak outlook on life, making excellent use of lighting and shadows to set the depressing mood. Tim Holt portrays the blundering stupidity and arrogance of his character exceedingly well, his unflinching stance on numerous issues ? most notably in the worth of the "horseless carriage," the automobile, and in the lingering romance between his mother and Eugene ? ultimately contribute to the downfall of his family and its legacy.I've never particularly been a fan of period-pieces, and so perhaps this is why the narrative of 'The Magnificent Amberson,' despite being a great technical achievement, failed to entirely draw me into its world. The greatest evil, however, is the extremely disjointed structure of the film's second half, as well as an absolutely unforgivable, overly-optimistic, tacked-on ending. After Welles' original 148-minute cut (as well as a later 131 minute preview) performed poorly with test audiences, editor Robert Wise removed about one-third of the original footage (Welles himself was absent and unreachable somewhere in Brazil) and a few new scenes ? including that ending ? were filmed, directed by Wise and Fred Fleck. If I could have re-edited the film myself, I would have concluded 'The Magnificent Ambersons' with what is now the penultimate scene, as George Minafer sits beside his bed and stares helplessly downwards, the somber voice of the director informing us that "George Amberson-Minafer had got his comeuppance. He got it three times filled, and running over. But those who had so longed for it were not there to see it, and they never knew it. Those who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him." It would have been among the bleakest and most brilliant endings in film history; however, I've heard that Welles' original version didn't end with this scene, either. Is this the masterpiece that got away, or is it a masterpiece, anyway? You decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welles' Flawed Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This great film could well have been Welles' masterpiece if not for the cuts applied to it and the plastered-on ending. However, it is still probably Welles' second-best film (running closely with Touch Of Evil)and one of the great films of the 1940's.It is a fluid, beautifully shot, written (adapated from Booth Tarkington's famous novel)and acted piece. Welles once again shows his creativity with the camera here, showing a different method of storytelling. Welles' camera is not the static one of the early 30's, but a powerful, moving object that effortlessly sweeps across ballrooms, taking in snatches of dialogues that orchestrate the plot.Welles was obviously attracted to films with enigmatic male characters- George Amberson Minifer, like Charles Fister Kane, is a mystery. Minifer is slowly torn apart by delusions, and the trappings of wealth and society (indeed, the trappings of simply being an Amberson)- much the same way that Kane is ruined by great wealth and position.Welles uses his Mercury Theatre actors to great effect here. Cotten is perfect in his role, yet Agnes Moorehead gives the performance of the picture as pitiful Aunt Fanny. She is terrific in a scene that requires her to have an emotional breakdown. There has been conjecture over Holt's performance as Minifer (he is rather stiff and wooden in the role), yet that could be due more to the nature of his character, not the actor himself.Welles' use of symbolism to recount the downfall of the Ambersons through the spoiled, selfish George is sublime. The Ambersons are reduced by 20th century modernity and their own mistakes, and George duly receives his comeuppance when forced to take a boarding house. This breakdown of family is symbolized by the coming of the motor vehicle and the doing away of old families and traditions- note the clever inter-cutting between George's attempts to transport himself and Lucy (Anne Baxter) in a horse-drawn carriage and Cotten's method of transport in a 'horseless carriage'. George must grudgingly assist Cotten's Eugene after his own carriage falls in the snow.Welles' use of the montage to open the film (as he does with Kane) is effortless and flawless. It introduces the social concerns of the film, as well as the romantic concerns involving Cotten's Eugene and Dolores Costello.This is also a rather delicate tale of lost love- Minifer's own selfishness and snobbery and determination to keep the family reputation intact drives his mother to the grave. There are many poignant scenes in this film- Dolores Costello's death-bed lament about Cotten 'I would have liked to have seen him once more'; Baxter's cheerful face as George leaves her, then her face falls as she retreats sadly to the drugstore. This is a piece with powerful emotional resonance as well as cinematic technique- in this aspect, it outdoes Kane.The ending is rather trite (though I'm told it is the novel's ending), with Minifer, forced to work, breaking his legs, and Baxter returning to him, with all past tragedy forgiven. Yet it is still a stunning work despite the last eight minutes, and truly deserves it's place along the film great's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Citizen Kane" may be the most enjoyable 'high brow' movie ever made and I can't think of another film quite like it that moves at such a clip, but isn't there something just faintly facile about the way it reduces it's characters to stereotypes. Great fun it may be but it never goes very deep into the psychology of it's characters including Kane himself, despite the greatness of Welles' performance."The Magnificent Ambersons" may have been butchered by the studio and may have had the most unsatisfactory ending tagged on to it of any great film but what remains dazzles on an entirely different level from "Kane". Working from superb source material, (Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize winning novel), Welles is able to imbue his film with an almost overwhelming sense of loss and regret. Seldom has a film about a past that is slipping inexorably away captured so perfectly that feeling of an uncertain future. The world of the Ambersons may be coming to a close but there is regret, too, in Welles' vision of a changing cinematic landscape. It's as if the vistas opened up by "Kane" are not to be trusted. "The Magnificent Ambersons" is as much a lament for the cinema that is passing as it is a study of a decaying Midwestern family.And magnificent it is, from the elegant sweeping camera-work of Stanley Cortez to the pitch perfect performances of the Mercury Theatre Company to Welles' own off-screen narration, (he doesn't appear). Of course, it is impossible to say had Welles been given complete control over the finished product if this would have replaced "Citizen Kane" in all those best film polls, but even in it's butchered, deflated form it remains the better film, a monument to what the cinema can do in advancing our understanding of the human condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Orson thought of the butchering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the following disturbing. Its a passage from the very necessary "This is Orson Welles" book by Orson's friend, director Peter Bogdanovich:"...in a Beverly Hills hotel suite (in the late '60's), Orson was flipping the TV dial as usual when he happened on an early scene from Ambersons. Almost before it was visible, he quickly switched channels, but I noticed it and asked him to leave it on. He loudly refused, but everyone in the room started badgering him to let us see the film--one of the people had never seen it--and finally, exasperated, he turned back to the channel and stalked out of the room."Now we all felt terrible, and called to him to come back; he yelled in jokingly that he was going into the 'soundproof room.' We watched for a while, and pretty soon Orson appeared in the doorway, leaning against the door, looking at the TV unhappily. We all pretended not to notice and went on watching the picture. A few minutes went by. Orson casually made his way across the room and sat on the very edge of a sofa, and looked at the TV intently, but with a kind of desperation combined with a terrible anxiety."The film went on, and Orson loudly announced the loss of certain truncated scenes. Several minutes later, he stood up and, turning his back to us, went to the window and began fiddling with the venetian blinds. The rest of us exchanged looks. We'd all noticed there were tears in his eyes."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>waiting for George's comeuppance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ambersons are the wealthiest family in Indianapolis. Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) and Isabel Amberson are in love but she marries the dull Wilbur Minafer instead. Their only child George grows up a spoiled arrogant brat. Everybody in town is looking forward to his comeuppance. George falls for Lucy Morgan who is the daughter of Eugene Morgan. Eugene is in the new automobile business which George ridicules and belittles at every chance. George ridicules everybody and their professions while having an aimless outlook himself. After Wilbur's death, Isabel and Eugene rekindle their romance and enrages the petty temper of little George. While the Morgans gain greater and greater success through their automobile, the fortunes of the Ambersons decline.George is such an annoying petty character that it's hard to base the movie around him. He's really the villain in Eugene and Isabel's lives. Orson Welles is a magnificent filmmaker and everything looks terrific. It's just hard to care about this character. Like the rest of the town, I'm just waiting for his comeuppance and I don't like that feeling. I'd rather have his redemption where he learns generosity. At least, he gets to responsibility but that part is short and the movie rushes to its ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In those days, they had time for everything..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fot the longest time I've been conflicted in my attitude toward "Citizen Kane", regarded by many as Orson Welles' and America's finest film. It just didn't grab me that way. Earlier today, "The Magnificent Ambersons" managed to affect me in a way that "Citizen Kane" hasn't done after three viewings; I thought this was a masterful story told brilliantly, and that's without knowing ahead of time how the studio (RKO) butchered the original product.A particular scene that got me, cinematically speaking, was when George (Tim Holt) and Lucy (Anne Baxter) rode past Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) in their horse drawn sleigh while other Amberson family members struggle to push Morgan's car through the snow. The beauty of that snow-scape seemed absolutely surreal and wonderful. Regarding Welles' use of lighting and camera angles, the scenes of George and Aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead) arguing up and down the staircase of their mansion was also incredibly effective. Perhaps I'm just noticing these things better now, but they seem to surpass the camera work of Welles' earlier triumph.Storywise, there's no arguing that Welles packs a lot of emotion into his decades spanning history of the Ambersons. Early on it felt as if the story was rushed to get to George's adulthood, but once there we learn that he never outgrew the tantrums of his youth. For Tim Holt to convey such an arrogant character was significant for me, as most of my viewing of Holt's work has been in rather perfunctory B Westerns. So his range as an actor, even if one sided here, was a worthy discovery for me.As regards my own age, I was rather drawn to the impact of Eugene Morgan's letter to Isabel (Dolores Costello) regarding her son George. I've had it personally confirmed repeatedly that '40 can't tell 20', and to see that concept on display in the latter half of the movie was quite impactful. It's probably the main reason that history is doomed to repeat itself with successive generations, even though we have the experience and teaching of many wise men who have gone before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very sad that RKO butchered what could have been the greatest movie ever made with their idiocy. Orson Welles had planned an epic telling of Boothe Tarkington's novel but due to the decision to test the film in front of screwball-film loving knuckleheads, RKO butchered the film and discarded the edited footage to its death. I wish we could have all seen the product that Welles wanted. What we do get is 88 minutes of sheer human drama in glorious black-and-white.In a day when films spend ridiculous amounts of money to satisfy the brain-dead masses who want every movie to be a roller coaster ride for the senses, it brings tears to my eyes to see human drama like The Magnificent Ambersons. The story of a conceited, haughty family who refuse to change with the times and seeing people hoping for young George Minafer to get what he "deserves" is a joy to see unfold. You, too, will hope that this arrogant and backwards-thinking mama's boy played brilliantly by Tim Holt will get it where the sun doesn't shine.The entire cast is excellent and you can see every line of dialog, every set and every situation was nailed perfectly. There's no lollygagging here. The players and Welles took the entire project seriously.What remains is still a true classic and even if 70 years later we wonder "What if?", we can be thankful "What we have." is available for us to see. We sadly wish Orson had finished more films; he was a true master of the moving picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A proud family loses its wealth and its control of the neighbourhood, and its youngest son gets his come-uppance.The Magnificent Ambersons was director Orson Welles's second film, following Citizen Kane (1941). It's a fascinating period drama told in brilliant cinematic snippets; owing to studio interference, the last reels are weak, but the whole is a treat for connoisseurs, and a delight in its fast-moving control of cinematic narrative. The film was included in Sight and Sound's 1972 list of the top ten greatest films ever made, and again in 1982's list. In 1991, The Magnificent Ambersons was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</fullReview>

The depth of the characters, the excellence of just about each and every scene, just the overall unsurpassable class of the entire effort shocks the viewer into realizing what grand possibilities could be achieved on screen. The only possible flaw in this masterpiece is what RKO did to it, but its (the movie's) superiority (acting, writing, direction, cinematography, the narration, the power of the story, and every other element) easily overcomes even the lopping off and apparent destruction of big and never to be known chunks of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did They Really Think That 50 Minutes of a Movie Can Be Considered Extraneous?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles's sophomore effort tells the story of an aristocratic family. I think that the studio's ruthless butchering took a terrible toll on it. Robert Osborne said in his introduction to the film's broadcast on TCM that it couldn't be much better than it is. This is not true. It whisks by so fast that you feel you've missed out on the movie, which is disappointing because it's so good, which you know because you just saw for yourself! What did the studio think cutting nearly an hour of a movie does? Did they really think that an hour of a movie can be considered extraneous? The Magnificent Ambersons succeeds in being an exciting trailer of a great movie that we probably will not ever see.However it thankfully remains that Agnes Moorehead is very very powerful, especially in a later scene, and Tim Holt is incredibly becoming as a man we cannot stand. From what I could tell, it I a well-shot film too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT better than Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing more that I can say about this film than has already been said. It was a very good film for its time. But there is a reason I think it never caught on like many other classic films of the time: it is a lavish though dated production that is more lamented among film fans for its lost footage than it is for its cinematic greatness.For those who have always wanted to know what was lost, the best source is The Magnificent Ambersons - A Reconstruction by James Carringer. It's an OOP book that contains the cutting continuity of Welles' original cut. It shows what was cut and where it was cut.I have to say that the cuts aren't all bad. Of course the cuts from the ball hurt, the cut ending was more pessimistic but still better than the release version. But then there are little lines cut here and there that actually don't hurt the film. And frankly there are one or two whole scenes that were cut and actually help the film. But then I have other problems with the film. Agnes Moorehead should have been cast as Isabel as Fanny is an annoying character that isn't sympathetic. Delores Costello is wooden and her character shows no affection for Eugene. Tim Holt does an excellent job but how can you sympathize with his character at the end when he was such a total jerk up till that point. Overall, the film comes off to me as a grand soap opera.And also don't believe that the studio blindsided Welles and destroyed this film without authority. In order to get it made, his contract was renegotiated and one of the things he gave up was final cut. Therefore, the studio could do anything they wanted.I know many Welles fans consider this a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, I think he was a master and I'd do anything to see all of his films released as they should have be. But I think he made a mistake choosing this film as his follow-up to Kane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Masterpiece that might have been....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well...what a difference a website and a few pictures can make! The original title for my review was going to be: "Much Ado about Nothing", but coming to this site and reading Austendw's response and going to the Ambersons.com, that he mentioned, has changed my mind. Go to "Lost Images from Ambersons" and you will see for the first time, some powerful stills from the lost segments.Based on this, plus Richard Carringer's book "The Magnificent Ambersons-a Reconstruction", and what survives of the film, I think that maybe, just maybe, this could have been one of the greatest films of all time!But so many "ifs" persist, however: 1. If only the Japanese hadn't attacked Pearl Harbor. 2. If only Wells had stayed to successfully complete the picture. 3. If only the studio had waited, instead of panicking and chopping it to pieces (what they did amounts to a "bucket brigade on a sinking ship"). 4. If only Wells and the studio hadn't severed relations and he been able to come back later. And then there are other questions that linger as well:1. Was this story really the best choice immediately after Citizen Kane? 2. Was Tim Holt the best choice as George, or should Wells have played the part? 3. Was Well's interpretation too dark, Gothic, gloomy, and heavy handed? 4. Was Well's camera technique unnecessarily expensive, cumbersome, and overdone? (Many, many shots are "from low to high" necessitating an elaborate ceiling for every single interior set. In fact, Wells seemed to prefer this angle almost exclusively for some reason. A silly one was Wilber Minafer's funeral, where the camera appears to be in the coffin, and moving!) 5. Did this just happen to be the wrong fare for the new wartime audiences?We will probably never know the true answers to all those questions. What we have now is the remaining pieces to a mystery that will remain unsolved forever...RIP Orson...Update (10-14-05): After carefully reviewing all the facts, I have come to the conclusion that this film suffered from "artistic overkill"; but it was a group effort, not just Well's fault. The entire Mercury cast &amp; crew simply went "overboard" in the telling of this quaint and simple Victorian story, and instead treated like it was the grandest tragedy of all time. Blame it on their inexperience with the medium. They had been lucky with their first film "Citizen Kane". That film had plenty of artistic excesses, but the subject matter was more compelling, and held the audience interest throughout; this time they were not so lucky. Apparently, what seemed to them so wonderfully dramatic in front of the camera, simply did not translate to the viewer on the screen; again, because it is a different medium from that of stage or radio productions.I know that there are lot of fans of Wells &amp; this film, and it's hard for them to admit fault. It's easier to blame RKO, the audience, or other circumstances; but the truth is that Orson, cast, &amp; crew simply got "carried away". There is plenty of evidence for this, mainly from Richard Carringer's book: "The Magnificent Amberson - a Reconstruction". The previews were terrible, the management staff at RKO agreed that the film was too downbeat &amp; somber (they can't all be wrong, that's their business), and even Bernard Herrmann's score (wonderfully recreated by Preamble Records in 1990, I have a copy), reveals a different Herrmann: dark, downbeat, excessively dramatic, &amp; "too somber" (the exact words RKO general manager George Schafer used to describe it). Also, the thing that strikes me the most is the odd ending that Wells "tacked on". The simple ending that Tarkington gave us was perfect; why "mess with it"? It confirms my impression that Wells interpretation was a darker, somber view (and too much so, perhaps). He simply didn't believe in happy endings, and the audience "paid the price"!Now whether the original version would hold up today, I guess we will never know. One only has to move ahead to 1944 and "Jane Eyre" to see the difference (with some of the same participants: Orson, Agnes Moorehead, &amp; Bernard Herrmann), when a director (Robert Stevenson) &amp; crew (20th Century-Fox) knew how to strike a balance between art &amp; entertainment.Want further evidence...? Move ahead to Well's later efforts "The Stranger" (1946), "The Lady from Shanghai"(1948), and especially "Touch of Evil" (1958) All were gimmicky, arty, dark and overly melodramatic (and commercial failures!). That was Well's style, he couldn't change. He admitted in his later years, that it was a mistake for him to go into movie-making, he should have remained with stage productions (and maybe TV, by implication). RIP Mr.Wells...!Best regards,Steve</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a lifelong fan of the great Orson Welles, I have seen this picture four times and it took four plays just to warm up to it. Even now, I have a hard time reconciling it in my mind when people call it a masterpiece, which it is, in some places. Out of respect for the big guy, I'd like to think the biggest problem is the studio's final cut (approximately 45 minutes is slashed from Welles' original cut, that footage since lost). Some of the crucial bits in the movie seem to be glossed over lightly or hardly at all: the death of Dolores Costello's character, how the family lost their wealth and their great mansion (which I assumed was paid for), so when was it sold? Agnes Moorehead's character makes a passing reference to a "headlight company" that she invested in and lost all her money; somehow I sense there was more to that than meets the eye.  Some scenes, however, are truly brilliant: Welles' lingering shot of the old major's face while Tim Holt babbles on in the background about details concerning the estate; the opening sequence at the ball is well done, the "sleigh ride" in the horseless carriage; the funeral scene with the great proud shot of Agnes Moorehead defiantly in the foreground, the "comeuppance" scene, a broken Tim Holt kneeling by the bed while Welles as narrator confirms his fate; Holt turning away Joseph Cotten at the door. So many great scenes, yet it still doesn't totally work because of what's been lost. Maybe if I watch it ten more times, I'll come around finally. Definitely worth watching. 2**1/2 out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good film, but certainly NOT as great as some of the hype would indicate. One IMDb reviewer went so far as to say it was "better than Kane (CITIZEN KANE)"! In fact, over the years a sort of "mystical" adoration of this film has arisen that is completely ridiculous and way out of proportion. In fact, Orson Welles HIMSELF said that the film we all know as THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS was terribly edited and he disowned his film--so WHY all the hype?! Let's first review the history of the film. The ORIGINAL Orson Welles version of the film no longer exists--or at least no one has found it. When the original and significantly longer version of the film was previewed, the audiences found it depressing and too long--and possibly this was due to WWII just starting and people wanted a happy an uplifting film. So, when Welles wasn't looking, RKO reedited the film severely and gave it an upbeat ending!! So, if the film is only a bastardized version of the original, it just doesn't make sense to declare it a masterpiece as so many have done. In fact, when I watched it for the third time, I noticed many places where the film seemed to skip about and MANY times there was narration instead of action--as if they'd delete major scenes and then just describe what you missed in a few sentences! This is NOT great film making! So what do we have left? Well, the acting is exceptional throughout and there is often the trademark excellent Orson Welles black and white shadowy cinematography. The total package is pleasant enough, but way too sketchy and disjoint. Good, but certainly NOT great. If only someone would find the original film hiding somewhere in a vault!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Magnificent Ambersons delivers on so many levels. This is a deep, complicated film about life, the passage of time, the vanity of wealth, and humanity in general. Where Citizen Kane was a carnival, The Magnificent Ambersons is a grand ball. It is one of the most sophisticated things I have ever seen - yet retains enormous raw power despite its delicate nature.The only real problem with The Magnificent Ambersons is its place in history. Hidden under the gargantuan shadow of its predecessor Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons is hardly a drop in the bucket. And buried beneath the weight of its own legendary debauchery myth, it cannot seem to stand on its own legs. However, in my opinion, The Magnificent Ambersons as it stands is every bit as good as Citizen Kane. The real mystery about The Magnificent Ambersons is where it belongs when not evaluated in light of Welle's artistic oeuvre.One could say that The Magnificent Ambersons is a more mature film than Citizen Kane. I believe they would be right. And to think that Orson Welles is merely 26 at the time of its making. Truly remarkable...I end this review with a thought: If Renoirs "Rules of the Game," Welles' "Citizen Kane" and "The Magnificent Ambersons," Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey," and Hitchcock's "Vertigo" were given a pure reading which one would be considered 'the greatest' on pure artistic merit?

From the first frame to the last, this is the some the best entertainment Hollywood ever delivered. It is a story about where we (collectively) come from. It is a story about unrequited love. It is a story about what happens when the future meets the past. It is a story about what happens when we spoil our children instead of raising them. And, best of all, it puts in context the expression "whippersnapper" -- which I grew up listening to, but could never place. I explained in other reviews that Welles came from radio, it was his first love, and so did Cotten. The two did amazing work together. (One of the secrets of a Welles film was that you could watch it with the picture off and sound only, and it would STILL tell the story). Wow. What a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One longs for what Welles cut would've looked like, but still a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magnificent Ambersons was Orson Welles' second feature after Citizen Kane. An adaptation of the Booth Tarkington novel of the same name, the picture concerns George Minafer, the spoiled heir of the aristocratic Amberson family, and the loss of his fortune which coincides with the rise of the automobile age. Though the RKO cut which survives leaves much to be desired (the studio excised and re-shot a significant portion of the film), Ambersons remains a very good picture and a glimpse into the cinematic genius of Orson Welles.The film centres around George Amberson Minafer (Tim Holt), the spoiled heir to the Amberson legacy. When the wealthy auto-industrialist Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) attempts to rekindle an affair with George's widowed mother Isabel (Dolores Costello), George does everything in his power to thwart it. He ends up being successful, preventing Eugene from seeing Isabel on her death bed, but also inherits next to nothing. Finally forced to kick reality, George gets a factory job and injures himself - his story parallelling the fall of old money and rise of industry at the turn of the century.The only criticism to be levelled at The Magnificent Ambersons is the editing job done by RKO, you sense that the original cut was an uncompromising work of art and that the surviving version, while still quite good, is by comparison inferior. That being said, the picture is exquisite in all other departments - Bernard Hermann's score, the sublime dolly movements during the ballroom scene, Agnes Moorehead's electrifying performance as Aunt Fanny, there's a lot to like about the movie. All these formal elements are in the service of a poignant story too, one about the larger social changes of an era and about a man who clings to his childish behaviour and gets hit hard by life as a result.In summary, watching Ambersons is like looking at a damaged great painting, you're simultaneously in awe of its brilliance and frustrated by the prospect of what was or could've been. Still, for film buffs and fans of Welles, it is a must-see. Even in its tampered state, it manages to be at the highest tier of quality in all areas and say something that moves us, which is the mark of any great movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Official Story has it that Orson Welles saw, in Tarkington's novel, his own story. The 'completed' film, such as it was, and the mess that led up to it, really IS Welles' own story - though not in any way he could've foreseen, or relished the irony of afterwards. The simplified version of events has philistine Hollywood &amp; RKO cutting the genius Welles' legs out from under him on the AMBERSONS film, while he was off in Brazil shooting IT'S ALL TRUE. The actual chain of events is a lot more complicated than that, and has as much to do with the star-crossed history of RKO as with the movie colony's dislike of Orson Welles, enfant terrible. Put bluntly, the saga of Welles-in-Hollywood could not have ended any other way, given that his deal was with RKO - the most ineptly run studio in Hollywood, beset with warring factions and Borgia-like intrigues among its braintrust. For Pete's sake, at one point the head of production was JOE BREEN! The miracle is that Orson Welles managed to finish one picture on his own terms, and parts of two others. All that said, I hope anyone who hasn't yet seen AMBERSONS will make plans to do so. The first 70 minutes or so IS Welles' picture, and as beautifully thought-out and detailed a film as he ever made. There's a burnished glow to the production that heightens the viewer's emotional connection to the events onscreen - the script, performances, photography and art direction are flawless. Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead and Tim Holt were never better than they are here. Those last 20 minutes, unfortunately, are hackwork - a porridge of flat and flavorless new scenes spliced into mutilated existing Welles-shot footage, julienne-sliced at the studio's behest by then-film editor Robert Wise (who remained on Welles' s**t-list for the rest of his life because of it). Enough greatness remains - even in this compromised botch - to captivate and carry an audience back to turn-of-the-century Indianapolis. But you should feel a slight sting at every mention in the narration of George Minafer's long-awaited 'comeuppance', since it was Welles himself who took the full brunt of that comeuppance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The death of an old, white-shoe, white-picket-fence America and the birth of the world we live in; the war between youthful obstinacy and wisened acceptance; the feeling of time emptily passed and love passed by--Welles' mutilated masterpiece touches upon them all. The least gimmicky and emotionally the richest of Welles' work, AMBERSONS has a flaw that would remain, I suspect, even if Welles' additional footage had survived: the performance of Tim Holt as Georgie Amberson. It often feels uncertain whether Welles wants us to accept him as a lovable, immature ne'er-do-well, or despise him as a selfish prig. Perhaps a more complete shape would clarify the character; what remains ranks close to LOLA MONTES, THE LEOPARD and ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA in elegiac force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Orson Welles film was supposedly hacked to death with cuts but still has the Welles stamp on this still watchable but somewhat dated story. I like the deep focus and close-up shots that are also a part of Welles' classic Citizen Kane. The idea that inherited wealth breeds apathy and smugness is not new and George Amberson Minafer is a perfect example of a young man gone bad far too soon. In the role of George is Tim Holt who has wealth, good looks and status but is essentially a lad who resists change and lacks ambition. While this character does ring true, I found the one dimensional performance hollow and unconvincing. George does get his "comeuppance" but it seems like a morality lesson. Joseph Cotten is a reliable and strong presence on the screen and in his role as the suitor to George's mother, he plays a gentlemanly yet strong character, a more than worthy opponent to the spoiled boy who wants his mother to submit to his will. Cotten is a self-made man who champions the automobile, an invention that George cannot abide. Cotten's daughter is a youthful Anne Baxter, who has no difficulty spurning George's overtures of affection. Her role is limited but well performed. The best performance is delivered by Agnes Moorehead as George's sister, who displays much greater range than the other actors. All in all, not a bad movie but not a particularly interesting movie. Perhaps an audience in the the early 1940's would react more positively to the lesson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this several times without being as engaged as I expected, but this last viewing was different. I think I finally got it. The execution, by Orson Welles and his comrades in arts, is superb but the story itself almost buries its implications for modern society under one of those multi-dimensional generational narratives, like "The Young Philadelphians" or even "Peyton Place." Young George Amberson Minafer (Tim Holt) grows up from a spoiled brat in a rich Indianapolis family to become a spoiled brat in a family that's on its way downhill, while the older Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten), whom Georgie hates, and Morgan's daughter Lucy (Ann Baxter), whom Georgie loves, turn into a wealthy automobile manufacturing family. Georgie gives up what little he has left in order to support his Aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead) and, in the end, everybody comes to appreciate Georgie for his self-sacrifice. Not that it appears to help Georgie very much, since by now he's broke and in the hospital with two fractured legs, having been run over by one of the automobiles he loathes.This was Welles' follow-up to the magnificent "Citizen Kane." It was shot in 1941. And it would be nice to say that it's up to the standards of the first movie but it's not. There's a good deal of shouting, running around, and dancing, but it's rather a slow slog through the years. The theme that would most impress modern viewers is similar to that of "How Green Was My Valley," the virtual destruction of intimate, small-town life, by the spread of an ugly industry. That's my impression anyway. I'm old enough to remember standing on the streets of a city -- Phoenix, Arizona -- and being able to look down a thoroughfare and see the desert at both ends. Old enough to remember New Jersey before its last inch of greensward was paved over. Yes, it's true. I don't like smog and urban sprawl. Oh, where did it all go? (Sob.) Well, not to be too depressing, some people seem to love look-alike shopping malls. A chaque a son gout. Welles' film doesn't spend enough time on what I consider a pretty powerful theme. It's most hinted at. In the opening scenes, Welles' jovial narration tells us how much time everyone had and how simple life's more mechanical aspects seemed. Later, we notice telephone poles have grown alongside the city's roads. And towards the end the narration tells us explicitly what the screen shows us -- an ugly city, befouling itself. I should add that there's something else that got by me on previous viewings. Without setting it up in flashing neon, Welles deals with the same problem here that he did in "Citizen Kane", namely the loss of youthful and innocent determination or, to put it more broadly, aging itself. It seems a very personal issue for him. Even in his first, clumsy, amateurish short movie, Death is omnipresent. Now that I'm ancient myself, it may be easier to grasp his obsession with the problem of age, impotence, and death. Sartre once suggested that anyone reaching the age of twenty-five should blow his own brains out. That strikes me as a little excessive. Better sublimation than suicide.Not that there's anything wrong with the performances or with Welles' directorial technique or with Bernard Hermann's score or Stanley Cortez's photography. The camera work is artful in fact. Cortez shot several lengthy scenes following the actors around with a sixty-pound camera strapped to his chest.I'm not sure that the faults of the film belong to Orson Welles alone. The shooting was interrupted by Pearl Harbor and Welles was sent off to Latin America to make sure the good folk South of the Border didn't make any critical mistakes in choosing their allegiances. So some of the remaining scenes were directed by committee. And Welles wasn't available to supervise the editing. He tried doing it long distance, sending Robert Wise six-page telegrams full of instructions that were, to Wise, "incomprehensible." A final shot was filmed that would have evoked the last warehouse inventory of "Citizen Kane," a long survey of the empty Amberson mansion with its furniture shrouded in sheets, but the studio cut it out. Who knows what else wound up on the floor? There isn't enough room to examine the film -- its virtues and its flaws -- as thoroughly as it should be, so let's summarize by saying it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Orson Welles Vs. The Evil Studios of RKO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to say whether The Magnificent Ambersons could have been better had it not been tampered it. The notorious story of conflict between Welles and RKO over this film is very complicated, and one cannot help but wonder in seeing this film. Because as it stands, although it remains a good film, there are some elements that just don't match.To begin with, the ending. It feels entirely unnatural and out of place. This film does not deserve a happy ending, just like Citizen Kane did not deserve one. It's part of the game. In Orson Welles interest, as in Stanley Kubrick's, the main character is almost always the true anti-hero, the one we are not supposed to side with. But all along, we do anyways, because we always hope that something within him will make him change. And yet in The Magnificent Ambersons, unlike Citizen Kane, we know right from the start that Eugene is a terrible person. He's a spoiled child, a liar and a delinquent, who thinks he owns the town because of the second name he carries. In fact, his family doesn't like him either. Then why do we like him? Perhaps we know that he is not half as important as he thinks, because he knows nothing of his family's business, and keeps supporting his theses, possibly biased, that the automobile is a nuisance. He is a loser, one that will certainly not go anywhere, because he doesn't want a career. He is possibly destined to end up badly.What lacks in this story probably ended up in the cutting room floor. The pace of the film is very quickened, and some emotional bits seem to be missing. One important element, is the way we never really see the the loving relationship between George and his mother. This, however, isn't all bad, because the only time we see them alone together is in a brief scene when they decide to leave the town and travel the world. This is a decision that troubles Isabel greatly, but she will part from her lover for his son's sake. The effect this has on the movie is positive, because this is the real chance George has of showing us that he is not evil, and yet, he doesn't take it.The bad situation that the Ambersons are left with is something that should have been studied deeper. And there is no explaining why the film wouldn't end with the image of George praying on his bedside, finally realizing that all the bad he has done has come back to haunt him. That would have been a much better, if much harder, finale. That, is not Welles fault, whether you blame him for the outcome of the film or not. It was the studio that decided, after a few test viewings, that the film's ending left most of the audience dissatisfied, although the same audience was the one that had laughed at lesser and more entertaining movies that didn't go well with an arty movie as The Magnificent Ambersons.The technical side is flawless as usual. In the mansion, Welles is the real Magnificent Amberson, moving the camera about it is a truly spectacular way. When we first enter the mansion in the dance in George's honor in the beginning of the film, we are greeted as guests, and we enter through the door, with a tracking shot that lets us admire the house bit by bit. Of course, Welles' famous deep focus technique adds to the magnificence of the sets, that are enriched. The visuals are truly overwhelming, and the photography is something innovative. The scenes set on the staircase alone are enough to show all of Welles' supremacy on the technical side.As far as the acting is concerned, that is one of the weak points of the film. Although Tim Holt acts in the way Welles did in Citizen Kane as Charles Foster Kane, he has his weak moments, that Welles himself could have turned in better. It is, in fact surprising that Welles would decide not to play the part himself. The similarities between the two characters are great, they even share a common joke about fatness, when Fanny tells George that he'll get fat, and George says that he can't help it because she is such a good cook (in Citizen Kane, Charles Kane is asked rhetorically if he's still eating, and he replies "Well, I'm still hungry"). Anne Baxter turns in a good performance as his love affair, and the camera really loves her. She looks most gracious in the scene where George tells her that he will be gone forever, and she acts like she doesn't care. You just want to jump in the screen and squeeze her tight, because you know it's a cover up, and in fact, just as George turns, she breaks down. It is in fact one of the most interesting aspects of the movie, the relationship between the two of them. You ultimately do wonder how she can love such a spoiled child in his mid-twenties. You wonder how can a man as arrogant as him make her happy. Perhaps she loves him because she knows he is a good man, just like we hope that he is.As is stands today, The Magnificent Ambersons is mostly acknowledged because of all the problems and rumors that concerned the production. This film, however, remains a very good film, and it should be remembered, watched, and admired as one of Orson Welles' greatest works. He gets the first and last words in the movie, although he did not get the last say.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - There are many moments within the film, but the one that really got to me were the credits, that are announced by Orson Welles, in the way he did in his radio shows. Priceless, just priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent "Magnificent Ambersons"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RKO tried its damnedest to butcher Orson Welles' haunting, fantastic follow-up to "Citizen Kane," but they only partially succeeded. The movie does fall just short of greatness for me, but that's not Welles' fault. One can see that if the film he intended to make had actually been preserved, it would rival "Kane" as the premier example of Welles' cinematic genius.The movie feels rushed due to RKO's hack editing job, and there are odd, disjointed sections in which the pacing and sense of time feel off. Tim Holt isn't a forceful enough presence to play Georgie Amberson, and so Joseph Cotten, a much more charismatic screen presence, becomes the focus of the film, except for the moments when Agnes Moorehead is on screen and blows everyone else away with her caustic performance as Aunt Fanny. This is the one aspect in which the film is inferior to Booth Tarkington's magnificent novel, in which Georgie Amberson emerged as one of the most compelling and colorful characters I've ever seen in literature. And I don't think even Welles' "true" version would have changed that, since the failing is in the actor, not the editing.However, that aside, "The Magnificent Ambersons" stands as a towering achievement in film art. All of the Welles trademarks are there: the chiaroscuro lighting, the deep focus, the fluid camera. The sense of deterioration that plagues the Amberson elite is palpable in every frame.It's a high compliment to a film when you can say it's only fault is that there should have been more of it.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first viewed this film I was very impressed and as the years past, I see that many generations have felt the same way about a masterpiece of American Film Production. Orson Wells put his complete heart and soul into the production of this film; it certainly topped all his other films. It seems Wells loved Joseph Cotton who appeared in this film as, Eugene, "Niagra",'53, who was very deeply in love with Dolores Costello, (Isabel), "Outside These Walls", '39, who was simply beautiful in those days and was a very elegant lady and sweet as sugar. Ann Baxter, (Lucy), "The Blue Gardenia", '52, was full of joy and pep in this film and also fell in love with Tim Holt, (George), "Hot Lead",51. However, poor Lucy seemed to wait and wait for George to decide how he was ever going to earn a living, and did not really want to do anything in life except live and love his MOTHER. Enjoyed the great acting of Agnes Moorehead,(Fanny),"Bewitched",'64 TV Series, who played a spinster and added greatly to her supporting role. Glad I viewed this film again, it had deeper meaning to me this time around. Tim Holt was always a cowboy to me and appeared in many Westerns, in this film he completely surprised me, except when he was in the horse and carriage with Lucy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Orson Wells, as well as Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead. However, I think all three did much better work in Citizen Kane than in this movie. I agree that had Wells been able to deliver the entire movie the results might be different, but as it is, the story is too choppy. Further,as much as I like Moorehead's work in Kane, Sorry Worng Number and a particularly challenging episode of the Twilight Zone, I think she overacts in this film. Cotton is as good as always, but the material lacks some of the beef he needs to really step out. THe story line is strong and had the potential to be another Citizen Kane had Wells not been limited by cost and time overruns- if only we could have seen his original product!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have to have one lopped-off masterpiece in the sound era of American cinema, it might as well be "The Magnificent Ambersons." The very title, as well as the movie's treatment of the insular, too-proud clan, speaks of a grandeur that's not all quite there.What's left of the story, after heavy cuts (a full hour from its original running time, and more than 40 minutes less than it had been when previewed in Pomona, CA) and an upbeat reshoot of the ending while director Orson Welles was away, tells about the son of one Amberson, George Minafer (Tim Holt), and his downfall after he stops his widowed mother from taking up with the only man she ever loved, car inventor Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten)."The Magnificent Ambersons" is a satisfying film in many ways. It is a nice old-home week for several of the people involved in "Citizen Kane," most prominently Cotten; Agnes Moorehead in an Oscar-nominated turn as George's dizzy, embittered Aunt Fanny; Ray Collins (Boss Gettys in "Kane") as George's wise though aloof Uncle Jack; and Welles himself, narrating as well as directing and writing (this time alone). Gus Schilling, who fetched Susan Alexander Kane her highballs in "Kane," fetches a glass of water for Eugene Morgan's daughter Lucy (Anne Baxter) as a drugstore clerk here.It's also exquisitely shot, with dramatic backlighting, incredibly well-focused framing, and a composition that veers between Currier &amp; Ives quaintness to Dali-like surrealism with such suddenness it feels natural. The acting is uniformly strong, with Cotten especially engaging our amusement and favor at the opening ballroom scene (I see more of Welles in him, the inventor, than I do in Holt, who is often spoken of as having the Orson role in the film) and Richard Bennett, playing the Amberson patriarch literally on his deathbed and working it into his performance, standing out.So why don't I think it's great? Maybe it's because I'm not a filmmaker, and don't see its revolutionary advances the same way a filmmaker would. I'm watching a movie, an engaging film made with unusual intelligence, as a movie, a story on screen. I see evidence of chopping, I know enough of the backstory to gather a little of what I'm missing, but I don't feel cheated quite the way I should. Largely humorless, elliptical, and distant, "Ambersons" is too caught up with its technical triumphs. Watching George and Lucy on a buggy ride, we are meant to be impressed by the background (the developing city of Indianapolis) while the characters themselves speak in tinny romantic clichs. A lot of the film works like that, soap opera set against the Industrial Age. I feel a little hypocritical bemoaning the studio slashing; I couldn't wait for the film to end.By making George the principal figure, "Ambersons" presents us with an unusual challenge: A protagonist as unsympathetic as any ever put on film. Tim Holt, by the way, gives in my view the best performance in the movie, even better than Moorehead's. The way he smirks uncertainly, leans on the same tired phrases ("There's a bit of freshness for you"), and smugly eats strawberry shortcake does a great deal to establish his frailty without tipping his hand, so that when his comeuppance comes, you aren't as happy about it as you expect to be. But you never care enough.What stinks about the tacked-on ending, involving Eugene and Fanny, isn't just its silly piousness or patness. It's the fact we are hearing described a dialogue we should really see, George apologizing to the man he hurt, since it's so out of whack with all we have seen before and cheats us of the one scene in the film where we might have been turned around about him.Alas, for all Welles' mastery on display, there's nothing about "Ambersons" that grabs me. The scenes in the movie are enveloping, but they don't linger. Dialogue that crackles on screen loses its pungency upon reflection. "Ambersons" is a film that enthralls more than it entertains.</fullReview>

Glaring lapses in the plot and illogical leaps in characterization relegate this movie to the middle of the road.I can imagine another 40-50 minutes of impressive, witty, and heart-breaking Welles dialogue and camera work, but that's so much to the tragedy of the politics of the time - like the destruction of the library at Alexandria. You can see genius in there somewhere, but you're not allowed to view it as a whole. You can either kid yourself and weep or take it as it is and admire what's left of the pieces.</fullReview>

Mounted with great care and style despite studio interference (Welles had his final edit taken away from him by studio bosses, who recut and reshot portions of the picture, possibly resulting in the truncated final act and the brief running time of 88 minutes). Begins like a free-flowing play, with episodes of romance, humor, cynicism and drama, but the second and third acts get awfully heavy, with too much soapy theatricality. Excellent performances, particularly by Agnes Moorehead as a spinster aunt (she was Oscar-nominated). Worth-seeing, with some reservations.

		<shortDescription>A middle-aged Romeo &amp; Juliet story in a hugely overrated Welles film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First a word of warning: if you are in any way made uncomfortable by, annoyed, or even allergic to the word "pathetic", skip this review, for that very word will be utilized often and to its full and devastating effect."The Totally Pathetic Ambersons". Orson Wells's "second masterpiece", as this piece of c*** is referred to, is doubtlessly a well-directed (especially for that time) but idiotic and overly pathetic, melodramatic soap-opera. A story so irrelevant (in its pathetic grandeur) that it boggles the mind. A sort of "Romeo and Juliet" for the middle-aged. Based on a rather bad novel, I assume.The movie starts with Welles's admittedly pleasant voice (he was considered for Darth Vader at one point), and his narration can be heard on several other occasions, the most mystifying one being when his voice is heard while we find out the contents of a letter, instead of the voice of the letter's author, which is Cotton. As the movie progresses, so Welles's dramatic narration seems sillier, simply because it attempts to something that isn't worth s*** seem grand, something that is merely small, hardly big in any way - the story. The story has at its core the undying, ever-lasting - but most of all pathetic - love between Cotton and Miss/Mrs/Ms Amberson. Both of them are ethereal characters straight out of fairy tales for very small, retarded children; they are both pure goodness, pure patience, pure unselflessness, and pure kindness. In other words, they make me wanna throw up for days. (Ms.Amberson is the absolute replica of De Havilland's pure-goodness/tragic-death character from "Gone With The Wind".) For some dumb, completely invalid, to some - comical - reason they don't hook up when they're young, so Cotton waits - for decades - until her husband dies to woo her again (although he woos her a bit before the guy's death). Alas! George, her son is in the way! A spoilt, selfish brat right out of a bad novel; he is shocked and appalled by the very idea of his mother resuming her sex-life so he stands between the two doomed, tragic lovers... Aahhh... So sad. So impactful? So pathetic! So unrealistic! While at least in Shakespeare's tragedy there was a real barrier between R &amp; J, here there is none. No real one. George can hardly be considered a barrier. If Cotton really wanted to, he could simply tell him to shove off out of his way and then proceed to convince Ms.Amberson that her stupid son's interest are not relevant enough in this matter, and he would do so without mincing his words. And then they would get married, and George could sit around and sulk for all they care. But, but, but... Do not forget: this is an ethereal, grand, je-ne-sais-quoi drama with delicate lovers who take everything and everybody so very seriously and tragically. And they care so very much how their decisions affect everyone, even the nearest squirrel or spider or ant. And George is anything but a spider: his opinion is not only important - it is essential. His word is in fact the word of God himself. Hence, Ms.Amberson, instead of marrying her great love Cotton decides to take a trip around the world with her son George! How pathetic is that?! Talk about a silly, majestic, overkill reaction! But she is so self-sacrificing, so je-ne-sais-quoi... Ah. Ah. Aaahhhh... It's just so touching, her devotion to her brat son. I was close to tears and then shed them. (Okay, tears of laughter they were but tears Welles did get out of me, nonetheless, didn't he? He wanted my tears ? he got them!) Her generosity is only matched by Cotton's: he says not a word of all this to Baxter, his daughter, with whom George flirts. How unegotistical. How unself-serving. How pathetic! How far-fetched! How very old-school Hollywood! When Baxter comes back from her trip, she at first seems to be totally oblivious emotionally to George's glorious departure. But when George leaves after informing her of it, she starts sobbing, and proceed to so very pathetically faint in the nearby pharmacy. (Moments before, George suggested that he might have to get something in the pharmacy so as not to faint. What clever, clever irony. I am utterly spell-binded by this bit of cleverness. Also: we are fortunately spared seeing her faint; the camera was on the pharmacist ? who was picking his nose (just kidding).) Typically (for old-school Hollywood) Ms.Amberson returns from the long trip sick. Naturally, she is lying in bed dying, and what does she do? She asks her son if he ate enough and worried if he had caught a cold. Oh, isn't she so unselfish... So generous... So preposterously badly written! In her own mega-pathetic way she displays what true goodness and kindness is all about. And who better to relate this message of goodness to the sheep-like public than a decadent, ego-maniacal Hollywood director! (What irony. Though not the kind of irony this movie was aiming for.) After she dies, somehow George and her aunt Fanny have almost nothing left and he has to get a job to support the two of them. Ah! How destiny punished them for their meddling and selfishness! The irony! Hold-your-breath drama at its highest level, no doubt. But here comes the moment when I laughed hardest: many years later Cotton finds out in the newspaper that George broke both legs in a car-accident! I know I'm not supposed to laugh at this sort of dramatic plot-device, but I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it because it was so funny on so many levels: 1) a typical, dumb old-school Hollywood plot-device: a tragic death, an accident? Sorry, but I've hit the 1000-word review limit.

		<shortDescription>Watch This Instead Of Taking Sleeping Pills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to see this again. I only saw it once and was disappointed. Perhaps another look would help. In a nutshell, I loved the camera-work but was totally bored with the story.It's no surprise I liked the cinematography since Orson Welles directed. Actually, he not only directed but produced, wrote the script and narrated it! He had his usual assortment of closeups and different camera angles, which I always enjoy.This story, an unpleasant tale of a selfish young man and his deteriorating family, drags more and more as the story unfolds. The nice people in the story, played by Joseph Cotten and Anne Baxter, are pleasant but on the bland side. Tim Holt's character is effectively annoying and Agnes Moorhead's is just plain annoying. I doubt how many people today would watch something like this unless they had insomnia problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Extremely successful family drama and adaptation based on the novel. Welles showed an excellent sense of drama. THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS are grandiose and magic. Ordinary people in the aristocratic way experiencing the most ordinary adversity. Once poor Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten), who made his fortune producing cars, is trying to impose the traditional aristocracy. On his way he was blocking with moral barriers in the form of a young and spoiled George Amberson (Tim Holt).The story of Ambersonovima, a prominent and wealthy family of the then small city of Indianapolis, begins in 1873, at a time when life was much slower and when you have time for everything. This is a kind of dawn on the Industrial Revolution, a time in which materialism rule the country and the time to become money. It's hard to resist the impression that this is a somber drama. In one human story is born a new era. Maybe a little too ambitious. As a result, witnessed various changes and shortening.Director in the role of narrator introduces us to the magic and seamless switching to the characterization of the characters. Tim Holt as George is the embodiment of the requested malice and misunderstanding. Dolores Costello as Isabel is incredibly beautiful and attractive mother. A woman who is mature leaves the strongest emotion. I'm stunned because I Costello first saw in this film. Agnes Moorehead as Fanny in the role of the romantic and deeply frustrated aunt is great. Joseph Cotten as Eugene in good and surprisingly limited role.Magnificent Ambersons is a very good movie that captures the director's style, impressive scenery and great working with the cast, and has a strange manpower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The spoiled young heir to the decaying Amberson fortune comes between his widowed mother and the man she has always loved.More than 40 minutes of Welles's original footage was deleted, with portions reshot. Welles later said, "They destroyed 'Ambersons,' and 'it' destroyed me." Like the film itself, Bernard Herrmann's score for The Magnificent Ambersons was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name were not removed from the credits.In 1991, "The Magnificent Ambersons" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The film was included in Sight and Sound's 1972 list of the top ten greatest films ever made, and again in the 1982 list. It's not that great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterpiece From Orson Welles !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad that I didn't read any reviews for Orson Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) before I viewed it because they all mention that about an hour of the original film was burned by the studio editors while Welles was away on another project. Not knowing this historical tidbit about the film allowed me to appreciate it on its own merits without second guessing where the "missing" segments of the film were placed. In any case, I must say that the only negative thing about this film in regard to the "chop job" by RKO Studios is that the ending of the film, starting with the death of Isabel, did seem rather rushed and abrupt to me, even before I learned of RKO's "chop job". We go from Isabel's death to scant mentions of the Amberson fortune being lost (without ever knowing what happened to all the money), to George having to take a production job in an explosives factory, to George being hit by a car, and, finally to Mr Morgan visiting George in the hospital at the very end. This is the part, and the only part, of the film where I can say that the "chop job" probably diminished the quality of the film.Given the current state of The Magnificent Ambersons, however, I still feel that it is an excellent film. I've only viewed a few of Welles' films so far, and they all reveal his ability to "spin a good yarn". There is no "hidden meaning", or esoteric "symbolism" in this film. What you see is what you get, very much as was the case with Citizen Kane and The Stranger.But what you do get with this film is a damn good story, a very interesting, engaging and compelling story, with a solid script with no unreal "coincidences" or unexplainable "plot holes". As in the other Welles' films that I've seen, the performances by the whole cast, from the major to the minor characters, is very solid and definitely benefited from the wise directorship of Welles. The cinematography was great with lots of innovative camera positions and angles. The period sets and period costumes were much more than simply good.I would really like to see this film again very much because I enjoyed it so much the first time around. Just a very entertaining film with no gimmicks or gadgets, just delightful dramatic cinema at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles' Version of the Film Seems Forever Lost and it Runs a Full 50 Minutes Longer and is Assembled Differently. The Contrast Between what Welles Made and what Remains is More than Significant it is Profound. But All We Have is the RKO Version and While that has Received an Enormous Amount of Praise, it Must Be Said that the Praise is Singular and Cannot Reflect the Director's Original Intent.Basically it's the Second Half, Not Counting the Interruptions of the Long Fluid Shots and Such, where the Studio did the Most Damage. It has been Reported that Once Welles was Persuaded to Sit Down and Watch It, Decades Later, After About an Hour Stood Up and Said "From here on it's their Film". That Seems to be the Case, Because the Second Half is Not Near as Mesmerizing as the First. All Rushed and Jumbled Up. Choppy and Erratic, and the Ending is Ill Fitting. The Little 88 Minute Butchered, Mutilated, and Mangled Version is a Powerful but Painful Film to Watch. Even if One was to Know Nothing of the Changes it would be Obvious that Something was Not Only Missing but Amiss.Yes, it was Nominated for Four Oscars Including Best Picture and Most Film Critics Agree it is a "Magnificent" Work and Although what is Up There On the Screen is Technically Innovative and Beautiful at Times and is More Artistic than the Majority of Hollywood Product, the Tampering and Fiddling is Evident and Overall, Not at All Welcome. Still the Movie can be Enjoyed as Sort of a "Better Than Nothing" Glimpse at the Movie Making Expertise of Welles and Company (in shorthand).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Ambersons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Orson Welles (Touch of Evil), this film in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was the follow up to the highly regarded Citizen Kane, and from the picture I saw of the film I knew it was about a family in the olden days, and it was rated five out of five by the critics, so I hoped it would be really good. Basically Eugene Morgan (The Third Man's Joseph Cotton) is a young and handsome with a somewhat wild side who wants to marry the daughter of a rich upper-class family, but Isabel Amberson (Dolores Costello) gets married instead to steady but dull Wilbur Minafer (Don Dillaway). Isabel and Wilbur have one child together, but their son George grows up a spoilt brat, and years later Eugene comes back a mature man, and with the popularity of automobiles he has become successful making the, but he is also a widower. It is when Wilbur dies that Eugene gives Isabel some time to grieve, and then he is ready to ask her again to marry him, she is certainly open to the idea, but George (Tim Holt) hates the idea of having a new father, and with screwball aunt Fanny (Oscar nominated Agnes Moorehead) they manage to break the couple apart and stop their romance. But disaster comes upon the Ambersons when the family go into bankruptcy, George gives up his job in the law firm and finds more money working in a factory, and Fanny descends into psychosis, George is seen wandering around and injured, and in the end he and Eugene reconcile their differences in hospital. Narrated by Orson Welles, also starring All About Eve's Anne Baxter as Lucy, Ray Collins as Jack, Erskine Sanford as Roger Bronson and Richard Bennett as Major Amberson. Cotton is charming as the family man trying to make good for everyone, Costello is nice as the beautiful mother figure, Holt is good as the nasty one, and Moorehead in her scenes is compelling as the mad woman, I will be honest and say that I didn't understand everything going, such as class system and financial things, but the family value material and inventions changing the economic climate was interesting, a watchable classic period drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Picture. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pivotal Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to echo consensus points. Even in its mutilated 88-minutes the film remains a visual triumph. I do, however, want to underscore how Hollywood and its Production Code of the time robbed the film of its powerful ending. According to IMDb, Welles intended George's repentance scene kneeling before the bed to be the final one. It does consummate a dominant theme. The arrogant George has finally gotten the 'comeuppance' the town had long wished for. But then, thanks to Welles' powerful voice- over and staging of the scene, the comeuppance is unexpectedly more ironic than gratifying. The feeling conveyed is more one of poignant tragedy than of cosmic justice, even if George has at last received his due. With the family wealth gone, George has had to experience life as others do, without a cushion. It's like he must first learn humility before he can experience regret. But it's too late to repair the injuries he has so carelessly caused, especially to his late mother. So now he too becomes an injured party, sorely aware of a misspent life. But the sense Welles creates in this moment of self-recognition is far from the satisfaction seen in a wrongdoer being punished. Rather, it's almost a sense of one more personal loss being added to the others, for which there can be no satisfaction, only remorse. It's one of the more ironically powerful scenes I've experienced in many years of movie watching. More importantly, were this the movie's final scene, the audience would be left having to ponder some of life's more challenging conditions. But, of course, Hollywood and its Code couldn't allow folks to leave on a downbeat note, regardless of the redeeming qualities. So a happier ending was tacked on by the studio. Thus, writer-producer-director Welles' intended ending is undercut. At the same time and despite its many impressive movie products, old Hollywood again reaffirms its status as a producer of commercial goods instead of artistic ones. And an unusually powerful film is denied an unusually powerful ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is one of Orson Wells' finest films. I wish it was easier to find. It's a shame that it is currently out of distribution. It has a great story to tell and presents it in a visually interesting way. For the most part the music is effective. To my modern ear, the violins get a little old. But that's presentism talking. I realize back in the day, that was an expected norm of cinema. The aspect I'll remember most are the little comments the film makes on society, trends, and technology. They are very thought provoking and in an odd way mix well with the flow of the film. I'm also a sucker for great black &amp; white photography, and Wells' always seemed to attract the best DPs. Great story, great actors, and just a pleasure to look at: Recommended.</fullReview>

This film is second in importance only to Welles's Citizen Kane. It is a very moving and superbly made film with a wonderful cast--especially Joseph Cotton. The novel by Booth Tarkington is one of the great classic pieces of American fiction, and Welles's rendering of it on the screen is therefore of double importance as a way of making the novel available in visual form. The modern remake, done fairly recently, does not come anywhere near the original Welles version in quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh off the heels of soon to be hailed as greatest film ever made Citizen Kane, even fans of Orson Welles have to admit it's a little downhill from here. His followup film The Magnificent Ambersons could even be called more ambitious than Kane. It seems like it would've been if the full length version were its current incarnation. The way the film is approached feels like it needs that bloated 2 and a half hour running time with its overly lush frames and on-the-edge acting. Unfortunately, despite the film's presence, it struggled to engage me in the bigger picture plot at every turn. However, some scenes work their own little bubbles and are really quite thought-provoking and poignant. The performances are undeniably brilliant for that reason but it's a shame the script was so butchered, even though it still garners acclaim in its current version. Fascinating way to deliver credits though. The Magnificent Ambersons is a magnificent mess.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles and the industrial revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that people weren't, and still aren't, able to see the original director's cut of the movie, which is actually 148 minutes long. I may only assume that The Magnificent Ambersons would make a much bigger impression on the viewers, as of now it's probably one of the most underrated of all Orson Welles' movies. But still, the RKO Radio version is a remarkable one, and everyone should definitely see it.It's worth mentioning that this picture wouldn't be so fine without the great narration, provided by the director himself, which places the movie in time and space, and give a great insight into the characters' personalities.The Magnificence of the Ambersons lies in their ability to make money. This very prominent family was connected with success and wealth for generations. However, the movie doesn't intend to bask in their glory. Instead, it shows a gradual downfall of this clan, in the revolutionary times of great expansion and progress during the 19th century. The plot cleverly intertwines this sad tale of a decaying family, so to say, with a story about love that wasn't meant to be.Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten), a handsome man from middle class, has always been fond of Isabel Amerson (Dolores Costello). He wanted to marry her, but she chose a dull and tedious Wilbur Minafer instead. They had a boy named George (Tim Holt), who was ever so rude, impolite and obnoxious towards other citizen. All the people wanted to see was for the boy to finally get a well-deserved punishment, but his family background was like a shield that protected him from every bad thing.Years later, Eugene comes back to town as a widowed, very successful endorser and maker of a possible life-changing invention: the automobile. His daughter Lucy also arrives in town and George, who's grown to be an enormously snobbish, arrogant, and intolerable young heir, is charmed by her prettiness. After the death of Wilbur, Eugene steps in to make Isabel fall in love with him again and that doesn't suit George in any way. Being so full of hatred and jealousy he, along with the help of a devious and eccentric aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead), plans to sabotage their relationship.I think it's brilliant that Orson Welles was able to present a tragic story about love, and at the same time show how, in the times of industrial revolution, one rich family lost their big chance to stay on top and eventually collapsed under the weight of industrialization. George finally got what he deserved, being the grand maker of the fall of his own household. Overcome with bursting wrath and anger, he didn't understand that his actions struck the ones that he tended to love the most. In the final scenes, he wanders around town confused, looking at the changes that the revolution brought, and realizing that everybody went forward but him, as he was too concentrated on his selfish desires.Great performances from all the actors: Joseph Cotton as the stylish and dignified man, who was true to his first love up till the final moments; Dolores Costello shines in all her beauty and elegance; Tim Holt as the spoiled brat George, who not only made his mother miserable and sad, but also missed a chance to rebuild his family's magnificence; Agnes Moorehead gave probably the most memorable performance of all, as the wacky aunt Fanny, so in love with perfidious affair of any sort that it ultimately made her descend into psychosis.All in all, The Magnificent Ambersons is a vital position in the Orson Welles directorial career. It's highly recommended, mainly for its brilliant story, fine historical allusions, beautiful sceneries, and fantastic performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles' sophomore feature established a pattern that would dog the maverick director for the rest of his career: he never completed the film, and in this instance it was taken out of his hands and finished for him. Booth Tarkington's dramatic novel about an American family torn apart by changing times could have made a film equal in style and scope to 'Citizen Kane', but what might have been another masterpiece was compromised by a tragically mismanaged production. Despite the handsome old-world veneer and turn-of-the-century charm, the film looks rushed, as if by the time the sets and costumes were prepared Welles had lost interest in it. Tim Holt's static lead performance pales alongside the full-blooded acting of Mercury Theatre pros like Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead, and the optimistic epilogue, clearly filmed after Welles' departure, rings false.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performances, but a choppy plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, "The Magnificent Ambersons" released by RKO in 1942, seems to be a bit stuffy and slow. But it is the characters and the actors who play them that are pivotal to keeping it alive. A young Tim Holt gives a marvelous performance as Georgie, a spoiled loafer born into wealth and privilege. We are not sure what to think of Georgie; one minute he is awful, then the next very loving with his mother (Delores Costello) or pining for a girl (Anne Baxter in an early performance). Agnes Moorehead is the other standout performance, portraying plain Aunt Fanny, a spinster who keeps a fantasy alive about being proposed to an eccentric inventor (Joseph Cotten). Much of the plot seems to about progress, and those who either get with it and accept it (and invest in it if you have money) or those who get left behind. Much discussion has been made about RKO butchering Orson Welles film, and perhaps that 50 minutes that was cut could have filled in some of the holes apparent in the storyline. While this is not a perfect film, and at times the plot is a tad confusing, it is still quite good. The lighting, camera angles, etc. were ahead of their time and typical of Welles ingenuity. And the stellar cast -- interesting that Tim Holt would become later known for westerns and Agnes Moorehead would achieve more fame on the TV series "Bewitched" in the 1960's. Anne Baxter would have a memorable career ahead of her, notably as Eve in "All About Eve." And of course the wonderful Joseph Cotten, who would be in films for about the next thirty years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical '40's drama done Welles style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very typical for the '40's. It's an epic family drama, in which a lot of drama is happening. Best example of this genre is perhaps "Gone With the Wind". Well OK, bad example perhaps since that movie is from 1939 and not the '40's but when you say "Gone With the Wind" everyone knows the type of movie you mean. Those movie were really popular- and flourished in the '40's. I must say though that during that time period some better genre movies. A lot better and more powerful movies. Only thing that still makes this movie good and a bit more special is Orson Welles his touch.It's funny how basically every Orson Welles movies seems so ahead of its time. It's techniques, it's storytelling. It's all something you wouldn't expect from an '40's movie but more from one made decades later. Also Welles his love for the radio shows in this movie. The movie is being made and told as a radio show, only with moving of course added to it, with Welles providing his own voice for the narration. Prior to this movie, Welles also made a radio show of the novel, this movie as well is being based on. For this, he used most of the actors that also star in this movie.The movie really doesn't feature the best known actors from its era but everyone is simple well cast and suits their roles superbly. It even earned Agnes Moorehead an Oscar nomination. She really earned it as well in my opinion. She played the best character out of the movie and was truly splendid in her role. Her acting style didn't really seemed like anything common for '40's standards, which is perhaps the reason why her acting and characters stands out so much in the movie.A problem I had with the movie though is that it was too long and just not always interesting to watch. Well, the movie actually isn't long at all with its 88 minutes but still the movie feels like a 3 hour drama production. Hard to say if this is Orson Welles his fault really, since it were the studios that 'butchered' this movie by cutting out 50 minutes of it, through editor and later turned famed director Robert Wise. Maybe Welles his version was a better flowing one, with some more drama and other moments added to it. We will never known, since the 'original' Welles version is most likely lost forever.Nevertheless it otherwise still is a superior made movie, with some wonderful new fresh used techniques. Orson Welles was truly a pioneer in film-making and this movie as well is a good example of this, even though it's not his best or most interesting one. But is there even such a thing as a bad Orson Welles movie?8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent motion picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following up on a brilliant and groundbreaking classic like Citizen Kane would not be an easy task for any director, but genius auteur Orson Welles has proved that he was more than up for the task with this movie. The Magnificent Ambersons is an adaptation of Booth Tarkington's novel, which gives a commentary on American life in the 40's. I was unsure going into this movie as I'm not exactly the biggest pro-American in the world and, to be honest, couldn't really care less what American life was like in 40's. However, I should have known better as all truly great films transcend the time that they were made in; and this film does also. The Magnificent Ambersons delivers a slice of family life that is interesting not because of the parallels with American society, but because of the emotions and motivations of the central characters in the plot. The plot follows a spoilt young man named George. After the death of his father, one of his mother's old suitors, a man named Eugene Morgan returns as a widower and successful automobile manufacturer. However, the spoilt young mother's boy doesn't like the attention that is being paid to his mother, and so seeks to end their affair.The Magnificent Ambersons is very much an 'A' quality picture, with all elements of the film being very much top class. Orson Welles doesn't need any more plaudits as a director, but I'll give him some anyway. For such a young man especially, the film is superbly well directed. The atmosphere that Welles has created excellently compliments the plot and helps to draw the audience into the characters and their motivations. The characters themselves are suitably deep, and more than enough so that we as the audience are able to relate to them. The motivations are classic ones, as we have the young man distraught that his mother has a rival for attention, the man himself vying for her attention, putting his rival's actions down to naivety and the mother herself, not wanting to displease her son; but at the same time, wanting a companion. The relationships of these characters make for fascinating viewing, and that is the backbone of this classic film. On the whole, this is classic cinema at it's very best, and it's amazing that the film isn't mentioned more often in 'great film' discussions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Magnificent Ambersons plays out like a classic melodrama ? its elements include scandal, revenge, class conflict and a corniness that make this genre so much fun to experience. Based on the novel by Booth Tarkington, the story of the spoiled George Minafer and his elite family, the Ambersons is fairly timeless, despite the turn of the century setting. When you throw in Orson Welles' brilliant direction and innovative blocking, (in this film, it is blocked much like a play) the film is incredible.However, the fact remains that the final cut of Ambersons was not the final cut that Welles wanted, so guilt is definitely a companion to my enjoyment of this film. Unfortunately, Welles was never able to release the version that he wanted to make, so it is unclear as to what his vision was for the film; however if you are not a Welles disciple and are just looking to enjoy a good (if not sometimes unusual film) then it stands on its own merits as a classic. --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles's THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS (1942) is a follow-up to his acclaimed directorial debut CITIZEN KANE (1941). It's based on a popular novel and Welles felt very strongly about the material and intended AMBERSONS to surpass the cinematic artistry of KANE. However, as legend has it, some 50 minutes of film was deleted from Welles's original vision, while other scenes were re-shot, all without Welles's input. His film was "mangled" to appease the wartime audience and many believe a masterpiece was lost in the process. The lost footage is believed to have been destroyed, so the world may never see AMBERSONS the way the auteur Welles intended. But the world still has the 88-minute version that was released in 1942.I was not altogether impressed with THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS as it survives. I think I knew what it was about (a spoiled brat falling from the toast of society to working a factory job for the very industry that made obsolete his previous way of life; the downfall of a bygone high-crust lifestyle in the industrialization of the early twentieth century; unrequited love; etc., etc.) and I noticed some of Welles's artistic flourishes (long takes, shadows, camera angles, visual compositions, some flashy transitions, etc.), but the film is no masterpiece, in my opinion. The story doesn't always flow smoothly, which I assume is the product of the choppy editing done by the studio. And I couldn't really "get into" the story or the characters. I sat through the film, but it didn't capture my interest or keep me hooked throughout its 88 minutes.To me, AMBERSONS falls far short of KANE as a work of art. CITIZEN KANE is not my favorite movie, but I can recognize the greatness of its film-making. THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is not in the same league. A few interesting camera movements and some continuous tracking shots do not a masterpiece make. Maybe the film would have blown me away in Welles's original 131-minute version, but the movie we're left with is not all that great. I was surprised to see such a high rating on IMDb for AMBERSONS. I wonder if people rate "the masterpiece that could have been" rather than the film as is, taking into consideration Welles's original intent. Some artistic flourishes and good intentions don't raise AMBERSONS to a masterpiece, in my mind.Of course the movie isn't all bad. I like the beginning, walking the viewer through late 1800s social practices and setting up "the magnificence of the Ambersons". And I really like Orson Welles's narration, where it pops up. It sets up the scenes nicely, but it disappears for long stretches of the film and then pops up unexpectedly. (I wonder if the original version better utilized the narration throughout the film's duration.) I also appreciate the large Amberson mansion set, which I understand was constructed like a real house so that the cameras could follow characters into any room and cover it from any angle. Some tracking shots go through several rooms, which is cool. And some shots follow characters up the various levels of the grand staircase. But, again, these highlights do not save the film as a whole for me.THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS had lofty aspirations. And although it has promise, I can't consider it the masterpiece other viewers do. After viewing what's left of Welles's vision, I was surprised to find such a high rating on IMDb (and even more surprised to see a Best Picture Oscar nomination). So maybe it's just me, and I don't understand the artistry of the film. But I still think that it falls short of its grand ambitions. The whittled down version is sometimes choppy and has its fair share of weaknesses. I give it bonus points for effort, but despite occasional flair I'd rate AMBERSONS a 6/10.UPDATE 12/14/11: Having seen the movie again after nearly two years, I believe I have a warmer opinion of it. It's definitely not as smooth as other Hollywood fare of the time, but I can appreciate the technical aspects, the solid cast, and even the script. The story got to me a little more this time. Maybe I was too harsh before or maybe I'm more lenient now, but I've bumped my rating up to 7 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a journey back in time. When one family was the envy of the town. I enjoyed this movie as I felt the characters were well developed and you feel as if you know them and even feel emotions for their good and bad behavior. Each character is given an important role in the story. When the movie ends you wonder what happened next? It would be nice if the movie had not lost all the original footage, but even with it missing, the movie tells the tale of a well to do family at the turn of the 20th century and how the automobile changed towns and changed wealth for some families. We get to see the wealthy changed to the humble and the happy changed to the concerned.The movie is well worth watching, if you are a fan if older movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Orson Welles, it is difficult to know fact from fiction. The man loved magic tricks, and he was an expert self-promoter. Pauline Kael's "The Citizen Kane Book" opened my eyes to how legends are made and maintained, especially in light of the bogus auteur theory. (According to Kael, Welles offered co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz a sizable bonus to remove his name from the credits and improve Welles' profile as a solitary genius.) Over the years I've seen my share of 'martyred' projects that Welles created in his long decline. Some real rarities too, like 'Chimes at Midnight,' and I've enjoyed them all.But for reasons I don't fully understand, I never got around to seeing Welles' second feature, 'The Magnificent Ambersons' until today. Perhaps part of the delay was based on career mythology. According to legend, the studio cut Welles' 131-minute running time to a B-picture 86 minutes while Welles was in South America on assignment for a documentary. Who wants to see another ruined masterpiece? Thanks to TCM, I took off this afternoon to see what 'Ambersons' was about, and I have to say I was duly impressed. It is obvious where the studio tampered with the original, the shifts of tone in the second half, and the 'happy ending' does not fit the grim noir feel of the first two acts. Never mind that. Never mind that this movie may have created a lifetime of war between Welles and the studios. Even in its fragmented state, this movie is a treat for anyone who claims to be a fan of Orson Welles, that grand old fabulist of self-invention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victorian Soap Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What really annoys me about this film is the script. It starts out as an ensemble piece with too many characters. Later, the George character (Tim Holt) emerges as the protagonist. Early on, we learn there are two main families; yet, there are three sets of family surnames: Morgan, Minafer, and Amberson. The script's too many characters go by first names: George, Jack, Gene, Wilbur, and Henry, among others, and are poorly introduced; their relationships are hard to determine, at first. So I had to watch the film's first Act twice to determine who was a Morgan, who was a Minafer, and who was an Amberson. All of which made the film confusing and detracted from the plot.Further, the film is heavy on dialogue. Characters laugh, cry, lament, dream, and argue. But mostly they talk and talk ... and talk. Given that the era is early 20th century, the costumes and sets look highly Victorian. And so the film comes across as a Victorian-era soap opera.As shown, plot segments lack effective transitions, making the overall plot choppy. There's a conspicuous lack of story continuity and flow. And the film's ending is way too abrupt, as well as disappointing.A big part of my script complaints may stem from the fact that some fifty minutes of the original film was excised by the studio while director Welles wasn't looking. We'll never know how much better that original might have been from this final version.The B&amp;W lighting is fine, if perhaps a tad dark. Prod design and costumes seem appropriate for the story's historical era. Background music is predictably manipulative; light and airy during scenes of fun; dreary and brooding during serious scenes. I did not like the casting of Joseph Cotten, a bit too smug and pompous. The idea that changes in technology can change families and their future financial prospects was a relevant theme for a film in the 1940s. "The Magnificent Ambersons" gets that theme across well. And it's possible that if I could watch the film that Welles intended to make I might have liked it better. Even so, I'm not a fan of Victorian-era stories. And the script would still have been laden with too many characters and too much talk; the existing film certainly is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has weaknesses but is mostly a strong story on several levels with good direction and high production values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rise of the automobile sees the changing of the times. The Ambersons are an establishment in their town and have the house and reputation to maintain that. Having been rejected by Isabel Amberson in favour of Wilbur Minafer, Eugene Morgan carries on with his life, only returning once he has made his money by manufacturing cars. This time Isabel seems more interested in Eugene but her son, George, is not so happy with this attention ? nor with his lack of success in the love stakes and sets about to scupper any chance of the reunion working out.Apart from the fact that it had a good going over by RKO executives and the fact that the "happy" ending doesn't totally ring true, this film still stands up as being an interesting and dark look at the fall of a family with the passage of time. It has this as its core and it makes it much more interesting because we are allowed to see the bigger picture of such things while also having a main narrative that is enjoyable and engaging to watch. The main story is a simple affair with interesting characters and it works for what it is. I found it hard to shake the feeling that it should have been darker and that perhaps some of the edges had been taken off, but it still worked. The directing is strong throughout, using lots of classy long takes and moving the camera with gentle sweeping style.The cast are good but I did feel that some of them really lacked bite. Cotton is usually a reliable face for me but here he didn't make much of an impression ? not helped by the fact he appeared too young for the role (as did several of the others). Holt is strong as George ? not "bad" so much as pitiful and annoying in the way real spoilt people are. Costello is good and Baxter is marvellously mean but yet innocent in the way that girls can be when they have it and they know it! Special mention form me goes to the sets and costumes ? so accurate, ornate and beautiful, it really adds to the class feel of the film.Overall it may not be the product that Welles was after but it is still worth seeing because it works on several levels and, aside from the ending, is darkly entertaining and enjoyable. The cast are mostly good, the direction strong and the production values classy, all making the film a strong piece that works as a narrative and a character story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, of course, Old Awesome's follow-up to Kane and several forests have been decimated arguing the toss about whether or not and if 'yes' how MUCH was it butchered. Like any committed film buff I too weep for what might have been but I also rejoice for what IS and what is is really something. Awesome's voice-over narration sets the tone perfectly striking exactly the right nostalgic note and slipping in the subtextual message that continuity and change is the topic for tonight. The film is replete with subtle touches like the store-fronts slowly expanding as the town does and Awesome allows us to read them from right to left - if we've a mind to - as they form a backdrop to buggy/automobile rides and then with gorgeous irony from right to left as Tim Holt and Ann Baxter WALK down a street in a town now grown out of all recognition. Elsewhere the deep focus is used both sparingly and effectively and the maestro knows exactly when to let gossiping heads fill the frame and when to wax lyrical. The acting is superb throughout and for 86 minutes this is as good as it gets and even the final two minutes which flies in the face of everything that Welles had been building towards is at least tidy. Flawed Masterpiece? It floored me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, but disappointing. Produced, written and, most importantly, directed by Orson Welles. That alone would make you think that this can not fail to be great. Consider too that Welles' previous film was the astoundingly brilliant Citizen Kane and you would think that greatness is even more assured.Yet, somehow, it fails to deliver. The Magnificent Ambersons is not bad, but its not great either. Cinematographically, Welles is in top form. The usual shadows and light tricks and perfect camera angles are there.No, it's not the cinematography, it's the plot, and the characters. The plot started off well enough. You got a sense early on that the movie was going to be a social commentary on change, on social mores and how wealth corrupts. This is all there, but is secondary to a story that more resembles a soap opera. The social scheming by some characters was quite off- putting, and the conclusion was just a bit too neat and convenient. Plus, there are so many contrivances in the plot to make it feel not entirely plausible. The comeuppance at the end doesn't make much sense. Neither does the relationship between Lucy and George.Welles, who made a great social comment with Citizen Kane, could have made and equally important one here, but pulls his punches and misses the mark.</fullReview>

Agnes Moorehead is interesting as the spinster Fanny but her character is wishy-washy as well, producing lots of sturm und drang that peters out to nothing in the end.I'll have to read my fellow reviewers' work to try to understand why this film is so well-respected.I'd say the best thing about it was the sleighs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing film, but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a "different" movie. You can tell that right from the opening scenes. And perhaps that was the brilliance of director Orson Welles, who also narrates the tale. But that is not to say that I feel this is a great picture. It's all most too different.In some ways, the story -- about an odd family that devolves into "staying apart from others" and, eventually, poverty -- reminds me a bit of a Lillian Hellman tale, although the location (New England) and era (Victorian) are wrong for Hellman.The primary role in the film belongs to Tim Holt, and I'm not sure it's a role he should have accepted. In the film he plays such a spoiled and cruel child, and then adult, that I' actually not sure I want to see him in another film. Yes, I know, it's just a movie role, but here he's downright despicable.The film is a good reminder that Joseph Cotton, whom I feel is greatly neglected in the history of American film-making, was a very fine actor...and he was perfect in his role here. Dolores Costello, a name pretty well forgotten, and from the silent era, is excellent here as the female lead. She only made one more film after this, but lived another 36 years (reportedly, the makeup used in the silent films made her skin seriously deteriorate). Anne Baxter has a very secondary role here. Two character actors who deserve a mention: the venerable Agnes Moorehead, who plays a very odd (and Hellmanish) role, and Ray Collins, here another eccentric.Is this another great Orson Welles picture (right after "Citizen Kane")? Not quite, though it is interesting. Isn't it almost always delicious to watch a family disintegrate in a film? But, the studio took apart Welles' film before it's real release, even filming an alternate ending (which was more faithful to the original novel). What I kept thinking through much of the first half of the novel was -- what's the plot line? It seemed to ramble quite a bit before we finally figured out that the real plot was the son's ruining of his mother's life. And that, I think, is the fatal flaw in this film, which keeps it from being a truly great film.But that's not to say that it's not compelling. It is. You just have to be fairly patient. Recommended to watch at least a couple of times, but this is not Welles' best effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Ambersons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a bit unfair that Orson Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons is often remembered as the movie that wasn't as good as Citizen Kane, as that label applies to virtually every film ever made; taken on its own merits, the film is a formally experimental and subtly subversive meditation on wealth and class in a small American town. The film examines and critiques two faces of the capitalist elite: on one hand there's George, a smarmy little f*** who lives off of his grandfather's fortune; the townspeople hope to witness his comeuppance, and so-- cleverly complicating the film's criticism by revealing our own spectatorial desire for capitalist dominance question mark?--do we. On the other hand, the film reserves a quiet criticism for the "good" capitalists as well: upon introspection, Eugine is unsure that his drive for innovation is benefiting humanity, and at the end of his life, Major Amberson finds no solace in his stately mansion or magnificent name. That is the film's ultimate thesis: in the face of love and death, trivialities of class and social status don't matter, never mattered, couldn't possibly matter. None of these characters are ever quite able to strike a perfect balance between philosophy and practicality, and The Magnificent Ambersons is uninterested in proscribing one; Welles only hopes to spark such introspection in his audience. Also, Aunt Fanny is the most obnoxious character in cinematic history. -TK 8/31/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Official Tagline of the movie is 'From the Man who Made "The Best Picture of 1941" '.Mentioning Not only of that year's , but considered as one of the best movies ever - Citizen Kane. After this classic, Welles made a movie based on the family values and human relationships of that era. 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is not only about the magnificence of the Ambersons but also the deterioration of their values and relationships. The story is very simple but handled with complexity such that sometimes it tends to shy away from the basic story. My problem with the movie is that it tends to be technically brilliant, great camera-work, great editing, great sets, even great acting, but the heart and soul of a movie - The story is given secondary treatment IMO. Orson Welles who is not only the director but also the narrator of the movie lacked in that aspect. Thus, you do not feel for the characters of the movie, you don't get involved in their emotional turbulence, you just are restricted to praising it's sets, camera-work, costumes and acting. Also, it might be boring for some viewers and may be considered as a substitute for sleeping pills.Acting is a strong aspect of the movie, right from Orson Welles's best friend Joseph Cotten, to a very bright Tim Holt. From a hyper Agnes Moorehead to a restrained and graceful Dolores Costello. I would suggest this movie for viewers who view cinema as an art or who love the different aspects of film-making. But for an average movie-lover, staying away would be the option. Rating : 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Drama Of Turn-Of-The-Century Wealthy Family's Fall From Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ambersons are a wealthy family whose only heir is their spoiled son George, who shows no interest in any trade or profession. But times are modernising, epitomised by the newfound wealth of family friend Eugene, an automobile inventor. Ignoring these changes around them, are the Ambersons doomed to fade away and be forgotten ?Welles' follow-up to his classic Citizen Kane is a very sad film, for two reasons. Firstly, it is a sad story of a group of folks who have lost touch with family values; an insufferable child never taught respect, a spineless interfering aunt, a mother who married the wrong man out of pride, a patriarch only interested in money. They are selfish, but worse they are proud and ignorant, and the world eventually passes them by. Secondly, the legacy of the film is the beginning of the sad story of Welles, one of the most talented filmmakers and artists America has ever produced. When the movie was finished, the bigshots at RKO found it too gloomy and had editor Robert Wise recut it (removing about half-an-hour) and film that godawful incongruous final scene where Cotten tells us everything's okay, George has miraculously changed and the future's just peachy. It's a sad example of something beautiful marred by those who care only for money. Nevertheless, it's still a remarkably beautiful movie (based on the 1918 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Booth Tarkington), with elegant sweeping camera-work by Stanley Cortez and a wonderfully evocative atmosphere. The photography starts bright, open and wide as the small picturesque town gradually expands and industrialises, and slowly becomes more stark, closeup and shadowed. As ever, Welles' style tells the story as much as the pictures and sounds. The cast of faithful Mercury Theatre players are excellent, with Moorehead a standout, and many touching moments such as the dinner scene where Cotten questions whether progress is really something to celebrate. I enjoy and admire this movie, but - as with several others - I wish I could see the film that Welles originally intended. Some of his detractors have compared him to George - an egotistical young man who gets his comeuppance - but make no mistake; Welles understood people and understood cinema and his work remains amongst the most important film-making of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Ambersons was an almost-great Orson Welles-directed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this long acclaimed, if heavily edited by others, Orson Welles movie on YouTube. Based on Booth Tarkington's novel, The Magnificent Ambersons tells of a wealthy family of which mother Isabel Amberson Minafer (Delores Costello) becomes reacquainted with Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) who has just started making a new invention called the "horseless carriage" or automobile. Her spoiled son George (Tim Holt) himself seems smitten with Morgan's daughter Lucy (Anne Baxter) who likes George enough but sees him as a little arrogant and not very ambitious. There's also an Aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead) who also likes Eugene. That's all I'll say of the story. Welles, as narrator, takes us through what importance the title family once had to their town before their decline. For the first hour, things seem to occur naturally before the obvious cuts come in the last 20 minutes. Despite that, I was mostly spellbound by what I saw until the last scene when something of an abrupt happy ending seemed tacked on. So obviously, this version of Orson Welles' second directorial feature isn't a complete masterpiece. Still, what I watched was compelling enough with fine performances from the main cast that I mentioned above.</fullReview>

I always thought of Gregg Toland as the master b/w cinematographer of all time mostly for his work on Kane, but the cinematography by Stanley Cortez on the Ambersons is as good if a little less showy, and surprisingly similar to Kane's. Maybe, like the Venus de Milo, the flaws resulting from the petty interference with the director's vision somehow add to the overall impression.

		<fullReview>Booth Tarkington's memorable novel became a hit film of 1942.It's the story of the deterioration of an American family set in the mid-west at the turn of the century. Their lives change drastically as the country is industrializing.Orson Welles amassed an impressive cast where Joseph Cotten twice attempted to marry Isabelle Amberson, (Dolores Costello) but fate intervened each time.While both marry others, it appears that their offspring George (Tim Holt) and Lucy (Anne Baxter) will marry each other but the fates are tempting again.Holt, as the wealthy scion, steals many of the scenes in every sense of the word. He is equally matched by Aunt Fanny, a superb Agnes Moorehead. She portrays a spinster aunt, sister-in-law of Isabelle, who has designs of her own regarding Cotten.An interesting note to this film is that Agnes Moorehead won the N.Y. film critics award for best actress in 1942 for this film. When it came Oscar time, she was nominated for best supporting actress for it and promptly lost to Teresa Wright in "Mrs. Miniver."Orson Welles does a great job directing. The close-ups of the town gossips are memorable. The eerie scenery sets the standards of what the film is all about. It is filmed beautifully in black and white. The coldness of winter is evenly set against the strong family relationships that only death can put an end to.Too bad that over a half-hour of this wonderful film was cut. As an example, Isabelle running off to Europe after the vicious gossip destroys her relationship with Joseph Cotten, only to return gravely ill. There must have been scenes between all of this.Nevertheless, this is a memorable classic motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 'Magnificence' of the 'Ambersons' has not been kept secret over the years to TV viewers; that is, until as of late, when fewer and fewer films of any vintage and/or quality are being shown on free TV. I do not have cable, and therefore am forced to pay strict attention to the few instances when a truly classic film is shown on free commercial TV and PBS. The "Magnificent Ambersons" has been shown in its aborted form all along, and has been further butchered to allow commercial interruptions. I--for one-- would volunteer to help a Kevin Brownlow search out the archives for a Director's cut of this and/or other classic films that would stand a chance of complete or at least near complete restoration. "Ambersons"--like "...Cane"--suffers from a discontiguity that frustrates the viewer. We all know,just from watching, that there's much more to the film that we are not seeing. To recommend that one see "The Magnificent Ambersons" is like recommending that one breathe, or take a walk. It isn't so much a recommendation as it is a vital necessity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nobody like Orson Welles. The man can even end a film with this looming microphone swinging in the distance, and it seems more like art than what is released today. My favorite director/actor, Welles proved once and again that what lurks in the shadows are men, and their spirits are more sinister than anything a horror film could produce. Being an avid fan of Citizen Kane, I wanted to experience more - and that is where The Magnificent Ambersons comes into play. Surprisingly, I didn't even know anything about the drama behind this film. I wasn't privy to the knowledge that the studio burned most of Welles' 113 minute long cut, and instead kept with this 88-minute version ... which ... in my eyes ... is still a powerful film. I didn't know he didn't have much say over the final results, and instead, was left with a choppy, studio- driven version that left a soured note in his eye. Oh, the drama. Yet, here it is - found on VHS for now, this was a powerful film about the turn of the century, the introduction to modern technology, and the depression of the status quo. Oddly, created in 1942, this film seems more relevant today - with the current economic distress - and making the overall experience a powerful Welles outing.I would first like to say that any film that focuses on a central character getting his "come-uppances", is already going to receive high marks. Secondly, narration by Welles himself - guess I asked for a second scoop of cinematic pleasure. The only downside was that Welles should have played the role of George. I completely understand that he didn't want another Kane looming in the distance, but he obviously pulled a Woody Allen trick, where he wasn't the lead role, but had the actor take his mannerisms. Ergo, he was in the film. With that small element aside, the narration did add a rather strong voice to this film. Giving us an everyman's town, a place not unlike where we all live now, with the wealthy experiencing the same issues many of us see daily. That is what pulled my strings the most with The Magnificent Ambersons was Welles' ability to pull such an ordinary event into the view of this wealthy family. We see these things happen all the time with average couples in film, so it was a distinction to see it happen to the wealthy Ambersons. This story is simple, and I am eager to read Booth Tarkington's version as well, just to see what Welles left out. I want to get to know these characters more - and the book should bring that to me.To end, I loved this film for more than just the actors and the narration. I loved the introduction of the automobile into the story. I loved how the ending (albeit choppy) pulled in more than just a dramatic closure, it spoke to audience about fears, modern advances, and the uncertainty of life. It transformed this film about the turn of the century into a film that could be watched today - nearly 67 years later - and find current relevances. It is more than just a story about a family. This is a story about the future, about depression, about love, and about children. It is about small town America - it is about the changing world - it is about Welles' deep dark soul. This isn't a happy film. In fact, it is rather full of gloom and doom, but it is 100% Welles (or at least the parts not taken out). I loved the cinematography, the looming dark scenes coupled with Welles shadow angles. It was brilliant - from beginning to end, this is not the film you expect when you sit down. This isn't a love story. This is a life story. Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magnificent Ambersons contrasts the story of a wealthy family's decline in fortune, with the countervailing rise of the automobile. The movie in its current form only trains viewer attention on a banal bit of financial moralism (the comeuppance); but the original ending would have been a scathing indictment of the shallow brutality of capitalism; which is mishandled to a grotesque degree by its stewards (George Jr.) and metes out cruel, mechanical fates to those who can't fit themselves into the prevailing financial equation (Aunt Fanny... George Jr (again) after his early years). As anyone can see in 2010, capitalism does NOT work for society, only for a a small group of powerful individuals. The movie also dares to take on the question "At what point, do social pressures force the severance of family bonds; when relatives become dead weight?" Not light fluff by any measure... America's desperate condition in 2010 can be summed up as: "When is Grandma no longer profitable?"The confidence and competence with which Ambersons is assembled is just astonishing, until the movie abruptly comes screeching to a halt with that phony-baloney ending. It's not hard to see where Welles shots are, and where the Robert Wise dross is. Welles treats the viewer like an adult, and lets you search the whole frame for subtle evidence. Wise hits you over the head with singular motivations and feelings. Too many people write this off after seeing Kane, and knowing they have an out because Ambersons was 'ruined' by the studio. But this has nothing to do with Kane. There is scarcely a scene in this movie that isn't executed much more thoughtfully than anyone else would have done in 1942, or really in any era for that matter; it's that good, even in its ruined state. If you can't see that, you don't have a leg to stand on in terms of your film analysis. It did take multiple viewings for the movie's quality to sink in for me. I always liked it, but now I absolutely love it, and know precisely why. (And Tim Holt is fine in his role, despite what casual acting snobs claim.)The movie speeds along compared to other work of the era. It is breath-taking. And just as well, it was spared a performance by Welles. It's also one of a very few movies to portray a warm, loving father-daughter relationship. The long takes are amazing, as is Welle's engaged, mobile camera. The sense of place in the film (the town, the Amberson mansion) is palpable. Unfortunately it's still not available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to imagine the cut footage making the film any better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "Citizen Kane" garnered strong reviews in 1941, it did not recuperate much of its budget (thanks largely to the efforts of William Randolph Hearst), so RKO Pictures pulled back on Welles' creative liberties on his follow-up picture, "The Magnificent Ambersons." Welles traveled to Brazil for the State Department, leaving the finished footage in the care of the RKO editor who had worked on "Citizen Kane." While Welles was out of the country, RKO - after seeing a rough cut of the movie and despising it (and fearing a bomb) - demanded it be edited down without Welles' approval. When Welles returned and realized what had happened, he was extremely upset and disowned the film. However, it was nominated for an Oscar, and years later remains one of his most memorable pictures.Welles does not appear but narrates the picture chronicling the lives of the Ambersons, an extremely wealthy family burdened with an arrogant and presumptuous "heir to the throne" of sorts. Joseph Cotten plays the ex-lover of the boy's mother, and when he returns to court her it sparks some tension. It doesn't help much that the Amberson son begins courting Cotten's daughter.Cotten delivers a strong performance but it is Tim Holt who really steals the movie. The performances are all-around strong and the direction is very fitting - you can tell Welles has learned a few things from "Kane." The narration works well (which I hadn't expected - narrations can usually be pretty terrible).This is overall one of the better films of Welles' that I've seen and, although not as "classic" as Kane, it remains an underrated character piece that - despite Welles' claims - actually works really well as is. I find it hard to imagine the extra footage that was cut could have improved it, although I suppose we'll never really know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magnificent Ambersons is a good movie. Orson Welles does a good job directing the movie. The cast is good and leading man Joseph Cotton is also good. But this is far from a great movie. From the audience of 1942 and the present audience, the substance of a great movie is just not there. The audience of 1942 wanted to see Citizen Kane and did not get it. Most of today's audience only know Orson Welles for Kane and maybe Touch of Evil or The Trial. The Magnificent Ambersons is as good a production as Kane or Touch of Evil, but it lacks the drive that Touch of Evil and Kane gave to its audience. Even the Trial kept the audience interested until the final credits rolled onto the screen. Kane was a mystery told with amazing direction and characters. While the Magnificent Ambersons have an interesting cast and story, it lacks the drive that Welles' other films had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is without a doubt better than "Kane." The depth of the characters, the thematic profundity. It is a swan song to an era that was unable to adapt to the quasi-progress of a rapidly-changing world, as germane today as it was in 1919 and 1942. It is a pity the saccharine ending was tacked on, completely destroying the mood and tone of the entire film. God Bless Booth Tarkingotn and Orson Welles for his inventive translation, especially the kitchen scene (unbearable!) and the ballroom scene. Aw what the hell throw in the dinner table scene where the always-underrated Jo Cotton explains the unstoppable path of technology. God, it makes me wanna cry...I gotta go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>read the book instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another major movie disappointment for me. I loved the book on which this movie was based. Even with the most ironic writing I've ever experienced, it is still very moving. The movie captures none of this, in my opinion. It was undoubtedly better when Welles finished in and before the studio butchered it, but I obviously didn't get to see the Welles version. Instead I saw a film that was so poorly edited that I don't think I would have understood most of what was going on if I hadn't read the novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I miss something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I finished watching this film I was flooded with wonder. I wondered; Did I miss something? Did I fall asleep at some point(several some points)? Was I abducted? It felt like at the end of each scene, someone forwarded through the next scene, then pushed play again. Something about this film is lost on me here. If it was "great" then I need to understand more about greatness. I give it 6 of 10 (not 10 from 6; Bad Company).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been so bored by a movie. I didnt feel drawn to any of the characters, especially &lt;i&gt;Georgie&lt;/i&gt;. There was nothing tragic about his downfall since you want him to fail from the start. From start to finish it drags its feet along endlessly. Welles might have done some great things but this is not one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like "Rebecca" without Mrs Danvers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing some of Orson Welles' other films, and what Welles himself said about "The Magnificent Ambersons" and how it was taken from his control and ruined beyond recognition, I can only heartily agree with his point of view.This is one movie that starts out with a Welles setup and dies in a corny mess, something like Hitchcock's "Rebecca" with Mrs. Danvers taken out - Manderley ends up in flames, but just how it got so far must have been too distressing for a test audience.All of Welles film have a strong narrative and ask interesting, often uncomfortable questions. If Welles ever made an apparently stupid, pointless movie, this is the one. Still, the first half is watchable for its props, like the quaint old automobiles. Just forget about the rest.</fullReview>
