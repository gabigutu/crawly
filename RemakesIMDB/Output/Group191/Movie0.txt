		<shortDescription>One Of The Better Adventure Stories Of The '30s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film that's billed as a romance movie, this has got a surprising amount of good suspense and action. It's really an adventure story with a romance angle. It's also very interesting and a good film with decent special effects, at least for when this was made.It's almost a "Count Of Monte Cristo" story with an innocent man imprisoned on an island and finally succeeding in escaping. However, in this story, the escapee "Terangi" (John Hall) also has to battle a hurricane after escaping!The film starts slowly in the first half hour, but stick with it, it's worth it. The story becomes very involving as "Terangi" begins his battle against "the law," which is not pictured very flattering here. In that respect, the film is ahead of its time with its anti-government message. However, it's behind the times with the typical classic-era white man trying to pass himself off as a dark-skinned island native. Dorothy Lamour is likewise as "Marama," Terangi's wife.The cinematography is very good and the direction excellent. Then again, one of the best directors of all time did this film: John Ford. It also has a nice cast. Look at the supporting actors: Mary Astor, Raymond Massey, C. Aubrey Smith, Thomas Mitchell and John Carradine!A solid Golden Age adventure story and one of the best of the 1930s decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hurricane worth waiting for...spectacular in its fury...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JON HALL stars as a hot-tempered native on a fictional South Seas island called Manakoora, run by a strict martinet of a governor, played by RAYMOND MASSEY. After petty theft and a brawl, Hall is hauled into jail and given a strict sentence that separates him from his new wife, a native girl Marama played by DOROTHY LAMOUR.Hall and Lamour are both in their physical prime. Hunky Hall is shown to advantage in the central role in a series of adventurous escapes from prison, climaxed by his authority in leading some of the islanders to safety during the climactic storm. Close-ups magnify Lamour's sultry beauty and handsome Hall is likewise photographed like a Greek God in profile. Ford has directed a film rich in character and settings with some stunning B&amp;W photography.Aside from the leads, good character roles are abundant. RAYMOND MASSEY, MARY ASTOR (as his loyal wife), THOMAS MITCHELL (another one of his drunken doctor roles) and JOHN CARRADINE as a sadistic warden, are all memorable.Escapist entertainment with a South Seas setting and two photogenic co-stars who would both move on to better things in the '40s. But Jon Hall never had a better role than he does here as Terangi, the resourceful man who dives off a steep cliff into the calm waters of an enchanted island paradise during one of his many escapes.As for "the hurricane", it's so realistic that you have to see it to believe it. And all this was before CGI effects--a brilliant job.Alfred Newman's exotic background music is woven around a theme later called "The Moon of Manakoora" and turned into a popular song for Dorothy Lamour to warble. After seeing her in this film, no wonder she became the sarong girl of the '40s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Adventure Still Blows Up A Great Storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Isle of Manakoora in the South Seas is an idyllic place. Swaying palm trees &amp; warm ocean waters enhance the enchantment. The contented population idolize Terangi (Jon Hall), one of their native sons, first mate on an important trading ship &amp; new husband of Marama (Dorothy Lamour), daughter of the Chief. But when Terangi falls foul of the laws on Tahiti, and is cruelly imprisoned there, only the 'wind that blows away the world' -THE HURRICANE - can scour away the injustices heaped upon him.This is one of the great films of the 1930's - pure escapist entertainment. It creates a place that never existed, in this case Manakoora, and makes it seem totally real to the viewer. It's also a superb example of the magic performed by the folks in Hollywood's special effects departments. The storm which climaxes the movie is unsurpassed in its cinematic power &amp; emotion.Lamour &amp; Hall are both excellent in their roles and are totally believable in the tribulations they endure as part of the plot. Lamour was kidded for the rest of her life about the 'sarong parts' she played in, but there was no reason to be ashamed for participation in this classic. As for Hall, (whose mother was Tahitian and whose uncle, James Norman Hall, wrote the story on which THE HURRICANE was based) this was his finest role; he was never to achieve the major stardom he deserved. Suffering from cancer, he died a suicide in 1979 at the age of 66.The rest of the cast is equally topnotch: Raymond Massey, the stiff-necked Governor; Mary Astor, his sympathetic wife; Thomas Mitchell, the island's alcoholic doctor; Al Kikume, the native Chief; Jerome Cowan, a friendly captain; John Carradine, the satanic Tahitian prison warden; and marvelous old Sir C. Aubrey Smith, as the island's wise priest.A couple of small quibbles: Would an island as small as Manakoora really have its own French Governor? And shouldn't this Pacific Ocean tropical storm more accurately be called a typhoon? Hurricanes are generally found in the Atlantic Ocean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Gives a Lot More Than It Promises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The South Seas island of Manikoora is alive with happiness on the day of the wedding of Terangi and Marama. Terangi has his honeymoon cut short, when he has to sail to deliver cargo to Tahiti. Terangi's visit to Tahiti becomes hell when he slugs a man in a barroom brawl and is unjustly sentenced to six months in prison mainly because he as a native islander hit a white man. Terangi repeatedly tries to escape and is caught each time, only to add more years to his sentence. Back on Manikoora, Governor De Laage makes no effort to release Terangi because in his mind Terangi is a law breaker and deserves to be punished, despite the words of his wife, priest, and island doctor to the otherwise. One night Terangi does manage to escape, even though he unknowingly knocks a guard to the ground, killing him. Father Paul rescues Terangi from the sea and arranges to meet Marama and their daughter Tita. When De Laage learns that Terangi is back on the island, he makes a determined effort to apprehend him, not realizing one of the most devastating hurricanes is coming to strike, which may destroy the whole island. A very good movie. I was expecting much footage of hurricane destruction, I didn't realize the plot aspect of the prison, which was a lot more than plot filler. Hall and Lamour were good, even though I enjoyed their movies from the 40's a lot better. Massey gives one of the best performances of his long career as De Laage, as a heartless and sadistic fellow. The special effects are amazing, even by 2004 standards. Beautiful on-location photography as well. Rating, 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, the leads are silly, and there's a great deal of mannered melodrama to endure, but don't overlook this. Academy Award nominations for Thomas Mitchell and Alfred Newman, and a well-deserved Oscar win for Thomas Moulton, the credited sound guy. The 10 minute Hurricane sequence plays entirely without music; just sound effects and scattered dialog, shouted over the wind and waves. You'll forget that the wind is ringing the church bell constantly through the storm, until the church is washed away and the bell sound is suddenly gone. The visual action and stunts are extraordinary and ahead of their time. I show this sequence to my film sound students, and I wish I could get it on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fury of Nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took John Ford another 18 years to get back to the south seas as a film location after his award winning The Hurricane. He had an incomplete trip with Mister Roberts in 1955, but then made it back for Donovan's Reef in 1963. Both The Hurricane and Donovan's Reef deal with racism and have as their settings, French colonial possessions in the south Pacific. Of course Donovan's Reef takes a far more light hearted approach. In both films Ford feels that colonialism is at best a mixed blessing for the native populace.Jon Hall is a happy and content resident of the small island of Manakoora with a new wife. He's a sailor by trade, first mate on a ship captained by Jerome Cowan. While in Tahiti he defends himself in a barroom brawl, but gets sentenced for assault because he struck a white man. An obnoxious lout with political influence. His lot is made worse with repeated attempts to escape adding time on his sentence and all kinds of torture, physical and psychological, by a cruel guard played by John Carradine.Meanwhile back on Manakoora wife Dorothy Lamour gives birth to a child and Hall becomes something of a native folk hero. That's most unsettling to the Governor Raymond Massey. Massey is one uptight dude with a lot of issues. He says he's defending the law, but he knows he's defending the concept of white supremacy and that fact isn't escaping any of his peers including his own wife Mary Astor.Thomas Mitchell got nominated for his performance as a doctor with a bit of a thirst problem on Manakoora. A decent man, he's revolted by a lot of what he sees. As is C. Aubrey Smith the priest. Both Mitchell and Smith take comfort where they can, Mitchell in booze, Smith in his Catholic faith. Mitchell lost to Joseph Schildkraut for Best Supporting Actor, but two years later won with essentially the same role in Stagecoach.The Hurricane won the very first Oscar given out for Special Effects and the hurricane which should have been called a typhoon in that part of the world even today is something to see. You will not forget the fury of nature that destroys C. Aubrey Smith's church. This ain't your Wizard of Oz type storm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic that delivers good characterizations and terrific special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hurricane, John Ford's masterful film of 1937 is rightly remembered as one of the best disaster films of all time. It stands head above shoulders over should such miserable cinematic fare like CBS's ludicrous Category 7: Day of Destruction. For one thing, the hurricane in The Hurricane is not the focus of the story but its climax. Ford spends most of the movies developing the main characters of Terangi and Murama (played by Jon Hall and Dorothy Lamour respective) and their lives on the fictional South Pacific island of Manukura in French Polynesia. John Ford spends his time as any good story teller does in presenting sympathetic and unsympathetic characters (such as Raymond Massey's governor, Eugene De Laage and John Carradine's sadistic warden)and shows the obstacles that face these characters before leading up to the climatic hurricane of the movie title. Such patient work by Ford on his characters pays off in the climax of the movie when the hurricane hits. We, the viewers, care about the death of the people so affected. I found myself riveted by the climax, appalled at the death and destruction, as one should be by any disaster. Unlike Category 7, there is no temptation at all to laugh because Ford ultimately wasn't interested in special effects but in people and their effective characterization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story line of this movie gets a bit fanciful at times, but it doesn't get out of hand and the movie does not pretend to be anything it isn't, so I think most people well enjoy it.There are several fine performances. My favorite is that of Raymond Massey as he is very convincing in the thankless role of a cold-hearted governer who towards the end shows a sadistic side and then, at the very end of the movie, shows that there is good in everybody.Then there is the hurricane itself. Naturally I have not seen every movie ever made, but seeing how this movie predates the computer age the hurricane is surely the greatest special effects in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Effort for the Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reviewing films made so long ago, such as John Ford's "The Hurricane" one MUST take into account the lack of computer graphics, etc., that so dominate today. This film of the late Thirties was an eye-opener in its day, and was rightly highly acclaimed for its power and effects. It even had a good story, and while there were some horrendous examples of overacting by today's standards (Aubrey Smith's final scene in the swamped Church is just one !) I felt overall it was an excellent movie. It set the seal for Dorothy Lamour to be an island maiden for many years to come, while it gave a great launchng pad for Jon Hall who unfortunately for him, never went on with it except mainly in T &amp; A movies for Universal. The cast of Raymond Massey, Mary Astor and Thomas Mitchell (in a most familiar role for him!) all added to the quality of the film - full marks had to go to Ford for such an achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hurricane Sequence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hurricane is a terrific but overlooked film from 1937, often thought of as a tepid "island romance," but in actuality a solid dramatic film (directed by John Ford) with great special effects and music by Alfred Newman.Dorothy Lamour and Jon Hall play the leads, Pacific Islanders who get caught in French provincial law and governance, as applied by strict governor Raymond Massey. Despite sympathetic tendencies of others Hall is convicted of striking a white man and imprisoned in Tahiti-600 miles away. He escapes in time for the "big blow" that seems to his the island in retaliation for the white man's laws.Lamour is quite good as the island beauty, and Hall brings more to his role than the usual "hunk" attitudes and poses. Massey is solid as the taciturn governor who finally sees the light. Mary Astor is good as always as the governor's wife. Thomas Mitchell is the drunken doctor. Jerome Cowan is the ship captain. John Carradine is the sadistic guard. Spencer Charters is the inept judge. Inez Courtney is the girl on the ship. And best of all is the regal C. Aubrey Smith as the island priest.The hurricane is awesome and the special effects among the best of the decade. The scenes of Astor crawling along a rope to find refuge in a tree and windblown Smith playing the organ as the church roof blows away are great. The destruction of the island is totally convincing and becomes almost mythic as a natural force to wipe out man's inhumanity. Great film and very underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of wind and skin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Hall, Dorothy Lamour and an excellent cast are all caught in "The Hurricane," a 1937 film and the first to win a Special Effects Oscar. The original novel was written by Jon Hall's uncle. On the island of Manakoora, Terangi (Hall) and Marama (Lamour) marry amidst a happy celebration, though their happiness will be short-lived. Terangi must deliver cargo to Tahiti, though Marama has a premonition about the trip and warns him not to go. While in Tahiti, he gets into a barroom fight and is sentenced to 6 months in prison. The governor of Manakoora, DeLaage (Raymond Massey), despite the urgings of his friends and his wife (Mary Astor) refuses to ask for Terangi to be brought back to Manakoora and put on parole. Unable to endure a life with no freedom, and desperate to get back home, Terangi continually attempts to escape. Each time he does, 2 years are added to his sentence until he has to serve 16 years. At last, Terangi escapes and makes his way back to his island, where he meets his daughter for the first time. Knowing that DeLaage will capture him and return him to Tahiti, islanders prepare to help the family sail to another island. But a hurricane (actually a typhoon) strikes.Besides those mentioned, "The Hurricane" also stars Thomas Mitchell as the French doctor on Manakoora, C. Aubrey Smith as the local priest, Jerome Cowan as Terangi's captain, and John Carradine as a sadistic prison guard.The effects are astounding and are a no-miss, particularly considering it is 1937! The tremendous winds, the rising waters, the trees falling, buildings collapsing - all magnificent. John Ford did an excellent job of directing this film, which has racism as its underpinning - the prison sentence was the result of a so-called dark man hitting a white man; and DeLaage's patrician and cruel attitude has racism at the base of it. I disagree with one of the comments that states that Hall was a white-skinned movie star trying to pass himself off as a dark man; Hall's mother was Tahitian.Dorothy Lamour, exotic and beautiful, has very little to do in this film except look frightened and lovely - you can count her lines on one hand. Hall, a total hunk if there ever was one, has more to say and do but one is so distracted by his face and physique that it becomes difficult to pay attention to anything else. The acting burden falls to Mitchell, Massey, Astor, Carradine, and Cowan, who are terrific.Ford isn't known for his tales of the sea, but obviously he was good at everything. He wouldn't see water again until the 1950s. Lamour carried on the sarong tradition in better roles, and Hall worked into the mid-'60s; at the age of 65, dying of cancer and in excruciating pain, he shot himself.Highly recommended as a feast of skin and brilliant special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie decades ago as a child and being frightened by the hurricane scenes. I saw the movie again last night on AMC and it was even better than I remembered.The special effects were far better than the computer generated ones of today. Sixty years before the real-life tsunami showed waves leaving villages and towns looking like Hiroshima, John Ford's movie dramatically showed similar results from a major hurricane. Utter devastation.In addition, the story line was excellent. What should be noted is that the movie was based on a book, "The Hurricane", written by Nordhoff and Hall. If their names sound familiar, you may have read their most famous book, "Mutiny on the Bounty". Two authors who certainly knew of the oceans and the South Seas.Wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Injustice in the South Seas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Island of Manukura, a French colony in the South Seas, the joyful Terangi (Jon Hall) is a leader among the natives and the first mate of the Katopua, the tall ship of Captain Nagle (Jerome Cowan). Terangi gets married with Marama (Dorothy Lamour) and sooner he sails to Tahiti. While in a bar playing with other natives, Terangi is offended by an alcoholic racist French and he hits his face, breaking his jaw. Despite the testimony of Captain Nagle, Terangi is sentenced to six months of forced labor since the victim had political connections with the Powers That Be. Captain Nagle asks the Governor Eugene DeLaage (Raymond Massey) to uses his influence to help Terangi, but the governor refuses. Terangi unsuccessfully tries to escape from the prison, and each attempt increases his sentence. Eight years later, he finally escapes and his jailbreak is celebrated in Manukura. Father Paul (C. Aubrey Smith) finds his canoe and brings Terangi hidden to the island. But a devastating hurricane also arrives in the island threatening the dwellers. "The Hurricane" is a tale of injustice in the South Seas that recalls Victor Hugo's Les Misérables. The saga of the sweet Terangi is very similar to the story of Jean Valjean, both characters victims of the injustice of the French criminal system in those years. The sequence of the hurricane is very impressive for a 1947 feature. I can not say that the hurricane was brought in a divine intervention since the despicable governor saves his life in the end and most of the natives die. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Furac?o" ("The Hurricane")</fullReview>

The picture doesn't require any heavy lifting dramatically but Hall is fine in the lead, certainly a dashing protagonist and Dorothy of course looks great in her sarong. It's the supporting cast, a collection of dynamite character actors, that make this memorable. Any movie lucky enough to have Mary Astor, Thomas Mitchell, Jerome Cowan, Raymond Massey and John Carradine contributing their individual presence is worth seeing if only for them but this has good special effects, for the time, and a fun story to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just to respond to ccthemoviemans comment about Jon Hall being another Caucasian actor trying to pass himself off as a dark-skinned native. Although at a quick glance that may seem to be the case, in reality nothing could be further from the truth. My uncle worked with Mr. Hall back in the early 1950's. And having Jon Hall play this part was not really a backwards idea because although his features tended to favor his father, he was actually the son of a Tahitian mother. It's been said that he was descended from Tahitian royalty, as his mother was a Tahitian princess. In the islands he would be referred to as a "Hapa-Haole". A term describing someone who is half Caucasian and half Polynesian or Asian. Also worth noting, is that the movie "Hurricane" was adapted from a book written by Jon Halls uncle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On An Island With You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by John Ford with an extraordinary eye for detail and with tremendous sympathy and sensuality, this picture will be a surprise for those who only know the later Ford films that explore the male worlds of military life on the frontier. In those, Ford seems to take the side of authoritarian severity, as if he had come to agree with the Raymond Massey character of THE HURRICANE, for whom human nature can and should be broken on the wheel of law. But in this earlier film you can feel Ford's deep yearning for the freedom and eroticism of a natural life of the body and the senses.I grew up with THE HURRICANE, which was a staple of TV viewing throughout the '60s and '70s. But seeing it now for the first time in years I am struck by how subversive of convention it must have seemed in the '30s, and how much it was in sync with the cultural and political wars of the late '60s. Terangi, the kind, capable natural man wants merely to live freely and happily, but he is imprisoned and tortured and unwittingly finds himself in opposition to a rule of law that is anti-love, anti-life, anti-human. Every frame of this film sides with Dorothy Lamour and Jon Hall, the gorgeous young lovers, against the hard fanaticism of Massey's governor. Meanwhile the priest, the doctor, the sea captain and the governor's own wife are sensible, kind-hearted (if condescending) humanists who are on the correct side of the debate, but who are helpless in the face of insane obedience to authority.Yes, the hurricane is marvelously done, impressive and absorbing, and it acts as a very necessary catharsis after the anxiety aroused by the many injustices Terangi must endure. But what seems to matter most to Ford is the idyll of sexy young love, not seen in films since the first two pre-code TARZAN pictures from MGM. Once married, the couple are stripped of their western clothes by their friends and returned to their near-naked state wearing sarongs and flower leis. It is Lamour's character who signals to her husband that she is ready for the honeymoon to begin, and the camera follows the happy couple to their private island where they lay in the sand to make love under palm trees. Just as sensual is the morning after, where Lamour raises the shades of their hut, letting the sun fall on her husband's naked back, and her hair falls around him as she leans down to kiss him tenderly on the neck. This must have been a powerful vision of romance and eroticism to workaday, Depression-weary audiences. The island scenes cast a naive spell, like something from Melville's early books of south sea island life. Ford films these like silent screen montages, with dissolving images of swaying palms, bare, tanned legs, the look of young, tawny bodies and shining hair. Rather than just a professional job for him, his work on THE HURRICANE seems deeply felt.Lamour was just right here: Though not yet the wry comic actress she would become, she was rather gravely beautiful in a way unusual for an American star then and now, full of languor and sometimes a startling natural grace. The way Marama suddenly pulls her hair back from her face when first seeing Terangi after eight years is an expressive gesture, full of emotion. Hall was very appealing, with the grace of an athlete and for all his muscularity there is something feline about him. And for those aware of rumors that director Ford may have nursed closeted yearnings all his life (as revealed by Maureen O'Hara in her autobiography of 2005) the fevered way that Hall's body and face are photographed in the midst of his torments will have an added charge and interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Classic That Never Received Its Due</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hurricane is a movie all movie buffs need to see. It's great on so many levels that its minor drawbacks or imperfections are entirely forgivable. First of all, you have one of the best hurricane scenes in any film, ever. This is so realistic, intense and prolonged that, even today, you keep wondering: how did they do this? This is what hurricanes do - to people's lives and to the topography of our world. But then you look at the cast. Jon Hall was just OK yet we have Thomas Mitchell, John Carradine, Mary Astor and Raymond Massey - four movie heavyweights who infuse this with its near-greatness, putting in performances that fans of great acting need to see. These are actors who usually have a supporting role, yet when given the chance, they bring a gravitas and realism that rivets the viewer and draws one into the story such that you're bonded to it...entirely invested in the story's outcome, rooting for the much-maligned good characters to "win" in the end, your emotions going up and down with their fortunes. That's the sign of a really really good film. The story, too, speaks of universal truths and injustices done in the name of imperialistic governments, wrongs done native islanders, laws applied unbendingly and cruelly, and the bitter ends that come of political power struggles - all of this plays out along with the more immediate story, the plight of a young couple with a child, victims of circumstance, struggling to find happiness in a mad political situation that's become of their prior idyllic world. So if you don't pick up on the greater picture or care about it, you still care deeply about the lives of these young lovers and their child - as well as their people, the native islanders (played in some instances by real Polynesians). You have to have patience to get beyond the first few moments in the film, where the writing and the acting (primarily because of Jon Hall) was not as great as the rest of the film, because then brilliance takes over as Hall's role greatly diminishes and the story unfolds in all of its horror and wonder, and you'll be hooked...on the edge of your seat to the end. Finally...there's some redemption at the end. This is key to a great film and it happens. Not easy to pull off - in a way that moves you. Here, it's real, and it affects you, rewards you - even though, as in life, the redemption isn't complete or perfect. Like life, lives are ruined in the process - which is a credit to this film. It scrupulously avoids the hackneyed and sugar coats nothing. Dorothy Lamour...fine actress, beautiful as a saronged islander...has a somewhat limited role, though key because she is the angel that makes us really care about the plight of the young family. Her performance, though spare, is, to her credit, always believable and full of appropriate intense emotion. No shallow beauty here. In sum...this is a must-see film!!!!</fullReview>

But an ill wind begins to blow when Ms. Lamour has a bad dream. In Tahiti, hard-hitting Mr. Hall punches a white man and is thrown in jail. Hall repeatedly attempts to escape. Each time he is re-captured, Hall has two years added to his original six month sentence. He is also severely whipped. As the years are added, escape is the only reasonable option. Hall is incredibly athletic and resourceful. His adventures, directed by John Ford, are good. Even better is the ending hurricane staged by James Basevi.******* The Hurricane (11/5/37) John Ford ~ Jon Hall, Dorothy Lamour, Thomas Mitchell, Raymond Massey</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If they would show this movie for a few days before a hurricane is forecast to hit a given area, there would be far fewer deaths. Perhaps viewing should be mandatory for those who refuse to evacuate. Special effects are far ahead of the times.Acting is par for the 30's, but story line is gripping. How they ever shot the final scenes of the hurricane without killing someone is beyond me. You can actually believe a storm is raging around the people and get drawn into the action. With all of todays hi-tech audio-visual tricks, it would be difficult to make anything more believable. But perhaps someone should try. This one would make a great remake. A 3-D presentation might make it even better. And an IMAX format would almost make it too intense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viva Dorothy Lamour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a picture! If only someone would digitize, remaster and possibly colorize this flick. UCLA Film Archive, are you listening? Jon Hall and Dorothy Lamour put on some great skin beauty candy for the viewers. Both had long natural hair and athletic bodies. And the special effects were before their time. The "wind" plays as a character in the movie. You would be surprised at these special effects, given it was filmed in 1937 without computers! On a different note, I wish all seven of Dorothy Lamour's sarong movies were available on DVD with tons of special features, remastered, of course! Did you know that one of Dorothy Lamour's sarongs is in exhibition at the Smithsonian Museum? I can't wait to read her "My Side of the Road" autobiography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good old fashioned movie about time tested themes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will enjoy this movie more if you believe Jon Hall and Lamour are Polynesians. In fact, these people are John Ford constructs which is why Thomas Mitchell plays the amiable drunken doctor. But this is a John Ford movie about justice, survival, love and more. And if you accept it with a willing sense of disbelief it is a bit of fun. There are the usual stunning Ford visuals which he always seemed to do so effortlessly. He is a master of camera placement. His sailing scenes are perfect. At one point a boat raises and flys a sail called a "mule," on a schooner. You'll never see this again. But mostly it is a movie about which it is easy to take sides. Vicious, racist colonial Europeans versus the simple people of the islands. And in the end nature asserts her judgment over all the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Disaster Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was one of the first disaster epics that I can remember. However, unlike many of the films that came out in the years that followed this film at least has a great story and didn't become a soap opera like many other films of the genre. This was also established Dorothy Lamour's image as an exotic South Sea island beauty (even though she was born in New Orleans). This film is also a great commentary on colinization and how any country can wind up treating the natives as less than human. This truly is an underrated classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch Nordoff and Hall adventure film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine film based on the novel by Charles Nordoff and James Norman Hall from Samuel Goldwyn in 1937 and directed by John Ford. The hurricane scenes alone were outstanding. I'm told they used up almost the entire water supply from Los Angeles to make this happen on their backlot. The filming of the sequences of wind and water were magnificent. Even compared to today's standards. The performances were very close to the book itself. The island of Manakoora was a small and beautiful island of Polynesian natives in the south Pacific, ruled by a go-by-the-book governor, played splendidly by Raymond Massey. There is a wedding of the chief's daughter, Marama, played by the alluring and sarong-clad Dorothy Lamour, to the island's popular hero Terangi, played by a handsome youthful Jon Hall [related to the author James Norman Hall]. Mary Astor plays Massey's wife who is sympathetic to the lovers, who are wronged by a political injustice to Terangi, while in Tahiti. Terangi escapes the prison and heads back to his wife, Marama, only to be followed by Massey who believes only in justice and the law. Thomas Mitchell gives another rip roaring performance as the drunken doctor of the island, along with C. Aubrey Smith as the Father of the Mission and Jerome Cowan as Captain Nagle. With the attempt to capture Terangi, the hurricane hits the small island and all the natives run for cover. However, most of them are wiped out by the storm and the island becomes a sand belt that the doctor explains "happened to have had the misfortune to be born in the path of a hurricane belt". Nice touch is that Frank Loesser, known later for score to "Guys And Dolls" and "Most Happy Fellow" wrote a tune that was used as the theme of the film and became a popular tune of the time. The name of the song is "The Moon of Manakoora". All in all a delightful adventurous and romantic film of it's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From my brief introduction of the film at the Library Of Congress in 2012.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many believe tonight's director John Ford was one of the best. He's the only director ever to win four Academy Awards. John Ford directed over 160 films, he learned his craft starting in silent photoplays making westerns and moving smoothly into sound films of nearly every genre. Ford won his first Best Director Oscar for THE INFORMER an Irish drama in 1935. That same year he also made THE WHOLE TOWN'S TALKING an Edward G. Robinson gangster comedy and STEAMBOAT ROUND THE BEND a Will Rogers comedy. In 1936 Ford made the powerful THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND a Civil War era drama. Later in 1939 Ford started hitting them out of the park directing such classic must-see-films as STAGECOACH, YOUNG MR. LINCOLN, in 1940 THE GRAPES OF WRATH, and in 1941 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, and later others. Just before making HURRICANE Ford directed Shirley Temple in WEE WILLIE WINKIE a family adventure film. The screenwriter for tonight's film was Ford's favorite, Dudley Nichols who had collaborated with him on 16 titles. Uncredited was Ben Hecht known as the script doctor who producer Sam Goldwyn brought in.As for the cast Jerome Cowan as Captain Nagle using John Ford's own yacht in the film, Cowan you may recognize from THE MALTESE FALCON as Bogart's partner that gets killed in the beginning.John Carradine a master at evil characters plays Warden. My favorite performance of his is as the preacher in GRAPES OF WRATH. Thomas Mitchell who plays the Doctor was Scarlett's father in GONE WITH THE WIND was Oscar nominated for tonight's film and won the Academy Award for STAGECOACH playing a drunk doctor.C. Aubrey Smith that great English character actor with the giant nose plays the priest Father Paul.Mary Astor another silent film star most famous today for being the femme fetal in THE MALTESE FALCON and the same year as THE HURRICANE appeared as the woman everybody's fighting over in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA. Astor plays the wife of Governor Raymond Massey.Raymond Massey was also in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA. Just a year before Massey made the Sci-Fi classic THINGS TO COME and three years later would be Oscar nominated as the lead in ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS.Finally I have worked my way thru our ensemble to our young leads, both early in their career.Handsome, athletic leading man Jon Hall was the son of an actor and a real life Tahitian princess. In fact his uncle co wrote the book that tonight's film is based on. As you may have read in the slide show he changed his name twice before becoming Jon Hall and it took tonight's film HURRICANE for him to become a star, but it also type cast him in adventure films for the rest of his career.Dorothy Lamour's road to fame started when she was named Miss New Orleans in 1931, Dorothy Lamour worked as a Chicago elevator operator; band vocalist for her first husband, band leader Herbie Kaye; and radio performer. In 1936 she donned her soon-to-be-famous sarong for her debut at Paramount, THE JUNGLE PRINCESS, and continued to play female Tarzan-Crusoe-Gauguin-girls in parts through the war years and beyond. The most famous of these was in the popular Bob Hope/Bing Crosby "ROAD" pictures ? those a strange combination of adventure, slapstick, ad-libs and Hollywood inside jokes. Of these she said, "I was the happiest and highest-paid straight woman in the business." Among her serious films were JOHNNY APOLLO and A MEDAL FOR BENNY.As for the plot, opps I see I'm out of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Force Majeure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Basevi's special effects are very good for the period and hold up well today. During the climactic storm, director John Ford told his photographer to keep the cameras running "in case somebody's sarong blows off or something." There must have been many out-takes involving disappearing sarongs because the wind machines and water tanks were working overtime.John Hall is Terangi, happy first mate of both a cargo-carrying sailboat and of Dorothy Lamour. In fact all the natives on the island of Manakura are happy. So are the white folks who more or less run the place -- Raymond Massey as Inspector Javert, I mean Governor DeLaage, his wife Mary Astor, C. Aubrey Smith as the priest, and Thomas Mitchell as a drunken doctor, a role he must have found comfortable. On a visit to Tahiti, six hundred miles away, Terangi is insulted and slapped by a racist white man and impulsively hits back, breaking the man's jaw. This nets him six months in jail, despite the efforts of his captain, Jerome Cowan, to have him pardoned.John Hall, however, isn't used to confinement. No "native" is, explains Cowan to the governor. And he's right about that. Hall's repeated attempts to escape cost him more time until it all totals up to sixteen impossible years, before Hall finally makes a successful escape and return to Manakura and his wife and child.Governor Massey is not a cold fish. He loves his wife, enjoys the company of his friends, and wants to be liked by his subjects. But he's adamant about upholding the law. When he learns that Hall has returned to Manakura he turns the place upside down looking for him.At that point the eponymous storm strikes and destroys the island, leaving only a handful of survivors including Massey, Astor, Cowan, Mitchell, Hall, and Lamour. The latter sail off into the sunset with their daughter in a small canoe. Massey spots them but, having undergone a conversion to compassion during the hurricane, he pretends he sees nothing but a floating log.It's an interesting movie, if a very sad one, and raises questions about what might be called "slippage" in following bureaucratic rules. Can there be no exceptions at all, as Massey argues? In World War Two, one of my professors was a company commander who received orders to set up a machine gun before an expected enemy attack. The field of fire covered nothing but the face of a cliff, from which no attack could possibly come. He pointed this out to his superior officer, who replied that, yes, it was true, the map was wrong, the position was untenable in the case of an attack and everyone in the company might be killed. But that's what you have to do because it says so right here in the orders.Got a bit derailed there, for a moment, but universalism is the central issue of the movie. It's what moves the entire plot along. The increasing tension and the final resolution depend on the conflict Massey experiences between the letter of the law and its spirit.The climactic hurricane aside, I have to subtract some points for acting and make up. The acting resembles that in silent movies. John Hall is handsome and has expressive features with big bright sorrowful eyes but he overuses everything. That's partly Ford's fault. Dorothy Lamour, pretty much ditto. And, man, she can't handle a Polynesian accent. As far as that goes, one native near the beginning speaks Samoan and later some others speak Tahitian. It's a minor point because Polynesian languages are closely related. If it's "aloha" in Hawaiian, it's "talofa" in Samoan and "tarofa" in Tahitian. But among all the extras, they could apparently find only one woman to do the traditional Tahitian dance called "tamure", and no skilled men at all.Again, that's all carping. Less minor are stereotypical shots of the priest with his arms upraised to heaven while a choir sings and the walls of the church cave in and kill everyone. Ford, a sentimental and religious populist during this era, didn't waste any time on subtlety. Everyone is good, everyone is right -- except the unyielding governor. Oh, and John Carradine, who plays a sadistic guard in the prison at Tahiti. The natives are thoroughly stereotyped. They celebrate Hall's return by getting drunk, doing dirty dances, and allowing men to sling women over their shoulders and rush off into the jungle. Ha ha.The story is shot in a straightforward fashion. Unlike Terangi, we're never at sea. The fine, evocative score -- overused by today's standards -- is by Alfred Newman. And the climax is slam-bang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's 1937 film is remarkable on several counts. Most obviously, the climactic scenes when the hurricane hits the South Sea island is stunning, sustained, and imaginative...way ahead of its time on special effects that mostly look extremely realistic...and done the hard way -- without computers! Second, an underlying theme here that is expressed subtly through the telling of the story, rather than by preaching, is the difference between morality and law...not a simple topic. John Ford made about 140 films, this is certainly in his top 20.The basic story line is that a Polynesian (unfortunately, Jon Hall) is imprisoned for a fight with a white man in a bar. It begins with a not-too-unreasonable sentence, but over more transgressions balloons to 16 years, and that's where it becomes unjust. It's a morality play, however, and the climax of the film, where many are punished is the hurricane. The film begins with a passenger ship sailing by a bleak, deserted island. Thomas Mitchell, who plays the island's doctor, tells the story of the once tropical paradise to a fellow traveler. Regrettably, although Mitchell is excellent as the doctor, he is a heavy drinker at various times throughout the film...almost a cliché for him.It's the colonial era in the South Seas, and Jon Hall is first mate on a local schooner. He plays Terangi. Now, it's not that he's bad (in terms of acting) in this film. It's that he looks so darned White to be playing a Tahitian that it's distracting and appears to be typical studio miscasting of minorities. Ironically, Hall's mother was really Tahitian and his uncle wrote the book on which the film was based! Terangi marries Marama, Dorothy Lamour in her 7th film. She's just right for the part, looks Tahitian, and is quite captivating in this film. She plays the daughter of the island's chief.On a ship's journey to Tahiti, Terangi gets into a fight with a racist colonial type, and the governor sentences him to 6 months in jail. The governor is not being unfair, but rather following the law. On Terangi's home island, the new governor there -- Raymond Massey -- is not an evil man, but he is obsessed with the letter of the law. Through his harshness he relentlessly condemns Terangi, making his job as governor tenuous since the local population turns against him. It's an interesting part for Massey, because while he seems so unfair in his job, you also see him as an adoring husband who does have a change of philosophy at the very end of the film.The island Catholic priest -- C. Aubrey Smith -- is sympathetic to the island's people and customs, so this is an interesting role for him. He is very relaxed here, doesn't come across as the typical Puritanical priest in the third world, and has some great visual scenes in the film.Mary Astor's role is also a bit atypical of her. She often plays very "hard" characters, but here she is the wife of the governor (Massey), and manages to come off as very sympathetic in her ability to adjust to island mores and still be supportive of her husband.Terangi repeatedly tries to escape, thus his increasingly long sentence, and here's where the evil comes into the film -- the gleefully harsh jailer (John Carradine). After 8 years, Terangi does escape, but kills a guard in doing so. He steals a canoe and manages the grueling journey to his home island (although his killing of shark in a swarm of the vicious animals seems a little far fetched to me). Terangi is rescued by Father Paul and a Tahitian boy, who keep the situation secret from the governor. He is reunited with his wife and their daughter, whom he has never seen before. Massey attempts to hunt him down on a schooner, but that's when the hurricane strikes. Heavenly retribution? Well, not really because a lot of innocents die, and the governor (and his wife) survive.There's hardly a dull moment here, the acting is top notch, and the story is timeless. This is one for you DVD shelf!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Potboiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This silly but fun potboiler looks at life on a Polynesian island before a hurricane. The main attraction here is the climactic hurricane sequence, which is quite impressive for its time. What precedes it is rather melodramatic. Hall's many attempts to escape from prison are ridiculously implemented. As with other Ford films of the period, it's visually opulent but the acting is overdone. Massey and Mitchell seem to have a competition going to see who can be more hammy. At least they are actors who have shown themselves to be good performers in other films. The same can't be said of Hall. Like Johnny Weismuller, the hunky actor looks great but can't act his way out of a loincloth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great John Ford Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford directed many great classic films over the years, however, this film was outstanding with great special effects for a 1937 film. All the actors were great film veterans of the silver screen, who contributed a great deal of their great talent during the 30's 40's and 50's.; Dorothy Lamour,(Marama) "Man Handled", was very young and extremely sexy on an island with Jon Hall, (Terangie),"The Invisible Man's Revenger" who was very handsome and the two of them created a very warm romance through out the entire film. Raymond Massey,(Gov. Eugene DeLaage), "Abe Lincoln in Illinois",' hated poor Terangie for murdering a man and wanted to keep him in prison for the rest of his natural life. Thomas Mitchell,(Dr. Kersaint),"Gone With the Wind", was a doctor who liked to drink and was still able to deliver a baby in a horrible Hurrican. John Carradine,(Warden),"House of Frankenstein", was the warden of a prison and an extremely hateful person who was good friends with Gov. Eugene DeLaage. There is a great fight scene with a shark between Jon Hall (Terangie) and Jaws which was very dramatic. This entire film is a great masterpiece from 1937.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Needs CGI?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hurricane, The (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Excellent John Ford film has the director pretty much making three movies in one but his wonderful direction keeps everything in line and in the end delivers a nice little gem. Tarangi (John Hall), recently married to his one love (Dorothy Lamour), sets sail for Tahiti where he ends up getting into a fight after a man slaps him and uses a racial slur. The politics of hitting a white man gets him thrown into prison where a sadistic guard (John Carradine) is constantly abusing him. Tarangi finally is able to escape but once home he has no time to rest as a large hurricane is about to wreck his island. As I said earlier, this is about three different movies as we get the typical love story, a great prison drama and then the disaster film, which was clearly on a high as movie crowds had just gotten SAN FRANCISCO. This time out the special effects are certainly the highlight but there's still a lot of other great stuff here. Hall does a wonderful job in the lead role even if it was a tad bit hard believing him as a native. He is incredibly strong in his role as is Lamour who looks downright beautiful here. The two have wonderful chemistry together and one can't help but hope they can survive their ordeal. Carradine has a minor role but he once again shines in it. Mary Astor, C. Aubrey Smith, the Oscar nominated Thomas Mitchell and Raymond Massey all deliver fine supporting performances. The final fifteen-minutes feature the $250,000 special effects, which are downright haunting, tense and jaw dropping. The way this small island is torn apart by the wind and water makes for one of the most memorable scenes in film history and one can't help but feel as if they are going through a real storm. There are a lot of underline beliefs thrown out, most dealing with religion, and they are perfectly brought to life by the director. Just take a look at the scene where everyone takes shelter in the church, which slowly starts to break apart. This is certainly another classic film, which proves you don't need CGI and I doubt anything made today could look half as good as this. Those impressed with the storm here might also want to seek out Griffith's ONE EXCITING NIGHT. A pretty bad movie but there's a storm at the end, which is just as impressive as the one here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LES MISERABLES set in the South Seas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie that earns an 8 due to the amazing (though a bit overlong) ending. Without the technically brilliant ending, I'd give the film a 6 or 7.The movie is about a small fictional French-controlled island near Tahiti. Everything seems happy and idyllic until one of the main characters justifiably protects himself from attack in a bar when visiting Tahiti (the film never mentioned WHICH island this was--just calling it "Tahiti"). However, the French legal system seems totally indifferent and unjust and sentences this native to six months in jail. And, not unexpectedly from a "child of nature", he goes almost crazy and tries to escape again and again--and increases his six month sentence to over 16 years!!! This is almost exactly like what occurred in LES MISERABLES, where poor Jean Valjean steals a loaf of bread and after trying to escape is sentenced to spend most of his life in prison--just for a crust of bread! And, like Victor Hugo's classic, there is a parallel to the character Inspector Javert--a man whose obsession with the technicalities of the law but not justice makes him almost inhuman. Interestingly, however, in this film, there are actually several characters reminiscent of Javert--not just the governor (Raymond Massey).In the role of the native couple are Dorothy Lamour (who is beautiful and looks like a real native) and Jon Hall (who is beautiful and looks too much like a European to be believable as the native prisoner). However, Hall did an excellent job with the role, though I must admit that Lamour was given little to do other than to pout, swim and kiss Hall.Overall, this re-working of LES MISERABLES was very competently done and interesting. John Ford and the rest did a good job. However, the hurricane scene at the end was the true star of the film. How did they ever get it to look so realistic?!FYI--This movie was made in 1937. I seriously doubt if it would have been made in the same form just a few years later, as it makes the French government look very, very bad. During the war years or especially just after WWII, Hollywood tried very hard to portray the French in a sympathetic (such as CROSS OF LORAINE) or somewhat sympathetic light (such as in CASABLANCA).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling film stands the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1937 film, when watched today is as exciting as if it was made yesterday. The plot of the film is this: a very handsome native, played by Jon Hall is arrested while in Tahiti for punching a white man and breaking his jaw. Hall is sentenced to 6 months in jail, but continually tries to escape, thereby increasing his time in jail to 16 years. His reason for wanting to escape is to get back to his home island, to his beautiful, pregnant wife, played by Dorothy Lamour. The kindly priest on the island, C. Aubrey Smith, and Thomas Mitchell both want the islands Governor, played by a nasty Raymond Massey, to grant Hall a pardon.The film is very tastefully done, and even though the film was made after the Hays code went into effect, the film is still quite sensual, beautiful shots of Lamour and Hall, some risqué shots showing just their legs, and in several scenes it looks as though both at one time or another are swimming around naked.The highlight of the film is the final 20 or so minutes when a massive Hurricane (though in the South Seas this would be known as a Typhoon) approaches the island. The scenes of destruction, are quite frankly very realistic, and had me on the edge of my seat.Mary Astor must get special recognition in this role. She plays the sympathetic wife of Raymond Massey in this film, which was filmed shortly after a very highly publicised divorce case between Astor and her husband, Dr. Franklin Thorpe. Astor had been having an affair with married playwright George S. Kaufmann, and had kept the details well documented in her diary. When her husband found out the details of this, he filed for divorce, and custody of their young daughter. The diary was included as evidence in the press, and lets just say the press had a field day printing some of the more x-rated excerpts of the diary.Portions of the film were filmed on location in Tahiti, and the film does the islands justice showing the natives and the beautiful scenery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing special effects and a decent story but...quite a bit of over-acting and some poor casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another one of those films from an A+ Director that's just not one of his best unfortunately.A Pacific Island is home to some peaceful natives. One is a Captain on a ship and has been promoted rapidly up the ranks. He gets married before he goes on his next trip to Tahiti then sets off. In Tahiti he gets into a fight and breaks the jaw of a local important official with connections. He has done nothing wrong but defend himself but he gets 6 months in jail anyhow. They tell him to hold out and it'll be over soon but he can't wait to get back to his wife and proceeds to repeatedly escape and get recaptured. The last time he tries and succeeds but kills a guard accidentally. Throughout all this he has to deal with a sadistic guard who eventually becomes the warden and repeatedly taunts him. The Governor of his home island is not swayed by his innocence from because the law must be upheld regardless. When he finally arrives home, at the same time, a hurricane arrives.The whole story is really about choosing what's right and wrong with the justice system. The Hurricane is only in the last part of the film...and the best part. John Carradine plays his usual scumbag self as the prison guard without a conscience. I do believe he was the original bad guy in film as he has played those roles since he's been in films. Looking at him you know he's no good but that was his niche so he was typecast with it....effectively I might add. The over-acting comes in the form of Raymond Massey. It's just ridiculous to see him play this holier than thou island Governor who plainly sees the injustice happening and he just keeps his mantra going..."the law must be upheld". It's really a theater type of acting that makes it really corny to watch. If you've ever seen John Barrymore act in film then you'll know what I mean. His type of acting performed by Raymond Massey was not needed. The miscasting came in the way of Jon Hall. Wow what a terrible actor. He is easily one of the best looking male actors in history but if you notice his screen credits after this film, you'll notice they're all B grade stuff. Why you say? Simple...he was a terrible actor. I have never seen him in anything other than this but it's plain to see why he never succeeded in major roles. He needed some serious acting lessons.The real reason to see this film is last 15 to 20 minutes. The special effects in this are stunning. I have never seen a film about a Hurricane more effective than this. You will feel absolute terror for these people in the end. You will find it hard to believe how realistic these effects are. Even by today's standards it's a 10 on the wow factor.See this one for the special effects..and maybe to take a notch out of your John Ford film catalog. Other than that it's nothing special imo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a remote island Tarangi (Jon Hall) marries Marama (Dorothy Lamour). But, while away in Tahiti on a job, he strikes a white man who insults him. He is instantly jailed--it's forbidden for a native man to strike a white man. Nasty Gov Eugene De Laage (Raymond Massey) won't help him. He keeps trying to escape and that keeps extending his prison sentence. Will he ever get out and be reunited with Marama?This film deals fairly realistically with racism (it's against it of course) but this is hardly a message movie. It's a big, silly but enjoyable piece of escapism. It looks great, there's a beautiful score and plenty of attractive shirtless men and women in sarongs. The script is merely serviceable but it does work--I admit to getting misty-eyed once or twice! John Ford directed this very well.Jon Hall is very handsome, nicely toned...and very bland as the lead. Lamour isn't much better. But their good looks (and bodies) make them pleasant to look at. Massey is just OK; John Carradine is fun as an evil warden; Thomas Mitchell is good (and Oscar-nominated) as a doctor and even Mary Astor has a few good moments.But the climatic hurricane sequence at the end really sells this. It has still impressive special effects and goes on for a good 15 minutes! No music here--just the sound of the wind howling and the waters crashing (this won a well-deserved Oscar for Sound Effects). It's worth sitting through the movie for this one part.So not a great movie but a big, fun popcorn movie. If only the leads had been better actors...I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unequaled Hurricane Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always try to catch this movie when it shows up on TV, usually TCM. Leonard Maltin calls the hurricane scenes unequaled and he's right. Quite impressive even by today's standards.Well, I guess I need to continue with this review. I didn't meet the quota on lines.I would agree with the assessment above that Lamour and John Hall are in their prime physically. Impressive that they got top billing despite the appearance of Raymond Massey, Mary Astor, Carradine, and Thomas Mitchell. Of course, John Ford, the director went on to even more successful action movies, and won numerous awards. As many know, he teamed with John Wayne for a number of award winning westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy romantics, but what a realistic and terrifying climax!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever thought that TWISTER brought you the first "really" realistic cinematic storm images, update your library: For a movie which is over 60 years old, THE HURRICANE is one hats-off piece of first-rate romantic action fare!As apparently always in tales of the South Seas, the characters are quite stereotypical: the lovers who would die for each other, the mean and cold-hearted governor, the priest with a heart of gold... But this is, at its heart, a bittersweet and deeply moral tale, so I won't nag too much. For the truly breathtaking hurricane finale, John Ford must have gathered each and every wind machine in Hollywood - it easily holds up to today's F/X standards and IS realistic and frightening. Wow! Alfred Newman's music score adds considerably to the atmosphere, using a female wordless choir to maximum dramatic effect. But I really do wonder how it ever passed the Hays Office: scenes of sizzling desire and anticipation, a naked foot gently stroking the lover's naked legs in the sand...All in all, a lasting and highly enjoyable piece of movie entertainment - a true classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hidden Ford gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of John Ford's best films. It's a pretty straightforward adventure, but with a great script and exceptional direction. A young man of the islands (John Hall), the first mate of a ship, marries his childhood sweetheart (Dorothy Lamour). A few days later, the man sails away to Tahiti. When a white man orders him and his friends to vacate a table, Hall punches him, which lands him in jail for six months. Unwilling to be trapped away from his wife, friends, and home for so long, he attempts escape after escape from prison, and each time he fails and ends up with several more years tacked onto his sentence. Meanwhile, on his home island, the French governor (Raymond Massey), is repeatedly asked to repeal the unjust sentence. Although not a bad man, his style of governing is strict. Soon Hall does make his escape, and Massey is on the lookout for him. Also in choice roles are Thomas Mitchell as the island doctor (also a drunk, predicting his role in Stagecoach; he gives an exceptional performance and won the film's only Oscar nomination), Mary Astor as Massey's wife, C. Aubrey Smith as the priest (his second exceptional performance in a Ford film in 1937), Jerome Cowan as Hall's captain, and John Carradine as the prison warden. The native actors are also very good, especially Al Kikume as the chief of the island and Hall's father. And, satisfying my curiosity over whether Ford had seen and was inspired by Murnau's and Flaherty's Tabu (1931), Reri, who was the lead actress in that film, has a bit part here. I didn't recognize her, however. And then there's the titular storm. Though it often gets compared to the disaster epics of the 1970s, it's far more believable, and also far more tasteful. Disaster films use death and destruction to entertain, with nary a care for the fictional human beings who are dying. This storm is devastating, both physically and emotionally. The scene with Thomas Mitchell right after the storm is heartbreaking. The film moves with a perfect story arc, starting with a romantic island paradise, moving into the frustration of imprisonment, and then into the danger of the storm. It also deals with French colonialism somewhat critically. The other Ford film of the same year has to do with British colonialism in India, but it's not so harsh. The film depicts the government being unnaturally hard on the islanders. The supporting cast is absolutely perfect (although, as she gives such a wonderful performance, I was wishing Mary Astor had a little more to do). John Hall and Dorothy Malone have excellent screen presence. Hall is quite good himself. He never achieved much success in his career. Malone is probably the weakest part of the film. She doesn't deliver her lines very well. The two are to seem as islanders, of course, and, while Hall accomplishes it pretty well, Malone doesn't. Fortunately, she's barely in the film. She was the draw, of course, but it was her sexiness, not her acting (Hall's sexy, as well, or, er, um, I'm only guessing [wink]). There is a scene near the beginning where, after they are married in a Christian ceremony, the other islanders strip off their clothes for their own (this predicts Ford's multiculturistic celebration in his later island film, Donovan's Reef). The more films I see from this period of Ford's career, the more I think it was the strongest, or at least most consistently strong, part of his career. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Expose on "White Privilege" in Global Colonialization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Director Jon Hall gave the audience a glimpse of how the French dominated the locals in this island paradise with imposition of very unjust legal punishment for misdemeanors. In one instance, a white patron in an island bar ordered Terengi, who sat there first, to get up an move "when a white man tells him". Terengi, believing he was an "equal" stood his ground, "Golden Gloved" this white patron and and knocked him out cold. The patron was hospitalized. Terengi was charged with assault and imprisoned for 6 months with hard labor, despite his captain's plea to the island governor to have Terengi's sentence commuted. One can infer a "what if" and say...."if this had been a white man", would his sentence been commuted? Or another scenario, "what if a white man or (woman) had have assaulted an islander? One can wager a slap in the wrist, if that, would have been in order. Overall, an entertaining and romantic sea island adventure from an an islander's (even if it's white Hollywood actors painted like islanders) point of view. (smiling)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a hurricane,the storm in your eyes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the directors who made or are making or will make a disaster movie should have(have had) a look at "The hurricane" .Not only the special effects are very impressive today but the characters involved are also made of flesh and blood.This is one of the strongest Ford movies in the thirties it's fordian to the core:Home or coming home is the main subject of many a movie of this auteur ("the searchers " which many look upon as his masterpiece is nothing but this:coming home,and the main character's tragedy -see the last sequence-is that he's got no home).Not only home but also the lost paradise theme :as the old native says ,before the white came ,there was no such injustices.The law has two faces here ,and does not mean a thing for Terangi,who was born to be free:the scene where he 's watching the sea,behind a barbed wire ,is admirable.The first one is French Delaage ,who is kin to Victor Hugo's Javert in "les misérables" For him ,only duty counts and no matter if he destroys life in his wake.The second ,verging on sadism ,is the warden.But ,above them all,Ford introduces the marvelous Father Paul ,whose divine law transcends everything.And in spite of the destruction of the church,his message survives and is finally the winner.The island ,the sea,in a nutshell,the nature is another force which literally drives Terangi and his longing for freedom is so intense it's impossible not to side with him.Yes he's like a hurricane,the storm in his eyes,as Neil Young would sing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly romance, but one of the best action scenes ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The romance is laughable, and having Caucasian actors playing the two main islanders was not only inappropriate, but also confusing at times. However, the action throughout is good, and that 10+ minute finale is something to behold. It easily stands up to modern action sequences, and has a real feel of danger to it. I have never seen actors placed in such genuinely treacherous positions. Perhaps it was safer on the set than it appears, but I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much swallow as spatial effect on ocean board nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Hurricane" (1937) directed by John Ford is something like a lightening on a dark sky nowhere in South Pacific and it seems that the location was almost imposed by an adaptation, where the director during the shootings was for the most time laconic in his own direction's style of the time. In another words, showing the strength of the Earth above an island, cutting the edges of this reaction edited by the impact of the huge swallows waving against it : as a blind giant coming again and again, smashing the cliffs on the ground with its water mills, in a black and white picture of as almost science off fiction ; as though, poetry of nature it was instantly translated by such features of deaf intriguing machination, without any control by the smallest of the human beings present there. But out of such an attractive and storming leisure for the movie goers from yesterday as till tomorrow, as did a catastrophe movie as this one in Samoa, that is still of course a lesson of perfect conception of a tiny community, completely transformed in waste, by what we know now as atmospheric intervention. The most of the time during this fiction the reality of images and sound were enough to secure the viewer, astonished with the skill manner of Ford and his team, controlling the march of events as it was a realistic view of a hurricane as monster of the nature nearby. Who cares about the local population ? The priest in his church where are the inhabitants, that took the good way for searching a refuge, well placed for staying alive during the storm, it reveals that is the better place in the island as if it was the house of God the true antidote against the untempered sin of the natural turmoil. But this symbolism it has also in this movie only a partial effect within the mind of the viewers not exactly for preaching faith, but because its colonial architecture which it seems is strong enough to support such event, before the eyes and ears of the survivors. So that, such thing occurs when incapacity of human beings for another solution is at stake, for the enormous responsibility securing children, old people and domestic animals, all protecting a subsistence for a way of living in this kind of territories, lost on the ocean and at its mercy.The story works well and a little boy lies, when someone asked him where he and his mate were before, and he tells that he was fishing. If this tale in 1937 it works only as a movie for youngsters, savages and sailors from the end of the world, it was perhaps the reason why Ford was also so laconic during the rehearsal before the camera. When such a mechanical artifact for making special effects it was for him maybe the more important of the movie, likewise at the time of construction of dams elsewhere. Why such a reverse of desert on the soul of mankind ? There is the sensation that the director was concerned with the idea of the beginning of the world, by the sense of drowning and submerging land. Too by the inaccuracy of destiny with such an episodic natural event, from the bottom of the cracked undersea on the shores of an island, in the middle of the ocean surface. Like also imagining it with fair play, for a tale about escaping from there sound and saved for another human adventure of discovery and conquest, in affirmation of solitariness of soul and flesh, like the prisoner escaping on the boat viewing nothing in contrary in such a stormy environment watching himself such an opportunity and apparently without the need of any help.</fullReview>
