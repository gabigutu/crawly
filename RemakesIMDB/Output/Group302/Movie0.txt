		<shortDescription>The Three Godfathers (1916) - Lost ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of you will recognize this films synopsis, as it was re-made several times, evening starring John Wayne. I cannot find any information that this 1916 adaptation from the novel, The Three Godfathers by Peter Bernard Kyne, starring Harry Carey still survives. The Library of Congress lists it as No holdings located in archives. For now all I can offer the reader is this brief synopsis and hopefully this silent western does survive.Ruby Merrill ( Stella Razeto ), an employee of an orange packing factory, suffers a breakdown because of stress. Emerging from the hospital penniless and friendless, she travels West and becomes a dance hall hostess. She meets Bob ( Harry Carey ), a cowpoke, and they fall in love, but his past as a horse thief catches up with him when three fellow convicts come to town. Bob is persuaded to become an accomplice when the trio robs the Wells Fargo Bank. After a gun battle with the sheriff, the three survivors escape into the Mojave Desert, where they assist a dying woman in childbirth and become "godfathers" to the baby. The three thieves sacrifice their own needs for the baby's, and, after much hardship, only Bob and the baby make it to town. When Bob and the sheriff return to the desert to recover the robbery money, the sheriff discovers a family bible and realizes that the dead woman was his sister. He then forgives Bob for the robbery and gives him and Ruby a portion of the reward money for saving the life of his nephew.</fullReview>
