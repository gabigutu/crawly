		<shortDescription>Are you afraid?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seen when I was very young, this "made for TV" movie became the vehicle which drove all my fears. These fears, once irrational, were validated one unforgettable night. Before that night, during bedtime, it was only instinct that asked my mom to leave the hall light on. After seeing this movie, I had a reason, an image, and the creepiest soundtrack to plead with her not to turn it off again! This movie plays right into those dark corners of legend. Why we don't just reach under the bed without looking first. Why, as we lay awake, closet doors need to be constantly observed... just in case! I was eight years old, and truly ripe for the scare of my life!The movie begins with a cats meow and haunting music. The score of this movie is absolutely penetrating and perfect. This is not an overstatement. I can think of very few I would call it's equal. This music accompanies Sally (Kim Darby from True Grit) as she unwittingly, and unknowingly, sets free demons from a bricked up fireplace. They set about, slipping through the dark corners (and there's plenty of them), searching to get Sally's soul. As frightening events start to mount up, and with no support from her workaholic husband, Sally begins to doubt her sanity.Darby has a quiet demeanor that lends itself to her rising panic. When the "creatures" do finally appear, they seem to have come straight from a casting call from hell. That...or a jar of raisins. The ending is absolutely unforgettable. "Dark" made quite an impact for it's time.I am now 40. Don't like to have ANY lights on when I sleep. Can watch this film, or any other horror flick without strategically placing a body part to obscure the view. However, a few slight noises.....a scratch or a whisper, and my defenses still go up. The blanket is always on the ready. All because of a few film makers decided to take "TV movies" seriously. I thank them....I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old School Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid I watched television every day until I was absolutely saturated with popular culture. Although I was an athletic youth, I ran home each day after school to catch the afternoon movie on Detroit's ABC affiliate on Channel 7. I have never forgotten seeing the film Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, about a young couple who move into the large rambling home once owned by the woman's grandmother. Something sinister once lurked the basement, but had been sealed within the fireplace by bricks stacked four deep -- the door giving onto the ash bin had been bolted shut. Evil subdued.However, the first thing that happens when the young couple take over the house, is the wife wants to turn this grungy dank room into her home office. And she just has to have that damned fireplace cleared out and working. An aged handy man warns her against "meddling with things you don't understand," but she doesn't heed him.Remember, there would be no such thing as horror movies if there weren't stupid people.Sally, the wife, managed to undo the bolt on the ash bin door. That's all the evil needs to be unleashed through the house in the form of tiny raisin-headed ghouls who look like Smurfs gone bad.The movie hit me like a piledriver when I was eight years old. It scared the absolute shite out of me. Last night I borrowed this film from a friend, seeking to demystify it. I'm just after watching the film for the first time in twenty five years, and I have to say that this cheesy little horror knock-off still does the job. I don't think it'll keep me up tonight as it had when I was a kid, but the story's simplicity, particularly its makeshift special effects, came off quite effectively.I've never seen the film on the shelf in a video shop. But if you do come across and are looking for a nostalgic thrill, I think Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is what you're looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when I was 8 years old, and whenever someone asks me what the scariest movie I've ever seen is, I tell them about this one, but nobody seems to know what I'm talking about! I'm so glad to see that I'm not the only one who saw it and was creeped out! Another movie from those days that had the same effect was "Trilogy of Terror," when Karen Black gets a Zuni fetish doll in the mail and it comes to life and chases her around her apartment---both these movies had a profound effect on how I looked at staircases and other places where little creepy things could be hiding. I'm looking forward to the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things that go bump in the night can be very scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll always remember when the first advertisement for this movie was shown. It was on the old ABC Wednesday Movie of the Week (1973) and came right after the flick for that week ended with the announcer saying "Next on the ABC Wednesday movie of the Week". A clip of William Demarest telling Kim Darby "Some things are better off left alone" then a few other quick clips concluding with the announcer saying "Don't be Afraid of the Dark" as a lit Flashlight in pitch blackness is snatched up by something which the viewer is given only an eyeblink glimpse of. WOW! It was definitely worth the week long wait. This was hands down the scariest Things that go bump in the night made for TV movie ever! Throughout the years it's amazing how many people I've met have seen and remember this movie. Sometimes all it takes is to say "Did you ever see the movie with the guy who played Uncle Charlie from My Three Sons" and they'll immediately say "DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK."!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't miss this flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unbelievably creepy. Is this movie on DVD or video anywhere? I haven't been able to get it out of my mind since seeing it in the 70's. Totally 70's gritty cool horror film. We'll probably never see horror made like this again. Especially when dopey heiresses are playing leads in current horror films. Movies, especially horror, have sucked since the early eighties. The film brings you back to a time when people didn't need spit shined, glossy Hollywood film style to be scared. Budgets were limited, so this movie makes do with lighting, shadows, eerie music, and mood. So again, shut out the lights, curl up under a warm blanket, and try not to be afraid of the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that was fun to be scared by</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a sadistically weird movie this was! Have you ever thought you saw something out of the corner of your eye, but when you looked directly at it, it wasn't there? Of course, it was in the shadows, so if it really WERE there, you wouldn't know for sure, would you? That's what this movie is about. Small, dangerous things in the shadows. Of course, they couldn't harm you directly... while you were alert... but they sure could mess you up if, say... they strung a rope across the stairs or did something to you in your sleep.The theme of this movie is, "Did I really see it?" And of course, we know Kim Darby really did, but it was too late when she finally knew forsure.As a t.v. movie, it was okay - production, setting, acting, special effects and make-up... but the idea of things... lurking... waiting... made your hair stand up and want to exit the room along with the rest of your body.And what the heck WERE those things, anyway? They lived in the furnace... or BELOW the furnace - we know that for sure. But were they demons? Goblins? Aliens? And was one of them Kim Darby's grandfather? We never know the answer to this. All we know is they're nasty spiteful little things that want to make you one of them. And, I guess, that was the spookiest part of the story - it never let you know the answer. Just made you wonder what sort of ickies could be lurking below YOUR furnace! The spookiest moment is when Kim ticks one of them off and it makes the nastiest face. You really don't want to tick one of these little creepy-crawlers off.I watched this movie-of-the-week alone at night really late while I was home by myself. Even though I was well into my teens at the time, I was totally weirded out.The moral of the story, I guess, is that if you don't want evil miniature creatures to drag your wife off to the nether-regions below your furnace, don't be a workaholic and ignore her when she says she's seeing strange nasties in the corners or the room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Scary When I Saw it as a Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I also saw this movie as a kid and was haunted by it for a long while. I still remember being scared of the little creatures. There was another somewhat similar TV movie called Trilogy of Terror (just found the titles of both of these movies on the web out of curiosity) with Karen Black where she was haunted by a little voodoo like creature with a spear that also really got me good. As far as the effect a scary movie had on me at the time I saw it, this was by far the scariest movie I have seen in my life. I don't know if it would have much an effect on me now or not but it certainly did then.I'm guessing it is not available on DVD or video.</fullReview>

As it turns out, the young couple aren't the only ones living in the house, there are scary demons living in the basement. This movie is great! You just scream sequel.

		<shortDescription>Unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those little films that lends itself to legendary status, because it is almost impossible to see nowadays. With a great deal of effort and patience, one can find a copy....but it sure isn't easy. So many of us remember seeing it when it aired...I was all but six or seven and remembered only these gnome-like creatures. Recently I was able to see it again....and started to remember a lot more of it. The film is pretty atmospheric as it chronicles the slow then fast menacing of Sally Farnham by pint-sized demons with conical shaped heads. Sally and her husband recently moved into this large house and forsaking the advice of carpenter William Demarest, Sally opens a fireplace which had been sealed over twenty-five years ago. These creatures lived in the fireplace and now they want Sally...to join them. Kim Darby does a good job playing Sally as she slowly descends into madness...as well as other destinations. Forget all the talk about it being only good for a television movie...this is a good movie period. It has loads of atmosphere and suspense, albeit a bit shallow in the area of plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple and Effective Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sally Farnham (Kim Darby) and her husband Alex Farnham (Jim Hutton) move to an old mansion that belonged to Sally's grandmother and they hire an interior designer and the carpenter Mr. Harris (William Demarest) to redecorate the manor. Sally opens a locked door in the house and finds a sealed fireplace and ash pit. She asks Mr. Harris to open the fireplace but the old man argues with her and refuses to follow the order. Sally uses Mr. Harris' wrench to remove the bolts of the ash pit cover. Sooner Sally finds that evil little creatures that fear the light have escaped from the underground through the ash pit and are threatening her. However, Alex and her friend Joan Kahn (Barbara Anderson) believe that Sally's imagination is affected by the words of Mr. Harris."Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is a simple and effective horror film made for television released in Brazil only on VHS. The story of a young couple that moves to an old house and the wife Kim Darby, the unforgettable Miri of "Star Trek" and the girl Mattie Ross of "True Grit", releases demon-like creatures is original and developed in an adequate pace.In 2010, Guillermo del Toro remade this film with a lame screenplay that included silly sub-plots and spoiled the original story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Criaturas da Noite" ("Creatures of the Night")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sally, we want you, we want you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times in a horror fans youth that a certain film will leave an impression that will be carried forward for ever more. In my case one such film is Don't Be Afraid of the Dark. A cheaply made for TV picture starring Kim Darby, Jim Hutton and William Demarest. The plot on the surface is standard. Alex and Sally Farnham inherit a big old mansion from their deceased grandmother, it has a basement den room with a bricked up fireplace. Sally wants to unblock the fireplace but is advised that it should be left as it is by the family handyman Mr Harris. Naturally Sally goes ahead and has the fire opened up, and pretty soon she starts to hear voices and see what she thinks is little men in her midst..Don't Be Afraid of the Dark terrified me as a child because it played on one of my basic fears, a fear that is shared by many an impressionable child. That of something being under the bed at night time, or in the cupboard, and yes, in the walls behind the fireplace. Of course now as an adult revisiting the film it has lost the power to truly terrify me. But not once since that time as a child have I not cast a nervous smile in the direction of all the open fireplaces I've come across over the years. This is something I think one should always remember when revisiting such films from your youth, the impact back then is what's important. Now to me the film is a nostalgic trip that still retains the power to prick up those goose-bumps, and with each goose bump comes back memories of believing there was such a thing as little troll like demons out to get us. It's a cracking little chiller is this, the cast give it their all {particularly Darby} and while the effects and production are evidently low, it still carries a charm that 70s TV movies seem to carry for those that blossomed during it. Very much a cult film over the years, horror fan pressure has led to it finally getting a DVD release in August 2009. All those fans are just like me, they remembered the night that Don't Be Afraid of the Dark actually meant that we "would" be afraid of the dark. First time viewers to it now are unlikely to get much, if anything, from it. But don't mock or be scornful towards us, for we was there, and we carried with us that first chill for ever more. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Most Memorable ABC Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One reason ABC plays such a key part in my childhood memories is because we were a captive audience, in a sense. My family and I moved to Sag Harbor in 1971 - a then unknown town on eastern Long Island. Cable was in its infancy back then, and if you didn't have it, well there was ABC, the only network that came in clear as a bell. CBS and NBC were always snowy or fuzzy. So, I remember a lot of ABC programming, whether it was 'Movie of the Week', 'The After School Special', and the many prime time dramas and sitcoms that aired on the network - even those which were short-lived. And even before we moved from the city, I had memories of racing home from parochial school to catch 'Dark Shadows'.The house in Sag Harbor had a real fireplace, not one of those gas jobs like the house we had in our old neighborhood of Springfield Gardens. Well, the allure of a real log fire wore off quickly when I saw 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' at the age of 12. I didn't go near our fireplace for about a week afterwards! It creeped me out that much. In spite of the movies disappointing ending, it's still good for what it is: one of ABC's best forays into the supernatural.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, interesting little t.v. horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so interested in this movie that, after watching it again after many years, I decided to contact the writer, Nigel McKeand; I not only got a chance to talk with this excellent person, he also filled in many 'blanks'. The story was written fairly quickly, for 'Lorimar'-ABC, and involves Kim Darby as Sally, dour but believable housewife that moves into the house her Grandfather lived, along with her upwardly-mobile exec hubby Hutton. (you may remember him playing 'Ellery Queen'). After opening a clean-out grate that reveals a pit behind a bricked-in fireplace, three small, demonic creatures begin terrifying her; nobody believes her, of course, and the creatures have special plans for her....namely making her one of them. The last 15 minutes of the movie are pretty creepy, which involve a drugged Sally being roped and dragged down....THERE. We never find out what these creatures are, where they come from, or why they want Sally, and there is a good reason for that. Nigel McKean stated that there was simply no time for exposition because the script had to be short...he never had or developed a real background. He used what scared him....voices whispering in the dark, dark pits, (Nigel got the idea of the clean-out pit from a real one that was in the rear of a Spanish house he was living in, the clean-out pit was so dark and spooky nobody wanted to clean it out), He is also constantly amazed at the amount of people who still remember this film, owing to the fact it received bad reviews. He recently confirmed the rights were sold to a not named 3rd party, and yes, looks like a remake. He also stated his only disappointment was that the creatures were too 'lumbering', and his script described them as quicker and thinner. He said that several people call him every year and mention this film. Nigel McKeand also played on the t.v. show "Voyage to the bottom of the Sea" as the sonar-man, and wrote many of the 'Waltons' episodes. Watch this with the lights out, andDon't Be Afraid of the DARK....!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ironic title for this creepy chiller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a housewife moves into her grandparents old house, she opens up a sealed basement fireplace only to discover that sinister dwarf creatures dwell within it.This made-for-TV horror film from the early 70's is a pretty good late night watch. Its story is cleverly unique and has a truly chilling, almost Gothic atmosphere to it. The brooding plot remains intriguing throughout as it ultimately builds to a terrifically spooky conclusion. The creature effects are nicely done and quite memorable. The music score by Billy Goldenberg is quite eerie and perfect for the films dark atmosphere. Best of all though is the cast. Kim Darby does a fine performance as the understandably nervous housewife, Jim Hutton is good as her husband, and Barbara Anderson does a nice turn as Darby's concerned friend.Definitely one of the most memorable TV horror films out there, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is an enjoyable oddity for horror fans. Currently the film is set to be remade as a feature film by acclaimed director Guillermo Del Toro. It must have made an impression upon him as well.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messed with my mind as a kid - and it still holds up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I couldn't get enough horror movies, and yet, as much as I look back fondly at all the Hammer Studios' vampire and werewolf films, no two more seriously creeped me out than Don't be Afraid of the Dark and Trilogy of Terror (the Zuni doll episode in particular). These two films were the engines that drove millions of childhood nightmares amok during the mid 70s. I just had the amazing luck to catch this film on a cable channel - a rarity considering how little this film circulates. Know what? It still holds up to this day. No doubt you've read the synopsis of the story from other reviews, so I won't waste my time repeating it here. Suffice to say that whereas the producer and director "could" be accused of ripping a page from the cheese ball movie Robot Monster by dressing the little demons in gorilla suits with cheap rubber ghoul masks, this film is redeemed by it's atmosphere and what it doesn't show. It carefully doles out the story, giving only fleeting glimpses of the demon creatures at first, gradually showing more and more until the payoff. The movie taps into the most primal of fears - that of being left alone, in the dark, at the mercy of the unknown - and does it ever so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, creepy, and terribly scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was but a lad, my friends and I used to sit up and watch those Friday and Saturday late night horror flicks (i.e., gargoyles, tarantula, etc.). They were kinda scary for us, but nothing serious. Oh, once in while I would get the feeling that a 20-foot spider was peeking in the windows at me, but I could still get to sleep without problem. (I confess that a couple of times I used the life-saving blanket snorkel to allow me to completely cover up with my blanket. We all know monsters can't get through cotton blankets.) This movie seriously freaked me out. For three weeks I could not even turn off the light and woke with terrifying nightmares. It was simply the most mind altering thing I had seen . . . and never wanted to see it again. (We watched all the other movies four or five times each).Why? Now I am a psychologist and have finally recovered from the ordeal created by this movie. I sorta get it. It plays on the exact fear all kids have. It islike a little piece of evidence of what we all thought was really going on (or at least feared it.) We had those basement steps that have planks, but no backs. You know the kind - the kind that makes you fear that a monster is hidden underneath and its hand will reach out and grab your ankle when you go down at night to put something in the laundry (Oh, Mom. Can't it wait until tomorrow!) If there was a movie that had your own house and your own ankle and your own stairs and that furry, creepy hand from under the stairs - it could not be scarier than this movie.Now the graphics look dated and the acting is not all that great. But it still can get to that core fear in many of us.Parents: Pay attention before letting younger viewers see this. I know this was a TV movie, but that is still a bit shocking. My parents had not seen it, but thought it would be okay for me to see, since it was on TV. I probably should not have seen it as a child, but I survived and I eventually got my eyes to close again.Now as an adult, very little frightens me. I can walk at night in the forest without as much as a shiver - but as I decide to purchase this flick, I still wonder if I want it in the house all the time. It might be like having those creepy little monsters boxed up in the video cabinet. That cabinet does not have a lock.By the way I cannot comment on the transfer quality - because I have still not bought it. I have heard it is fine. Maybe someday I'll be able to tell you. Maybe not.New comment: My young son only heard me read some comments to my wife (because we were thinking about getting our own copy). That's all. Last night he woke with a screaming nightmare. If I wasn't a scientist, I'd say that was a powerful kind of creepy. He did not even see the movie - I won't let that happen at least until he is a teenager.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you are in your early 40's or late 30's and remember the 1970's as the golden age of film and television, then you will remember this movie. It seemed back then (the 70's) that most of the made for T.V. movies were based on the occult or had suspense elements. Someone needs to write a definitive guide to the made for T.V. films of the seventies. Back when the movie of the week was somewhat of an event because there were only a few channels available. Did cable kill the made for T.V. movie? Yes, I believe it did. As a side note, does anyone have any info on a made for TV in which some old guy is looking through his cupboards and finds some weird thing in a jar? The action seems to take place on a farm, and the old guy is extremely distressed. Any input would be greatly appreciated</fullReview>

Ha, ha, getting scared by midgets with potato-heads? Awww, where is your blankie then? Pathetic. Everything is crap with this film, and I sincerely hope more nay-sayers will come along to bring a healthy counter-weight to the rating it currently has received.

		<shortDescription>For an 8 yr old this is as creepy as it gets!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie on TV when I was 8 and it scared the @#$! out of me. The plot seems familiar but has a disturbing twist. Woman inherits creepy old mansion and finds it to be haunted, unlucky for her there are no ghosts here but rather sinister looking demons which she unwittingly sets free. I have not seen this movie for at least 30 years but remember it very well. This movie is not for children as it plays to every child's fear: something under the bed-in the closet-dark corners. This movie, to its credit, also leaves behind more questions than answers. What are the creatures, Demons, goblins or something else? Where did they come from + how the hell do you get rid of them? The film only reveals that they can't stand light and seem to be able to appear and disappear at will-except from the furnace which is both brick and metal. The demons also seem to be tethered to the house-no explanation. Demons seems most appropriate since they seem to enjoy tormenting the heroine psychologically 1st before they attempt to do physical harm! Take the sinister looking antagonists + add an unorthodox ending + you have an excellent horror film. The remake should be interesting, but if it gets the typical modern horror makeover-CGI + over explaining every minute detail-lack of appropriate atmosphere + it won't measure up. One of the creepiest horror flicks ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i can only cast my 10/10 vote based on my experience as a teenager... this film has always stood out in my mind as one of the creepiest and far reaching films to date.. to this day i always make sure i have torches prepped and ready around the house...this film definitely GAVE me a fear of the dark... i don't know if the remake will measure up, and that could be because i'm middleaged now and practically numb to many modern horrors.i also remember the trilogy of terror, zuni doll around about the same era. vividly remember my older brother teasing me about my obvious fear, and how he would "dropkick that little **** to pieces" luckily he didn't get to witness me watching the much worse DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK. that would have given him much 'torment' ammunition.i'd always remembered the womans name as susan, but i see it was sally... the ending is so frustrating, stupid old fashioned flash bulbs.. why with todays economical led lights, things could have been so different....also must mention the useless husband who failed her, because he thought she was just an hysterical woman with a vivid imagination. i've never seen this film since then, must be late 70's.. i think i'll look it up.. it was a very worthy horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was and is one of my favorite "scaries" of all time. It was so spooky when I saw it as a teen. I think it is one of many scary classics of the 70's when a lot of movies touched on the topics of the supernatural, parapsychology, ESP, and the like. This movie has suspense and still gives me goose bumps after 35 years. Those ABC "Movie of the Week" shows were great. I still remember a lot of the titles; Daughter of the Mind, When Michael Calls, Trilogy of Terror, Crowhaven Farm, The Night Stalker..I could go on and on. This movie can be found on line at "only classic movies". I can't wait to get my copy. You can also view the entire movie in 8 episodes on YouTube.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the other writer who viewed this film as a child. I was eleven-years-old the first time I watched it and it messed me up for the next ten years - literally. When I was living on my own at 21 years of age, I would still check under my bed, half expecting to see those prune faced little demons. I am curious what effect this film would have on me now that I am an old, brave, forty five-year-old fire fighter. I think it could still make me afraid of the dark. Does anyone know how I could get a copy of this thing? I have been trying to find it for years. I would like to give my two young sons, ages 5 and 11 nightmares for the next decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scared me away from scary movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can trace my hatred of scary movies...it's a love-hate, really, in which I RARELY watch scary movies, but love good ones like "The Grudge" when I do watch them...trace my terror and shock that movies could create such a reaction in me back to this one movie, "Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark." I came home from middle school one afternoon to find my brother watching it, glued to the TV. He told me to sit a watch a minute, but I wanted to go outside to play. I sat for a minute on the coffee table, and sat longer, and stayed until I was so freaked out about having my legs hanging down off the table that I moved to the couch. I found myself checking behind me on the couch and hating my brother for drawing me into it. I stayed through the ending, and was totally freaked out. I went to play, and tried to work it out of my system, but to no avail.Later that night, and a month later, my brother could whisper, "Peter, we want you," and I would either freak out checking closets and below my bed before sleeping, feel like screaming, or punch my brother. Now it's over 20 years later and he can still pull my chain by saying the quote from the movie.Granted, seeing it now might not have the same effect. Seeing it at a young age, however, and it has a lasting power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it aired on ABC. I was very young and it really put the hook in me. I haven't forgotten it since and it gave me many, many bad nights. I recently bought the DVD and I hope to see it soon to: 1. See if it is still as scary as I remember 2. Face my personal demon and hopefully exorcise it for good (did the same thing with The Exorcist) 3. End my recent disappointments and finally watch something that is really scary again.Without a doubt, the most disturbing part of the entire movie and the one which has haunted me for 30 years, is the whispering over &amp; over of "Sally...Saallyy....Sssaaallyyy..." My only hope is that this film isn't like others I've seen as a kid and then watched again as an adult, only to hear myself saying, "This crap actually scared me once?" But, no other movie affected me like this, except for the Grand Daddy of them all, The Exorcist. THAT sucker still freaks me out and probably always will.My only beef is the title. Was it tongue in cheek?Someone who does quality work (Speilberg, Howard?) should feast on this and do a remake for the modern times and the next generation. I can't believe no one has attempted to do it yet, but I'd hate to see someone do this film an injustice and make a stinker.Just a note...PLEASE don't let anyone under the age of 13 or someone who is easily disturbed watch this.</fullReview>

Her desperate attempts to fend them off with the flash of a camera. Brrrr...there are those chills again!

		<shortDescription>Another emotionally scarred 30-something over "SALLY"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled upon these "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" postings and was absolutely delighted! I laughed like crazy at some of the commentary here! Like so many others here, my 2 brothers and my little sister and I were kids when we saw this. For the longest time we forgot the title, and just called the movie "SALLY!" This is definitely a phenomenon limited to that generation of kids who were glued to TV in the 1970s. We're all in our mid 30's now, and it's still a running joke. All one of us has to do is call on the phone, or leave a voice message saying in a hushed whisper, "SALLY!" and it's enough for peels of laughter! This movie was indeed creepy, and scared the crap out of us, but was funny at the same time -- funny because the "Sally" routine was one that we pulled off time and time again through the years...hiding behind doors, hiding in a dark closet, etc. Watching my little sister scream as she jumped almost into the ceiling whenever we did it was worth it every time! As kids, we spent hours debating why those spooky little bastards hauled ass whenever Sally took a picture and the flashbulb went off. A favorite scene is when Sally drops her napkin - -I think -- and one of those buggers is under the table! In my view, the only other time my siblings and I were more scared was when my brother and I intrepidly stayed up until 2:30 AM one night to see "Phantasm" on HBO. Great memories! SALLY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing to think how really frightening a non-gory, non-profane, no-nudity, no axes in the head made-for-TV movie can be. In the age before we became so desensitized to violence that it takes something like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 to get a raised eyebrow, the folks that made TV movies really made some doozies. This jewel, and "Something Evil" were huge presences in my childhood, and I am not going to give the plot away, but if you can get a copy of this buy one.Kim Darby did a really good job as the woman pursued by the playful little darlings that come up from the basement, and is very convincing in the part. The other fine performance is the old gentleman who plays the caretaker of the house - he played Grampa on "My Three Sons", and to my shame I can't remember his name, but he's a fine character actor who really makes his part stand out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this seems to be a real phenomenon! like so many others, i saw don't be afraid of the dark as a young kid in the seventies and it stayed with me ever since. i didn't realize it had such cult status. VERY interesting that everyone who seems to comment on it saw it originally as a child - this is a pretty big impact for such a little movie. we are not allowed, as moviegoers today, to the joys of subtlety in a horror movie. the fear is manipulated out of us with obvious 'here is the knife, now the camera pans in for the gore' progression. so the real pleasure of a movie like DBAOTD is that it brings out all the irrational, inexplicable fears of childhood... and then leaves you to your own devices. i also liked this movie for the atmosphere, and sense of helplessness and dread. i would love to see this on dvd, or at least on one of the specialty cable channels for a weekend horror marathon. what a trip! check out 'the changeling', 'don't look now' and 'let's scare jessica to death' for other creepy 70's gems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sad to say that I did NOT see this movie growing up, although I can't imagine now how I could've missed it, given that I am an avid follower of horror telefilms. My friend Jim in Los Angeles kept raving about this movie and finally found a copy of it, so we watched it with friends. Yes, it's a product of its time (1973) and the special effects and dialogue are a bit goofy by today's standards, but it is definitely creepy and atmospheric. And I KNOW that, had I seen it as a child, I would've been severely traumatized. What the 1970s lacked in terms of cinematography and production values, the decade more than made up for in terms of imagination. Now that the movie is allegedly being remade, I shudder to think what the CGI and effects-crazy Hollywood executives are going to do with the source material. The remake will be a horrible trainwreck of a film, no doubt. For those of you who haven't seen the original, track it down somehow, at a specialty video store or online (eBay is a good place to start). It's well worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most terrifying movie I have ever seen. You will never forget it if you see it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will never forget this film, if you see it. Never.I, like the 5,000 other users commenting here, was about 7 the first time I saw this back in the 70's and experienced what seems to be the same collective, generational trauma over this film. Nothing to that point, and nothing ever since, has scared me as badly as this film. In fact, I would say it scarred me for life. I slept with a light on until I was 13 or 14 years old because of this film, and that's no joke. I would consistently check in my closets and under my bed every night before I would go to sleep. And I dreaded hearing those whispering voices, "Sally...".I'm not sure what deep, psychological, trauma, or what subconcious fear, this film taps into, but it is about as deep and primal as it gets.The film is decently acted, the husband is a bit of a drip. The premise is absurd at times (why won't anyone believe her?). But this was the early 70's where women were treated as "excitable" and the husband in films and T.V. movies always had to "calm the little wife down". But the plot takes this to absurd lengths, and then at a crucial moment (the end) the husband leaves, and everyone who's supposed to be caring for the wife leaves. It's all a bit unbelievable (sort of like the, "don't open the door" cliche, everyone in the movie does exactly what they shouldn't, to maddening extremes).But the little demon things (we always called them the "little potato head people") were terrifying beyond words. I still, as an adult, occasionally think about this film when I get in the shower. My cousin watched this with me when it first aired, and to this day, with both of us in our late 30's, we still talk about this movie every now and again. It's a running joke with us. All one of us has to do is whisper in that creepy voice, "Sally...Sally we want you...", and one or the other of us will immediately yell, "Shut the he!! up, man! Don't bring that up!".If you see the movie these days, it looks a little cheap, as you can see the zipper in the "demons" costumes - but surprisingly, the film holds up better than you'd expect. The creature's voices will never leave your memory, and the whole film has an unearthly, creepy mood about it that I've never experienced in any other horror film. Not ever.I found a copy on E-Bay recently and its in good shape. Just hearing those demons whispers again nearly made me crawl out of my skin. I was surprised at how well the film still held up, flaws and all, and how I felt that same, almost irrational terror, as I did when I was 7.If you ever get a chance to see this film, see it. But be warned that if you're at all impressionable or imaginative, it will scare the living bejeezus out of you and scar you for the rest of your life.</fullReview>

I should hope that it dredges up the same fear that it did back then. The first segment in "Black Sabbath" still does that for me. I know there are dubbed copies for sale on e-bay, but they always go for a lot of money. I found a "real" video copy at a store one time for $150 but they would not rent it.

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, My Ass, Be Very afraid, Very, Very Afraid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the scariest made-for-tv movies that I had ever seen. I was 13 years-old when this first aired. Like other commenters here, I have never forgotten it. It was on ABC movie of the Week and it was very creepy for TV. The story was tight and well done as was the acting. I could never figure out what exactly William Demarest's character knew or didn't know in relation to who and or what inhabited the fireplace. That said, it is minor complaint.Either way this movie exudes a creepy atmosphere that feeds on our fear of the dark. It makes you wonder if there isn't really something hiding in the dark after all. This ranks up there with other great made-for-TV movies like the Night Stalker, Crowhaven Farm, and others. Now only the cable channels put out movies like this. ABC was at the top of its game with this one. This movie is hard to find. It took me using Buy It Now on ebay to finally get a copy. That is how much I like this movie. You can't help feel for Kim Darby's character in the movie because she thinks she is seeing things and possibly going mad and her smart husband doesn't believe in anything let, alone what she has told him what she has seen or experienced. If you can find it, rent or buy it. It is classic TV movie from the 70's at its best. I hear tell they are doing a remake of this movie due out in 2003, which should be real interesting to say the least. Get yourself some popcorn, turn out the lights and be very afraid of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark. It's a lot of creepy fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the other comments posted here, this film has an almost legendary status. After some doing, I was able to track it down for myself and I was a little surprised by what I saw.For a TV horror film, this was very well done and creepy. Kim Darby does well with her role as Sally, a housewife tormented by a trio of imps that she releases from their lair inside of the bricked-up fireplace in the brooding mansion she has just moved into. The weird creatures, who speak English (albeit deliriously), seem to want to turn Sally into one of them, and of course nobody will believe her.I really got into the strange atmosphere of the house. Sally and her husband don't really turn on a lot of the lights (which is good because the creatures don't like it anyway), and there is a strange layout of rooms and staircases that give the place a creepy feel, even without the little demons. The creatures are supposed to be really small, and the special effects are somewhat laughable at times with full-sized actors playing the imps on oversized sets, but the idea is bizarre enough that I didn't really care. It made me laugh, but it was also kind of spooky.What did bother me about the movie is the extreme foolishness that the characters exhibit, especially Sally. Here is a woman who knows there are three tiny demons out to do her in, and yet she stays in the house where they can get her. Furthermore, there is a handyman who knows that something dreadful is in the fireplace, and although it would be much simpler for him to just tell Sally this, he insists on bludgeoning her with vague statements about things that are "better off left alone"...as if THAT would stop anybody. Near the film's climax, where Sally's husband finally manages to coax the promise of an explanation out of him over the phone, he insists that the husband drive all the way across town to discuss it in person, therefore leaving Sally with one less person to guard her. If I recall, he never really did explain anything either, even though he saw the demons with his own eyes. Sally's husband is a real jerk, acting like she's crazy and yelling at her when she freaks out during a dinner party (which is one of the movie's best segments). Sally's best friend, Joan, isn't much help either--although she comes to believe the house is inhabited by murderous imps, she too is content to stay put instead of just getting into the car and driving Sally away.It was this kind of annoying ineffectiveness that raised my blood pressure in "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane", where the whole problem would have been solved if Joan Crawford would have been able to summon up the nerve to just scream "My sister is crazy and she's trying to kill me!!" Likewise, Sally could have avoided the grasp of the imps if she had just said to her husband something like "I don't care if you believe me or not" and left the damn house.Other than that, "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is a lot of fun. There's a real atmosphere of dread here, and like one other reviewer noted, it remains consistent even when the film is taking place in daylight. The idea is unique, and I think it's probably this original premise that makes the movie so memorable to everyone.Those last few moments of the movie are pretty creepy, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many of the people commenting here on "Don't be Afraid of the Dark", I remember watching this TV film many years ago as a kid being left with some creepy memories.Before I say anything else, if there is anyone is out there reading this who can make this happen - please, please release this film on DVD! Some commentary and/or features such as ABC promos would be absolutely priceless. Just look at all the bids for this film on online auctions. A lot of people want to see this. Please.Last year I was able to obtain a VHS copy of Don't be Afraid of the Dark. I was struck by how this film was still able to spook me, especially the ending.Granted the film is somewhat dated. The clothing worn by the actors is early 70'a horror fashion show in itself. And Sally's husband really seems like a self-centered jerk for the most part. But the film still scares. No, it's chilling, is perhaps a better term.I think it succeeds so well because it doesn't reveal too much too soon. You don't really get a good look at the creatures tormenting Sally (Kim Darby) until near the end of the film and they are really freaky looking in a very believable way. They look exactly the way you would imagine some creatures living in the basement of your house would look like.It also plays on the basic, primal fears of monsters living under your bed or in your closet. What would they do if they catch you? Don't Be Afraid of the Dark doesn't quite answer that but the question itself is chilling enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was watching this with two friends, and wasn't paying as much attention as I wanted to, but I still saw enough to say it definitely was pretty creepy. Especially for a TV movie. Sally and Alex Farnham inherit a huge mansion from Sally's grandparents. The repairman, who stops by a lot, make them aware of the fact that the chimney has been blocked up, and doesn't really explain why. Well, Sally needs to know, and pries it open. Thus, she frees three little monsters that go creeping around the house, terrorizing her to no end. They pull her napkin off her lap during dinner, pull on her dress, knock things onto the floor, and even try to kill her. Alex is sure she's losing it, and her neighbor Joan tries her best to help out. As Sally driven further and further to the edge by these little buggers, it becomes evident of their motive, going back to a secret of the house.The movie is creepy. Not the scariest thing I've ever even, but had some genuinely good scares. Granted, it is a TV-movie, and you can't deny that, but it's impressive. The ending is unexpected, and the final scene of the camera looking at the house from a bit far away, and the little monsters' whispering continuing on and on has a nice effect. From what everyone else here seems to say, it looks like this is a pretty highly-acclaimed little movie. Hopefully, it will be released on video soon for everyone to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For twenty years or so I thought I must have been crazy, or at least perhaps the only person who remembers this movie! I was in the third grade, eight years old, when it was on the ABC Wednesday Night Movie in the fall of 1973, and it scared the bejeebies out of me! "Sally ... Sally ... Sally ..." -- god, the very memory of it sends chills up and down my spine!I haven't been able to purchase a copy of this film, although I have found it available for rental at a couple of local outlets. A few moments in the movie amuse me (though perhaps I'm looking for amusement to avoid giving in to terror *nervous grin*): mainly, why is it that if Sally is so nervous about being in the house with the unseen but very-much-sensed creatures, SHE DOESN'T TURN ON THE DARNED LIGHTS??? *lol* I suppose that would spoil the title, but if I had been her I'd have given Con Edison a run for its money.I'm sure that sophisticates, hardened by all the splatterfests that have emerged in the horror genre since 1973, would find this movie ridiculously tame. However, I think something has been lost along the way -- horror doesn't have to mean buckets of blood and gore. It can be found in something as simple as a quaint old mansion with a mysterious history, one that even the best efforts of an imaginative decorator can't successfully obscure.It isn't "Halloween" or "Psycho," but neither is it "Plan 9 From Outer Space." *grin*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ABC made a bunch of supernatural made for television movies in the 1970's and this one is, by far, the best of the bunch. What makes this film so spooky is that at no time do we ever feel comfortable in the house. Not in the dark, not in the middle of the day, not even when the house is filled with guests (and don't even THINK about taking a shower). There's no comfort zone as with most supernatural thrillers or horror films. Waiting for the light of day just gives one a false sense of security.Spooky, spooky stuff. Let's hope this one makes it to video. I, for one, will buy a copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basements are _still_ extra scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie in over 30 years, but I still remember it every time I have to go down stairs into a dark room.I was at least 11 when I saw this movie. My mother and I moved into a house that had a basement when I was 12. A basement with open stairs that you had to go all the way down and into the room to turn on the light. And guess where the washer and dryer were? Also the freezer and various other ordinary things that meant I had to go into the basement almost daily.The worst part wasn't going down into the basement, it was coming back up out of it - because coming out you had to turn off the light, then run up the stairs before the nasty little men could grab you from between the steps.It's a wonder I didn't break my neck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another scarred child of the 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, yes, yes -- This is the one I will never forget. Somewhere around seven or eight years old, watching it on ABC in my mother's bedroom, in a near panic as the GNOMES do their dirty business to poor Sally. I also saw it twice more on Saturday afternoons over the years, and now own a VHS copy (which I still watch a couple of times a year). Let me just say that "Don't Be Afraid" left me a quivering eight-year-old mass of jelly, unable to sleep, checking my closets and bed frame every night for malevolent, wrinkle-faced little GNOMES. It took me years to recover -- another commenter claims s/he slept with a light on till 13 or 14, and that sounds about right. This tight little film is chock-full of unforgettable scares --I still use dialogue from the carpenter GNOME attack in the study on my wife and children ("YOU TOLD!! WHY DID YOU TELL??? YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO TELL!!!"). But it was the shower scene that left me absolutely petrified. The idea of these evil, scraggly, wrinkled little GNOMES crawling out of every hamper and crevice when the lights go out, like wily little cockroaches, had me looking askance at every closet in my house growing up. I'm talking years here. Do yourself a favor -- Not sure if those who missed it 35 years ago will 'enjoy' the same powerful soul-searing effect, but find a copy any way you can.And did I mention the GNOMES????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm surprised that there are so many others who suffered a memory burn as a child from this movie. I was nine-years-old when I saw this movie. To this day I still remember my shocked response to this movie. It left quite an impression on me as little kid.. especially as this is the ONLY movie good enough to scare me.Admittedly, I've been searching for answers about this movie for years. I couldn't remember the name, the year, or any of that. I thought maybe it was on "Night Gallery" that I saw it. However, none of the episode descriptions matched the storyline. So, 34 years later, on a whim, I found what I was searching here on the Internet.It's interesting that a made for television movie would pack more of a punch than cinema movie. I only saw this movie once, but as I mentioned it left quite an impression on me... and for this reason I give it a ten. I'm really excited about seeing this movie again to try to key in on what made it so powerful. Especially as a made for television movie.The interesting thing concerning this made for television phenomena is how it would reoccur years later with another made for TV movie "IT." However, this time it would be my two daughters (seven and eight) who were so strongly influenced and scared. This was confusing, as both my daughters had spent most of their lives up to that point watching movies far more intense than what I though "IT" delivered. That is, my two daughters had seen the uncut versions of all the Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Night/Day/Return of the Living Dead, etc., etc... all movies they were unimpressed with and actually fell asleep watching on many occasions. So, imagine my surprise that a TV movie could scare them... I was intrigued by it. Ten years later, I saw the movie "IT" at the video store and I rented it to test it with my youngest daughter. And once again this movie delivered fear where the best horror movies could not.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark was very effective in scary little kids... I'm inclined to believe that the writers jumped on the chance to make such a movie for a general audience on network TV... it was an opportunity to write a psychological thriller specifically targeted at the child audience they knew would be watching this ABC Friday Night Movie.This movie was like a nightmare. It was surreal in its content and its real time pave... it was like a dream. This movie required you think... so the bulk of this movie was going on in your head in real time. It was cool... I cannot wait to see this movie again to gain insight on why it worked so well. And I'm really interested to discover what my nine-year-old daughter thinks of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This internet is amazing!! It's great to find others who experienced what you thought you alone experienced. This film was the first time I was actually paralyzed with fear. Don't even know how I got to see it but I was only about 6 years old. When that little demon opened the flowers on the dinner table to reveal himself, I literally was so scared I couldn't move!! My eyes were pried open and my heart literally stopped!! I could physically feel the fear in my entire body. I have NO idea how I watched the rest of the move but I did. One of the most terrifyingly groundbreaking about this movie was the way it made those little demons look real with large props. The part where they came up behind the dropped flashlight and turned it off made them look as if they were really that small. Plus their little hands on the latches of the windows looked totally real. No other movie at that time pulled it off as realistically as that. I read on IMDb how one of the people playing the demons also played E.T.!!! The voices were also terrifying. Today's Hollywood movie makers could take some lessons from this movie about what is scary.I still don't know why but after this I became a scary movie lover. I always watched "The ABC Suspense Theater" after that and then later never missed an episode of the Night Stalker. A lot of other reviewers talk about how they wouldn't even show that movie to kids today. But I beg the question did it really harm us in the long run?? All the reviewers call the movie excellent so how were we really harmed?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>UNDERRATED AND REALLY SPOOKY FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of horror films for a long long time and this is my favorite movie along with The Changeling (made in 1980).I don't like giving plot details away for movies such as this because it spoils it for people who haven't seen it and it makes the film less scary. It's far better for someone to watch a movie like this and not know what's going to happen next. That way, you're scared more. If I were to tell you about individual scenes you'd know what to expect and it just would not be scary.All I will say is that the film is about a couple who move into a house with a chilling secret. If you want to know any more, it's best to watch the film.If you've ready any of my other reviews of horror movies then you'll know that some films really do scare me. This was one of them. I watched this movie on my own one night and I just couldn't get to sleep. It's a spine chilling movie which will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.In my opinion, films like this are much scarier than films where there is a big green monster screaming right in your face.Without giving too much away, let's just say that a lot of the horror in the film is implied rather than show. This is truly scary.What a great movie this was. However, the title of this film should actually have been Do Be Afraid of the Dark After Watching This Movie. If you like being scared, then watch this film. But don't watch it alone-if you do watch it then get straight on the telephone to a friend and ask them to stop the night. Trust me, you won't want to watch this alone.</fullReview>

The woman breaks through the wall herself and bad things come out that try to...scare her.This movie isn't bad because it's dated. It's bad because it's not good. The story is pedestrian, the "evil" that is released is only frightening if you're eight years old and, as you'll see, most of the people praising this were, indeed, children when they saw it. They're just nostalgic about it because they saw it when they were young and if you saw it now you wouldn't like it.Unless you're one of them, don't be afraid to skip this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super-effective and this film proves you don't need a huge budget to make a very good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the late 1960s and through much of the 1970s, ABC produced a long series of made for TV movies marketed under the title "The ABC Movie of the Week". While the budgets and production times were all very low, they did manage to sign some reasonably big stars and produced quite a few very good little movies. As a kid, I saw a ton of them, but the scary ones were always the ones that stood out in my mind...and scared the crap out of me! "Crowhaven Farm", "The Stranger Within" and "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" were the big three--the three that made my skin crawl the most and made me go to bed with the lights on...they were that scary. I recently bought copies of a couple of these films and in both cases I was thrilled to see that they were indeed good films and were truly frightening.This film begins with a young married lady (Kim Darby) looking around her new house. She manages to discover a hidden room--though the handyman (William Demarest) tells her to leave the room alone. Why? Who knows...but it is pretty creepy. Later, the curious Darby undoes some bolts on an old furnace...and unknowingly releases some demonic little creatures who are now up to no good! There is much more to it, but I don't want to say more, as it would spoil the suspense.Overall, this is STILL an incredibly creepy film--and might make you lose some sleep! This is incredible considering that this film has the distinction for being the fastest to produce made-for-TV film of all time! And, considering this and the very low budget, the film is a huge success. And, if you enjoy this, try watching "Crowhaven Farm". It, too, will scare your pants off! While not a masterpiece, I still give this film a 9, as it's a wonderful film for young film makers to watch--to know it does NOT take explosions, gore or big bucks to make a wonderful film. See this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Was Once Dark Is Now Light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Whoever frees us must live with us and become one of us...' When a young woman and her husband move into the house she inherited from her grandparents, she finds herself drawn to an old fireplace that either harbours demons intent on drawing her to the other side, or she's losing her mind. After watching 'Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark', I wished I'd followed the advice of Mr Harris the old carpenter when he said that some things are better left alone, for this is most definitely one of the silliest horror films I've ever seen. The conviction of the actors alas suggests it was intended be a serious chiller of the day. Kim Darby, in her role as housewife Sally Farnham, gives a very real and concentrated performance that reminded me why Star Trek fans still remember her from her role in the episode 'Miri'. However, the characterisation is rather flat and dated for a modern audience (the paternalistic male attitude of the husband was a bit grating) and the realisation of the 'demons' both visually and verbally extremely childish - indeed, I think you more or less had to have seen this as a child in order for it to have had any impact.This has nothing to do with the production values of the day - the execution is simply absurd, and about as frightening as a balloon with the word 'boo' scribbled on the outside with a laundry marker. Nor is it a criticism of the concept - certainly the idea of malevolent creatures living in the dark recesses of your house is a good one for playing on your irrational fears, but whenever these particular boogeymen spoke or appeared on screen, I found myself more amused by how ridiculous they were than anything else. Director John Newland seemingly does his best with what he's been given, using the dark to good effect - which is in itself a plot point later on - but when you draw a veil over rubbish, that doesn't stop it from being odoriferous. Recommended only for those coloured by favourable childhood memories and perhaps a new generation of children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wasn't Scared Because We didn't Have A Basement!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But we did have a crawlspace under the house. (!!!)Just one more name to add to the long list of people who saw this thing thirty years ago and was psychologically scarred by it. I made the grievous mistake of catching the ugly little face peering up at our heroine and dived back behind the chair (This movie, 'Satan's School for Girls', 'Gargoyles' and The Nightstalker movie with the vampire all had me hiding behind the same chair). My brother laughed at the little characters, but I wouldn't look. I was so disturbed by this thing I drew a picture on the Sunday comics of the woman's lower part of her body from the waist down, sticking out of the furnace. Recalling none of the actors or the title, I was able to completely and totally put this film out of my mind and supress it in the old subconscious,. . . THEN IT AIRED AGAIN! Reading the plot of the film '...woman opens a fireplace in the basement and lets three miniature creatures free who want to take her back in the furnace....' I knew I had found my childhood trauma. Kim Darby? William Demarest? Jim Hutton? No recollection of any of them, but did have a cloudy image resurface of Uncle Charlie in those overalls. In rewatching it, I was a bit digruntled by the 'nobody believes me' direction of the film, and was totally distracted by Ms. Darby's wardrobe, especially her evening dress. But the stair tripping, the camera flashes, and the annoying Barbara Anderson were all fascinating and delightful to watch. Wish I hadn't known the outcome this time, but alas, I did, so it was spoiled.Wish i could recall what I thought this film might be called, but I never would have guessed 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' nor did the opening music strike a familiar chord. Still it was a delight, best left to memories. If I manage to get it on tape, it is just amusing to watch and wonder about what scared me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But do be afraid of revisiting cheesy TV movies that scared you when you were seven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seemed to be almost constantly when I was around seven, and at the time I remember it being totally scary and engrossing. My sister remains freaked out about the little veiny-headed people to this day, so, being the evil little brother that I am, I hunted down a copy to give to her for Christmas, and watched it first.The story is that the hideous Kim Darby, in a hairdo seemingly accomplished by swirlie, has inherited this gorgeous house from her grandmother. Her husband, Jim Hutton, sees all the beautiful windows and space and pool out back and all?and would rather live in an apartment in a high-rise. Throughout the movie, there is all this talk about how much work the house needs, saying at one point that a dinner party there will be like "eating in the subway," when all of this is utterly belied by the house itself, which is spectacular. Sure, it's decorated with a comprehensive cross-section of everything wrong with the 70s, but the house itself is a stunner. We later keep hearing about how the couple has "done so much work" on the house, thought we never see ANY evidence of this throughout the movie.Anyway, Kim wants to make a study out of this, well, study in the basement, which features a big fireplace that has been bricked up and bolted closed. The handyman keeps telling her that she'd better not open it if she knows what's good for her, but won't explain why. Naturally, she opens it, and soon enough we're hearing little voices saying "We're free! We're free! She set us free!"One thing apparent from the start is that Kim's husband is a major jerk. This little time capsule comes from the period in which men thought nothing of telling their wives that they are psychotic rather than even making the slightest attempt to hear what they have to say. Jim is also a bitch to Kim throughout, throwing constant attitude at her and caring about nothing but his job and reputation. There is a little bit of "topicality" in that Kim feels like he's going to only be worried about his job for the rest of their marriage, but it seems to me that their problems run far deeper than that.So soon enough strange things start happening, caused, we soon find out, by this race of foot-high men in gorilla suits with strange veiny-headed masks on. For some reason they want Kim. Please don't put too much stock in getting an explanation for this phenomena?-ever?-as one never comes. You're like, is it witchcraft? Aliens? Ancient Indian burial ground? Ancient Chinese secret? And nothing ever comes. The little ape-men, always accompanied by an inexplicable and wholly ludicrous green light, creep out and cause havoc in the household at regular intervals.After a few brushes with her furry friends, Kim is understandably freaked out and skittish (while her husband, with increasing annoyance, considers her a lunatic?who knew husbands were so eager to consider their wives plumb nuts?), which makes it surprising that she doesn't seem phased in the least when, at the height of her nervousness, the lights in the bathroom go out while she's taking a shower. Kim just showers away, taking no heed. I guess she just really, really had to get that cr?me rinse out.Spoilers ahead! The attacks increase, with a corresponding drop in viewer interest. But they do at least offer the meager fun of seeing guys cavort around sets made of giant books and stairways designed to make them look small. During all this time, Kim never thinks of just leaving the house. You know, they DO have hotels, Kim. She is supposedly going to spend the night at a friend's house, though the friend never shows up and no one seems to think that's strange. The fools also, though by now it's obvious that the little men are afraid of the light, never turn on the lights. In addition to never considering just bolting up the chimney again during the day, while the little men are sleeping, which is the only method that obviously worked in the past. Idiots.So it all builds toward a fateful evening?-after the bearded decorator is killed?-in which Kim is drugged by the little beasties. Her friend, Geraldine Ferraro, finally believes her, but still has no problem leaving her alone (while drugged!) to make phone calls and creep around outside. Her husband, now starting to believe her a little bit, leaves her in the house to go have a chat with the handyman. No one considers just taking her out of the house, which destroys any minor scares this thing may have generated on the weak-minded. The whole thing has the air of the script being written way before the film was shot, and of no one caring enough to go back and adjust it. The biggest example of this is all the talk about the house being a wreck, when it's clearly ready for Architectural Digest, and there are other little instances where someone will talk abut something that never happened or whatever. Nevertheless, little creepy guys skulking around in corners does manage to offer a few chills. Someone could remake this movie and have a B-feature on their hands. Too bad such little effort was put into this version.--- Check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goblins in the brickwork...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unnerving TV-movie features Kim Darby and Jim Hutton as an upwardly mobile young couple who move into an old manor previously owned by Darby's now-deceased grandmother. The veteran handyman tells curious Kim not to open the bricked-off fireplace in the hidden room downstairs, but she unbolts the ash bin anyway and unwittingly unleashes a society of evil little goblins intent on adding her soul to their circle. Well-done thriller from director John Newland and writer Nigel McKeand might have benefited even more from a slightly larger budget and more time on the clock to expand on McKeand's scenario. As it is, "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is so compact that it feels rushed, although the finale being cut short may actually work in the movie's favor: there isn't an opportunity to ask questions, only to ponder the possibilities--and the sounds we're left with linger in the mind. Loosely remade as a theatrical feature in 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and sinister, but a singular achievement on its own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that this film has a special place in the hearts of a lot of thirty and forty-something-year-olds, probably due to nostalgia and their childhood imaginations as to what roamed around their houses at night. I saw this film for the first time yesterday as a twenty-something-year-old, and I can tell you that their love for it is not in vain. The film focuses on young housewife Sally Farnham (Kim Darby), who moves into a Victorian California mansion with her businessman husband (Jim Hutton). The house belonged to Sally's grandmother, and she feels obligated to restore the place. In a basement room, she discovers a bricked up fireplace that the maintenance man insists should stay that way. Sally lets her curiosity get the better of her, and she unlocks the door to the ash pit. Almost immediately afterward she begins to witness glimpses of short goblin creatures roaming around the house, but her husband dismisses it as feminine paranoia. But as the creatures' antics grow more and more violent, they insist that Sally must become one of their own.I've read reviews online from people saying that this is the scariest film they've ever seen, and I'd like to say up front that the people saying this are probably relying on what they remembered of this film from when they were six or seven years old? it's NOT really that scary. Regardless, it does have a sense of dread to it that is unnerving and there are some spooky moments revolving around the little goblins (mostly their raspy whispering, geesh!). What stood out to me most about this film was its atmosphere and the surprising sense of paranoia and dread packed within its 74-minute run time. Kim Darby effectively plays the lone housewife who is dismissed continuously by her business-centered husband, played by the stern Jim Hutton. Is she crazy? Why do the creatures insist on appearing only to her? This uncertainty of events is reminiscent of films like "Let's Scare Jessica to Death" and "Rosemary's Baby", where female protagonists are challenged on their perceptions of reality and their fears go ignored by male characters. This edge gives "Don't Be Afraid" an almost feminist slant, along with its brief dialogic references to women's lib and housewives spending their absent husbands' money on shopping sprees.As for the little devils lurking around the shadows of the house; well, they're creepy. And they're almost cute in a way, except for when you remember their intentions with Sally. To be forthright, the creatures are not scary by modern-day standards. Their presence is frightening, but the actual physicality of them is dated, though still mildly effective if you can tune your brain for it. I certainly wouldn't want to see one running around my house. They are bizarre, and the fact that they emerge from somewhere inside a fireplace is both absurd and horrifying. Add to that the fact that their origin and motives are left completely unexplained? by the end of the film, we have no more a clue as to what they are than Sally does.Accompanying the ominous goblins is a surprisingly good musical score, which really helps the film out in a lot of ways, but not as much as the haunting whispers that echo throughout the house. The vocal work there is probably one of the film's scariest elements.Atmosphere-wise, the sets in the film look very "television" in some scenes, and very real in others, but have a consistently charming vintage feel to them. The house used in the film is a character itself like in many of these films, and its angles and shadows give room for the goblins to be anywhere at any time.The real kicker here is the downbeat ending, which is a bit of a downer now and was probably absolutely horrific back in 1973. You don't see films that end this way often, even today, so the film deserves recognition for being so daring. I don't really know what else to say about this film, besides that I genuinely liked it for whatever reason. It's goofy and dated but there's still something extremely charming about it, and it has some elements of classic haunted house stories and an extremely '70s feel to it that is welcoming and foreboding simultaneously. That's really how the entire film is? where it's ridiculous, it's also spooky. What makes it hokey is also what makes it bizarre. Where it makes no sense, it doesn't need to. The conglomeration of all these elements make it a classic of its own, albeit a product of its time. Worth a watch for fans of 1970s television or horror films, despite the fact that it's not quite as scary as some say. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was a kid in the 1970s, (I'm 42 now) it was very scary to me and those little demons were the scariest thing up until then (xenomorphs took over that top spot for me a few years later). I can still remember the ending when Kim Darby is dragged into the fireplace/furnace or whatever by the little buggers. The demons hate all light and she tries using a flash bulb from a camera to ward them off, to no avail. Really creepy, scary movie. And considering it was made for TV, that's quite impressive. Also it was the only time I saw the movie, so it obviously has made quite an impression. I hope the remake isn't a disappointment like so many remakes are. I won't go see it until DVD anyway ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent precursor to films like 'The Gate' and 'Gremlins'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1970s a number of made for TV Horror movies aired and have enjoyed a long cult following. Sure they made on low budgets, but what they lacked in money they made up for with strong casts and scares. They were filled with the kinds of things that kept children up at night and thanks to VHS and DVD could be viewed by the next generation of thrill seekers. One of the most popular is this 1973 film about little creatures in a house and though it might be as powerful now as then it's still good spooky fun.Pros: Performances are good. Gorgeous house. Spooky atmosphere. Creepy score. Well-paced. Some suspense. Plenty of chilling moments from right out of a bad dream.Cons: Too familiar territory. Not as scary as it could have been. Can be predictable.Final thoughts: I was really looking forward to this one and although it wasn't as good as the hype it does have quite a bit going for it. Things in the dark have always been frightening and Horror films that force us to use our imaginations are usually the best kind. They don't make them like this anymore.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have seen this movie when I was around 7 or 8 yrs old. This was the scariest movie I had ever seen. I was never afraid of the dark prior to seeing it, but afterward was a different story. When my parents put me to bed my door had to be slightly cracked open the the hallway light on. I slept with my covers over my head and I was so afraid those little creatures were going to get me. I then began telling some neighborhood kids about these little creatures and I don't think their parents were too happy with me. The parents complained to my parent saying I was "scaring their children" and they were having problems sleeping at night. Little did they realize how really scared I was and I guess I just wanted some company....oops. I've brought this movie up to many friends but no one ever seemed to know what I was talking about. But after reading a bunch of these reviews I am relieved to find out that I wasn't the only one scared out of their wits! To this day I really don't care for scary movies, perhaps that is a effect from seeing this movie, who knows? I am happy to report that I no longer am scared of sleeping in the dark :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very effective little horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't offer much of a substantive review of this movie since the last time I saw it was easily 30 years ago. I *can* tell you that it scared the bejeebers out of me and I was indeed afraid of the dark for sometime afterward! The film, surprisingly made for TV, is extremely effective, working primarily on a spooky atmosphere, paranoia, and a fear of losing one's sanity. I have always wanted to see this film again but as far as I know it has never been released on video or DVD, which is a real shame. I guess since Guillermo Del Toro is remaking this, the original will see a DVD release within the next couple of years.Horror fans, if you can find a way to catch this little gem DO NOT miss it! Cheers! Brent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The little creatures themselves / what about them scares us / remake possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible spoilers in that I paused the VCR in 1984 and photographed the creatures. Let's face it, you the reader's not knowing what they looked like made the movie scarier)Rather than summarize the movie (as other posters have done), I would like to comment on the primal fear in which movies like this evoke. I would also like to offer some suggestions for a remake.I first saw this movie when I was eight or nine years old, in 1973, first on a bad, wavy black-and-white T.V. and later on a sharper color t.v. that same year. About 10 years later, in 1984, someone taped the movie and I borrowed it, pausing the VCR to photograph (with a 35mm camera) the creatures themselves in the instantaneous frame or two when the creatures were actually visible.There really wasn't much to see. Their bodies were dark, probably furry and anthropoid, their faces/heads were bald, shriveled and ghoulish, their eyes dark as if covered with glasses (giving possibly a skull- or possibly alien- effect), and they had small hands with claws. Like mice, they were impossible to corner, you could only see parts of them as they departed into unknown exits/gateways. They definitely had some physical limitations because of their size but were extremely efficient at improvising and overcoming these obstacles. They could have been anywhere from 12 to 20 inches in height, I tend to favor saying 16-18.They feared the light, which we presumed anything brighter than a candle or two was extremely painful or lethal, like a wall of fire. It was this undeniable sense of mystery and fear of the unknown that made this movie so creepy: Being watched -- merely that, is shocking enough. Then, the foul, threatening-yet-beckoning whispers in the dark, echoing weirdly and sharply in a big, dark old house; the fear of having some unseen presence tug on your clothing but only getting a glimpse of what the thing was before it glides off into the corner or around a piece of furniture, the fear of being abducted and taken to foul, netherworldly dimensions, and the fear of transformation itself: being changed from a normal human who thrives in daylight and open freedom into something unspeakably foul, grotesque and sub-human, and confined to darkness even when 'freed'. Even though the creatures seemed quite physical, they had a certain ghostly quality about them, and the ability to appear and disappear and get through places where there was no opening or route of escape. I tend to side with the posters who do NOT think of these creatures as 'demons' -- but something else. (Demons are too broad a category). Thank God so much was left to the imagination. I tend to think of these creatures as a nasty, vile, sub-anthropoid species perhaps like trolls, goblins, or some type of primitive hominid which, nonetheless, had vast inter-dimensional gate/teleportation abilities. Something perhaps banished from the earth or imprisoned long ago, accidentally released and reimprisoned, released again, and desiring to replenish or repopulate. A remake of this movie could be done, but the creatures, if shown, would have to be uglier and more repulsive than has been done with similar-sized creatures in Gremlins, Ghoulies, and similar movies. Glaring red eyes (not in the original movie, but associated with, say, the Amityville Horror) from the darkness has a horrific shock effect, even filth-dripping bloody cloaks like the Jawas wear (and the dwarfs on Phantasm) might temporarilly shield them from the light, but a few disrobed scenes could be done as well. I still think that the actual sightings of the creatures should be brief, leaving much to the imagination as the original movie did. But in the brief seconds they are bare and exposed in the flashlight beam (before inexplicably retreating and escaping), something along the line of ghoulish, putrid, decomposing monkeys, nastily clawed and with horribly rotting skull-faces and rotting teeth, rapidly and evily putrefying and decomposing in the light, would be in order.If one should attack (the handyman, for instance), the attack should be as ferocious as the African doll scene on Trilogy of Terror (1975). A scene like in Gremlins, with Sally actually confronting some of the creatures, would be a nice touch throwing some of the hideous things in blenders or microwaves might be in order, though little identifiable evidence would remain (just an extremely foul, putrid, nasty mess)of what the creatures were before being destroyed. Horror writer H.P. Lovecraft typically had his Mythos creatures putrefy to almost nothing when their bodies were (temporarilly) killed. Even light could make these three creatures explode. Glaring eyes, weird sounds, an unbearable, unidentifiable stench in the basement, would be other horror elements. Substances and damage about the house might add to the physical evidence without giving away the full reality.A remake might want to show the creatures as capable of some type of physical, sleep- or sexual assault (incubi) as well, as such have been suggested on the movies Poltergiest and Amityville Horror. This makes them far more threatening than their merely pulling off ash trays from end tables. Believing one's self to be sexually assaulted in the dark or while half asleep, while these creatures are in immaterial form would add a new dimension to the horror of what the victim is experiencing.But a remake ought to follow the same storyline, with the same end result.Just a few grosser and more interesting details along the way.Being kidnapped and taken away is a fate worse than death, and is probably the deepest-pitted fears of ghosts, aliens, boogie-men, etc. The entity does not want to kill us (a mere thug could do that), rather it wants to take us away forever for its own purposes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director of this film should be given an award for the most hell evoking, stomach shredding horror film ever made...and then hung. I saw Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark on TV when it first aired-I was scared to death...no I was scarred to death. I have never been the same. When thinking about this film or experiencing it I start to feel as if my stomach is going to come out of my mouth from extreme terror filled panic. There is something under my bed-there is something under your bed-there is something from hell trying to get you and me and it is shown in this movie. God please guide and help me through the darkness that is this movie and its unnamed chilling monstrous horror it evokes. There is a scene in the bathroom where the small creatures come out and let me tell you that I have seen them out of the corner of my eye ever since. In the week after seeing this film I had a dream that in my closet there was a portal to hell and that I had accidentally left my closet door open-because of that, creatures from hell had escaped onto earth. I awoke and nailed my closet door shut and did not pry it open until 1984. This is a fact. It should be illegal to show your children this film. There is nothing that compares to this gut wrenching, wicked scare fest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll never forget this show! I was born in 1970, so you can imagine how young I was when I first caught it on a late-night movie and then again as a re-run on a Sunday matine. A very affective horror tale that absolutely scared me to death! I think of this show whenever I see the door to an ash-bin on the backside of a chimney! I will never forget being so paranoid and afraid that those little demons were going to be lurking in any dark corner of my house, just waiting to drag me off by my heels!!! There are things that affect us so greatly that we never forget them and I have thought about this show from time to time thru the years. I would love to see it again as an adult. It would be great to find it available for purchase. A classic 70's horror show of its time. Very well-done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very happy to have found the origin of that movie.Like many here, I've seen this movie back in the 70s when I was about 8. It's not been aired on TV here since then but it remained in my memory.I had given up to find any information about that movie, since the only thing I could remember was its plot. Nothing about the players or that it was a TV-film. The French title would have not been of any help though.The impact of the film worked quite well on me although dubbed in French. The monsters' voice calling "Sally, Saally, come with us (in French)..." kept its scary power during long days after! All the more when it's quite easy to come across houses with old chimneys that might hide horrible things on this side of the ocean !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you grew up in the Washington DC area in the 70's where I was raised. Every week on channel 7 (ABC) they had the 4 O'clock movie. Each week there would be a theme for movies that week. Well, during the month of October every week would have themes like, monster week, horror week, sci-fi week and so on. I remember watching "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", I am getting such a chuckle thinking back. Scared was not the word. I was terrified to live in my own house. My parents bought an old neglected house, huge. Six bedrooms. (Big family) The basement had a fireplace and it had knotty pine panels. It was creepy because it was neglected so long. There were spiders, and some of the biggest centipedes I'd ever seen. After viewing the movie my older sister and sometimes older brother would terrorize me and my younger brother to tears. I remember the venting system in the house you could hear people from the first floor to the basement. So they (my evil siblings) would whisper quotes from the movie that the little demons would chant. To funny. Man was I scared. This only fueled my interest in horror movies as I became older and now I love them (when they are good) not campy (like most of them now). I hope the remake is as scary as the original if not better. Oh by the way the house was bought for $79,000 my father sold it in 1993 for $225,000. Good investment. Memories------priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Film Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It still amazes me that this movie was made for tv,and that even though I haven't seen it in 30 years at least, I have never forgotten it, or even how I "felt" watching it! How many movies can you say THAT about?All horror film makers need to take a lesson from this masterpiece on how a horror film "SHOULD" be made that is so fantastic that the viewers never forget it! It is so sad that it really is true"they don't make them like this anymore". I wish so much that this would come out on DVD,as it is about impossible to find even a VHS copy especially one that is affordable. DO NOT MISS THIS if you get a chance to see it. If you love to get the absolute creeps watching a movie,this one will do it for you! After 30 years of being my favorite horror film, I doubt if it's top spot for me, will ever be toppled by the likes of today's horror-gore/fests! I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like almost everybody else who's written a comment, I saw this movie when I was a kid, and it scarred me for life! I am now 36.First of all, I was living in a little town called Farnham, in the south of Quebec, and it struck me that the principal characters had the same name than the town I was living in! It felt more personal! And for that reason, I guess, EVERY person I went to school with remembers that movie...The scene I remember more vividly is when one of the creature is hiding in a flower pot during a party (?) and shows itself to Sally who freaks out! Wow, I have goosebumps just writing about it!...It seems the remake fell through...? I can't find anything on it anymore... I think it's a good thing...

		<fullReview>Like so many others who have commented here, I too was traumatized by this movie! I was about 7 and for the longest time afterwards, was terrified of being in the basement--especially since my mom had a habit of turning the light off on me if she didn't know I was down there.I also remember having to stand at my light switch and count to 3 before flicking the light off and racing across the room to leap into bed before it got dark! Never made it--lol.The scene that truly did me in was one that showed the demon creaturesturning the screw that held the faceplate on the (bedroom?)heat vent FROM INSIDE THE DUCTWORK. OMG--I can still hear the little 'chink chink' sound of that screw hitting the floor. I don't know how long it was before I stopped checking mine to be sure they were still painted over and hadn't been disturbed...I would love to see this movie again. It probably won't be as scary as it was when I was 7, but creepy nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend &amp; I refer to this movie as "Don't Go In The Basement Sally!" We joke about Kim Darby's dowdy housewife character &amp; her stupid actions. We make fun of the creepy little guys terrorizing her. But we never deny the fact that this is a scary movie. I believe it was an "ABC Movie Of The Week". Many of these TV movies were produced in the 70's &amp; most are now long forgotten, but this one stands out. What is frightening (and very unconventional) about this movie is the "heroine" does not win out in the end. What's disturbing is the fact that you're not that upset about it because she's a homely, frumpy dim bulb with absolutely no personality. You cannot help but think she got exactly what she asked for &amp; deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie made me pee in my jammies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was six years old when I begged my mom to let me stay up and watch this flick. It's been more than two decades since then but I remember a lot of begging and pleading until finally she caved in and my brother and I settled down before our big-ass Zenith to watch it. I had no idea what I was in store for and despite promising my mom that I wouldn't get scared and have nightmares, this movie just about pushed me over the edge. I had recurring dreams about the little demons in this movie and my older brother used to terrorize me and say "The little monkey demons are gonna get you!" Thanks to the internet, I finally managed to get my hands on a copy about 2 years ago. It was so strange to see it after almost 26 years and to my surprise, it still creeped me out. I've been a lifetime horror fan and few movies scared me as much as this gem. I'm really curious about the remake coming out. The original-- despite some campiness-- will be hard to match.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll want to keep a flashlight handy for this one... and it's made-for-television, even! Like most reviews I've read, I won't make the mistake of revealing too much about this small-screen horror gem. It stars Kim Darby (she made her big-screen mark opposite John Wayne in the late '60s Western "True Grit") and William Demarest as the old handy-man that warns her not to go into the locked basement room (My Three Sons' "Uncle Charlie"). I was surprised to know that this telefilm has this large cult following... which goes to prove we're all kids at heart. Pass the popcorn and, when it's all over, don't forget to check all the closets for... am I already beginning to reveal more of the movie? Oh well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still creepy after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am like a lot of other people in that I saw this as a child some afternoon and it stayed with me to this day. About a year ago, I could not get it out of my mind and decided if I could find out what it was called, I would try to find a copy of the video. I came here, did some poking around, got the title, and, as many other people here have also mentioned, finally found a copy on ebay for sale. If you can find it, buy it, or email me, and I will send you mine if you can't find one to buy.This movie is absolutely freaky. I watched it for the first time in easily 20 years with a date last night and all I can say is, wow. It is totally trippy and creepy and the guy I was with also thought so, and he is a lot more plugged into the horror/camp movie scene than I am. A few giggles due to the dated dialogue, but a first-rate movie, scary as hell, and worth all the fuss. William Demarest is particularly interesting as the old handyman who knows more than he lets on...oooooooooooooooooooo......spoooooooky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lasting impression after all these years....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" on TV when I was about six years old. Wow!! Like Chuck, I've only seen this movie one time, as I recall, and yet I can remember it like it was yesterday. Pretty good considering it's been some 28 years ago now.This is one of your better made-for-TV movies. It's suspenseful and scary with a good story and an ending you will never forget. I know I never have anyway. I'd even go so far as to say that it's one of the best scary movies I've ever seen, full stop. I'm not kidding. I am a horror movie connoisseur and my standards of scariness are pretty high. Look, when you've been exposed to this sort of greatness at such an early age, you get spoiled. I have to mention that those little demons were as creepy as can be. The director did a good job in not revealing too much as far as they were concerned, thus the imagination has a chance to run and play.I also have never been able to find this movie on video, although I know it was at one point. I still search every so often to see if it's available somewhere. DBAOTD did make an appearance on one our local stations about three years ago at the ungodly hour of 2am. Sadly, I was unable to tape it as my VCR had a technological breakdown at just the wrong moment. This still frustrates me to this very day. Grrrrrrrr!Bottom line, if you have a chance to see this movie, please do so. It's a real gem and I wish it would get the showing it deserves. Insomniacs shouldn't be the only lucky ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie On Television</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone was to ever ask me what the best made-for-tv-movie I have ever seen was, I would definitely have to say that it is this one. Like so many of the other people who have posted, this movie has had quite an affect on me. Although, I have yet to see it in re-run, I would love to see it again (at night). I was literally glued to the television during the entire movie. I was so entranced by both the plot and the little creatures, I was hoping the movie would never end. I vividly remember asking anyone I came into contact the next day, if they had watched this movie the night before. Those who did, were equally as affected as I. I also think this movie also would have made an excellent motion picture. I don't believe Lorimar Productions realize what a blockbuster they actually have. I have enjoyed reading everyone's post and am glad to see there are so many others who have enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW, I can't believe all the people who have seen and love this 70's horror flick! I was about 7 when I saw this back when they still had the late night creature feature, it was a re-run of the original...(didn't know it was made for TV until I read other user comments). My hubby and I were discussing movies that really scared the heck out of us when we were kids and lo and behold he had seen this too and it scared him as much as it did me. This has got to be one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, even in my 20's thinking about it gives me the creeps. It wasn't just the little demons running around but the mental terror they put our poor heroine though. Near the end when she is using the camera flash to drive them away, I was overjoyed.......YES she's gonna make it,(guess again). To anyone who gets the chance to watch this one...DO. It sticks with you and the shivers just keep coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Most Memorable Childhood Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seemed that in the 1971-75 period every other made-for-TV movie was of the suspense/supernatural/horror genre. There was Karen Black in TRILOGY OF TERROR, Patty Duke in SHE WAITS, Barbara Eden in THE STRANGER WITHIN, Kim Hunter in BAD RONALD, Jane Wyman in THE FAILURE OF RAYMOND, Barbara Stanwyck in THE HOUSE THAT WOULD NOT DIE and A TASTE OF EVIL, Sandy Dennis in SOMETHING EVIL, Olivia deHavilland in THE SCREAMING WOMAN, and Kim Darby and Jim Hutton in DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK. I saw the original broadcast of this movie and can vividly recall the next day at school how my fellow classmates were white-faced and sleepy-eyed due to having the crap scared out of them. Who can ever forget that creepy, wrinkled face peeking out of the flowerpot? That occurs at a dinner party, and poor Kim Darby is the only one to see the flowers part and that horrible face take a peek at her. She never should have opened the boarded-up fireplace that unleashed those horrible creatures! For some unexplained reason those creatures are determined to take her away and make her one of them. They fear the light, and only lurk around in the dark, causing a nuisance. Poor Kim's husband doesn't believe a word of it, and thinks Kim is WACKO! It's a shame that today's kids are stuck watching those tacky disease-of-the-week TV movies. My childhood is filled with the horrifying images of movies like the above mentioned. Too bad the networks don't make this type of movie anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that would have scared the **** out of Stephen King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If he had been my age when he saw it. This movie disturbed me for years after I first saw it in the ancient days of the early 70s. I would look for it every now and then, and be strangely disappointed yet relieved when I couldn't find it, like trying to confront a phobia and being glad you didn't have the chance to. To say this increased my fear of the dark as a kid was an understatement...and considering the comments others have made about it, I think it was irresponsible for ABC to have shown it when kids were watching. Yet it seems to have been aimed at kids...I would almost call this a sick movie. It has three small, unexplained demons who have been trapped for unexplained reasons in a house and then released by the unfortunate heroine; who, after a long and desperate struggle against them throughout the whole movie (trying to convince typically disbelieving husband, etc), she gets turned into one of them. Creepy message for kids... if you are a good person and struggle hard against evil long enough...you will eventually lose. The movie was almost like a sadistic adult pulling the strings of little kids, which I don't think is a fair thing to do; one wonders what age group the producers were aiming for. I wouldn't let my kid watch this movie, but I might watch it again to see if it scares me the way it did then. The movie, although exploitive, does prove one thing; that horror doesn't depend on what you see to scare you, but what you can't see, and is left up to the imagination. The unseen voices and barely seen puppet-sized demons were more terrifying than any typical Godzilla or dragon movie. You can slay a big, visible dragon - but how do you kill a demon who always seems to be hiding just off-camera? ...in the dark. Adults may enjoy seeing this. But I can't recommend impressionable little kids seeing it. Why pass our neurosis onto them? Seven out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine recommended this movie, having seen it when she was a kid. She still remembered the title and a lot about it. I was not disappointed when I saw it. These bizarre, scary creatures lurking below Kim Darby's house want to take her with them into the netherworld. There are some really creepy sequences, and the creatures' voices and whispered chants are memorable. They don't make TV-movies like this anymore. I think networks are unwilling to take a chance on anything as creepily, oddly off-the-wall as this now. Another example of a scary TV-move from this era is "Dying Room Only" with Cloris Leachman; it, too, is pretty strange and chilling.</fullReview>

No one in my family ever remembered watching it and when I described the plot line to others years later no one seemed to remember the movie. My family moved into a new home about 3 months after it aired. There was a closet with built in cabinets I refused to go into them years because of the movie. Mom hid all my Christmas presents there because she knew I wouldn't open those drawers. So glad to learn I'm not the only 50 year old who still remembers being traumatized as a kid.

		<shortDescription>Classic TV movie is solid on Atmosphere and Chills.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young couple, Alex (Hutton) and Sally (Darby) move into the Gothic old house of Sally's grandmother. Alex wants a new place but Sally insists on keeping it along with the old handyman Mr. Harris (Demerest). Poking around in the basement Sally comes across a bricked up fireplace she wants opened by Mr. Harris. He warns her, telling her that he bricked it up himself 20 years ago and it should stay that way. Sally gets it open and unknowingly releases murderous little goblins that were imprisoned inside. The creatures soon make their presence known, but only to Sally. She starts to doubt her own mind and everyone she tells doesn't believe her. The goblins attack Sally and whisper to her throughout the house in repeated fashion. They need Sally's soul and plan on killing her to get it. Filled with gobs of atmosphere, this scary TV movie was a late night staple scaring many young horror fans. The movie works on all levels even though we really never get to understand the Goblins and their reason for existence. Solid Directing from John Newland makes you forget you're watching a TV movie. Newland uses the whispering goblins to great effect and keeps them under wraps until a revealing Dinner party scene when we see the first one clearly in shocking and scary fashion. The Goblins talk of 'harming her' and 'wanting to' which will raise goose bumps in the early scenes. The nasty goblins get under Sally's skin and the audience's as well. Another memorable scene is when the creatures stalk Sally as she is taking a shower. All though the end loses a little steam the short running time and solid pacing makes up for that including an unexpected final scene that is so off beat it leaves the viewer with one last great chill! Composer Billy Goldenberg's musical score is very effective and helps a lot as well. This strange hybrid mix of Haunted House and Creature movie supplies many chills along with atmosphere and real scares that should entertain most horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting film but let down by some very leaden and unimaginative production values and direction. It would have been better had they left the creatures more in the darkness, once you actually see them then they lose all credibility. Also they seem to be not that formidable, they retreat from light so why doesn't Kim Darby just dump a can of petrol down the chimney and fry them? Why doesn't she just buy herself a shotgun and blow them away? And in the immortal words of Eddie Murphy why the blazes doesn't she just get out of the house?Kim Darby is extremely good just as she was in True Grit but she's by far the best thing in it, the other actors are very weak. It's interesting to see it all in retrospect in terms of the feminist revolution, this is the very beginning of woman's lib (which is even referred to in passing)and the patronising attitude everyone exhibits towards housewife Sally is quite startling.The ending is probably the reason why everyone remembers this film, for a TV movie of the week to have an ending where the heroine actually 'joins' the bad guys must have been quite daring at the time. So what happens next? Does Sally's husband and her friends try to rescue her? Or do they just brick up the chimney and make sure no one ever opens it again? Has she actually become one of the creatures or is she their queen and do they feed off her soul (one of the creatures says they want Sally's 'spirit'). What about the photos she took as she was being dragged towards the chimney?Interesting but really doesn't live up to its' reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising and Sinister TV Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the film that gave nightmares to a whole generation of children, who were afraid of what might be in the closest, behind the door, or under the bed: mysterious and evil little creatures who laugh maniacally to each other as they plan to harm a young newlywed couple(played by Jim Hutton &amp; Kim Darby) who have moved into their home, after the wife foolishly opens the grate in the cellar, releasing them from their underground prison.Though short in length, and threadbare on character development and plot detail, this creates an unsettling mood of fear, and atmosphere of dread, that it overcomes these issues to be an effective little gem; and of course there is that ending, the stuff of said nightmares...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We want you, Sally. We want you." Some people can't leave well enough alone. A young woman (Kim Darby; True Grit) inherits a mansion from her dead grandmother, insisting on using a closed-up fireplace, sealed for appropriate reasons she will soon discover to her horror. The old family carpenter (William Demarest; My Three Sons) forewarns Sally (Darby) about leaving the ash door to the fireplace alone, but curiosity gets the best of her and in opening it with a wrench releases a long dormant evil. "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is definitely one of those "the monsters in the dark of the cellar are out to get you" movies. I was quite amazed at how faithful Guillermo Del Toro was to this film with his remake (starring Katie Holmes , except featuring a little girl as the one desired by the fireplace creatures), applying many of the basics presented here. John Sutton (The Twilight Zone) is the frustrated husband who believes his wife is delusional, her ravings about hearing and seeing monsters inspired by the elderly construction worker, who was insistent upon not opening the fireplace. Alex (Sutton) is on the fast track at his firm, at that time in his life when promotions and a promising career are of great importance to him. Sally feels he is more concerned with success than their marriage, but this soon plays second fiddle to the danger of hostile monsters who know how to run and hide, their sensitivity to the light her only real weapon against them. While I'm certain you will be screaming at the screen for them just to leave (echoing similar feelings for couples who live in the cursed Amityville house), there wouldn't be a chiller if that were the case; making a rational decision to stay elsewhere when the fear of being harmed is palpable isn't proper for horror cinema. Anyway, the creatures reminded me of the Zulu doll from Dan Curtis' Trilogy of Terror (with Karen Black the one under assault), and it seems as if stop motion might have been used. Carefully submerging them in the dark as not to fully expose the creatures as puppets, it was a good idea and that threat of them lurking somewhere in the house, small enough to stay just out of sight, pop out when they are least expected, able to move about freely (?because who but Sally believes these things exist?) is always reminded to us. Darby presents a confused, bothered, and frightened victim of these beings, her situation amplified because Sutton criticizes her for talking such "crazy nonsense". Demarest has a key role in the film because his character knows more than he can reveal. Barbara Anderson also has an unceremonious part as the friend, Joan, who cares and is concerned for Sally, willing to listen even if what she hears sounds a bit far-fetched. Bleak ending is actually lifted exact for the remake and I still don't care for it because it just seemed silly and nonsensical to me. This 70s made for television dark house movie has a cult reputation, celebrated by those who grew up with it during the time when it first aired (and perhaps times shown late at night afterwards). I think the doom and sinister of the scenario and house itself are well directed, even if the payoff didn't quite work for me personally. The motive behind the behavior of the monsters is never quite fully explained, perhaps this is acceptable and welcomed by many, but I found it rather unsatisfying. That said, I did find this rather enjoyable for the most part...I think it is more about mood and suspense than a remarkable storyline. When it is taken into account that the film was made in like two weeks, I have to give all involved a pat on the back for accomplishing what they do within such a limited schedule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great scary movie from the 70"s!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh yea!! Don't Be Afraid of the Dark was the scariest made for TV movies I had ever seen when I was a kid. I'm 44 now and that movie still gives me goose bumps. Just hearing those creepy little guys calling Sally by her name was really freaky, and still is. The two other made for TV movies that hold up to it is "Night of the Scarecrow" and "Trilogy of Terror". But Don't be afraid of the Dark left a lasting impression on me. I know we have come along way with special effects but if they don't use to much CGI for this new movie and stay true to the original plot, they could have a real horror blockbuster on their hands. I hope Del Toro get's the remake right. I will have to go see it when it comes out in February. If you get a chance, see the original first and then see the new one. You shouldn't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie ever!! ( thanks to my sister)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about 5 or 6 years old when my sister and I watched this.The little demons had this freaky way of whispering to each other as they tried to kill the woman in the movie. we had stayed at our Grandparents house that night and as we went to bed upstairs (the only ones up there!) My 8 yr. old sister thought it would be funny to start whispering from the other bedroom "Bobby..we WANT you!" over and over again. I screamed louder than I ever had in my life and cried for Grandpa..he came upstairs and told us to knock it off...It was without a doubt the most scared I've ever been in my life and still freak out when I think about it today. I found this movie a few years ago and bought it...It still spooked me when watching it in my 40's. I think I gave it to my sister for old times sake. Hmm..I just noticed the woman in the movie (Kim Darby)was the same actress who played the little tomboy in True Grit. All in all...not scary for most people by today's standards, but will always be the scariest movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember "Pay TV"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all have movies that stand out in our memories. "To Kill a Mockingbird" is always the first one I remember and then "Thomasina" - a movie about a cat, I think Haley Mills was in it. The thing about these two was that they were the first 'movies' I watched by using a box on top of our neighbors TV that we actually had to put money into to make the movie begin (which someone came around to pick up periodically). I think we called it "Pay TV". It worked kind of like a jute-box. That alone made them memorable. We all gathered together in our neighbors living room, a whole bunch of us from a few families close by. We made popcorn and shut off all the lights. We were all huddled together. Now......imagine watching "Don't be Afraid of the Dark" like that! Someone's hand creeping silently up your back and scaring the heck out of you. You scream, the kid next to you screams...you get the picture. Actually (AND LUCKILY)"Don't be Afraid of the Dark" showed up about fifteen years later sans the "little TV box" so after all this time, Yes I CAN look at a fireplace without freezing in my tracks. "Don't be Afraid of the Dark" was that kind of movie; it scared you that much. In fact now that I've begun to think of it again, especially at this spooky time of the year, I'm going to be thinking of my fireplace AND the flue! To this day I am extremely freaked by any movies with troll-like creatures. I usually won't watch them...just because "Don't Be..." scared me 'to death'. Of course now that I know it CAN be found, I WILL search for it tenaciously. Someone commented on the plot being ,,,whatever...not so hot?, but I disagree. It was a pretty short film though, short but intense. Glad I looked this up! I didn't know it was rated so high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sally vs. The Fire-place Goblins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the remake of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark looming around the corner, I thought it best to check out the original beforehand. And with that said, I can safely say that that was a great idea by me.Sally and Alex, two star-crossed lovers (not really) move into an old house, fix it up and hope to start a new life. Alex has a new bizz deal on the horizon and is already making plans to move, but Sally has always dreamed of having house of her own, and especially a nice lil room where she can be 'romantic' in. Well, unfortunately for Sally, this room isn't her dream room; it's bolted and bricked up so zero sun-light can get in, and nothing can get out; of the fire place that is. Small humanoid creatures make their dwellings in this house, and more specifically, down the fire-place chute where the ashes lay. Well, these lil bastids want Sally, and they want her bad. With warnings from an old man, and resentment from her husband, Sally is at a crossroads of belief, loneliness and horror.First things first, this is a classic made-for-TV horror flick that easily and speedily races up to some of my favorite TV movies. With really great acting, especially by Darby, a creepy-dark atmosphere, and surprising chills, this flick delivers far more than any modern film viewer would expect.Besides the film being so great, I did have a couple thoughts of my own. First things first, the casting of Darby was just fine and all, but yeesh...when paired up with her husband here, she looks like she's his daughter. She's pudgy, cute and innocent...and it's weird/awesome when the two kiss. Secondly, the film has a slight...and I mean slight, demeaning nature towards women here. Two lines really stuck out at me. One was, 'How's it feel to be the wife of a man with a great future?' and the other, 'I'm a perfect woman; stubborn and curious.' Haha, I may be stretching things here, but with the vibe the film delivered, and how the husband was dominant....it just seemed to feel that way. Funny stuff for sure, and take it or leave it.Anyways, this flick is great, and I'm curious to see (like a perfect woman) how Del Toro tackles the re-make. It's a cool as hell story, and with one of the few bright spots in horror today giving it a go, I think any self-respecting horror fan should at least be interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid TV horror show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970s was truly the golden era of the made-for-TV horror movie, and "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is a pretty good example of the genre. Fondly remembered by those who saw it at an impressionable age, it succeeds at creeping out its viewers. It's got very respectable atmosphere, and an appreciable level of mystery to its diminutive terrors. Just where *did* they come from? All we know is the level of fear experienced by our appealing main character, Sally Farnham (played by the very cute Kim Darby), especially as her stubbornly skeptical husband, Alex (Jim Hutton) doesn't take her seriously.Sally and Alex have moved into her deceased grandmother's home, complete with a study and a sealed-up fireplace. Sally wants the fireplace opened up, despite the warnings from their cagey caretaker, Mr. Harris (screen veteran William Demarest) to leave things as they are. Her curiosity gets the better of her, and her actions lead to the release of three beings who are dead set on getting their hands on her.Fortunately, Sally is not the type of person to only do the stupid thing, so it's easy enough to sympathize with her and be chilled by how the story plays out. Darby is fine as Sally, and Hutton is good as Alex; able support is provided by Demarest, Barbara Anderson as Sally's friend Joan Kahn, and Pedro Armendariz Jr. as the briefly seen Francisco Perez. Andrew Jackson's cinematography is appropriately moody and the music score by Billy Goldenberg is excellently spooky. If there's a criticism to be made here, it's only that the three onion headed demons in the movie (played by Felix Silla, Tamara De Treaux, and Patty Maloney) are shown too much, and should have been revealed just a bit at a time.Still, this is fun stuff and worth a look for fans of "old school" horror.Remade by filmmaker and fan Guillermo Del Toro for theatres 37 years later.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1973 flick made for television has so many followers that it became a classic in the horror genre. It was made in a time when horror wasn't that popular but being broadcast at a normal hour in the US some kids were really scared and as a grown up they still talked about this creeper.John Newland, the director was well known for making TV series but he made a few television flicks too like Crawlspace (1972) but let Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark being his most famous one. Due being a television production they brought in two popular names for the main leads. Kim Darby playing Sally came out of TV series to make this flick and went back to television and some other famous horrors like Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Meyers as Debra Strode. The other name, Jim Hutton also came from television series but also appeared in some classics like The Green Berets aside John Wayne. Sadly he died in 1979 at age 45 due liver cancer. They did a great job in this flick.But it was those scary little voices that made the movie. And of course the story line itself. It had a bit of fantasy over it and that attracted the little viewers but how many did watch under their bed years after watching this flick. The buggers itself doesn't look very frightening up to today's standards but it was the way it was filmed and edited that made it believable. Still, if you watch it nowadays it is outdated but it's a must see how they made a creepy flick just before the heydays of horror.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Story 4/5 Effects 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised this was a made for TV movie. As a child I was a Fangoria magazine reader and loved horror movies and Halloween was and still is my favorite 'Holiday'. Even as an adult, when people tried to scare me, I would not flinch a millimeter and drove them crazy. THIS movie was the only 1 of 2 movies I can ever remember to 'scare' me as a child. For those who have watched it and remember the centerpiece fright, that was one that got me (do not consider this a spoiler because it in no way gives away what happened and at what time). My mother had a centerpiece on the table VERY similar to the one in the movie and I eyeballed that damned thing for a good year. I really cannot say this was a well made, high budget movie, but as a whole, it measure up perfectly in suspense, the actors did well (a lot better than remake, that's for sure) and I wound up getting the DVD, clear from overseas, just a few years ago. Debated on an 8, 9 or 10 rating before finally settling on a 10 based on 'when' it was made and not against everything SINCE then./if you wonder what the 'other' movie was that scared me, it was one of the 'Buried Alive' movies from this same era. The movie 'bothered' me actually more than scared me. The scare came from rolling out of bed w/o waking up, then rolling in under my bed and waking up, trying to sit up and slamming my head into cross boards and having the entire movie flood my head. Happened the NIGHT after I watched it.</fullReview>

It made an impact on me because I was 13 at the time and I'm now 50 and I remember it well.Someone else must have remembered this movie because they've remade it.

		<shortDescription>Urge to Redecorate Punished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I was actually well into my teens when I first saw this movie on TV, and at the time I remember that I found it pretty frightening. For almost 35 years, now, I've had a fond (if rather vague) nostalgia for it.But having just acquired the DVD, I have to say that it has not held up very well. It's not that it doesn't have a few frightening and suspenseful moments. Nor is it that the creatures themselves have aged so badly. I still find their creepy "shriveled potato heads," as one reviewer here described them, quite effective. The rest of their furry bodies . . . not so much. It seems that for years, the default costuming for a monster body was, essentially, a gorilla suit. I don't really know why. I guess they were cheap and most of this movie is so dark that the filmmakers hoped that nobody would notice them.No, what's bad about this movie is that the protagonist does so little to save or defend herself. She's pretty good at getting *into* trouble; she's the one who was so insistent on opening up the chimney in the first place. But when it comes to fighting the monsters, she doesn't give us much to root for.The film is very talky and repetitious. There isn't quite enough going on to sustain the story. Even at only 72 minutes running time, it felt stretched to me. And it's not just the human beings in it who tend to talk all the air out of the plot--the creatures themselves are somewhat yappy.And what's with the opening shot of the cat yowling followed by the bizarre voice-over montage of the house? The scariest moments are the ones where Kim Darby is playing tug of war with the creatures--either with a dinner napkin or that piece of cord they used to trip the interior decorator. At those moments, the little monsters feel palpable.Another small pleasure was hearing the voice of Dr. Heywood Floyd coming out of the mouth of one of the party guests. I don't think I've ever seen that actor in anything else but 2001: A Space Odyssey. This must have finished off his career.SPOILERS FOLLOWAt the climax, when the little devils are dragging Kim down the basement stairs to her doom, again, they have a real and physical presence--because they're doing something physical. The movie needed more of that stuff and less talk.Speaking of talk, the most idiotic moment of the film comes right near the end when Jim Hutton (spitting image of his son, Timothy Hutton, by the way) drives in a panic back to Uncle Charlie's place to find out more about these little demons because Kim's best friend has finally convinced him that they might actually exist.Once he's there, William Demerest rambles on about how the old grandparents bricked up the fireplace and something mysterious lives in the house which has this long and vague history. What he neglects to say is, "Oh yeah, and yesterday one of them stabbed me with a screwdriver and also spoke to me. In fact, we had pretty much what you would call a conversation." I mean, wouldn't that have been more useful information? I'm glad I saw it again. Like Kim Darby herself, whatever warm and fuzzy memories I had of this movie can now go back into the ash pit and be walled in for another 35 years.</fullReview>

My kids all wish that I would quit telling them about how much sleep I lost as a kid due to the images this film left in my head. To this day I do a double-take when I go into a dark basement. Movies that pose as "horror" or "scary" today would do well to bow down and wish they could surmise a tenth of the eeriness that this movie puts out. I sincerely wish that some young, talented director would do a remake of this film. But PLEASE...do not UP the special effects and kill the story, let the original director's method of slow build-up of suspense and fear remain!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually, Be Afraid of the Dark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something comforting about watching these spooky 1970s TV movies that scared us as kids, but now hold our interest as nostalgia.The one thing I'll always like about them is that they were produced on generally shoestring budgets, and had to rely upon everything else other than special effects and gore to create atmosphere and suspense. This is one of those fine TV movies that we no longer have being made, when TV was a place for those who wanted to create entertainment, and not celebrity status.There's nothing I could add to the many comments praising this film as superb, except that it is worth seeing if you are able to find a copy. They are rare enough and no DVD either, and I haven't seen it listed for broadcast or cable in a long, long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought i would have to resort to the avclub to find this film before i sent my google query of "horror film made for TV woman house small creatures under fireplace". I've been trying for years to remember this film from hazy memories of watching afternoon horror films on the local ABC affiliate's "Dial for Dollars" - "housewives take an afternoon break before the kids get home" programming. I must have been in kindergarten or first grade at the time. This film along with "The Norliss Tapes" seriously screwed me up when I was small. That I could remember so much of it after 30 years ... I'm afraid to go rent it now and have it lose its magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been cathartic for me to read all of these posts. After seeing this movie at around the age of 6, I spent the greater part of my childhood terrified of the dark. I would not go to bed without having a flashlight and a clear view of the floor. Worse, we had one of those old fireplaces with the ash door in the back! It also didn't help that the entrance to our attic was through the closet in my room. Strangely enough, I can only remember bits and pieces of the movie. The memories of my resulting fear, however, are quite vivid. Great, now it's all coming back. I guess I'll have to find a copy of the movie or invest in a good flashlight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many others have stated here, this movie shaped my fears as a child in the 70's and left me permanently changed. At 38yrs old, I still catch myself instinctively looking over my shoulder when I enter dark rooms, even though I clearly understand there's nothing to be paranoid about.Along with a handful of other cult movies of the era, this induced many nightmares growing up. Easily one of the most effective horror films ever made, it skillfully exploits every child's most common fears. Using real people to portray the creatures instead of stop animation or puppetry lends a lot in the suspension of disbelief. I recommend that if you were terrified by movies like Trilogy of Terror, Gargoyles or Night Gallery, this movie will be a fascinating view....even if it is a bit dated :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, 112 comments in all! I can't read them all but obviously this film made quite an impression. Even those who hated it still remembered it vividly enough to pass comments. A surprisingly good creepy TV film. Won't be long before Hollywood releases a "re-make" seeing that they just can't really come up with anything original anymore. Just the usual Tits &amp; Bums to titillate our jaded senses or Blood &amp; Gore to satiate our morbid lust. Surprising why a DVD hasn't yet been released either.It should sell really well.I thought the little imps looked more like the Star Wars orchestra creatures on Tatooine. The same head, eyes, hands etc all dressed up in a monk's habit. But then the last time I saw this film was over 25yrs ago. .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Scariest movies ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in the seventies but never had the chance to see this growing up. I have a great affinity for the made for TV horror movies of the 70's. I am so glad that I finally ran across a copy at a video store for less than a dollar. Great deal for a gem of a movie. I can't believe how well done this movie is, it definitely has that 70's quality to it but doesn't lack when it comes to originality. Has some truly creepy scene's and the makeup that they used for the creatures looks great. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves horror movies. On a side note I always watch horror movies in the dark and after it was over I took the time to look over my apartment and I actually got a chill down my spine(NO KIDDING)looking around in the dark. When a movie can do that to me at age 34 it definitely qualifies as one of the scariest movies of all time for me. Hope anyone who catches it enjoys it as much.</fullReview>

I couldn't believe it when I was led to this site that so many people that had seen this movie and it too impacted there lives in a very maniacal way. It so scared me and my siblings that we would dare each other to check under our beds. We had some knock down fist fights over who's turn it was to turn out the light. Then the lucky winner would scream from the instant they propelled their body from the switch to the bed. Screaming until their body hit the mattress. "I think we thought we could scare the little furballs away if we yelled loud enough." To this day it still makes my skin crawl.... I have yet to watch a movie that has had such an impact on my psyche! I hope I didn't accidentally let my children watch a movie as eerie as DBAOTD.

		<fullReview>This film scared my mum and dad when they first watched it in 1981, i wasn't interested in horror films until i was about 12. My mum didn't know the name of this film, but she kept going on about this really scary film about a couple that inherited to this house, where a maintenance man told them not to unblock the fireplace as they moved in. Little demons etc. So i always looked in the TV times for possible movies with that description in the film guide. One morning looking at the TV page of the Daily mirror low and behold i went running to my mum and said is this it. A look of terror appeared on her face and a "yes thats it" came from her mouth. That night in back in 1989 i set the VCR and the next evening we watched it. I found it reasoanbly scary but not as scary as my mum who was petrified. My dad said i'm not watching that again, has still hasn't. I'm not sure what happened to the copy of the video, but i would like to see it again just to see if it was really that scary. There was some very good horror films mad in 1973/74 I also recommend - Don't Look Now (Donald Sutherland), Satan's Triangle (Doug Mcclure), Black Christmas (The original slasher movie, now being remaid and released at dec 16 at Christmas in the uk) 2006.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just commented on this movie in another review, but I didn't know the title. Now I do. This was a rather good haunted house type movie that does play sort of like an episode of "Tales from the Darkside". That is not a bad thing coming from me as I liked that show. This one is really pretty creepy and it goes at a quick pace and seems to be over really quick. This one has a husband and wife moving into an old house where there apparently is something lurking. There are scenes where they show the house and you hear people having these strange conversations. They seem to really take to the wife and the wife seems to be the target of their attention. The movie progresses quite nicely and has a rather surprising end. Really good television movie that could have explained a bit more, but not too much more. I can not believe it was made in 1973 as it seemed to be newer than that to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard about this for a while, and wanted to see it after all the praises it got. Now that I did, I'm extremely disappointed. It certainly wasn't the supposed "masterpiece" it's made out to be on its board - in fact, it turned out to be a cheaply made (the puppets were really ridiculous), dull TV fare with bad attempts at creating ambiance and too many obvious "scares" that could have been effective in 1973, but definitely not today. Actually, I doubt it was even effective in 1973 - "The Exorcist" still holds as the best tension-keeping movie of all time, and it was made in the same year. I guess those who praise this mediocre TV flick as "great" only do that because of nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly disturbing; Old school horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thankfully this has been released on DVD. I never saw it on its TV release, so unlike so many others I didn't watch this as a child. I'm in my 40s. I watched this on my laptop, alone, in bed with the lights off. It was really awkward in places with clich remarks from an old man about leaving things alone, don't go there, I'm warning you, etc. Other difficulties with this movie is the same with many other movies of this nature: just get out of the dang house already. Why continue to stay when all this is going on? But all that aside, this movie disturbed me. I had trouble sleeping with the lights off afterward. That is the ultimate tape by which any horror movie should be judged. And this was indeed "horror," because there were no "feel good" threads, no comic relief, no happy endings where some cute child saves the day. It's dark the whole way through, I mean that literally as well: the house always seemed dark or too dimly lit. And the music was very well done.My pet peeve with modern horror is that the genre has become nothing more than gory comedies with large waves of laughter and cheers ringing through the theater over and over. That is not horror. I also hate the constant "gotchas" that litter modern "horror" films. The old school horror films always make you think something crazy is about to happen, but it never does. This is "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" in a nutshell. You are constantly worried about something jumping out at you, but the director never uses such cheap "gotchas" to fool you. So the suspense rides and rides and rides. That's not to say that this movie doesn't show you some creepy things, it surely does. Even if it is dated, I found some of the images exceedingly disturbing.Bottom line: if you like modern horror/comedies you will not care for this film. If you like dialog and increasingly building suspense, dark and non-comedic film... try it.(and it was very weird seeing Mattie Ross through the shower curtain. I felt like a dirty peeping tom.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made for TV movie from the 70's about to get a glossy makeover. For a TV movie, this is wonderful stuff. They keep the number of characters low, use just a handful of settings, and concentrate on developing a twisted little atmosphere. It was complete in 2 weeks, but you could never tell. The little creatures are eerie and original without being comical. Things are whispered, things are moved, people are attacked, but it carries it off by keeping most things low key. The use of simple panning shots and quiet editing, makes it a film that builds tension with ease. If you are open to less obvious horror, with a love of practical effects, you should find a lot in this mini-treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy little TV movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that it's only a TV movie, Don't be Afraid of the Dark is a creepy little film that takes it's modest plot and does really well with it. The themes in the film aren't very original, and it's always clear that the movie was made for TV as elements such as the acting performances and locations used aren't exactly the best, but the film succeeds in spite of this and actually works to much better effect than many big budget yet similar films. The plot is intriguing from the beginning, and revolves around a blocked up fire place in a house that a couple have just moved into. Naturally, being a woman; the wife decides that she wants to use that fire place, and proceeds to open it up despite the advice of the friendly repair man. It turns out that this fire place harbours tiny demons, and now no one will believe that she is actually seeing them! Director John Newland does well at implementing a creepy atmosphere, and there's also a lot of tension as the origin of the demons takes centre stage. The fact that it's never properly explained exactly where they came from is a shame, however, but the ending wraps everything up nicely and manages to create some intrigue on its own. Small niggles such as the fact that lead actress Kim Darby looks too young aside, in general this film is well worth seeing and definitely comes recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark has Sally Farnham (Kim Darby) inheriting a large house that belonged to her Grandparents. Sally &amp; her career minded husband Alex (Jim Hutton) move in &amp; start to decorate &amp; tidy up the old house, they hire local handyman Mr. Harris (William Demarest) to help. One day Sally investigates what's in the basement &amp; discovers an old fireplace that has been bricked up, Sally considers turning the basement into a study &amp; unblocking the fireplace despite Mr. Harris's warnings to leave it alone. Sally becomes curious about the fireplace &amp; unbolts the ash door on it's side but sees nothing. Sally is unaware of what she has done, she has freed some creatures who start to terrorise her, threaten her, scare her &amp; try to harm her. Nobody believes Sally about the creatures, not Alex &amp; not her best friend Joan Kahn (Barbara Anderson) who think she is losing her mind. Only Mr. Harris seems to know the truth, what do these creatures want? This made for TV film was directed by John Newland &amp; is one that seems to stay with people for a long time. I first saw Don't Be Afraid of the Dark at least fifteen years ago on late night TV but still remembered it until I saw it again only last night, the film has always stayed with me &amp; it's one of the few horror film I can genuinely say scared me, Don't Be Afraid of the dark is my 500th film comment on the IMDb &amp; I couldn't have picked a better film, period. Time has been quite kind to it &amp; Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is still an excellent &amp; highly effective piece of horror. The script by Nigel McKeand moves like a rocket &amp; it instantly grips the viewer with an opening consisting of a dark windy night &amp; creepy whispering voices belonging to something... The character's are good &amp; we know enough about them to care &amp; like them. There are just so many scenes which make Don't Be Afraid of the Dark work, the quick glimpses of the freaky looking creatures, the bricked up fireplace just looks ominous &amp; you know something unpleasant is waiting within &amp; the downbeat climax. I happen think Don't Be Afraid of the Dark works superbly because it plays on our basic fear that something may be in our home, a place where we normally feel the safest, something that wants to harm us waiting in the dark, in a corner or hidden away behind a fireplace, you may want to sleep with the lights on after watching this film... Having said that hardened adults brought up on extreme blood, violence &amp; fancy special effects may find it a little silly &amp; not that scary, although most children probably won't sleep for a week!Director Newland piles on the atmosphere with a great old spooky house, dark windy nights, those wonderful &amp; memorable creatures with their eerie whispering voices who are some of the scariest &amp; creepiest in all of horror film history! Newland also directs with accomplishment that manages to make Don't Be Afraid of the Dark look more like a theatrical release rather than the low budget made-for-TV film that it is. Instead of blood, gore &amp; fancy special effects Newland goes for good solid &amp; scary storytelling.Technically Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is very good, photography, music &amp; production values are fine, the special effects are also worth mentioning as they are actually very impressive. The creatures themselves are convincing &amp; worth watching the film for on their own. The acting is good by everyone involved.I think Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a brilliant piece of film-making, it plays one of our most basic fears to perfection during it's short 70 odd minute duration, it's creepy as hell &amp; a film I will never forget as it probably turned me into the type of horror film fanatic that I am these days. I order you to track a copy of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark down, sit back, turn the lights off &amp; enjoy! Highly recommend, enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"She set us free-free!!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very much like with "Dark Night of the Scarecrow" and "Don't Go to Sleep", this is another of those relatively unknown TV-produced horror pictures from the strange period in the 70s and early 80s when they were being put out that is all about slow but sure pacing that gently builds up effective tension and dread. I saw the remake way before I ever watched this and I did like it a whole lot, I think it's one of the painfully few remakes that are actually well done. But after consideration I find this the better film simply because it's very scaled down and smaller in comparison, and to me its mystery and fear is a lot more richer and satisfying for it. The story is a pretty simple and straightforward one: Timid young woman unwittingly releases something awful from a mysterious sealed-up old fireplace, it firmly wishes to drag her back down into the dank hell from which it came and condemn her to a dark fate that's probably worse than death, what can she possibly do to save herself when nobody will even believe her? You can put together where it's all heading quickly, but there's still plenty of eerie suspense and atmosphere to it that it fills out the time nicely and it kept me interested all the way through. I'd put it as a buried gem of an early example of a creature-based horror movie that's told with economy and skill and is a very worthwhile viewing experience. It's just trying to tell a good old fashioned spooky story in a big dark house with little goblins running around, and an ending that goes for quiet chills rather than jump scare in-your-face thrills! I thought Kim Darby was very good, she projected just the right kind of vulnerability. For a little while it almost feels a bit psychological, like you're not totally sure if she's going mad or not.. She's so darn mousy that's she's practically helpless and is basically easy prey for the evil relentless tiny fiends. And while you do of course see the age of the makeup effects, I love the onion-head design of the twisted fairy folk, I think it's weird and neat and it fits the tone well. It's so clever the way they filmed them in a scale that makes them appear a lot smaller than they actually were, it makes them a lot more creepy and effective. It makes me laugh how they all jibber-jabber at once so that their high-pitched weird voices overlap and it sounds like they're engaging in a mad little chant! I love the bad ending, with the wonderfully foreboding exterior shot of the house with the spectral green lighting that appears whenever the creatures do, they've won and can wait forever for new victims if they have to... I think I get the significance of the cat at the beginning - it's just a black cat of ill omen, your pretty standard macabre image. Simplistic but very engaging and eerie tale of suspense and of encroaching doom and of how just perhaps we shouldn't always be so quick to dismiss the childish fantasies of those who swear they see things in the dark, for that which they're afraid of may not always merely lurk in the imagination... I like it a lot, great movie, and one that makes for perfect viewing on a Halloween Night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies you might have seen on TV late one night in your childhood years and you forget all the details such as what the plot is , and who starred in it and eventually you forget the title and yet you can quite clearly and vividly remember the imagery of it - that of a young woman being trapped in a dark house with a group of malevolent demons with fright inducing faces . I remember seeing this too from my childhood and it is very remarkable that a TVM from the 1970s has so far seen a grand total of over 160 people come to this page to pass comment on it . This must be one of the great masterworks of made for television films musn't it ? Sadly after seeing this 35 years after seeing it for the first time I came to this website and looked through a fair amount of comments that summed up my feelings and that is my memory cheated and much of my affection I carried towards this TVM might mainly be down to nostalgia . Reading a comment from 2008 it appears DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK had an average user rating of 7.3 and now it's dropped considerably to 6.9 which isn't too bad for a made for television production and far far higher than a great number of Hallmark and SyFy productions get but one knows the rating will fall further as more people either having seen this many years ago and rewatching it as an adult or people hearing of its great reputation and seeing it for the first time will be disappointed To be fair a lot of thought has gone in to the realisation of the demon people . . They're never entirely convincing but some congratulations for the effects crew for putting some imagination in to their creations . They are somewhat daft and yet when they're revealed their never as silly looking as they could have been . There is also something practical about the way they use implements such as a coat hanger to switch off lights as they stalk Sally . They do work best when they're unseen and whisper in cold unearthly tones . Little else is outstanding and the cast are very wooden especially Jim Hutton who is capable of giving light comical performances even in the most mediocre of movies yet seems entirely bored with everything here . I don't know if it's the fault of the cinematographer or if I saw a disgracefully poor print copy but I often couldn't see was happening on screen to due scenes being dimply lit and DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK - BE FRUSTRATED BY IT would have been a more appropriate title</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK (TV) (John Newland, 1973) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that this has just been remade (under the aegis of executive producer Guillermo Del Toro, no less) suggests it has classic status within the genre but, then, so many horror films from this era have been revisited during the last decade that it hardly matters anymore whether the original actually had any real merit to begin with! And, to be sure, this emerged to be just fair ? not really scary and not all that engaging either: the problem lies with the fact that the monsters that terrorize the heroine are not only given too much exposure but, even more regrettably, they are made to speak ? which rather dissipates their other-worldliness! Kim Darby does well enough by her role but, again, because the Gremlins-like creatures are introduced at the very start i.e. before the leading lady herself even shows up, there is no chance of the audience considering that what she is seeing is only in her own mind! Having grown up ? via Robert Aldrich's notoriously violent and sleazy gangland thriller THE GRISSOM GANG (1971) ? from the tomboy-ish girl she played in TRUE GRIT (1969; which has itself been reworked last year), Darby is here married to Jim Hutton, representing the rather hollow aspirations (that is to, say, be made a partner in some big-business firm) of every working-man-emanating-from-a-small-town of the day. With this in mind, he has little patience with his wife's 'tantrums' when she tells of strange goings-on in their home (a bequest of her grandparents) and that she is even seeing things. Predictably, when he gives a dinner party to impress his future associates, all hell breaks loose.The film is certainly tolerable at just 74 minutes but, typical of 1970s made-for-TV efforts, it tends to hold back too much, so that one ends up wondering what was the point of it all. Here, in fact, we never learn what the creatures are or where they came from, not to mention the real nature of their relationship with the elderly handy-man (former Preston Sturges regular William Demarest!). The finale is surprisingly downbeat, then, but it is too rushed and obscure to really be given much thought: although we are told why the creatures want Darby specifically and what they intend doing with her ? since she was the one to liberate them from their centuries-old imprisonment in the walled-up fireplace, she has to join their ranks (even though, when they are carrying her there, she tries to defend herself by repeatedly activating the flashlight of a camera that happens to be on a nearby table) ? but why would they willfully seek refuge there again at the end rather than escape out into the open through the broken windows of the main door (cue another stretch of enforced waiting in the fireplace with Darby in tow)?! Mind you, the notion of there being 'something creeping in the dark' probably resonates with most viewers (especially those living in big, old and out-of-the-way houses) but one would have hoped that something a little more gripping had been devised in this case. As it stands, the one genuinely unsettling thing about the whole film is the music score!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-remembered TV US horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although unavailable for decades, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK has to be one of the best remembered US TV movie horrors of the 1970s, up there with the likes of DARK NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW. Nowadays an insipid remake hasn't put off the scores of fans who were traumatised by this film's scares when they first saw it as kids back in the day.The story is a simple 'haunted house' horror yarn about a married couple who move into a new abode. The wife becomes quietly obsessed with the blocked-up fireplace and grate in the basement, and sets about opening them up despite warnings not to meddle. Soon she finds herself assailed by miniature critters with designs on her very soul.I'd never seen this before so had no idea what to expect, but I was impressed with this TV movie's atmosphere, which is more oppressive and horrific than many a big-bucks Hollywood production of the era. In many ways it's an old fashioned production in which the scares are more subtle than in something like THE AMITYVILLE HORROR with its in-your-face fright sequences.The acting is fairly middling, with the exception of Kim Darby who puts her all into the role of the frightened housewife. The direction and cinematography are fine. The only problem lies with the creatures themselves, one of whom is played by Felix Silla (of BUCK ROGERS IN THE 25TH CENTURY fame). We see far too much of them as the film progresses, and the fact they talk in drawling US accents means that they're not frightening in the least. They should have spoken inarticulately, in hisses or grunts, and they should have been kept in the shadows until the final reveal. Less would have definitely been more in this case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a horrible movie and isn't scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard of this movie and that it might be one of the scariest movies ever made. I was very disappointed. It might have been scary the year it was put out, and then maybe only to children.It made me laugh. The central antagonists are even kind of cute. And they're so small and puny, you could kick one across the room.The only interesting aspect of this movie is the clothing, the suits being worn during the dinner party are very stylish.It seemed to be a documentary of drug-induced schizophrenia more than a serious horror movie. There are negative political connotations to this movie also. Sally is portrayed as a helpless female, this is especially poignant near the end. So it is anti-feminist. If you want to be scared, don't watch this movie. If you want to see how a horror movie could be done really bad and laughable, do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective Horror Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973) *** (out of 4) A young woman (Kim Darby) and her husband (Jim Hutton) inherit an old, creepy house. The two move in and start remodeling when the wife reaches a room in the basement that she wants to turn into her work room. She's warned by an old carpenter not to remove the bricks from the locked up chimney but she does so anyways and soon she is being terrorized by some troll-like creatures. For years I've read how many kids this movie terrified when they were younger and I couldn't help but think of my own terrors as a childhood. I remember watching IT the first time my mother let me stay by myself and it scared the hell out of me so I can understand why this film terrified so many who watched it back in the day. The film holds up incredibly well as its 75-minute running time goes by very quickly and everything moves at a good pace. What really worked so well is the fact that the director really builds up the eeriness of something being in the dark but you don't know where or what it's going to do. There are many great scenes where we see the creatures sneaking out of their hiding spots but our female victim doesn't know where they're coming from. Another major plus is that Darby is so good in the role. You automatically care for what happens to her and you can't help but feel bad for the lady when her husband and friends begin to think she's crazy. This made-for-TV flick has more power and atmosphere than many of the theatrical movies released around its time. The look of the creatures are rather good, which is another major plus. In the end, this is still an effective little gem that deserves its cult status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shrivelled potato-headed midgets running amok.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging by the extremely generous IMDb rating of no less than 7.3 out of ten and the copious amount of praising reviews; it seems as if quite a lot of people suffer from a phobia for midgets with shriveled heads living walled up behind fireplaces in old family mansions. How else would you explain the popularity of "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", except of course by stating that yours truly entirely missed the point and brilliance once again? Admittedly, the atmosphere is continuously moody and the locations are nicely chosen but, seriously, those "things" living in the chimney aren't the least bit scary! Are they? They're like mummified midgets with oddly shaped heads and irritating whisper voices, and they're pretty much powerless because of their inability to tear down a brick wall. Sally Farnham and her blind-by-ambition husband Alex inherit the ancient family mansion and she immediately wants to turn it into her dream house. There's a hidden study room with a blocked up fireplace, and every time Sally mentions she intends to open it again, the elderly handyman gets extremely nervous and mumbles that 'some things are better left untouched'. The stubborn woman she is, Sally of course neglects the advice and suddenly her house is overrun by little creatures with malignant intentions. I notice a lot of people's opinions are influenced by the fact they saw the movie at a vulnerably young age and on afternoon-television. I understand and deeply respect that, but honestly wonder if the recognition for "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" would still be this high if it didn't rely on nostalgic values. As said, there definitely are some impressive moments of atmospheric suspense, but also a lot of dull, overlong and irrelevant padding sequences. Kim Darby is likable as the woman-in-peril, but Jim Hutton depicts what is probably the most insufferable and jerky male character in a 70's TV-movie. The ending might be a little disturbing ? especially for young and inexperienced viewers ? but not the least bit convincing.</fullReview>
