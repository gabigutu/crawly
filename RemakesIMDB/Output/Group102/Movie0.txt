		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is exactly the kind of horror movie you want to hate. It's a remake, it involves a child in peril, and it contains some (and I say "some") very nasty violence. Just watch--you'll have trouble hating it.Guillermo del Toro's new collaborative effort with first-time director Troy Nixey is, simply put, horror done right. There's a lot here that can be found in any horror movie that comes out now, but this one succeeds for relying on tone and setting rather than blood and guts. The acting from all three leads is surprisingly good, and Nixey shines as well behind the camera.However, at the heart of the film is a ballsy story co-written by del Toro that really keeps the film stable. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is originally based on a 1973 British TV movie that has been hailed as one of the scariest movies ever made. The remake features a new main character: Sally, a child, played by Bailee Madison. Sally moves into a new Gothic mansion with her father (Guy Pearce) and a new stepmother (Katie Holmes). There, she discovers a ventilation system where she hears breathy voices calling to play with her. At first, the voices are friendly. Then, they're vicious and violent.The violence of the movie is one of the reasons why this movie succeeds so nicely. The first scene is grisly and is, without a doubt, the reason why Don't Be Afraid of the Dark earned its R-rating rather than its intended PG-13. There isn't constant violence. In fact, there isn't even that much of it. Most of it is bloodless, but all of it is enough to make us squeamish and afraid.Another area in which the movie excels in that respect is its design. The mansion that Nixey and del Toro chose is gorgeous. The intense lighting, which Nixey noted as "inspired by Rembrandt" in the Q&amp;A following the film, is moody and adds to the heavy tone of the movie. The house is just creepy on its own, but it becomes creepier thanks to the creature design. Unlike what the trailer tells you, the creatures are pretty tiny. What creeped me out about them was the loud, shrill screeches they let out. It'll give you chills. Keep a keen ear and listen for del Toro, as he voices a few of the creatures.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a very fun and very creepy horror movie experience. Though not without its flaws, it has a strong story stabilized by good characters and a surprisingly dark ending, and it's got some good acting too. It's hard not to be absorbed in the mesmerizing light pools of the mansion, and it's even harder not to be entertained. As usual in del Toro films, darkness and unseen monsters reign, and as usual, it's pretty damn unnerving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much need to be afraid of this remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: beautiful scenery/sets, a few good jumps, and about 5-10 minutes of eerie atmosphere Cons: not very scary, too much CGI'd gremlins, and a very predictable/slow plotConclusion: rent the original and skip this remakeThe much anticipated, by me, remake of the 1973 made for TV movie of the same name left me feeling extremely disappointed. The plot was fairly simple. A young girl Sally (Bailee Madison) moves in with her father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes), into a house Alex and Kim are fixing up to sell. Soon upon arriving, adventurous Sally discovers the house has a basement and that the family is not alone. The basement's fireplace is inhabited by little CGI'd creatures that terrorize the family, especially Sally. The actors I felt all did an adequate job playing their parts, especially young Sally (Bailee Madison), who played a convincingly cynical little girl fed up with being 'sold' by her mother to live with her father. Overall the movie was very predictable and offered very few scary moments. The creatures from the original, people dressed in little goblin costumes, were sparingly showed. I think it was way more effective than the over-shown little gremlins in this movie, which looked to me like Chihuahuas that could speak. Save your money and skip this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inept, clichéd, poorly edited, huge unexplained plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is totally inept. It's one of those films where the characters behave so stupidly you can't believe it. Every scene is a horror film cliché. As for horror, there is none. Some of the scenes are so darkly lit you cannot tell what is going on and I have a feeling the cinematographer did not know what he was doing. As for the script, plot holes abound. Things happen and then are dropped. Characters pop in the movie and are never seen again. One scene will suffice. SPOILER: The grounds keeper is attacked by the creatures with screwdrivers and box cutters, he staggers up the stairs, falls face down on the floor in front of his wife and the little girl. When the husband comes home, the man's wife tells him that her husband has had an "accident". No one asks how he had an "accident" with a screwdriver stuck into his eye and a pair of scissors in his shoulder. I was really disappointed with this movie. I would say save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing To Be Afraid Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about the plot of the "Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark" remake, I was disappointed that they decided to add the unnecessary element of a child to the story. Ironically, the portrayal of the daughter by Bailee Madison was one of the few highlights this movie had to offer. With all the creepy Gothic imagery, spiderwebs and shadows, this movie failed to create any of the suspense generated by the fairly moderate surroundings of the original. The CGI demons were absolutely ridiculous, and with complete certainty I can state that the raisin- faced-doll demons of the 40-year-old original TV movie were much creepier. Katie Holmes, although likable, must be one of the world's worst actresses, unable of conjuring up any emotion other then a perky turned up nose for all occasions. It is truly remarkable to see her constantly upstaged by the child actress in this film who forces you to believe everything she is feeling. I can only recommend this as a starter horror film for young children, or background TV while you pay your bills online - you won't miss anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well. Where to start?This is a film that starts badly, and save two relatively well executed scenes, gets worse. If you have seen the original seventies TV movie you will be sorely disappointed. What made the original frightening was the bareness of the plot, the ordinariness of the location and the bleakness of the ending. All of these elements have been removed. The story is over written, the location of overly ornate, and the ending, although quite nasty, is not as disturbing as it should have been. Add to this the frankly deplorable CGI and iffy direction. Well...The kid is good though (that's where the 4 points comes from)Verdict: Don't be afraid of avoiding don't be afraid of the dark</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for Don't be afraid of the Dark a few months ago and really wanted to see it, I begged my boyfriend but as always he makes fun of the fact how much I love horror movies and didn't take me. So I had to wait for the rental and now I actually find myself thanking him that we didn't waste our money on this stupid movie. I love haunted house stories, I think since Paranormal Activity, everyone has had their eyes back on that genre of horror. So naturally comes a remake from the 70's comes along that was a haunting child horror story and let's make it the most ridicules looking thing you'll ever see in your life.In Blackwood Manor eight-year old Sally Hurst arrives in Rhode Island to live with her father Alex and his girlfriend Kim, both restoring it to put it on the market for their client Mr. Jacoby. Sally is depressed due to her mother forcefully putting her in Alex's care. On the first night of her stay, Sally is given a carousel-styled nightlight, the melodious tune it plays awakening the creatures in the ash pit. The next day, Sally wanders the grounds and finds the hidden basement's skylight. However, one of the workman restoring the house, Mr. Harris, warns her, Alex and Kim not to venture into the basement, although they do regardless. Sally takes interest in the sealed fireplace where she hears the creatures calling her name, and follows the mysterious voices. They are now haunting her and will do anything to get her down into the dark.Where to start with the plot holes in this movie? The creatures are supposedly scared of light yet can walk through a party where there is light everywhere and somehow they could make it under the table? Then how is it that the handy man is attacked by these creatures, getting stabbed all over the place, including the scissors in his shoulder and when the maid comes in he says he had an accident! How you explain that one? The tool box just exploded? Of course you have the cliché where the father doesn't believe his daughter despite numerous episodes of her screaming hysterically that there are things attacking her and then his girlfriend tells him to listen but that's not enough apparently.They also show a lot of these little monsters that are just laughable, I'm sorry but they did not terrify me in the least little bit. You step on them, they're little bugs, no big deal. They don't have any super powers, they have to convince children to follow them with stupid little faces so naturally as an adult this is just stupid. They don't fly, don't hypnotize people, don't have super strength, so it's just lame. The ending didn't make any sense what so ever. The only thing I could give the film credit too is that the atmosphere was creepy. The sets were amazing and did give a good way to give little chills here and there. Also when Sally looks under her sheet to see what creeped under, that was a pretty frightening scene if it wasn't for the silly CGI effects. But it wasn't enough to save the movie sadly. I was really looking forward to this movie, but it was a total let down, it's not scary or enjoyable and honestly after I'm done writing this review I'll probably forget about this movie.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be afraid of the dark.....be afraid of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the very creepy and scary commercials on TV, I was finally persuaded (after much resistance) by my friends to go see this movie. I should have put up more of a fuss because after watching it, all I can say is I want that 1:45 min of my life back. The couple next to me left halfway through the movie...I should have gone with them. The most entertaining part of this film was the audience's reaction to how bad and cheesy it was. I frighten very easily but nothing about this movie is scary (unless of course you count the preview for Dream House they showed before the feature....now that scared me!!) The movie had potential....the opening scene with the old man and the maid had me intrigued and I was looking forward to a good scare. It didn't follow through and I was left disappointed. Once they introduced the creatures the movie became laughable...literally. Every time they appeared on the screen most of the audience laughed. Their erratic behaviour and odd screaming reminded me too much of the 80's movie Gremlins....which I'm sure scared me back then....but I was also 7 at the time.If you're looking for a movie that will chill you to the bone, do yourselves a favour and skip this one. I gave this a 2 out of 10 only because of the little girl's acting during the 'frightening' scenes. While the other actors fell way short, for the most part her fear seemed genuine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Exposure of the Creatures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie looked promising from what I saw in the trailers. Little creatures running around, mainly unseen. The part in the trailer where the thing jumps at you from under the sheets, unfortunately, that's the only "jumpy" part in the movie. The rest of the movie? Well, we see the scares coming. The movie literally shows you where the creatures are in the house, and the room, before the "scary" part happens. We watch them run behind a teddy bear. They then move the bear's arms and have it say "I love you," which is what it normally says without help. Then they push it off the shelf. When the girl is taking a bath, we watch the creatures run up to the tub. We then see them on the rim of the tub walking slowly up to her, with her watching them. Eerie feeling? Slightly. Scared? Nope. Remember the first Alien movie? Remember it was scary because you didn't see the creature until the end. That's the format this movie should have followed. You saw the little things so many times, and not just their eyes. You got to see exactly what they look like standing still towards the beginning of the movie. That takes the creepiness out of whatever's stalking you. These little things use tools that are lying around as "weapons." They apparently can't hurt you with their own powers. It kind of reminds you of Puppet Master. As far as story. Very little. There isn't a "shocking" ending nor is there any kind of emotional attachment to the characters. I found myself actually praying that the little girl would end up being taken away by the little creatures. I also couldn't help but hate the father, and step-mother, because of their refusal to do anything about their daughter seeing things. When the step-mother, Katie Holmes, finally believes the little girl, she agrees that they must leave the house, but decides that it will be the next morning, because the dinner party can't be put off. This movie is only worth renting if you are planning on having a lot of people over, and adding your own dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scenery of the film is breath-taking. The house is exquisite, and as always, del Toro does an immaculate job creating an ominous and foreboding mood. The scares in this movie are well thought out and are not the cheap thrills Hollywood has come to depend on, and the film did a good job building momentum.However, that being said, the plot and its lack of logicality stop the film dead in its tracks. The stupidity of the film goes beyond the typical, "No, don't go in there!" that one typically expects in a horror film. The ridiculousness of the characters' actions makes this film frustrating and near impossible to appreciate. I saw this film because I love "haunted house" films, I'm an old Katie Holmes fan from her Dawson's Creek Days, and I think Bailee Madison is adorable, and therefore, I'm awarding one point for each redeeming quality in the movie - 1) awesome scenery, 2) Katie Holmes, and 3) Bailee Madison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a waste of time!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't read everyone's review here but I did get to zadaw's review. I completely agree with everything you pointed out! Here's some of my own to add to yours...Spoiler Alert!! 1. OK so when Sally went into the basement to unscrew the RUSTED bolts from the furnace; this is just comedy because there is no way in hell she is able to unscrew those rusted bolts! Especially with an adjustable wrench! Im guessing she's anywhere between 60-70lbs, she's going to need a whole lot more than elbow grease to unscrew those two bolts! 2. Bath scene; how the hell did those gremlins get inside the medicine cabinet? Did they magically appear inside it? Sally is smart enough to use a wrench to unscrew some bolts, and yet she doesn't have the common sense to turn the damn lights back on? Plus, did the water magically disappear from the bath tub or did she imagine taking a bath the whole time? WTF!!! 3. Dinner; did the guy sitting next to Sally not notice that something was pulling Sally's napkin from under the table? When she ran out of the dining room, everyone had their full attention on her and yet NO ONE saw the little gremlin running a few feet away from her? And when she was in the library getting harassed by these little creatures, I guess it never occurred to her to turn the damn lights on?! And yet, she knows that they hate lights! Good god! 4. 24hr sun? WTF??!! OK did anyone who was involved in making this film not notice that in almost all or maybe all (don't remember) of the scenes where Sally was sleeping or when it was taking place at night that there was daylight shining in through the windows? Take for example the last scene, it was nighttime raining with thunderstorms. The little creatures killed the power and you see a shot of the entire house in full darkness and yet, when Kate fell down the stairs and when the little creatures were dragging Sally down the stairs, did all the freaking staff fell asleep while this scene was being filmed? Someone kill me! 5. Kim falling down the stairs! C'mon, she fell down a few flight of stairs and yet she couldn't move and passed out? Ridiculous, I've fallen 10ft from a tree with only grass to break my fall and I got up and walked away fine! Oh wait, that's not all, she was WALKING down the stairs, there is no way in hell that piece of wire is going to make a cut that deep nor should it have, and to make matters worse she was wearing a pair of jeans! The worst thing that could've happen was this, she tripped, fell, used her hands to break her fall, rolled down the stairs, got up! Wow! 6. Rushing to get out; OK so WTF??!! Both Kim and Alex knew Sally was in trouble, and what was the first thing you see them grab? LOL! No, not Sally but a pillow and blanket! Wow, the kid is in danger, yet the pillow and a blanket seems to be of more importance to them! 7. The little creatures were struggling to drag Sally (remember 60-70lbs) into the basement, yet when Kim cut Sally loose from the rope, did the rope magically wrap around Kim's injured leg? And did the little creatures somehow magically got super little creature strength and manage to break her leg while the rope was magically wrapped around it? Causing her to be dragged into the furnace? Oh wait, and here's what kills me, when Alex rushed down the flight of stairs into the furnace, he as a full view of what was taking place below, and yet, when he rushed below how the hell did he not notice that Kim was in the furnace? This move is totally worthless! If you guys want to see some real horror movies check out Insidious, Lake Mungo, or Grave Encounters, any of those are a million times better than this piece of junk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often a movie comes along that changes an entire genre and becomes something more than just movie, but this is not that movie. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a remake of a 1970's film of the same name. Guillermo Del Toro, famous for Pan's Labyrinth, brings us this modern update along with new director Troy Nixey. The movie tells the story of a young girl named Sally that moves in with her architect father and girlfriend Kim who are remodeling an old mansion. Soon after arriving the girl opens a doorway that unleashes a group of small monsters that attempt to kidnap her and eat her teeth!First thing I should tell you is that the movie isn't that scary. What the movie focuses on instead is telling a good story that relies heavily on atmosphere. One of the best parts of the film is the mansion that they life in. What's interesting is how the mansion is treated almost like a character in that with all the construction that the mansion is undertaking, it changes throughout the movie. Starting from as an old building that holds secrets to a completely renovated mansion that is more than what it seems. From a comfy lit room to a dim lit nightmare, the mansion becomes the perfect set piece. I must give credit to the director for the attention to detail in every set and the eerie coldness that the movie makes you feel.The acting is good but nothing to write home about. Katie Holmes does a fine job playing Kim, the interior decorator and love interest. Guy Pearce does an amazing job playing a father you really want to strangle at the end of the movie and Bailee Madison does a good job playing Sally. The little creatures, which are all CG done look fantastic in the film, which is something expected when I see the name Guillermo Del Toro attached to the film.While everything sounds good and great and the movie does a great job at being a good classic horror movie with the usual or unusual twist ending, I still have a problem with the movie that is more an issue with the genre. That problem I have stems from the utter stupidity from the characters in the film. If some little monsters try and attack you or someone you know why wouldn't you do everything in your power to stay away from the house or at the very least be with someone at all times? Why is it that once everything is going to hell that all the characters decide to split up instead of forming a party? I mean seriously, it just pains me to believe that all these characters could be so very stupid. You know the little monsters are there but you still decide it would be a great idea to take a shower at night? Seriously?OK, I think my little rant is done. Overall I enjoyed the film even though I am not a big fan of horror movies and I think that if you want to see a horror film is that more creepy than scary than Don't Be Afraid of the Dark will satisfy your needs.Written by Steve Cienfuegos for MovieFloss.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was actually more of a sedative then a horror movie...I was excited to check the movie: the trailer looked really freaky and the cast spot on and knowing that Guillermo del Toro from Pan's Labyrinth was almost like xmas day ! HOWEVER... All that was a big fat disappointment: long, boring (even when there's ¨action¨), full of incoherences and plot holes. ***SPOILERS ALERT***- It was just one plot hole after the other (listed beautifully by another user): there never is any police investigation even if there is obviously a case of: intrusion/murder/kidnapping. When katie's character goes missing (=she sacrifices herself to save the little girl) by letting the goblins take her in their lair, it seems like no one cares as there is no police investigation to organize an excavation in the hole to find out if she's dead and where are her remains. when the boyfriend and his daughter go back to the house, they don't even look that sad but more like "better you than me/my daughter b*tch": maybe they were happy that the movie was finally over... - The little girl was getting quite annoying... the actress was actually okay... but i wasn't feeling much sympathy for her character. katie should have just let those little creatures take the snotty girl away. - The little creepy creatures: i thought the cgi was actually alright. But for 1 hour were obsessing about taking the little girl and apparently had a "Children-Only" policy, but in the end settle for the adult: why???! the creatures should have just taken over the whole household with the adults and all. would have been easypeasy and this movie would have been over in no time. Basically it was like there was no point to any of it. Certainly no point in watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soon descends into CGI nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea behind DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK has potential. It's a remake of one of those classic 1970s TV horrors with Guillermo del Toro as one of the scriptwriters, no less. It starts off with potential, featuring a leading role from Guy Pearce (always a favourite) and some great set design and dressing in the form of a huge, crumbling old mansion complete with hidden rooms and passageways.And slowly, bit by bit, the potential ebbs away, leaving this a soulless and artificial experience. It ends up being overexposed and under-written, a jumble of pointless scare sequences and endless CGI nonsense as the inhabitants of the household are repeatedly put at the mercy of some unwelcome critters. In some ways it's like a modern day GREMLINS, and it has a very childish feel to it despite the adult rating. There are parallels to other del Toro fare like PAN'S LABYRINTH but this is nowhere near that kind of calibre. The only thing it makes me want to do is track down the original.The film I most likened it to was, in fact, an obscure early '90s B-movie called LITTLE DEVILS: THE BIRTH, which was much better in terms of pure, unashamed fun - the effects were better too. DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is just lazy, with cheesy CGI and only one good scare all the way through. Finally, the cast is underwhelming: Pearce is a sleepwalker, Katie Holmes embarrassed, and Bailee Madison once of the most irritating child actors I've seen in a while. Still, at least Pearce got to team up with NEIGHBOURS' Alan Dale (aka Jim Robinson) for a couple of scenes...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the original as a teenager and thinking how creepy and unnerving the film was. And it was no technological wonder! No CGI. Just Kim Darby looking afraid. But of course now we have much more advanced ways of creating special effects monsters. The problem though with this film is enough time isn't spent on the actors struggling with what their daughter is telling them. Mom see's some old paintings done by someone who lived in the house and opens her eyes wide, dad doesn't want to listen to his daughter or girlfriend and that's about as much reaction we get from the adults.It needed more time spent on the daughter trying desperately to tell the adults what she was seeing and watching the adults try to grapple with it. Is our daughter insane? Is she hallucinating? Did she really see something? Let's check it out. None of this happens until the end.The film isn't bad. The photography is good but the acting isn't there for me. If my kid told me they saw something I'd grab a flashlight and start poking and prodding. I mean, at least it could have been some wild animal in the house. This is lacking here and it does make a difference with this remake, in a film like this. Could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lame Screenplay, Despite the Participation of Guillermo del Toro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Rhode Island, the interior designers Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) welcome Alex's nine year daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) that was sent by her mother to live with Alex. The couple brings Sally to the manor of the painter Emerson Blackwood (Garry McDonald), who had disappeared with his son many years ago, and Alex has invested all his money in the mansion expecting to be promoted in his business with the restoration of the house.Sally rejects Kim and feels lonely in the mansion and while walking on the real estate, she finds that the manor has a hidden basement. Alex's employee William Harris (Jack Thompson), who is a descendant of Blackwood, warns Sally to never go to the basement but the girl overhears voices in the ash pit calling her. However Sally brings a wrench and removes the bolts of the ash pit cover. Sooner Sally finds that evil creatures that fear the light have escaped from the underground through the ash pit and are threatening her. However, Alex and Kim believe that it is only her imagination."Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is a remake of a 1973 film that I have never seen. The cinematography and the performance of the girl Bailee Madison are great. Unfortunately the lame screenplay has many plot holes and, for example, the disappearance of Kim and the weird events that the guests have witnessed have no consequence in the end of the story.The DVD has interviews and behind stage footages and it is visible the interference of Guillermo del Toro in the direction. Unfortunately his participation is not enough to save this film. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "N?o Tenha Medo do Escuro" ("Don't Be Afraid of the Dark")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be VERY afraid of this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pointless remake of the 1973 MTV movie. Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) renovate an old house. They invite Sally (Bailee Madison), Alex's only kid from a previous marriage, to stay with them. Sally starts hearing voices from the walled up basement in the house. There are creatures there that say they want to play with Sally...but they have more sinister intentions.There was absolutely no reason to remake the downright terrifying 1973 TV movie--but that never stopped Hollywood! In the original it was a woman who was terrorized--here it's a young girl. The film is not graphic (how it got the R rating is beyond me) but it has its moments. The attack on Harris (Jack Thompson) is pretty bloody and cool and when Sally finds something under her bed sheets it's downright terrifying...but there are too few moments in this film. It moves slowly and is pretty dull. Pearce (who can be great) appears drugged out and Holmes is just TERRIBLE in her role. Very blank and annoying. Madison easily outacts them in a very compelling performance. It says a lot about any movie where the kid gives the best performance. The monsters themselves are gremlin-like creatures and are kind of cool...but no reason is given for their interest in killing people.All in all this is a generic and quite boring horror film. Skip it. I give it a 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you love stupid movies, with stupid characters that frustrate you and make you wish you didn't pay ten bucks for this film. If so you are in luck, because this one is a real stinker.Let's start with the fairy/goblin things. They look like the dumbest things you could possible imagine. They look so silly it makes you wonder if this was supposed to be a kids movie. And apparently they have the strength of a 250lb man, but they are only like twelve inches tall. You like plot holes, well this film has them. Such as why the kid didn't show anyone the dead fairy in the library office, that would have made them believe her, but there must be a reason.... no they just screwed up. And I like how a man is brutally beaten and injured, but it just gets brushed off as a accident, yeah okay. And Guy pierce is one of the worst dad's I have ever seen. This film also has one of the dumbest and most unsatisfying endings ever made. Did I mention the acting sucked.This is the rule book for a bad horror movie. Believe me when I say you will hate this movie, so whatever you do, don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant visually with a somewhat worn storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro is a man in Hollywood that nearly everyone has something flattering to say about. He's a visionary, a creative genius, and a breath of fresh air when the majority of Hollywood films are so focused on turning redundancy into a cash cow. But the films del Toro produces are just as intriguing as the ones he writes and directs. The Orphanage is one of the more original horror films in recent years and Splice, despite whether you liked it or not, delivered one of the most amazing audience reactions I've ever experienced in the theater. So along comes Don't Be Afraid of the Dark and while it doesn't leave the impact The Orphanage or Splice did, it's still a film that is done incredibly well.The lighting and the atmosphere of the film is what will more than likely strike you first. You're taken one hundred years into the past at the beginning of the film (according to the summary of this book) and it feels authentic. Candle light is the only light source and Emerson Blackwood's house is on the best side of the word magnificent. The tone is dark and the atmosphere is thick with shadows. In the present, the house is being remodeled by Alex (Guy Pearce) and Kim (Katie Holmes). It's still a beautiful house. Judging by the house itself, it's kind of similar to The Haunting remake from 1999 except Owen Wilson isn't around to lose his head and Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a much better film.We're then introduced to Sally (Bailee Madison), Alex's daughter who clearly doesn't want to be there. Most of the stupid things in the film can be credited to Sally. That and she's a spiteful brat for half of the film. After stumbling onto an undiscovered basement, Sally hears voices coming from a furnace that's clearly been bolted tight for a reason. After doing exactly what you expect her to, the source of those voices is unleashed in hopes of feasting on human bones to replenish its army. The creatures in the film are reminiscent of both the small demons in The Gate and the ragdolls in 9. I found it an odd coincidence that the creatures were hurt by bright lights and only came out at night much like the trolls in Trollhunter, which I had just seen the day before. However, the intent of these creatures is much darker than anything it reminds you of.The creatures are fantastically creepy, as well. Seeing this movie in surround sound is a must. Hearing these little buggers whisper all around you is half the fun of the film. It almost makes you feel like you're hearing things. When they're not driving you insane or hiding from the light, the creatures are off being incredibly violent and leave most of their actions on-screen. Their scene with Mr. Harris comes to mind and it's almost overwhelming. You can see where the scene is going to go, but it's still pretty brutal. The scene with Sally in the bathroom and the one where they're slowly approaching Kim as she slips into unconsciousness are surprisingly ghoulish, as well.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark has an amazing atmosphere. The set pieces are extravagant, the lighting is brilliant, and its creatures are ugly and menacing. The film fully embraces its own macabre nightmarishness, which is certainly the most charming thing about it. But it doesn't come together in a way that's completely satisfying. The actors seem to do the best with the material they're given, so the writing is more than likely to blame. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark falls into typical horror movie fluff as characters make stupid decisions, character development seems a bit rushed, and the screenplay is fairly dull for something with del Toro's name attached to it. Nevertheless, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark features some very vivid and wicked imagery that makes the entire journey worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this I was never afraid of the dark or those dumb little tooth fairies, but i was afraid of all the bad acting, especially Katie Holmes. How is it that they kill two of them during the movie, and no one ever bothers to take a look at the dead little fellas that are trying to kill everyone. So why is it that when the little girl is in the library getting attacked she doesn't just turn the light on instead of taking photos with the camera, it's the first thing turned on when the adults enter the room. Another excellent horror movie ending by the way(Sarcasm), Hollywood is really running dry on story lines. In the end really bad story line and terrible acting, overall dumb tooth fairy lore, keeping an adult as the leader made absolutely no sense at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfulfilled promise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two unforgivable flaws: the characters all behaved stupidly, and it wasn't scary. The handyman wanders around looking terrified but won't say a word. The little girl is constantly looking down dark holes and under her bed when she hears scary noises. The dad doesn't believe anything she says for most of the movie. Even after he does believe what she says, he still leaves her alone in bed while he gets ready to flee from the evil (fill-in-the-blanks).This film reminds me of early Dracula movies, where the fair maiden was always warned not to remove her crucifix because evil is afoot in the countryside. In the next scene, she's sitting at her dressing table brushing her hair, and she takes off the crucifix and drapes it on the mirror. And then -- shock! -- a vampire comes in the window.Loved the Gothic cinematography, but the camera work and film editing gave too much away.Sigh . . . another one with potential bites the dust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this movie tonight on release day. Was utterly disappointed by the screenplay, however there were still great performances from the actors. Guy Pierce is a veteran on the screen and he makes the storyline a bit more realistic, as does Katie Holmes. However, with a disjunct storyline and an ending leaving you questioning the overall relationships between the two main characters along with the general moral of the story -if you have creatures in your basement, just don't bother exterminating them, lock them up and let them propagate. Then of course, turn that into a movie which will garner a good box office. Avoid this movie for your own good. Insidious was much scarier in both atmosphere and the cheap jump-scares.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A funny thing happened after I watched this movie. I was with a group of people, and as soon as the movie was done, we could not help but stand together in the theatre, dissecting everything thing that went wrong with the movie. We were relentless, this movie had so many logistical problems and eye rolling moments, it was almost insulting. The story is about a young girl named Sally who basically unleashes tiny little killer fairies into a creepy mansion that is being restored by her architect father and his new girlfriend. What begins as an effective first half of a movie, ends in something while jarring, is incredibly disappointing. In one sequence, we are given an interesting scenario. Sally is trying to convince her father that the little creatures who are in the house are real, so she is given essentially three chances to do this. 1. She gets a Polaroid camera to get evidence. When she succeeds in getting a photo, the photo is snatched away from her at a dinner table by one of the fairies. 2. Rather than saying, hey look, that fairy thing is under the table, she scrambles after it into the library, where she is attacked, but manages to actually squish a creature with a book shelf. 3. Now, I don't answer to the name Sherlock Holmes, but I thought the body would be perfectly acceptable evidence. Wrong. This is just one instance of many. I love me some Guillermo del Toro, that is why it pains me that this movie fails on so many levels. After an attack on the grounds-keeper, Katie Holme's character leaves Sally to go research the creatures in a library, where, coincidentally, she is able to find out exactly what the creatures are. I hate research in horror movies, like everyone who is ever scared has to become re-affirmed scientists bent on collecting enough information so they could write an expose. Its such a cliché plot point, I can't bear it. It could have been even worse had their been a google page for these fairy things, but still the whole library scene was horrible. Every other scene had me saying to myself, really? This movie has scares, yes, but jump scares to me can be done by anyone with timing, and access to a loud orchestral screech at the right moment. This movie had little ambiance for me, everything was about cheap horror thrills that can equally be achieved by walking through Universal's Haunted House, where men in bad make up jump out at you behind the pulsing rays of a strobe light. Do I jump? Yes. Does it keep me awake at night that I jumped? No. The movie seems to tease you just a little bit with a few minutes of atmosphere, and then blows its load in a hurry suspecting we need something loud to keep us engrossed in the movie. Yes the odds were stacked against the movie from the outset, as it is a remake. But I had so much faith in Del Toro I thought if anyone could squash the remake curse, it would be him. Yes he didn't direct it, but he co-wrote the screenplay and his DNA is very present in this movie. This one, sad as it is to say, is a miss...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love horror movies and was so happy they were remaking this classic from the 70's. But I should have been happy with the original because this movie sucked...sorry don't know how else to explain what a horrible remake this was. Del Toro, what happened?...Okay a young girl, her father and father's girlfriend move into a house belonging to a famous nature artist who is now deceased. At the beginning of the movie there is a flashback and we see the said Artist and how he meets his untimely demised--down in the basement raspy voices who want teeth pull him inside a hole in wall because he couldn't find children's teeth. The maid's will not do. Anyhow now we are in present time and this new family is in the house and the little girl has issues because you know, no one wants her--her mother "sent her to live with her father" she starts looking around and discovers the basement that had been covered up. She hears the raspy voices in a vent that has been seal with bolts, she opens the vent-she really goes to work with those tool, and lets out the creatures(fairies who made a pact with some King long time ago)END OF STORY...Really there is nothing else to tell, after the initial discovery of the bad ass little fairies there is nothing else worth watching-Yea in the end Katie meets the same fate as the famous Artist but that's it...And Guy Pierce really needs a sandwich.</fullReview>

And good grief is the film bad.Like the re-make of 'The Haunting' the house is beautiful and so are the sets, but you come to see a horror movie to be scared, or be put under a little tension, not to see anorexic gremlins bully a little girl.Pearce and Holmes have zero chemistry and the only reason this hasn't got one star is because, to my knowledge the first time that Mike and Jim Robinson from hit Aussie soap 'Neighbours' have been in the same room on the big screen.otherwise, it's dull, don't let the Del Toro credit fool you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dumb, dumb, dumb... I'm pretty sure the writers forgot this script was due until 12 hours before the deadline..."wait...the script's due tomorrow?!!?" Let me get this straight. Your house's caretaker has an "accident" in which he stabs himself in the back of the knee with a screwdriver, cuts his hand with a razor, gouges his own eye out and then stumbles up the stairs with a set of scissors stabbed into his shoulder...makes sense. That must have been some dynamite police work. I especially liked how he's laying on the floor bleeding and the nanny does nothing. Get the dude a towel, water, some Robitussin...something. The award for worst parents in history goes to Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes. What I learned from this movie is that if your child has a traumatic experience, the first thing you should do is immediately put them to bed, in the dark, by themselves and let them be alone with their thoughts. Guy Pearce is a total douche in this movie. His girlfriend's clothes are found slashed by a razor and his caretaker has just suffered a brutal, violent attack in the basement. His little daughter is hysterical and has been attacked twice, Guy Pearce's solution...let's throw a party!! He was a real bad ass too when Katie Holmes got sucked down the hole in the basement. Didn't even try to get her back...nice. CGI rat dwarfs aren't scary either. I would rather shut my manhood in a car door than see this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this film is essentially like Gremlins except with monkeys in it. Now I'm sure that this is supposed to be a horror, except there appear to be little monkeys everywhere.Where were the monsters?Are the monkeys supposed to be scary?The film trailer is far superior to the actual film. The trailer is actually scary with the creature under the bed sheets. Unfortunately when you watch the film, you know it's just going to be another one of those darn monkeys, so it's not scary.OK, so I know they're not really monkeys, but every time I saw them on screen, they reminded me of monkeys. Since when is a house full of monkeys scary?That's the fatal flaw within this movie, it is not scary. They should have made it into a comedy. It was closely verging on a comedy with all the monkeys anyway.If you love monkeys, I would suggest the new Planet of the Apes. If you love horrors, I would suggest almost anything else out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparing the remake to the original (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This review has SPOILERS to both the original and the remake) I saw as a kid and was really spooked by the original TV movie from the 70s, with Kim Darby. So I awaited the remake with great anticipation, particularly because the original little monsters were so corny looking and could really do with a face-lift.Overall I thought Del Toro did a good job of updating the story, and improved it in some ways, but in others I think I prefer the feel of the original better.First, I'm of two minds about the switcheroo making Sally a child. Yes, the sense of danger is greater, the fear for the child. But the downside of that is there are too many people in the mix -- in the original it was just the husband and wife but now there are two protective adults and so the feeling of isolation isn't as strong, and they have to be pretty contrived in putting the little girl by herself over and over again. In the original the husband is often out and very often it's just the adult Sally at home, all by herself, with her suspicions and fears, which I found to be very spooky.Second, all the back story. It sets the creatures up better, I suppose, and gives Kim the ability to do the detective thing with the groundsman and at the library, but does this really build tension or make the story scarier? I didn't think so -- having a person (especially a child) menaced by ugly little scampering creatures is plenty, and I actually found all the back story something of a distraction.Being Del Toro, he just had to add a magical secret garden. What is it with this guy and secret gardens? I saw all that overgrowth and the pond and the Koi and knew that it would play a part in the final act of the story, but it didn't. It was completely superfluous! I think GDT needs to get over his magic garden fetish and stick to the story.The cheesiness of the original creatures actually was a benefit, as they didn't show them too much. Here we see these obviously CGI creatures constantly. I am amazed that someone who likes the supernatural as much as GDT does not realize that what we don't see scares us far more than what we do. Likewise, having things explained to us takes the fearfulness of them away immediately. Human beings are first and foremost afraid of the unknown. (This is why so many primitive cultures independently invented "God.") To show something, to explain it, is to take the fearfulness away from that thing. As soon as the creatures take over the screen time, the movie stops being a thriller and becomes a monster movie, and my interest immediately wanes. "Insidious," anyone? That recent movie was quite scary until the trainwreck that was the big explanation in the last act, which drove a stake right through the heart of the picture.One final thing -- that self-conscious playfulness that GDT sometimes uses in his stories is not so cute to people who also have some background in the same story. In the original, Kim Darby played Sally. Here Sally is a girl, but the adult woman watching over her is named ... wait for it ... KIM. As soon as I heard that I thought, "ah, she's going to be taken instead of Sally," as Kim Darby got taken in the original. And sure enough, that's exactly what happened. That lessened the tension of the story for me immediately.Well, this ended up sounding more negative than I really meant it to be, as I am a fairly critical person. I should say that I actually enjoyed the remake, I thought it kept a good level of suspense, and it was quite an eyeful as all of GDT movies are -- very handsome and evocative. Bailey Madison with that chubby round face and big eyes was absolutely adorable, and she's also quite a talented young actress -- she did a wonderful job maintaining a sense of mournfulness over her family situation, which explains perfectly her mindset in unlocking the terror from the walled-in room. Katie Holmes has a familiar girl-next-door affability undiminished from her time on "Dawson's Creek," and she's just about as good to look at as she was back then as well. I was a little surprised that an actor as accomplished as Guy Pearce gave this two-dimensional performance, but it could be argued that he had little to work with -- this movie belonged to the girls.I have to say that I'm very glad that GDT is no longer associated with "The Hobbit." I think he's wonderful at painting supernatural tableaux, but truth be told, he's not a particularly good storyteller, and The Hobbit, despite the dragons and were bears and all that, is all about the story. In "Don't Be Afraid" he already had a pretty compelling story from the original teleplay, and it still manages to hang together well, but despite its cheesy teevee movie production values, I think there are more scares to be had in the original. That said, go see this one too, if only for the female leads and the beautiful camera-work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can always tell a good horror movie apart from a bad one. In a good one, there's an abundance of creepy suspense and tension throughout. The suspense is believable, the tension has you on the edge of your seat from the first frame to the last, and furthermore, the big scare that'll come every once in a blue moon is uncalled for, and effective, to point when it's not cheaply done. But what's even more Important that the characters are somewhat plausible.Unfortunately, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is not one of those.You know, I actually had not the slightest clue that this was a remake at all. In fact, much to my amazement, a look at the original movies page on IMDb and it has a huge fan base, apparently. I'm quite amazed, because I did not enjoy a single second of this boring sludge. Then again with it being a remake. I somewhat have the urge to find the original, because I'm curious to see if it really is that good.Essentially here we have the story of a girl named Sally, who is cute as a button, but her acting is the equivalent of a wooden chair. I get the circumstances surrounding her character, but you'd have thought she put some more effort into it. She is p!ssed to be moving in with her asshat dad, played by Guy Pearce, who continues to suck at doing an American accent to the point where his acting is almost avant garde, and Katie Holmes, whose acting is like a robot. Sally moves in with her faux-American dad and his robotic girlfriend. They take advantage of the comfort of a lovely home, which was owned by a designer in the 1800s named Mr. Blackwood. The house is quite lovely, and Sally has a lovely bedroom, although she hates the house. One day, whole exploring the place, she stumbles upon a basement that the family didn't know was there. So they do some exploring... and Sally hears these voices from the ash pit. They claim they want to be her friends. This is her first mistake, she opens the ash pit. But then that's not all. The creatures are free because of her.So therefore, the reason were supposed to feel scared is because of her stupidity. Yah- huh. And they terrorize the house, and they want her, and... Yeah.Raise your hand if you would have gotten spooked upon hearing the voices. Raise your hand if you would have just turned around and went upstairs. Raise your hand if you'd have taken the hint and would have just left them alone.The script is implausible, full of character stupidity, and just lame. The pacing is seriously awful. We get boring scene after boring scene of boring and unbelievable dialogs. Worse, the creatures are RE-TARD-ED. They look like crosses between geckos and monkeys, in fact, is there a special effects category for the razzies? Because these really are worthy of it. Oh, and the ending...was HORRIBLE!Quite simply put, I am glad the original must be good. I can't imagine this movie NOT being a remake, and not stinking as a result.OVERALL: 1/10Pros: well, it looks pretty...Cons: This movie is an exercise in the typical cliché of "our characters must be stupid, otherwise it's not scary". And that's just the beginning of the movie's laundry list of problems.</fullReview>

This movie should not have been classified as a horror movie, its more so on the lines of science fiction. Now the ending wasn't gory, and the very last words the creatures say isn't that scary. I would have made this movie higher, if there would have been more action. Most of the time, the people talk, and the creatures do nothing but walk around the house talking to the little girl. If you like science fiction movies like, Godzilla, then you should get some thrill at the really cool action parts. If they decide to make a sequel to this movie, I might buy it at red box if I'm bored one night, but besides that it had an average plot and a poor/average climax.</fullReview>

I just find it tragic to see such a nice premise go to waste like that, but I suppose that's what they get for remaking a British horror film from the 70's and trying to crossbreed it with Guillermo Del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth'.Seriously, Del Toro's touch adds a nice bit of atmosphere to the film, but enough is enough, we don't need a complete replay of a little girl strolling off, getting lost in the garden or whatever and running into fairy folk all over again.This is not to say that Bailee Madison doesn't do a good job. She is a nice young up and coming actress with a bright future, but seeing Guy Peace and Katie Holmes both go to waste is such a shame. Guy Peace is particularly oblivious for pretty much the entirety of the film, and the ending is just so ridiculously anti-climactic, and everyone just seems completely bored to tears by this point anyway, so no one cares.No real scares here, some nice effects, but the "creatures" themselves which should have been the movie's highlight, also managed to just be dull and boring. And am I the only one who thinks they look like miniature versions of the Morlocks from the 2001 remake of 'The Time Machine', which Guy Pearce also happened to star in. In all, I guess it's good to see once, if you've run out of better things to watch.DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK -----5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I thought this movie was directed by Guillermo Del Toro, and it disappointed me that it wasn't. I did see a lot of the influence he had on Troy Nixey with his camera-work, framing and look of the picture. I did not like the movie though. It wasn't scary, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, etc. It tied-in every cliché horror movie story point, from: moving into a creepy new old house, neglectful father, his new girlfriend, a misplaced child who sees things, the people don't believe her until it's too late, the people that live there that know what's going on but don't say anything...like give me a break. And Del Toro was nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay on Pan's Labyrinth, so you'd think the story would be a little deeper. How is anyone supposed to be scared of these "rat demons"? The visual effects were horrible, the story was stupid, and the only reason I'm not failing this move is because I like Del Toro, Holmes and Pearce, so I'll give them a second chance...but not a third!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1973 original was just a modest TV movie.It had style, great atmosphere, some good scares, was well acted and paced, and had the nastiest little creatures hiding in the darkness that popped out every now and then to make you jump. That was enough to make it a memorable title, and it became one of the best TV movies ever. Sadly it is rarely if ever shown now, and certainly not on British television.40 years later, and we now have this 25 million dollar Hollywood remake, determined it seems to do nearly everything wrong.Despite being handsomely produced, with impeccable art direction, this flat film is all style and no suspense.An interesting prologue sets up the story of the previous tenant of the house trying to appease some hidden presence living in the basement behind the fireplace. He fails, and loses his own life and his son's in the process.Jump to the present day and in move a new couple, Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes, unaware of the house history. Guy is usually such a good actor, but here seems dull and uninterested in the script, and Katie is equally lack lustre in her performance.Along with them is Guy's displaced daughter, who is shunted between her mother and father like an unwanted parcel. She offers the only interesting performance in the entire film.( It has to be said that Bailee Madison playing Sally is excellent in her part and acts everyone else off the screen.)Hearing strange voices calling out her name, she finds the hidden fire grill in the basement and foolishly loosens the securing bolts covering it , hoping to free whoever is inside. Dire warnings follow from the house maintenance man who wants to lock the hidden room up again, but despite his efforts, something breaks loose through the grill that night.At first, before they are seen, Sally thinks they are her friends wanting to play, but when night falls and they break into her room and turn off the lights,she realises their true horror, and spends the rest of the running time trying to convince her disbelieving Dad and girlfriend what is happening.Admittedly, at this point the film does offer a few creepy scenes where the creatures are half glimpsed crawling along under beds and half hidden in shadows etc. Once fully revealed however, they are just another CGI marvel - reasonable unpleasant to look at, and quite vicious and nasty in how they screech and move about, but to be honest they are too small to do any real harm to anyone.Even during their multiple attacks on the child, she is able to push them off quite easily, and squash a few by bashing them with her camera or between the shelves of a bookcase.Unfortunately, the last half hour of the picture seems to fall to pieces.Credibility is stretched to breaking point when nobody believes anything is wrong in the house. Sally shows obvious signs of being mauled in various attacks, particularly when the housekeeper discovers her screaming in the bath with a ripped and bloodied shower curtain covering her, and a house full of dinner guests notice nothing unusual whilst Sally tries to fight off and photograph a demon hidden under the table. Even her own Father does nothing after finding Sally has wrecked the library in a battle with a hoard of the demons jumping up and ripping at her clothes.The climax, with Sally being dragged down into the basement where she will become one of the demons, is poorly handled and shows little suspense, and a ridiculous ending has Katie pulled down instead - her disappearance is then shrugged off so casually, with no attempt to free her, as if it was all for nothing.This could have been really good with the right approach, but this is a big budget misfire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous sets let down by a script that's clunkier than Metal Mickey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don't be afraid..." is a squandered opportunity. Let's start with the good stuff.I like del Toro; and there are hints of the magic of Pan's Labyrinth here: elegant exterior shots (and a sumptuous and slightly unnatural/enhanced colour palette for the greenery), a maze, smooth moving camera arcs instead of too many jump-cuts, a great sense of depth and scale. The set design is superior, so is the camera-work. Lovely.I also think Bailee Madison is extraordinary. She remains credible, interesting and emotionally nuanced every step of the way.So, what's not to love? Well, it's hard to be emotionally nuanced with this dog of a script.Elsewhere here, you will find other commentators who will explain the many holes in the plot, but I don't have so much of a problem with that. After all, if nobody ever went into the basement when the music started getting creepy, horror movies would be pretty short. Nope, I don't mind the suspension of disbelief, but what I object to is the lameness and one-dimensionality of the script - especially when compared to the delicacy of the visuals.Guy Pearce is eminently capable (LA Confidential, anyone?) but gets no chance to shine here. The only word for this script is: clunky. If you're going to separate gripping 'ghoulies in the basement' from formulaic 'ghoulies in the basement', there needs to be delicacy, surprise or elegance in the back-story. And this, dear friends, is agonisingly formulaic.Yes, there's a sort of twist in the tail which ties up a moral subtext, but it so isn't worth the effort. If I didn't know better, I'd say this was funded by the Hollywood agent who represents the Gremlins who haven't had much of a career opportunity since the 1980s, just to get them a bit of limelight again. What's that you say? They don't like light? Meh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited to watch Don't Be Afraid of the Dark because I'm a fan of some of Guillermo Del Toro 's work, I love horror movies and I haven't seen Katie Holmes in a watchable movie in what feels like a decade. My suspicions were first peaked when the trailer for the movie was so short and uninformative. I understand this is a remake, but a little idea of what the plot is wouldn't kill you. After watching the movie, I was unsatisfied to say the least. I agree with everyone harping about plot holes and how things would've (and definitely should have) been done differently by characters in the movie. However, I kept having a feeling that a big event, or plateau was on the horizon and as the movie boringly plugged on, I realized i would be let down.The movie did a decent job with the story it had. I almost felt like GDT started making the movie and got about 20 minutes in before he realized that the main idea in the movie wasn't very scary. However even if I put my logic and common sense behind and embrace the events of the movie, I still believe more was needed. If they were striving for tension, they got it, but tension in the viewer, anxiously awaiting something to finally happen in the movie. The movie began well and built up a great plot base, then fizzled and floundered.I wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone but die-hard horror fans. But even they would have standards too high for this movie. So maybe someone who just began liking the horror genre and hasn't seen any good movies yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>just awful... don't waste your time watching I cannot understand for which reason would somebody bother shooting this film in the first place. It is not scary it's just stupid. I am very disappointed that I was fooled by the medium cast (usually I enjoy movies with at least 2 actors I know) to watch this and I was disappointed the least. I could even say annoyed for spending my time to watch this. Who would actually force their child to stay alone in a house that someone was recently killed? The most ridiculous part is that they don't really get shaken by this and the father barely takes part in the whole story. Even if your child was only afraid even of something imaginary you would not leave it alone. Would you? OK I understand the need to let the child alone to make the plot but maybe more imaginative reasons could be found. Even for the most science fiction movies you gotta make it a little bit believable in order to make it scary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is all about atmosphere or at least that is basically all it has going for it and even that isn't even that good. This is simply a very forgetful movie, it was like 2 days ago that I finished watching it and I almost forgot the whole movie. The main reason I decided to check this movie out was because the trailer made it seem like it would have potential and because it has Guillermo Del Toro as the writer. This movie was a waste of time, I had to stop this movie a few times to do something else cause it bored me that much. The whole movie is basically a build up and the climax was boring and the ending was very disappointing. This movie isn't scary at all which made the trailer so very misleading. And the antagonist aren't even intimidating and the characters just wasn't even all that likable. There was just nothing that stood out about them and they are forgetful characters. Just pass on this movie, not worth the time. There is just nothing positive about this movie for anyone to recommend to others.2.5/10</fullReview>

Technical this movie is severely flawed with special emphasize on the editing. Marco Beltrami's music is surprisingly flat. If you want to take one thing positive out of this film then it is Lance Drisdale's dedication to his role for which he trained for more then 10 months.3/10 from me for the poor viewing standards and the backward step taken by American cinemas..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love a great scary movie. It invigorates me and i get an excuse to squeeze close to my wife. I rented this movie and thought it would be a roller coaster of shock and horror. Instead, I was shouting at the screen about how stupid this feature was. I kept hoping a little sensibility would emerge from one or more of the characters. A hope to no avail. The original 1973 version was a great movie and I was hoping this one would utilize some of the techniques Del Toro is famous for. The plot made no sense and the reasoning and common sense was absent just as the AFRAID part. I sometimes marvel at how too much money and enough yes men could make a writer/director make such worthlessness. Holmes tried her best to really act through this dribble but all of the actions and reactions of the characters made you want to just burn the DVD. The creatures were over exposed so much it seemed they were afraid of the dark. The adults seemed to have had a pow wow to contrive the many ways they could leave this girl exposed to these creatures. I honestly do not see any redeeming value in any part of this film except for the opening sequence. A molar extraction is more pleasant than this experience.Hollywood should be ashamed of them selves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not much of a "horror" movie except for a few good 'taken-by-surprise' moments. The plot is simple and I'd say this would make a good 'sleepover movie' for some 12 year old girls. The locations are beautiful what ever said and done. Love the house and the garden.Too much CGI and exposure of the creatures. They run about and expose themselves thus revealing a lot of themselves, making it look like one of those Disney's children's horror flicks, you know what I mean! Acting is actually good. It's just the poor plot, plot holes and way too much CGI is what ruins the movie. Could have done a better job but nonetheless, this would make a good children's horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do really can't classify this movie.Is it for children? Really it look like it was, but no, a child could be scared also by those funny monsters.Then is it for adults? Neither, an adult can't be scared by this at all.There is horror? Almost nothing.Is it a thriller? No.Predictable? There is nothing to predict.Is the plot any good? No, it's pretty childish.Is the script any good? No, it's pretty basic.Do you get in the main characters? No. They are uninteresting.Is there any suspense? Not at all. Also because you know who are coming and they are funny too...Do you feel any kind of emotions? Excited, fun, scared, disgusted? No, a part a single scene where the filmmakers (as always) pump up the volume and show you a ugly face. But you'll jump for the volume not the face.Are the effect original? Nothing new, you have see them million time before. Computer graphic.I saw this movie just cause i generally do like horror movie, but overall because i was reassured by the writer Guillermo del Toro and the actor Guy Pearce. To me, both failed this time. I gave this 3 and not 1 just for the guy who worked on the computer graphic to create those monsters.So what's should be the audience for this movie? I really don't know. This is neither meat nor fish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way to many plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****CONTAINS SPOILERS**** I really kept an open mind when I heard about this movie. I'm a huge horror movie fan, but this one really disappointed me. For one, their are WAY to many plot holes. First off, They don't explain why the little girl is going to live with her dad or anything, it just jumps right into her not wanting to be there. About 10 minutes into the movie the caretaker finds the little girl in the basement where the gremlins hide out. After he told the little girl to go upstairs he then tries to seal back up the old furnace that the little girl tried to open because the gremlins told her to. The gremlins come out and completely attacking the caretaker, stabbing him with scissors and cutting him up so badly he can barely walk. He finally comes up the stairs where the nanny and the little girl are standing, he gets to the top of the stairs BRUTALLY attacked and the cops don't question him, the father doesn't care, and you don't hear about again till the girlfriend questions him about whats in the basement. Once they give a face the the gremlins it takes the entire scare out of them. They are sensitive to light but yet you see them in multiple scenes running around where light is hitting them and they are just fine. Then there is a scene where the little girl is in the library and the gremlins turn off the lights and try to attack her, she finally crushes one in the book case and her dad comes running in with everyone from the party they were having, and she doesn't even show her father the gremlin she crushed (her father doesn't even believe her) she just keeps trying to take pictures of them instead. At the end of the movie, the dads girlfriend who was trying to help the little girl gets killed by the gremlins. Not ONCE was a police report even done. They just went on with their lives. If it were not for these plot holes i think the movie would have been so much better. They ruined the movie for me.</fullReview>

Doesn't creep me out like when I was a kid, but still gives me goosebumps. the creatures may have been fake looking back then, but not as stupid as the CGI they used for this one. creatures were not even scary looking.looked like a bunch of deranged rats. dumb, dumb, dumb. the acting was fine but the whole story line around the characters just did not feel right. Never really had a chance to get into the movie.Had a few issues with some of the parts: 1) when people die-police show up. did not happen either time.2) what's up with the creatures wanting the peoples teeth????3)the creatures were all over the place, someone would have seen them at the dinner party-spare me.4) dude ur girlfriend just got kidnapped by HORNY creatures-go down the whole to rescue her-get a gun do something-instead of coming back the next day for a short mourning...hope u sleep at night bud!!5) it was too quick paced and u don't have time to get into the movie.I will say the set design was awesome and did like the feel of the cellar, but the rest needs to be re-shot..I highly recommend the original if u really wanna feel scared-other wise rent this to help u get sum sleep...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect too much of this movie, but I was hoping for an interesting scary story or at least something to go "ooh!" about. Unfortunately, I found this movie to be quite boring, not at all scary and with no twists to spice it up. It had a promising start, but it's all downhill from there.... And it truly is annoying to see yet another scary movie where the characters do stupid things when they know something bad is going on, like being alone etc. Also, there was a lot of things that clearly would have be handled differently in real life, like no investigation of a bad "incident" etc, that just made it stupid. I didn't care much for the end either. Too scary for kids, too boring for adults?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Katie Holmes and Bailee Madison play their parts as daughter and step mom very well. Guy Pearce lacks the skill of a father. This could just be the Writers/Directors for making him this way. This movie lacks a back story unless I missed it with the flying words at the beginning, they are missing part of the story. While you sit there in your seat waiting for someone to know or find out what to do, you become disappointed with the actions they make. This movie is Rated R, that doesn't mean you will get to see something with the camera always jumping away from the action you will feel like you missed it, but you didn't, they just didn't show it. This is one of the movies that when you leave, you ask your self "What? How? and Why?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark...Do Be Afraid of How Bad This Film Is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first review of a horror for a while as I caught up with Guillermo Del Toro's piece in my return to the genre which I laid to rest for a couple of months. Oh dear, what a turn off!Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes are cast as the loved up couple trying to redecorate an old house and base camp their with Alex (Pearce) bringing Sally (Bailee Madison) - his daughter - against her will. But suddenly, Sally begins to see and hear things in the house and it soon becomes clear to Alex and his girlfriend that Sally is not living in a fantasy land.First of all, having seen many horror flicks in my time, this is arguably the worst. Full of clichés, a laughable antagonist, questionable acting from some parties and a dreadful story-line, a director of Guillermo Del Toro stature should be tearing his hair out at participating in this drivel. The main key to a memorable horror is for it to be first scary and second engaging - this is neither. Not once did it grasp my attention for more than a couple of minutes nor was it even in the slightest particle frightening. This was due to a non existent build up of tension, the frights being built around obvious clichés and finally, the villain(s). It really was an catastrophic, cataclysmic effort because quite frankly, I felt more intimidated by 'The Muppets!' Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce are amiable with the script they have but in all honesty, you cannot see any other reason why they would take up the roles other than a big, fat pay packet coming their way afterwards. One positive note, young actress Bailee Madison performed quite well and has been described as a diverse young actress. She already has quite a number of lengthy stints as an actress on the television and is a promising star of the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is as dismal as you heard. In my view, the only way the film could have worked is: no backstory, no more than 10 minutes devoted to who is who of the characters, and have the rest as frantic horror up and down the old dark house, part gleeful sendup part purely kinetic action in the vein of old Raimi and Gordon. Instead of nasty violence, gooey fun. And scrape anything that isn't of the funhouse ride. This goes on the premise that we see the silly critters, which means you have to exploit the inanity to your advantage. This yanks us in too many useless directions; especially the childhood trauma and notion of a scary (submerged) world of juvenile imagination, which was likely Del Toro's Spanish contribution to the project and just pulls in a half-serious, contrived direction.This is pointless as we have it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one starts out like most Horror Lites, with the Blands moving into a mansion with a large, well-lit basement set. Said basement set also includes (as do most Horror Lites) a host of cgi. This time around, the cgi are- get this- Tooth Fairies. They're fugly, no doubt about it, but real, real small. Young Blandy meets them and is (yawn) fascinated/scared and eventually unleashes cgi on the Bland household. The cgi wreak havoc on the Blands, but things work out in the end (as often happens in Horror Lites). Family one, cgi zero. It would've been very easy for the Blands to deal with the cgi: simply turn the TV off the way most of us do when it gets this bad.

A fantastic build up with great scenery. Then out of nowhere a huge plot hole. One so big, that it halts everything the movie has been up to that point.The plot couldn't have lost the attention of the audience quicker if a jet flew in and crashed the theater. I don't know who exactly was the creator of this, but if it was Guillermo it must have been a side project that he put five minutes into. It's just very out of character coming from him.The movie then goes in a dizzying fall of plot holes. This is the main one.**Spoilers** Guy gets stabbed multiple times, everyone writes it off as an accident. Cops show up and do nothing. I don't know what else needs more be said. All the characters seem to not care afterwards, and the movie moves on without any explanation. It's insulting. "Hey look at this giant thing on screen, now forget about it!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark was advertised as the best horror movie of the year. No matter what year it was realised it will never even come come close to being a good horror movie, let alone the best.This film is a Gothic fairytale that takes place in a beautiful mansion in Providence. Sally moves in with her father and father's girlfriend. As she explores the mansion, she soon discovers a horde of evil faeries which live deep beneath the residence, and its Sally who sets them free.First of all i feel they exposed the 'little creatures' way too early. If they had of kept the mystery going for slightly longer, the movie may have held my attention for longer as well. Once i caught sight of the 'little creatures,' the movie became laughable. Every time they appeared on the screen i just shook my head in sheer disappointment. Also, their erratic behaviour and odd screaming reminded me of the Gremlins.The only scene that I enjoyed was the opening sequence. The actions between the old man and the maid left me intrigued, and created a certain mystery. This however led to believe that this movie was going to be a lot better than it was.One of the most interesting things used in the movie is the mansion that the family live in. The mansion is treated almost like a character in that with all the construction that is being undertaken, it changes and develops just as a character would. It starts out as an old building which holds secrets, to a renovated mansion that is more than what it seems. From a comfortable lit room, to a dim lit nightmare the mansion is the perfect set piece. Saying that its just a pity that the story did not live up to the creative setting.Whats most frustrating about this film, is that the story behind it is actually quite an original one, but they fail to focus on this at any point, and simply fail to tell the story. You briefly find out about some creatures and the sacrifice of a child. The fact that the filmmakers did not go into any depth to the background of the story, just makes it more confusing. I believe that this film would of been more enjoyable if they had of focused on the true origin of the narrative.Don't be afraid to give this one a miss, because you are not missing much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the good old days ( the 80's) there were plenty of movies that had a big scary looking house and creatures running wild in it, puppet master, ghoulies and countless others come to mind. Now I don't say those movies were masterpieces; if you remove the fluffy nostalgia look and see them again they might crumble under scrutiny but what the best of those movies had was one magic word..pace. And this is besides the fact they knew what they were and didn't take themselves that serious, which is always charming.So now we have basically the same sort of movie but with a better budget and the man who brought us "Hellboy" and the very underrated " Pan's labyrinth". Needless to say expectations were rather high. I was hoping to find the tongue in cheek from the old days combined with the fairy tale like evil this director ( here screenplay writer if I am correct) brings to his movies. Nothing like that can be found here. I hit the fast forward button twice..near the end, to keep myself from nodding off. So short and not so sweet what do we have;1. pacing is dreadful, although a lot happens it feels boring and long 2. the main lead, the actress who plays the little girl creates just about the level of sympathy that you actually hope that the little creatures get her in the first 10 minutes, which is a sin in this type of a " child in peril" movie..you need a basic feeling of caring for the lead, cheering for the evil grey smurfs to get her wasn't part of the plan, fairly certain of that. 3. Guy Pearce, great actor, has nothing to do and is forced to behave like an idiot from going overprotective at first to self centered to protective again 4. Plot holes big enough to hide Godzilla and his ( or her?) luggage in. My favorite; the handyman is attacked by the creatures, crawls on the stairs bleeding, is whisked away to a hospital and no one really refers to it or even visits him until in the final part of the movie. Although it is clear that the description " accident" is moronic. Same with keeping the little girl in the house where it is really clear it isn't safe just because its a needed ( and crude) plot device. Or another one, one of the creatures gets mushed,a corpse and a little arm are clearly visible and a whole bunch of people enter that room seconds later; no one refers to it or finds it strange and they keep the girl in the house after that event??? Duh; lazy writing. 5. the creatures are as big as a small smurf, no one - well on occasion 2 times- thinks of stepping on them or doing them harm. If I would be besieged by grey smurfs from the netherworld and my salvation would lie in a big boot on my foot I would use it, but hey, perhaps I am too assertive. Only 2 evil hairy grey smurfs where killed during the making of this movie. So any redeeming points??Well Katie Holmes is surprisingly good, she tries hard to make something of her one dimensional character and Guy Pearce is good but - sigh- wasted. Photography is nicely done, the atmosphere of the house is spot on. Creatures are digital ( in the old days it was stop motion..ah well) but well done. Origin of the story ( NOT the execution) is original. I never saw the original version but this felt as a compromise to please all audiences and as a result a miss on almost every level, which is a shame, because there aren't that many creature flicks out there with a budget. Seems that Guillermo del Toro keeps the best material for himself. Not worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"don't be afraid of this movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>okay, let me be frank by saying that i'm a fan of the Guillermo Del Toro films. Any project he touches is usually golden, so i went into this film expecting the same. But, sadly, this is not a film i will be watching again and may forget it ever existed. I won't go into too many details but just point out the flaws i noted watching this movie.#1 The characters: Normally in a horror movie you're supposed to feel some concern for the characters within, thus enriching the experience and simulating danger. But sadly the only character i felt any concerned for at all for was the old maintenance man. Let me say right now, I loathe Mary sue type characters. Those character that are just so perfect that i actually want the creatures in the film to kill them. In this movie it's the step mother and the child that made me think that way, they are both just way too perfect and in the step mom's case way too flat. In fact the little girl for the majority of the movie felt like a freaking deus ex machina for the plot. Basically the plot didn't take a single step forward unless she was involved.#2 Insulting the audiences intelligence: Okay, i've seen this show up in a lot of movies lately, and this movie is the worst about it. I won't give spoilers on this point but i have to say something so i'll leave it at this. Children don't mysteriously know squat about decades old seized bolts, let alone the tricks to remove them (i.e. applying penetrating oil). They also just blatantly state a part of a scenario about something in the scene one minute then completely change it without a single plot point to explain the plot devices disappearance the next minute so they can move the plot along (the welded line). if anyone has seen this movie they'll know what scene i am talking about.#3 The scares: If you're going to make a horror movie you have to build suspense. There isn't one scene in this entire movie, where i felt like i didn't know where the monster is going to attack you from. They outright show you the monster and where it's hiding. Just because you have a monster in a movie doesn't automatically make the movie scary. Good horror movies are all about the building of suspense by creating a fear of the unknown hatchet combined with perfect timing for when the audience is freaking out the most.Long story short, this movie sucks as a horror movie. let's stop calling it "don't be afraid of the dark" and change it to "don't be afraid of this movie"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't really recommend this movie, They could have done so much more with it, a few disappointments that I had was: 1. Sally took all these pictures and not one of them was used as the evidence of the existence of the monsters, then finally she smashed one of them, and still nothing. I think the director did not have any grasp of timeline and ran through scenes that needed more time but then got stuck on other scenes that was not necessary.I think IF we had a better director, scene writers and little more depth to the movie it could have been a great movie, unfortunately everything that is needed to make a great horror movie was missing, so I give it a 2 out of 10. The 2 points are mainly because I thought the actors/actresses did a great job.</fullReview>

I can't imagine how many movies they had to watch for making this epic horror movie... The creature was like a Compsognathus(from Lost Word)transformed into a Light-Allergic chupacabra which seems to have just given a chance in a 'wrong turn' movie and only given scissors &amp; razors instead of chain-saw due to the lack of its size...(poor creature) Most of the blunders are mentioned by other friends before.....so i am not gonna repeat those.....

		<fullReview>I am in no way a professional movie critic. And this is the first time I even bother to write a review on IMDb but after the opening scene I was already regretting being in the theater watching this piece of crap.For starters, the storytelling is horrible. The characters reasoning is taken out of a kindergarten play book. The film making is awful in a way that not even Martin Campbell could reach with Green Lantern. The only star I could give to this movie is for the young Bailee Madison, poor girl had to go though such a pile of insanity while all her potential was being flushed down the wicked "monsters". To sum up, in my humble opinion as a movie aficionado that could enjoy a cheap B-series movie, I would advice every single person with a little taste not to pay a dime for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the year of good scary thrills, 2011 had some bad ones. Such as the bland horror thriller Apollo 13, and a letdown called Don't be afraid of the Dark, which is co-written by Guillermo Del Toro. What starts off as a promising scary flick basically evaporates as you watch it.The film revolves around a young troubled girl(Bailee Madison) who goes to live with her father and future step-mom(Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes) in a big old house. There she communicates to these goblins who basically want to feed off of her to stay alive.The film has a promising start and could've been good. But unfortunately who feels way too cartoonish. I mean, we see here what we saw, basically, in The Spiderwick Chronicles. It's like a horror film for kids, which it shouldn't have been. We know that Del Toro is a visual wizard, but they should'nt have branded it as a horror movie. Because it's just not scary.Also, director Troy Nixey's film suffers from the clichés of your typical haunted house thriller. The troubled child, the disbelieving dad, the creatures... we've seen it all before, and most likely better.I hate Guy Pearce here. His character is really pointless and dull, and even annoying. I like Pearce, and it may just be the source material, but he is weak here. And I do like Holmes as the sweet, trying future step mom. But the ending is terrible and annoying. It's another one of those "woulda, coulda, shoulda" films. I was fairly disappointed with Don't Be Afraid of the Dark.C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ludicrous farrago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exactly who is this movie supposed to appeal to? The principal character (taking up something like 70% of the screen time) is a singularly unprepossessing, permanently sulky infant. The human cast is essentially rounded out by her preoccupied parents, who are pretty much ciphers as characters. The 'threat' is a bunch of the most ridiculous monsters ever dreamed up - sort of a cross between Dobby the house-elf and a mangy rat. I was rather inclined to sympathize with the monsters - after all they're small and they're there first, so they are pretty much the underdogs in this story. But they're not really very appealing, tending to scurry around and gesticulate a lot. Basically the only people I can imagine finding this movie satisfying would be those looking for Gothic design and moody lighting, and not at all concerned about plot or character. If that's your thing, then there's a certain amount to enjoy here. Kids who can identify with the sulky protagonist might be another possible audience - but the film is R rated, and so hardly targeted at the under 10 market. I've given is two out of ten purely for visual elements - it clearly deserves zero for plot and character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The haunted house formula is old school, but when executed properly, you get films such as Paranormal Activity and Insidious (to name a couple of recent entries). And then you have movies like Don't be Afraid of the Dark. It is bad enough that this film is neither scary nor imaginative, but coming from Guillermo del Toro, it's somewhat shocking. How could he be so lazy. Some of the dark twisted fairy tale qualities that made Pan's Labyrinth memorable are present here, but it comes across as almost tacky. I find the concept of little voices in the air vents almost humorous to be honest.Everything about this movie is a cliché. It's tired, unimaginative, poorly shot, and hard to recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film ended, my friend and I looked at each other the same way and knew we had something here to talk about. Trust me it was not positive, although this movie did have some areas that it did OK on.To begin with, the directing was good but nothing to write home about. The same is true for the acting - it held its end of the bargain up. The photography, lighting, and sound was actually some of the redeeming elements of this film.As for the two most important elements of storytelling, this movie just plain whiffed on the attempt.The first important thing it failed at was to TELL the story. Sounds like that would be hard to do, but this film accomplished just that. It did ramble on fairly quickly about some creatures, a little girl, and touched base on the prior occupants of the home as well as the new owners. It threw in a couple of make you jump scenes and then just kind of died from there. The fact that it did not go into any depth in some of the most important areas, lets us down as viewers. I believe that this idea really had a chance to work, if just a little more time was taken to fluff up the tale, especially the history of the little beings that dwelled in the dark in the basement. "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" gave it a small try, but that is about it.The second place it really, really failed was the ending. Without going into detail, all I will say is this film crash-landed. The "Movie Pulse" section of the review will give you a good idea of how bad the landing was.That being said, the movie did not warrant a D or lower grade. It was a fun little tale and it will let you think throughout the film that it will sink its teeth in you eventually. Well, it never really did, and it bombed the ending, but we had fun getting there I guess. Perhaps rent it on DVD when it comes out maybe just for fun, but please do not think you will come away with anything more than that.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Gothic Short Story Throwback to my Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard many bad reviews of this movie, but I went in with the open mind of one who loves creepy short Gothic stories and old haunted mansions. The movie was unique, atmospheric, and emotionally effective. I used to love sitting and reading old Alfred Hitchcock tomes at the public library when I was little, and listening to old scary radio shows on my AM transistor, a little black boxy thing I clung to late at night... this movie really captures that feeling as I remember it.I remember the original, it's a classic, what I remember the most is how in the end when they play that really scary music as they show the black cat sitting beneath the porch... I always thought that was really funny.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a Gothic fairy tale that takes place in a beautiful old mansion, in Providence, RI, home of the inimitable author H.P. Lovecraft and The Eagles's song The Last Resort, where a horde of evil faeries live deep beneath and Sally sets them free when the family finds the old barricaded basement and workshop of the grounds keeper's grandfather, an artist who lived in the home for many years, and who drew unpublished works warning of the creatures who once took his son from him. Will Sally become their next victim as they come up to feed only once every hundred years? Everything visual is quite visceral, from the rosewood trees, the Koi pond, the front door to the windows, all the aesthetics are beautifully captured in light and shadow. The directing is exceptional, the music while fitting is rather stock and forgettable.In the end Sally's parents must save her from becoming the next victim to the evil she unwittingly unleashed upon them.I know a lot of people don't like Katie Holmes but I thought she did a good job here as Kim, the caring and uncertain mothe figure to Sally and girlfriend to her father Alex, so that in the end her sacrifice is felt not just by Sally and her father, but by the audience as well.Even though Sally is not the daughter of Kim in the movie, the actress who played her Bailee Madison, looks a lot like Katie Holmes.The runes scratched into the top of the basement furnace reads: BE AFRAID.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous and empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mere setting of this movie garnered me more unease than the so-called story line! Although the acting was truly uninspired and unconvincing, the dialog and lack of any sort realistic response to being confronted by the supernatural evil in the estate was the final straw. What infuriated me even more was the fact that the 1973 original of the same title did a masterful job of exploiting the eerie atmosphere and mystique of the "fairies". They were MUCH too visible in this flop. Another failure in the film is the glaring inconsistencies as it relates to the creatures fear of bright light and selective targeting of victims (see: the groundskeeper). There are SO many points in the movie where proof would be evident, but is apparently and blindly over looked. This movie insults anyone with any shred of common sense (like the grounds keeper's facial wounds being unbandaged and unwashed by the hospital staff). Avoid this flop of a movie unless you enjoy being bombarded by stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the mighty have fallen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, in the years I've been a member of this website (since 2003), this is the most hurtful blow I've taken. I've fell a victim for online reviews written by people related to the makers of the movie, concerned friends and family or what I suspect in this movie case, the "paid" hired help. This movie is terrible. I've never walked out on a movie before no matter how bad it was but my wife had to keep pulling my arm to stop me from storming out of the theater in rage and shame at Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes. Both names have made immortal art pieces at some time in their past (Memento for Mr Pearce and Go for msz Cruze). What compelled them to participate in such a monstrosity as this movie is beyond me. All I can think of is that they needed money badly. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF GUY PEARCE OR KATIE HOLMES DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. I wish someone told me this before I saw the movie because all of a sudden I don't really feel like watching either one's future movies. Now, to review the movie real quick, the story line had great potential. The acting CGI and soundtrack were all offensive to the sane, sober movie goer. The "monsters" are not fit to be in a Disney fairytale production. They looked like a conception of a freshman in computer-design major. The first time the creatures were revealed, the whole movie house broke out in laughter, THAT bad.The last thing that I have to mention, those IMDb vote results are rigged. NOT by IMDb itself, obviously. A breakdown of the votes show me 400+ votes were 10. A number that no other "scary movie" has ever gotten. Scary movies are entertaining but they are not 10. But, hey, to each his own. A further breakdown reveals that 81 US users and 244 non-US users gave it 10. Hmmmm... A movie produced in the US, set in the US and is as American as a cheeseburger and yet the bulk majority of the people who thought it PERFECT are non US residents... Sounds too fishy. Why another reviewer here subscribes to IMDb and sings all glory to this movie while other "disputably" good movies were all rated one by that same user tells me there is money involved.Bottom line, the movie is a complete waste of time and money. This movie will go down to the film history as The Fiasco of Guy Pearce, Katie Holmes and Mr del Toror. 2 out of 10 for the fact that someone actually bothered and made this movie at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes this movie is not without flaws and maybe plot holes. But if there is a moment that I start actively seeking for plot holes and start lengthy debates about them, would mean I should stop watching movies and do something different. If I don't like something I move on and don't try to convince others how bad it is. So why did this movie work for me and not so much for many others here? Well it's not your typical slasher horror where lots of people die or get hurt. Actually no one dies and only one person gets badly hurt. Del Toro didn't direct this but as writer of the screenplay his influence is there. The story and character development must come from his hand and are for me the best parts of the movie. The performances of the 3 main characters and the interaction between them is splendid. Especially the young Bailee Madison as Sally blew me away. She carried this movie and deserves all the praise for pulling of such a difficult role for a child. I haven't seen the original and remain reluctant to do so. I know Sally was originally an adult. for some reason I don't think an adult as Sally works that well after seeing this movie. And another strong point is of course the setting, wow that mansion was just perfect for it. Beautiful interior and garden but than the contrast with that creepy cellar, splendid. And last but not least there is the creatures. OK their back story is not the most original but at least there is a back story. Some people complained the creatures didn't look scary (like old monkeys) but hey if you were attacked by a horde of creatures would you care if they looked scary? I think you would run and/or fight for your life and your heart would be racing. Besides it's not that you see them that often, which is a good thing. After all, what you don't see if often more scary than what you do. Maybe more drama than horror in the end but the combination works very well for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay Effects Poor Storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that made this movie okay was the visual and sound effects plus the actors who were at some point interesting. The storyline was very poor and very traditional and so predictable. It felt like watching Spiderwick with a Skeleton Key ending but this came out weak, way too weak.I didn't like it because there was nothing new about how the story ran. It was so predictable that I wanted to turn off my PC at some points because I felt that the director was playing with the intelligence of the viewers. The sound and visual effects were quite convincing at some points because it somehow provided an intense and thrilling effect to the scenes. But the director attempted to repeatedly give a scare and an edge of the seat feeling with the 'attack' scenes but it failed. The repetitions of the attacks of those tiny little creatures and how the characters responded to them just made them more dumb. Gone are those days that we enjoy watching movies with dumb characters. I'm sorry but i really don't appreciate movies which make me feel dumb regardless of how good the others elements are.#by the way. I'm a movie enthusiast. I'm very far from being the likes of any popular movie critic but i constantly check this site or rotten tomatoes or what Roger Ebert had to say with movies.Sometimes, i find some reviews here misleading but i realized that each one has different perspectives, intentions and tastes. So if you find my review helpful, then thanks and if you don't, we'll we can't please everybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in this movie is atrocious. The story seemed somewhat compelling and that's what drew me to the movie in the first place, but, in my opinion, they don't really do anything with the concept at all, just dance in the shadows, bolstering the anticlimax.I don't know why Bailee Madison is not listed on the credits as the first 'Actor', but you will see more of this bull-dog-faced troll than any other actor during this film. She has two modes in this movie: Whiny/rebellious and Whiny/Crybaby. She acts like she spent a lot of her time reading to a wall and doesn't know how to convey her scenes realistically with another person in the room.Katie Holmes is ridiculously bad in this movie. I laughed at her scenes over and over. Not only are her emotions unbelievable in the sense that a normal person would obviously not act in this way in this situation, but the emotions she was trying to give me were not coming through at all. Most of the more emotional scenes came across as weak and half-assed and other times, she was flashing between emotional extremes at comical speed.Guy Pierce is the only saving grace in this film, but, unfortunately, he isn't given many scenes and his character seems overly aloof and uninterested in his child. Furthermore, his character has the emotional depth of sea cucumber.If you want to see scene after scene of acting so harsh that it makes your eyes hurt, then, by all means, check this stink bomb out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty lame horror film, a remake of a 1973 TV movie with a screenplay co-written by Guillermo del Toro. Some of the opening scenes feel like a retread of the opening scenes of Pan's Labyrinth, and when the horror starts it's one of those horror films that require all of its characters to be complete and utter idiots in order to work. Bailee Madison plays a young, lonely girl who is moving in with her dad (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend (Katie Holmes). After discovering a secret basement in the mansion her father is renovating, Madison starts to hear voices coming from an old, locked-up furnace. After opening it, she discovers a bunch of little monsters which, now free, don't bother pretending to be friendly. They pretty much instantly go psycho, swarming all over anyone who gets in their way. The monsters aren't too bad, really, or at least the idea of them. The CGI isn't any good, though, and they don't come off as that threatening (when the protagonists want to, they're easily able to squash them). The writing is actually really bad here. I've heard del Toro changed a lot from the original TV movie (where the protagonist was an adult woman), and he doesn't do a very good job establishing either characters or situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story does not go anywhere. I mean that literally - no development of story beyond gremlins hurting people in most improbable ways. There was no culmination to speak of. It was the same basic mini structure repeating several times during the entire running time - the little girl is left alone and is attacked by funny little humanoids over and over again, who simply refuse to kill her for some unknown reason. The movie could've ended in the first several minutes if the gremlins decided to (logically) just kill the girl, eat her teeth and bones, and be done with it. But then there would be no movie to speak of.When the credits started rolling, I was in dismay that the movie was over. It was left hanging, with no sense of closure whatsoever. In most horror movies people attempt to take action and fight back in some way. In the end father and daughter finally decide to leave the house after girlfriend is gone. No questions asked, no investigation, utter disregard for any evidence of evil 'stuff' happening, gremlin limbs and dead bodies sitting around don't arouse suspicion, non-existent world beyond the house. Just another day in a gremlin-infested house... no big deal.Characters are even stiffer than the story. Most of all the dad - he is actually scarier than the gremlins, because he is a walking talking zombie. If he were any more oblivious to his surroundings, he would most likely stop existing altogether. To think that his little girl (with no history of mental illness or crazy behavior) was physically capable of turning the house upside down all by herself, besides all the contrary evidence, makes him the scariest monster in this movie. Just because he doesn't believe in funny little gremlins doesn't mean that he should disregard all evidence, and assume that she is responsible. For all he knows there could be a real animal living in the basement causing all the havoc.Also there is no actual 'horror' in this movie other than the dark and gloomy house itself. The creatures are comical rather than horrific. I think ants would be more effective than these goofy mini goblins. In fact I would rather fight these things than any bug infestation.Overall there are too many logic-defying moments in the movie which makes for a frustrating experience. No story or characters to like. Waste of time.</fullReview>

But when I watch the movie, it felt like I was constantly asking "WTF? What happened to that ......fill in the blanks?"If there are such thing as "Movie Plot Holes" Award, this movie takes it all home. Gee, I don't know, a lot of things don't make sense, and like "Yeah... I'm a little rebellious kid, I'll just walk straight into the forest, alone, far away from everyone else, see what I could find, perhaps snakes will bite me and I'll go numb and dead."The extra star I am giving is because of one thing only - those creatures DO look scary. Even though they are small, they reminded me of dried prunes with fangs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I had massive hopes for this film, After watching pans labyrinth I was really expecting something visually stunning and with an exceptional soundtrack, however, I thought I was watching a teenage video of the borrowers... It was awful, with a week story line and ridiculous moments, The monsters , or mice were awful. Their design and their personality was bland and almost cartoon like. As for the plot it was empty, a house with demon mice... I came out the cinema feeling gutted. However, I didn't have to pay as I had a free pass, so not all was lost... On another note I would be interested to see the original and see whether it was any good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not enough going bump in the night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets start off by saying that the set pieces in this film are great and that everything that is needed to make a really good ghost and ghoul story was here and ready to be used to make everyone in the cinema quiver in terror, unfortunately there wasn't much in the ways of things going bump in the night in don't be afraid of the dark and not much darkness for that matter.There were a few main point in which this film fell short one was the music in the film, it wasn't quite horror music and it wasn't quite fantasy music this is where the problem lies if you are not ether one or the other then it just leave the audience sitting on the fence nether scared or entertained and in the days of paranormal activity scaring the pants off of people and the only thing closely resembling a sound track in that film a low bass note that gives the whole audience a deep sense that something is wrong but they don't know what it is and they don't know when it is going to jump out and scare the crap out of them but it just isn't there in don't be afraid of the dark,the second part that is just wrong in this film are the monsters they are revealed to the audience to early and so the tension given by just the sense of the unknown is lost and never regained since they just aren't that scary to begin with so the only thing they had going for them (being hidden in the shadows is lost)These faults are in no way minor ones and so this film just falls down at the first hurdle and just never gets back up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so disappointed with this film. I thought that with Guillermo Del Toro and Guy Pearce's involvement, it was bound to be a decent horror with a good story. I was wrong. "Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark" is a mess. Katie Holmes is an amateurish actress. The goblin creatures don't look realistic. They look pure CGI. The story is poor to boot. The Stephen King short story compendium "Cat's Eye" did a better job with the goblin mini-story, than this. The child actress in this film is the only good thing about it. Her face was very expressive at conveying fear. Pity that her talents were wasted in this very unscary, plodding horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A campfire tale made into a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Verdict "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is one of the movies that polarize their audience. Some people genuinely enjoy it whereas others passionately hate it.Unless you are an adult who still likes childish campfire stories and at the same time tolerates gore and violence quite well, the movie will most likely disappoint you.The Positives "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is not a typical horror movie. The title of the movie serves as a first hint that what follows is a campfire story made into a movie. "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" has all the right components of a good campfire story in the right proportions. It is an entertaining mysterious and mystical fairy tale, sometime spooky, sometime silly, and sometime weird, with a kid and her parents as main characters. Even the scariest, the goriest scenes, and the most suspenseful episodes of the movie have a shade of childishness in them. Do not expect any strong logic and coherency from the movie as you do not expect them from a campfire tale, even from a good one.If you treat "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" as a 100-minute long campfire story, it becomes a little more enjoyable to watch.The Negatives The movie has a very narrow target audience. It is too childish for most adults and far too violent and gory for children. If you do not belong to the target audience and do not have the right expectations, a shocking disappointment will likely be awaiting you at the end. Imagine that you are going to take a bite of a nice, big, sweet, juicy apple. In the beginning, "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" looks just like that ? a nice, sweet, mouth watering mix of suspense, horror, and thriller with many exciting possibilities.However, by the end, when you actually take a bite, you suddenly realize that there was a large worm in the apple. You have just bitten off a part of the worm and now you feel it squirming on your lips, between your teeth, on top of your tongue, in the rest of your mouth, and slowly going down your throat causing an uncontrollable feeling of nausea. That feeling would probably be the best approximation of what I, as an unprepared spectator, felt right after finishing watching the movie. Until the very end of the story I was clinging to a hope, I was expecting a twist that would bring coherency to the plot and would tame the hopelessly random mess unveiling in front of my eyes?At first, I thought that my hope was futile; my expectations were just a wishful thinking - the horrible mess seemingly prevailed and triumphed over a common sense. Later though, when I realized that I had just watched a campfire tale made into a movie, my opinion of "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" improved significantly enough to give it a firm "C" grade.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as creepy as the trailer would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I thinkDon't Be Afraid of the Dark looks good and tells an engaging if nonsensical story, but I suspect its first-time feature director only halfheartedly tries to scare his audience silly. To meet that objective Troy Nixey would have needed slower pacing, with scenes long enough to make us wonder with increasing anxiety what was waiting in the darkness to make us jump from our seats, when it might happen, and if it could possibly be as terrifying as we imagine. As it turns out the creatures are rendered flawlessly, with a level of imagination that calls to mind the inhabitants of Pan's Labyrinth, but in flaunting these effects on screen too soon, too long and too often, Nixey sacrifices the mystery, anticipation and subtlety he would have needed to creep the heck out of us to the degree the trailer seems to promise. At times this overexposure (and some ill-advised comic relief in a party scene) nearly turns the evil fairies of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and the movie itself, into Gremlins.Why you should see itYou're about twelve inches tall, depend on human bones and teeth the way koalas depend on eucalyptus leaves, and need a training film to improve your calcium-acquiring tactics.Your bones and teeth are a highly sought-after resource, and you need a training film to improve your evil-fairy-evasion tactics.Why you shouldn't see itYou're five (see: The Rating). You're a blacksmith who was murdered by his scheming uncle one hundred thirty-seven years ago; both your eyes and your brain have been completely desiccated for quite some time now, so this film would be wasted on you. Try The Smurfs instead.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No basis to the storyline as to why they were in the basement. Dragged on and on, all about "watching" the little girl as she explores the house, hears whispers and walks around thinking about them. The very beginning of the movie was actually the best part where there was some real action but the real reason as to why the fairy creatures resided in the house was left out completely so yo never get a real grasp of "Why"! Maybe 2 or 3 events where things got loud but I wouldn't see this again even if it was free. Definitely wont be renting. Don't waste your time and I am sorry, but Katie can't act either. By two thirds of the movie, the audience was getting restless,and even starting to laugh and giggle. Our chairs are getting uncomfortable and we cant wait to leave. We were really looking forward to a good scary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong Marketing Of A Lazily-Scripted Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a children fable marketed, wrongly, as a film for well-educated adults. Guillermo del Toro has made his reputation directing fine films for adults who appreciate fine arts. The expectation of this film, even though he only produced and didn't direct, is much higher than the labor he and Director Troy Nixey had put into the making this film. I am a fan of Clive Barker and all his top-quality macabre short stories, novellas, and novels. When he released a fable called "A Thief of Always", it is a fable of simplified language, but at the same time as wonderfully intense as any of his self-styled macabre writings. del Toro should learn a lot from Barker. It is regrettable to see talented foreign directors get dragged into the Hollywood process and lose their craft and their reputation almost completely. "Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark" turns a misled, unworthy, and low-quality storytelling. Character developments are shallow, confusing, and unnatural to the point of annoying. Never again should anyone try to fool a horror fan into an artless fairy tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a 2011 horror film Directed by Troy Nixey. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark could have been a whole lot better, but I feel that it was more of a win than a fail,just by a little bit. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is about creepy creatures that are living in a hidden dungeon type place and they are released by a little girl. What starts out as curiosity soon turns to terror as the little girl is tormented by the evil little beasts. The film ends up being just OK and I think that was my biggest complaint.There is not anything really bad in the film, but there just not anything that stands out as good either. See this flick and decide for your self, you may like it,you may not.Skip it if you were looking for another Del Torro master piece. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have had this movie lying around now for a couple of months, and i was really looking forward to seeing it. After watching the trailer for the first time, i thought i had a pretty good idea of how this movie was.The opening scene where the man hits the woman with a hammer in her teeth, then offers the teeth to the..let's call them "Things" so that i don't spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, was a pretty good opener. And i was looking forward to the rest of the film, but from here on it only goes down the hill.--------------- Spoiler -------------- I started to get bored half through the movie, not one jump scare, and the "Things" i thought was going to eat people, was now using razorblades, scissors etc. I think this movie could have been made so much better, for the first make it scary. Second make it darker, for example at the end of the movie, when the little girl is going down the stairs, and her step mother was lying down on the floor. She does not see her until she stands on top of her.I choose to give this movie 3 out of 10, because it by far didn't live up to my expectations, it wasn't scary at all. So if you are looking for a good horror movie, this isn't the movie for you. It's kinda a horror movie for little kids in my opinion.</fullReview>

In fact the movie in general is just incredibly stupid which can be deeply frustrating and take you out of the film because of it.

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo Del Toro produces this remake of the classic 70's TV movie and removes it of all fear in the process. Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark has a new family moving into an old spooky house. There's the husband, his new and younger wife, and his introspective kid. Soon the little girl is tormented by little tooth fairy gremlin type things. Nobody believes her and would much rather believe she's crazy. The biggest problem we have here is that the script makes no sense. We are constantly given situations in which people would definitely believe this little girl. One scene is put down to being an 'accident'. What? Did he fall down on a pair of scissors 50 times? Later there's a shot of a severed demon foot, and nothing is made of it. Madison gives a convincing performance, but you'd suspect that Pearce would either have her committed or try and find out what is going on. But as always he just puts it down to acting out. The film also doesn't try very hard to scare, maybe for a younger audience this will be terrifying. Compared to the original, this is awful. That had a grown woman instead of a little girl in the lead, and she actually considered that she was going crazy. Anyone familiar with horror will have experienced this before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For one I am surprised that Guillermo del Toro put his name to this film as a producer let alone as a co-writer. It falls incredibly short in imagination and skill at either writing or directing as compared to not just anything else he's done but as far as other horror films in general go. The concept alone is not scary, "little creatures running around with wires and exact o knifes trying to poke or cut small abrasions into peoples legs" is not all that creepy. That sounds like "The Borrowers" gone bad. The only thing this movie had going for it was competent acting from some of the cast. In all I would not recommend this film to anyone that is either looking for a good Guillermo del Toro film or a horror film in general. I'm not quite sure why it was rated "R" either, no swearing, no nudity, and no genuine frights.</fullReview>

Or maybe viewers were expecting a goretastic horror flick, with buckets of blood and walls splattered with entrails?Regardless, I was pleasantly surprised by this wonderfully crafted flick. Like many Guillermo films it's got the whole "slightly creepy fantasy story" ambiance to it. I couldn't fault the movie's super slick production values, with exquisite sets and wonderful acting, especially Bailee Maddison's amazing performance. She's going to go far. My only complaint are the occasional "As if they'd do that..." moments, but show me a horror movie that doesn't have one or two of those and I'll eat my DVD collection.

		<shortDescription>Don't be Afraid of the Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a 2011 remake of the 1973 made-for-TV horror film. Directed by Troy Nixey starring Guy Pearce (Memento) and Katie Holmes ( wife of Tom Cruise) the movie is really a Guillermo Del Toro vehicle as he produces and co-writes the script. Del Toro himself admits he became involved in the project as he was terrified by the original film when he was a child and brings the story forward 39 years as a professional couple and small child move into a 19th century mansion with more than a few secrets beneath the floorboards.The child in question is 8 year old Sally (Bailee Madison) who's been sent to live in Blackwood Manor with her architect father Alex (Pearce) and interior designer Kim (Holmes), Sally's potential wicked step-mother. Soon enough Sally starts to hear strange voices from the walls and vents telling her to "come and play with us Sally" which inevitably prompts her to explore the house and yes, go down to the basement. She finds that the voices are originating from the houses sealed ash pit and decides it'd be a great idea to unseal said ash pit, this unleashes hordes of "scary gnomes" (actual dialogue) who proceed to terrorise her in order to obtain her teeth.That's right, it would appear that these small creatures are actually modern day manifestations of the tooth fairy and they will stop at nothing to obtain children's teeth. Quite rightly Alex and Kim think that Sally is suffering from a case of juvenile insanity and immediately get the psychiatrist in to set things straight. However eventually the little imps soon become a bit too big for their impy boots and start attacking the adults as well, leading to a final confrontation by the ash pit.As you may have already concluded this is a profoundly silly film and it should be noted that there were no mentions of the tooth fairy in the original film (though the creatures were still very impy). It is Del Toro's obsession with fairy tales, exhibited in the greatly overrated Pan's Labyrinth (2006), that drags this film down attempting to add an unnecessary dimension to a perfectly serviceable concept. Conversely in the original film it was the Kim character who was being tormented by the creatures and the addition of a daughter-stepmother dynamic is certainly a welcome one. In fact Bailee Madison is the star of the film acting circles around a dull Holmes and a wooden Pearce and is one of the few enjoyable elements on offer here.As silly as the concept of the fairies is the creature design and special effects are outstanding. Looking halfway between a rat and a monkey (a Sumatran rat-monkey perhaps) the creatures still manage to look quite intimidating despite their small stature. This is certainly an improvement on the original creature design which I can only describe as tiny men in gorilla suits with peanuts for heads. As a result of the effects and the brilliant set design of the mansion there is a certain eerie quality to the film but apart from that it's not in the least bit scary and in fact quite boring.If Hollywood has to remake movies it's certainly better to pick obscure low-budget TV movies however I would maintain that the original is superior. The bold changes made are ambitious and if you can watch a movie about tiny killer tooth fairies with a straight face then this may be for you. This film is bad, but unfortunately not so bad it's good and as a result there was minimal enjoyment to be had here. 2 Stars ** Did you like Don't Be Afraid of the Dark?

		<shortDescription>Not Worth It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently had the utmost pleasure of viewing the movie Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark. Don't be afraid of the dark? Well, you should be afraid of this movie! It stars Bailee Madison, an unrealistically teenage-like little girl named Sally, who moves into her father's new home with her father's new girlfriend. Her mom, who came off to be severely neglectful and keeping her daughter on drugs so she could go party, has two maybe three lines in this movie, not counting the repeated lines or her answering machine that you hear when her daughter tries to call after getting off the plane. Sally, being the rebellious angst-filled little girl that she is, finds a sealed-off basement, and of course, like in all overrated horror movies, she goes in, even after being warned that it's dangerous by Harris (Jack Thompson).Not to ruin the plot of the movie, I'll keep the summary short and sweet. Screaming, fighting, arguing, Sally crying because nobody believes her, the only sane person in the house goes to the hospital, pictures prove Sally's claim, they leave the house about 3 days too late, missing one person in their three-person family.This movie made me want to tear my hair out! The scenes are predictable, the ending is completely unrealistic and the last scene is anti-climactic. The setting is unrealistic, there are scenes that don't fit into the main plot at all, and the characters do things that are so out of the norm, I found myself yelling at my computer screen as I proceeded to finish this horrendous movie. But despite the horrible plot and storyline, the acting was pretty good. Well, excluding the scenes where they hear screaming from Sally yet stand in place listening and wondering 'Hmm, is that someone screaming? Oh, no, Sally isn't screaming. She isn't the only person upstairs! Oh my, yes she is! We must slowly progress upwards and stand outside the door calling her name, because SHE'S NOT IN DANGER OR ANYTHING!'Gary McDonald (Blackwood), Bailee Madison, Katie Holmes (Kim), Guy Pearce (Alex, father), and Jack Thompson (Harris) all did great jobs in this movie. I'll never be afraid of the dark again, but I will be afraid if anyone tries to make me watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, granted I'm a huge horror film fan, and I do not scare easily, it does not take much for me to appreciate good horror. This film did not qualify for the 5.99 I spent watching it on demand. The trailer made it seem pretty decent, but is very misleading. This movie is about small creatures who come after a little girl. It's a bit predictable and the creatures could have been a lot scarier. Their voices could have even been creepier. Instead, when they spoke, I thought of Jim Hensen puppets. So, the best part of the film was probably the ending. The voice sounds a bit like Kim's, which can lead us to think she's one of them. Also, my friend pointed out that the one looked a bit like Blackwood, which would lead me to think Kim in fact does become one of them. In conclusion, wait to see this movie until it's on Netflix or Fear Net for free, which is where it should be.</fullReview>

I'm glad this guy got to play with some money and CGI. "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" suffers from something that is often the case of most poorly written horror movies. EFFICIENCY. Usually lack of efficiency can be suspended once or twice throughout a movie. After all, the creation of the cinema was really to provide people an escape from reality. When it gets to the point where the audience says phrases like:"Okay the movie can begin now" forty minutes into the movie"Why not just kill him...like right now...just..no? okay""Why haven't they done OBVIOUS SOLUTION HERE yet"You really know there is a problem when these lines are running through your head. I wont even get into the obvious flaws in this movies story as they pertain to the human characters. I'm sticking strictly to the mindset of the "monsters" in this movie.Before I go on a long-winded rant here,let's first establish what the motive of the monsters in this movie is. Or what I think it was anyways....yeah...that really wasn't made clear either.The monsters wanted teeth. They apparently prefer teeth of children. Although I'm a bit confused on this because at the end it seems like they want to make a girl one of their own, transforming her SOMEHOW into a monster. How they do this, who knows? Maybe they need teeth to transform people into monsters? They seemed to have bartered a deal with the dude in the beginning of the movie that he would give them teeth of people in exchange for his life(speculation??). So really did they want teeth or did they want to transform a child sacrifice into one of their own? Maybe they feed on teeth? I don't really think they eat anything as they were locked in the furnace for years. When you have this much trouble establishing a motive for the killer(s) of a horror movie, you know you're in trouble. Don't get me wrong, sometimes the best motive is sometimes not having one at all, but when they try to have a motive and you can't figure it out..issues abound. We'll just say they wanted to change the girl into one of their own. After the girl frees the monsters by discovering the basement....This HIDDEN basement that people remodeling a house would never see on a blueprint...or.. jewqr;lkejrl So the girl unleashes the monsters. Monsters who know how to use tools, frame little girls by cutting up her stepmoms dress, and have the ability to drag Katie Holmes down a hole by tying a rope around her leg. Unscrewing a vent seems to be too much work for them though. Now free to roam the ventilation system of the house, they eye up the girl in attempts to *INSERT WHATEVER THE MOTIVE IS HERE*. They could have ended the movie right here by :A) Waiting until night B) Cutting the electricity in the house C) Using the razor from the master bathroom and slitting the throats of Katie Holmes and the father. D) Dragging the girl to the basement E) Disposing of the bodies and/or framing the father in a murder-suicide as to not arouse suspicion F) Wait for the next people to move into the house and/or go to the house next door and repeat steps A-EInstead this is what happened.....A) Attempt to befriend the child for no reason B) Frame the child for no reason by using the fathers razor to shred Katie Holmes dresses. All this did was foster hostilities between the family members. WHY DID THEY NEED TO DO THIS? WHY!?! jqwl;djqwd C) Attack the daughter when the next room over had 20 or so full grown people quite capable of squashing them like bugs D) Alerting the adults of the household to their existence, thus providing resistance to their cause. E) Not shutting off the electricity to the house until the humans made it known they intended to leave. What would have happened if the family would have left with the party-goers? Whoops..sorry guys I guess you missed your chance to kidnap the girl. Yeah. I really think I can type any more as the anger has bubbled to a point of no return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the DarkThere's no reason kids should be afraid of the dark because the same monsters will be there in the light, except now they'll have to watch themselves be eaten.Fortunately, the ravenous imps in this horror movie abhor any type of illumination.When her mother sends her to live with her father (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend (Katie Holmes) in the old mansion they're restoring, Sally's (Bailee Madison) ADHA begins to act up, resulting in strange behaviour.Beckoned to the basement of the abode by disembodied voices, Sally discovers the manor's secret: minute monsters that crave human teeth.Unfortunately, no one believes her outlandish tale, blaming the delusions on her disorder.While this remake of a made-for-television movie contains some scares, once the inane looking creatures are revealed, the atmosphere completely dissipates. Besides, when renovating a mansion you have to expect to discover weird stuff, like slumbering demons or a super-hero's hideout. (Red Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be Afraid of this Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, it's not particularly scary unless you are too young to officially watch it.I actually quite liked it, on the whole. I think the people that have trouble with it are those that are labeling it as a horror movie. Apart from the odd scene here and there what this is, really, is a monster movie. View it as such and it is far more enjoyable.I'm never too sure about Guy Pearce's acting, however. Sometimes he can be brilliant and at other times it's like he's not really making much effort. This film seems like the latter, to me. He's not bad, but I'm sure he could have done better.Katie Holmes was actually pretty good in this one, but the best acting has to go to the little girl, who, for the most part, outshines the adults in every scene.The effects are fairly good but, as always never quite convince you the creatures are actually there. Likewise, the plot leaves something to be desired, with people being injured or killed and no police involvement forthcoming, to name but one awful oversight.The problem as always, is one of character intelligence. If the characters in these films acted like any sane, normal person would, then the film would be over in thirty minutes with a significantly less grim result than is usually offered. The fact that said characters always act foolishly in these films shouldn't annoy me - I know what to expect, after all - but it still does. And once the annoyance sets in, the enjoyment is lessened.In short, then, this movie is fairly entertaining and worth a watch. Just don't expect anything too outlandish or out of the ordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how NOT to make movies for Dummies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to be short... Bad bad movie... hands down to the actors that did great job , even the little girl was good, and that's why I gave the movie 2 stars ... However The Plot was awful and the script an utter crap . The director and scriptwriters didn't even try to make the film and horror feel real . I mean the human being in the film acted nothing like a normal person would in the situations they were... There were huge plot holes , more likely the movie was one big plot hole. Why it was bad? For example, when the poor old man gets attacked by the creatures and almost gets killed , well nobody really cares , they(the other main characters) just say that that was an accident and they truly believe it :O , and the hospital doctors or the police don't have any questions about how can one man get into a accident that leaves him with hundred wounds and cuts ... and how in the hell did he stabbed himself with a screwdriver in his back ... no that's a normal accident for people in the Guillermos universe...Ahh, just a huge disappointment .. No suspense , no thrilling moments. Not A horror movie - more like Harry Potter just 100 times worse :) ( BTW the creatures looked like Voldemort + Dobby = very bad job from the creature creators, no originality)...And it was boring... That is all , don't go to this movie ... I am sad about Guy Pearce that he played in this movie, such a waste of talent ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be afraid of wasting your money!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need not be afraid of the dark. Be afraid of wasting ten bucks. This movie may put an end to the tooth fairy practice for awhile.The classic spook movie tone is set early while we watch an old horse carriage drive up to a spooky mansion on a dark, stormy night. It all goes down hill from there. The problem was the audience was laughing at the campiness of it all rather than dealing with any fear.The basic plot is painfully familiar. An old mansion where people disappeared and sat in disrepair is now restored by a young couple with a weird child, little Sally (Madison). Add the element that Alex, the Dad (Pearce) is divorced and is frustrated his young daughter will not bond with his new trophy wife, Kim (Holmes). No surprise as Alex is a jerk and does not even kiss or tuck his little girl in bed at night. Holmes, as step-mom Kim, is just a clueless babe in this film.All the goblins return, starting of course with the child's bedroom, and no one believes the child. I was often thinking they were trying to make a comedy rather than a horror or a spook film. In one early scene, the caretaker named Harris (Thompson) is brutalized and stabbed repeatedly by the goblins but survives. The police arrive and declare his condition to be "an unfortunate accident." Everyone laughed. The goblin creatures are not scary mainly because they look like ugly, talking rats. We see them constantly. The writers forgot Hitchcockian Rule Numero Uno of scary filmmaking?people fear the unknown. This film is loaded with laughable tracks of whispering voices ("get out , get out"?or "we want the girl") ?the kind of joke stuff we all do to parody bad Halloween films. Throw in a stuffed animal that talks when unexpected and the script writers fail to offer anything new at all.Madison as Sally was pretty much a caricature of a spooky, precocious girl we expected to see in a film like this. Rather than act normal, the girl is attracted to ghosts, dark dusty basements and hidden passages few adults would ever care to tread. We just don't buy it.Another little gem is when Kim visits Harris in the hospital after his "accident." Harris looks like he was just bludgeoned in the hospital and getting a full dose of Obama care. Another is why Sally's rich, BMW driving parents who can spend millions restoring an old mansion provide her with a 40 year old Polaroid camera. The goblins finally kill Kim (no spoiler here) and the story moves on without even a call to the police. I started to wonder who was the real creep in this film?the little goblins or Pearce as the Dad.Don't be afraid of the dark for sure. But, if your Dad acts like Guy Pearce in this film, you might at least be concerned and consider running away. (I am sure Pearce is a terrific guy in real life!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate remakes at the best of times. (Although you do come across the odd rare one that lives up to the original film) This isn't one that even comes close to the original. I even found the original "Don't be afraid of the dark" movie, absolute rubbish to be honest with you.As I said in my Summary "Never mind about being afraid of the Dark, DO be afraid of this movie", that isn't a joke. I mean it, avoid it like the plague. The original didn't have CGI creatures, but at least there was a story. This one has far too much CGI and if you can make sense of the story. Then good luck to you.This film isn't worth seeing.</fullReview>

The movie's director obviously wasn't paying attention to the previous scene when filming because as one item was explained, the next scene would generate the same question that was previously answered. Ex: The little girl / Sally was attempting to prove there are little creatures, so she is given a camera to take a photo. She successfully took a picture of the little creature. But when at the dinner table, as the photo was developing, she did not want anyone to view the photo. Then she became trapped in the library and actually killed one of the little creatures by crushing him between the book files, one of its little arms fell to the floor etc, but the dad still questioned her sanity as if there was no evidence of the fight, the numerous pictures she randomly snapped or the creatures remains. There are COUNTLESS other illogical events. Wait for free TV</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice mansion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The time really to be afraid is to spend 2 hours in the dark with this flaccid horror film, a remake of a TV film (hmmmm?what does that tell you?). Kim (Katie Holmes) is the girlfriend of Alex (Guy Pearce), to the dismay of his 8 year-old Sally (Bailee Madison), who comes to their palatial Victorian renovation to live.Quite a few homunculi live in the basement craving a body or some teeth (go figure). Guess what-- no one believes Sally as the rat-like creatures crave Sally's companionship (and maybe her teeth) and torture her and us with their phony voices.The mansion is impressive, as is Jack Thompson as beleaguered Harris, a grounds keeper with a scary family history. Beyond those, nothing much original happens, and then it's slow to get going and clichéd when it arrives. The little ones do provide some traditional scares but mostly they are ugly, humorless, and derivative.Guillermo del Toro as one of the writers/producers is definitely slumming here, given the beauty and complexity of his Pan's Labyrinth. But then he and the little trolls both have to eat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, let me say that I'm new to reviewing films. Although I have watched more than most and consider myself to be quite a film buff! Anyway back to this review. I won't admit to remembering the original in all it's not cgi glory, but what I can remember is better than this. Guy Pearce, oh Guy Pearce, seriously, did you do this film for some extra pocket money? You hear the term wooden sometimes and if you ever wonder what that means then please watch this film as a guide. Katie Holmes, is like a acting revolving door, sometimes believable, sometimes well oh dear. Bailee Madison, not a bad performance but when there wasn't much competition that doesn't say much. The film itself OK, did have some jumpy parts but a lot of that would be down to your imagination and when it did finally arrive, what a let down. What I found myself doing during the film was questioning events and therefore taking my attention away from it. A small mercy. I am not saying don't watch it, just do not pay to do it. Wait till it comes on t.v. then left it as either something on in the background while your doing something else or watch it then have the ability to turn over. Do not let the trailer or DVD cover fool you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not worth the wait !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wondered by this film took so long to find a release date, I now know, Del Toro must have realised while trying his best to edit the movie what a disaster he had made and was too ashamed to let it go, until finally he thought "hang on, i need to get some money back at least", then let it go. The movie is not frightening at all, its not suspenseful, all the acting apart from the little girl is wooden, I find it hard to say anything good about it ! Some tips if you buy a house with a stove in your cellar that your daughter has a funny attraction to; 1) If your handy man walks out of the cellar with a pair of scissors in his shoulder and a screwdriver in his eye, don't just assume he had an accident 2)If your daughter keeps insisting she is hearing voices, just have a look into it, it won't take 2 minutes 3)If your daughter tries to show you a photo of one of the gremlins she has been talking about but you did not believe her, just take a quick look 4) If some little gremlins do happen to attack you or run at you, KICK THEM AWAY, they are tiny and are easily crushable as we find out so have no strength, why be afraid of them really ? 5) If you see your wife get pulled into a stove by some small gremlins, show no emotion about it, just have a quick look down the hole in the stove, the move out with your daughter !Personally if I knew i had small creatures in a stove in my cellar, I would call in someone to get rid of them, I would not just leave them there, I would try and flood them out, burn them out or even gas them, who in their right mind would just leave them !Thats about me done, i hated this movie, thought it was a waste of a remake, the wife does not feel as harshly about it as me, she thought it was good, but she does not like scary movies, so that should tell you everything !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straightforward plotting ruins an otherwise solid old-fashioned horror that boasts great atmosphere and some well-executed thrilling sequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Guillermo del Toro's name is splashed prominently on the promo materials, it is first-time director Troy Nixey who is at the helm of this remake of a 1973 television movie of the same name. Nonetheless, it was del Toro who conceptualised the remake after recalling the frightening experience the original gave him as a child, and who co- writes and produces this movie. Yes, his prints are all over the movie- though this time, they are much less indelible than his previous works.Retaining the premise of the original, del Toro's version is once again set in a spooky house, the kind with decades of history behind it, secrets behind its walls and whispering voices along its corridors. The latter is literal, as a tense prologue set in the late 1800s where we witness the disappearance of the mansion's original owners, Emerson Blackwood and his son, establishes the other non-human inhabitants in the basement- nasty tiny critters who are after kids' teeth. Left abandoned and in ruins for more than a century, the mansion in present day becomes the centrepiece of architect Alex's (Guy Pearce) restoration works- which also becomes the movie's excuse later on for his reluctance at moving out.Alex is joined by his girlfriend cum interior designer Kim (Katie Holmes) and his daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) from a previous marriage. In particular, Sally's arrival rouses these basement dwellers, who hear her unhappiness of being sent to live with Daddy and his girlfriend and whisper teasingly that they are her friends. Needless to say, their agenda is far more sinister, but Sally suspects little- as curious children are wont to do- and follow their voices to unearth the hidden basement, inadvertently releasing them to roam freely around the house.From then on, del Toro and co-writer Matthew Robbins deliver a straightforward narrative where Sally gets terrorised by the creatures every night when the lights go out, try to convince Alex and Kim in vain of the horror lurking behind the walls, and then gets proved right when both adults are confronted by the very monsters. Del Toro weaves some mythology that links the goblins to the tooth fairy and their origin through the centuries, but largely the background, while interesting, adds little to the main storyline.If the movie turns out surprisingly engaging, credit must go to Nixey for skilfully translating del Toro and Robbins' screenplay into some truly intense sequences. One of them is partly shown in the trailer, where one of the creatures finds its way under Sally's bedcovers; another has the creatures attempting to kidnap Sally while she is alone in the bathroom. Nixey also stages the climax thrillingly, the culmination of some excellent work in pacing and building atmosphere that keeps the creatures hidden from full view until late into the film.He also has a terrific child actor in Madison, probably best known for her role in this spring's 'Just Go with It'. Madison doesn't overplay her role even when her character is supposed to be freaking out, and the restraint she shows goes a long way in earning her audience's sympathy at her predicament. The same however can't be said of her adult stars. Holmes looks spent most of the time (probably from her marriage to Mr Tom Cruise) and Pearce, usually excellent, reciprocates by not bothering to invest much effort into his role.Perhaps it is also because they are astute to know that even with del Toro's participation, this is really del Toro-lite material. Sure, you can recognise his trademarks in the film's play on childhood fears, and the mythological world of sinister creatures that could probably fit into 'Pan's Labyrinth', but this is nowhere near the brilliance of his usual works. Nixey does a fine job as a first-time feature helmer- unfortunately, his best efforts barely transcend the all-too simplistic plotting. As an old-fashioned creature horror however, his film works well with an efficient combination of suspense and thrills- though it is likely that most modern-day audiences will find it coming up short.- www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guess my expectations were too high. I'm a fan of Guillermo Del Toro and so I'm highly surprised he's attached to this. The gore is on par with something I'd expect from him, but past that I can't see his influence over this film.Granted the setting and the set production are exceptional, but that's really where the pros end. The acting, particularly by Guy Pearce who plays father to the main character, is abysmal. Next to him, Katie Holmes looks good. The pacing is way too slow, the CGI is bad, and the creatures look like something that with minimal tweaking could appear in a children's version of a scary movie. I wasn't impressed.Gave it 45 minutes then just decided to call it quits. I won't be giving it another try. Not my type of horror movie at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny but in the 1970s and 80s I don't recall Hollywood constantly remaking horror films from the 40's and 50's and when it was done it was done pretty well 1978s Invasion of the body snatchers and 1982s The Thing come to mind. But since the new millennium it seems the only offerings from the horror genre have been pointless remakes to smart and SCARY classics from yesteryear. We had to revisit the likes of The step ford wives, A nightmare on elm st.,Halloween I AND II,Black Christmas,Friday the 13TH, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,When a stranger calls, The Fog, The Amityville Horror,Hills Have Eyes,The Hitcher,Last house on the left,Dawn of the Dead, another body snatcher remake The Invasion and in the late 90s remakes of Psycho and The Haunting and not to mention the almost blasphemous remake of The Omen! The formula is always the same take an intelligent blockbuster, recast it with a politically correct ensemble(usually with arrogant, annoying teens),saturate it with play station worthy cgi effects and rewrite it so that it's familiar to an MTV/reality show audience with the attention span of a fly. And I'm sure there are more on the way....When is Hollywood gonna produce an original horror script that doesn't insult my intelligence? After all isn't that why they're paid millions and millions of dollars? Don't be afraid of the dark is no exception to these new rules and frankly from this writer and director I expected better. The 1973 creepy original which terrified me as a child starred Kim Darby as a young wife who inherits a gloomy mansion infested with demonic creatures and cannot get her executive husband Jim Hutton to believe her despite warnings from an ominous handy man. This version centers naturally around a young girl instead of a young wife (hence the annoying arrogant teen, kid rule) and a back story (hence the rewritten to the Mtv/reality/dancing with stars attention span crowd) the bottom line if an original is a known as a "classic" always stick with the original, if they must make remakes remake a crappy film and make that one better not vice versa believe me there are enough to choose from or remake a film that is not well known what Gauls me the most is todays young audiences are being jipped into thinking that some of todays garbage are the originals. If this trend continues I suppose in 2040 there will be remakes of Saw,Insidious,Silent Hill,Hostile and the 2040 generations will think they're the real deal. Please don't let my rant prevent you from making up your own mind we all have different tastes if you wanna go see it and if you enjoy it, dandy , this is simply one humble mans opinion.</fullReview>

Once we get to present time, I kept waiting for the "scary" to happen. It didn't. Tooth fairies???? really???!!!! Typical Guillermo Del Torro style, but the back story didn't live up to my expectations. The scariest part of the movie didn't even involve the creatures, which by the way were not scary at all. The ending of the movie does have a twist, but a really stupid one. I really gave the movie a fair chance, being Del Torro's fan, and I did go see it on the opening night, but I wish I wasted my money on Colombiana, at least, I'm sure, I would have been more entertained.

		<fullReview>Don't be afraid of the dark is apparently a remake of an old made for TV movie, had no clue it was, but that's just some background for ya. First I would like to praise the cast and acting, both were very good I thought. First of all Katie Holmes was great in the film and I really thought she was the best part, she was touching in some scenes and then very serious and dramatic in others, which was called for. Then there's Bailee Madison, who is our star, I thought she showed impressive acting skills for her age, if she chooses I'm sure that a Hollywood career could be in her future. She was very focused and very centered in her role, and I was actually really impressed that her performance wasn't cheesy or over-the-top. Guy Pearce was all right, but to be honest, I think that just about anyone could've played his role and done well with it/fit it. Now the CGI little creatures the crawl around and terrorize throughout the film were a little lackluster looking and it just wasn't scary at all. I really was hoping that don't be afraid of the dark would have some scariness to it and maybe some creepiness, but it seems to me that the only creepy parts were the very beginning and the very ending scenes. But I think the reason I liked it better than I probably thought I would have is because of Katie Holmes and Bailee Madison, they really just made up for what the movie was lacking, not all of it though. I had to take off points for the lack of creepiness/scariness and the CGI creatures that ultimately disappointed. Overall this gets a 7/10.</fullReview>

I simply don't understand how after the groundskeeper all oats gets killed, Bailee almost gets killed and Kim finding vital information that the Dad did not move out. I found myself hating him in the end. I believe they could've made this movie better if they gave the characters a more realistic approach to dealing with things. (Another example is when the child keeps talking, looking at and following the creatures. Any normal child would scream and run away.) I believe the actors/actresses were great it's just that the movie fell short and missed that needed realism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010): Dir: Troy Nixey / Cast: Katie Holmes, Guy Pearce, Bailee Madison, Jack Thompson, Alan Dale: Laughable haunted house horror farce about facing one's fears. Never have I heard so much laughter during a horror film as I did here. I had to check to see if I had entered the wrong theatre. It was as though I was watching a comedy. Bailee Madison stars as a young girl whose parents have split and she is sent to live with her father. He moves her into a big house and she immediately disapproves of his girlfriend. Soon she is hearing voices that request that she release them out of the basement. These little creatures cannot face sunlight, which reminds us not only why Gremlins works better, but also why it is so much better. Listening to these creatures whisper is so lame that it had the audience in an uproar of laughter. Madison fares well against the nonsense dealing both with feelings of neglect and acceptance. Katie Holmes also holds her own as the new woman in daddy's life. She goes from discouraged to investigating Madison's claims and comes to startling realizations. The ending here is complete bullshit with that whole self sacrifice crap. Guy Pearce plays Madison's father whose job is to not believe her claims and be irritated easily. Jack Thompson plays some old geezer who knows the house's past and ends up in the hospital for trying to do something about it. Director Troy Nixey makes great use of lighting for ominous appeal but it doesn't make up for the juvenile screenplay. Special effects look fantastic but it is not the dark that one needs to be leery of. It's the level of laughter. Score: 4 / 10</fullReview>

Do not see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but no improvement on the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*************************************************************** Warning this message contains spoilers ****************************************************************We watched this the other night on DVD. It was not a bad horror film when taken on its own merits. The movie was visually impressive. The story was predictable. It reminded me very much of the last segment in the film 'Cat's Eye' where a little girl is being attacked by a tiny gremlin-like creature. Nobody believes her either. I personally liked that one segment from the earlier film much better. What I found most irritating about 'DBAotD' was the adults not believing the little girl for so long. There were some parts in the film with the adults not believing her that bugged me. When she crushed that one creature with the shelves during the adults party why didn't she show them the severed arm that was clearly there? Why did she hide the photo from them as it was developing on the dinner table? And why didn't she use a digital camera instead of that old Polaroid? If this was supposed to have taken place before the development of digital cameras that was not made clear. The flashes were probably meant as a homage to the original TV film with similar scenes of an old flash camera. And even earlier in the film the adults explained away the brutal attack on the grounds keeper as 'an accident". The man had multiple stab wounds, deep cuts, numerous bruises from working in the basement....some accident. And why didn't someone just look closely inside behind that grated furnace door? Oh look a bottomless pit...isn't that strange. But nobody bothered, even when they knew the house might have hidden art treasures and the like in it. You'd think they'd search everywhere, especially after finding that mysterious hidden basement with a weird mural on the wall. If the creatures' goal was to drag the little girl down into their pit, they had ample easier opportunities earlier in the film once the bolted crate was off the door. Heck the little girl was even sticking her head in there. Yes, yes, then the story would have ended too soon and all that, but still.If I compare this film to the earlier 1973 TV version it comes up lacking. For me at least the earlier film was far superior even with its lower budget and being made for TV. The dreary atmosphere and simpler story of the first (1973) 'Don't be Afraid of the Dark' were much better. IMO. The story was also different for its day. Heck, I even liked the look of the creatures better from the earlier film.So bottom-line, taken on its own merits this was an okay film to me, nothing to write home about. When compared to the earlier version, I don't think it was as good. The earlier version was superior for me in many ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quite dark and at times gruesome fairytale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro is well lauded for some fine work. Some of his best work is placing tales in a dream-like world which we can all love and appreciate but have a very dark edge. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is possibly his best known work and illustrates his skill well.This film is penned by del Toro, but directed by another. The problem is that as much as the director has actually done a fine job on the direction, the truth is that this has a disappointing script by del Toro.Again, the story centres around a young child who is caught up with fantasy figures. In this case, it's little mischievous creatures who want to take the life of the child. In many ways, the creatures are a del Toro take on marrying an old school haunted house story with 'Gremlins'. The effects are great for the creatures, but there was little of substance to get me interested. It can be quite gruesome as well, definitely not one for kids this film.The three leads do well with the little script they have. In some ways, it has few great ideas, and if they padded out the story then the film could have been so much better.It's a lost opportunity, and with a bit more work it could have been so much better. Instead, I lost much interest. Fine scares aside, there's little of note, and instead I'd recommend you to look out and watch for much of del Toro's other work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original 1973 made-for-TV original a couple of years ago, long before there were any rumors about an upcoming remake, and remained quite underwhelmed to be honest. Many die-hard fans consider "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" to be the ultimate suspense &amp; atmosphere driven TV-thriller of the 70's and vividly remember it as one the first and only movies to petrify them as a child. I respect that, of course, but basically it's just a simplistic old dark house feature with little potato-headed monsters living in the chimney and driving the lady of the house stir crazy. Apparently Guillermo Del Toro ? master director of "Pan's Labyrinth" and "The Devil's Backbone" ? is one of the many avid fans of the classic TV-tale, so he slightly rewrote the screenplay and provide a buddy director of his with a tenfold of the budget in order to make a present day homage remake. Well actually, I presume the remake mainly exists to appeal to younger and wider nowadays audiences and to earn more money out of a relatively easy investment. The result is an attractive looking fright fest, but only just beneath the surface it sadly is another hugely derivative, illogical and unmemorable genre failure. Like in the TV-original, there are a few isolated moments of sheer suspense and genuinely macabre atmosphere, but the wholesome fails to leave an everlasting impression. Eventually, three vital defaults bring it all down: implausible &amp; clichéd twists, major plot holes and unconvincing special effects. The setting and pre-credits opening sequences are nonetheless sublime. What better location to set a traditional (semi-Gothic) spooky tale than in the automatically depressing town of Providence, Rhode Island. It was the home state of H.P. Lovecraft and allegedly one of his many short stories formed the basis of both movies. Centuries ago, famous painter Emerson Blackwood lost his only son and eventually his own life to the monstrous little demons inhabiting the hole in the basement, and this in spite of obeying their commands to be fed human teeth. Fast forward to present day, when a couple of interior architects and avid Blackwood connoisseurs come to reside and restore the mansion with the man's nine-year-old daughter Sally. The already naturally insecure girl immediately forms an ideal target for the malignant creatures that follow her every move from inside the walls and terrorize her nights with perturbing whispers. Needless to say Sally's father doesn't believe her cries for help and even hire a psychiatrist to analyze her grandiose stories of evil elves. The poor girl nearly has to get torn to pieces by an army of grisly demonic rat creatures before someone, and then it's even her stepmom instead of her own father, takes her seriously. It's perhaps a bit harsh to write, but all the great potential and creativity is sucked into oblivion through the gaping black hole together with Lord Blackwood at the beginning of the movie. What remains is a nicely polished but substantially void chiller. The acting performances are adequate (especially from the young Bailee Madison) en certain sequences will undoubtedly haunt my girlfriend's nightmares for a long time (ha!), but generally speaking this is a misfire from Del Toro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not-so-scary faeries.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8-year-old Sally (Bailee Madison) is sent to stay with her father Alex and his girlfriend Kim (Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes) at the Gothic mansion they are in the process of restoring; unfortunately for Sally, the basement to the old building is home to evil faeries who like to feast on the bones and teeth of children?and they're feeling quite peckish.For one so young, Bailee Madison gives an incredibly convincing performance in this Gothic fairytale horror produced by Guillermo Del Toro. Far outclassing her adult co-stars, little Bailee looks genuinely petrified by her supernatural ordeal, so it's a real shame then that her hard work goes to waste, the film's faeries?malnourished, hunchbacked, rodent-like critters brought to life with CGI?lacking the fear factor necessary to scare the crap out of the viewer as intended.It doesn't help much either that the screenplay, written by Matthew Robbins and Del Toro, is very predictable and riddled with plot-holes; for such a simplistic story, it should have been a cinch for the guys to inject a degree of inventiveness into proceedings and ensure a level of plausibility as far as character behaviour is concerned, but they fail on both counts. No-one in this film acts in a believable manner given their situation; if they did, the film would have been over almost as soon as it started, Sally never again setting foot in the basement having heard creepy voices calling her name from the ash pit.Crappy creature concept aside, Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark is fairly impeccable in terms of its visuals, the production design, cinematography and direction all being very impressive; the high level of artistry involved, combined with Bailee's surprisingly mature performance, help to make the film a bearable experience despite its many flaws, but in terms of scariness, this falls well short of the mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched on Netflix - Visually, the movie was interesting. Unfortunately that's about the extent of it. The acting (other than the little girl) was terrible, especially Katie Holmes. It's as if she realized what a clunker the movie is and sleep-walked through her performance. Or maybe she's just not very good, I can't tell.The story makes little sense. People make the usual horror movie decisions which leads to the usual horror movie results. This film was a paint-by-numbers routine. Nothing was a surprise, as the entire concept of the movie was pretty much given up in the first two minutes. The rest of the movie was merely unsympathetic characters going through the motions.It felt like the director threw his hands up about three quarters of the way through and said "I'm done". This is apparent from the extremely gratuitous Librarian of Exposition scene where everything is info-dumped on us. Lazy, uncreative, and not scary. This pretty much sums up my feelings about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my review on this film, I am going to write it with a open mind and based of my experience in viewing almost any horror film.The story line of this film seemed amazing. A young girl goes to live with her dad after her mom decided it is the best thing. The dad caught up in work has no time to really understand the warnings his young daughter begs of him to notice.Being a young girl and obviously board with doing nothing all day, decides she will explore. She finds something of strong interest and is warned by the grounds man not to keep going. The father agrees with him, then changes his mind to search himself. Upon uncovering what they were searching for he then tells his daughter Sally she should not go down to the basement (which they uncovered). Once again the grounds man warns them of how dangerous it is down there.You would think the stupid father would get the clear idea after the grounds man comes out of the basement with scissors stuck in his shoulder and cut up like mince meat.There is nothing more that annoys me, then complete blind stupidity. I do not care who he is, the father would not be so stupid to overlook this. He being a house renovator would seal up the door and lock it after this incident. Things get worse and worse and even with direct evidence of the following events occurring, evidence from the past... the father still refuses to believe his daughters cries for help.The film goes on and on with the basement midgets haunting and haunting the little girl, and driving her to pure insanity. These little things...can not stand light at all but all throughout the film they keep switching...they run into a bright lit room whilst the residents are eating dinner and steal a photo from Sally, a photo that would prove their existence to her father... She was so scared??? Then why not show the people next to her, who attempted to see what it was. Often young children will reach out to other adults to make there parents listen to them.In closing there is a insanely disappointing ending with one of the main characters getting picked off.In the very end a even more bazaar voice comes from the depths. In all this...Where was the police investigation? Where was the common sense at one point in this film?No Where.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young girl, her father and his new girlfriend discover creatures in their new home. It soon becomes apparent that the creatures don't want to befriend the little girl but harass with the intent of killing her.1973's Don't Be Afraid of the Dark TV movie aside this is a creepy, stylish looking but sterile chiller directed by Troy Nixey. It starts off very Gothic and dramatised with a Hammer Horror, Tales from the Crypt looking prologue which quickly becomes an evil tooth fairy yarn.The sets, the house and the grounds of the home are spectacular, with a ghostly atmosphere however the exterior is sorely underused. The excellent Guy Pearce struggles with the basic script and appears to go through the motions of a dismissive then concerned father, Katie Holmes looks more comfortable especially when acting alongside little Bailee Madison as Sally.Reminciant of Stephen King's Cat's Eye (1985) while the effects are well executed they are nothing more than mini rat looking Gremlins (that lack comedy) with eerie whispering voices. After a few tension building scenes in the dark, in a bedroom, cellar or bathroom it soon become a little tedious. Ultimately Guillermo del Toro and Matthew Robbins screenplay is an attractive drawn out Twilight Zone / Creep Show episode with a budget. It looks great, has its creepy moments but there's not enough originality or substance to equal the likes of Pan Labyrinth or a generic mysterious house flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one will be afraid of the dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Review: Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (4/10) ¨We want you! ¨Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is the latest scary movie to once again fall short in what I consider a dying genre. Horror movies nowadays suffer from very poor scripts, the stories are really predictable because we've seen so many horror films, and they all rely heavily on special effects. Very few horror films actually manage to scare audiences, and most simply try to shock. At least this film isn't gory, but there aren't any scares either. The main problem I had with this movie were the villains: small Gremlin looking fairies. They just weren't scary at all; they never seemed to present a threat. They are more funny looking than anything else. What really disappointed me the most about this movie however was the script because I was expecting more from Guillermo del Toro (Laberinto del Fauno and Hellboy). The story was actually weak and by the time the mystery about what was in the house disappeared so did my expectations. The mystery only lasts about 20 minutes and then we have to sit through 70 minutes of pointless storytelling. This was Troy Nixey's directorial debut and in my opinion he failed big time. This film was actually based on a 1973 made for television movie of the same title which was directed by John Newland. It's really hard nowadays to find an interesting horror flick that won't disappoint. We don't need to be warned about fearing the dark as long as these movies keep on failing to scare its audiences. The movie opens with a strange murder that takes place in the large basement of a house. A famous painter named Blackwood (Garry McDonald) calls his housemaid (Edwina Ritchard) to come down to the basement where he patiently waits for her and kills her. He asks her to forgive him, but he has to do it in order to get his missing boy back. Some creatures that live under a fireplace seem to demand teeth in exchange for the boy's life so Blackwood takes her teeth and offers them to the creatures, but instead of getting the boy back he is pulled down the fireplace and disappears. Many decades later a couple, Alex (Guy Pearce) and Kim (Katie Holmes), decides to buy the old house and restore it. While working on the house Alex's ex wife sends his estranged daughter, Sally (Bailee Madison), to live with them. Sally isn't happy about ¨being sold¨ by her mother and she isn't very fond about Kim either. Sally is a very lonely and depressed girl, but she begins hearing voices in the house. One day while she is walking around the backyard she discovers a basement and Alex decides to open the sealed up room. Once they unlock the basement, some small creatures begin to haunt Sally in the darkness. Of course no one believes Sally since she has been so affected by trying to adapt to her new home. Since no one is willing to help her, she decides she will have to face her fear alone.The story actually seemed kind of interesting at first, but as I said, once the mystery was over in the opening minutes of the film so was my interest. The story just goes downhill from there on with very little thing making sense. I was even disappointed with the ending of the film (in my opinion it didn't make sense at all, but I can't give anything away). It was good to see Katie Holmes back in a lead role and she did what she could with a weak script. Guy Pierce is a good actor, but this won't be one he will be remembered for. As for Bailee Madison she is one of my favorite child actors. She is so adorable on screen, but this role simply wasn't for her. She is much better in comedic roles, than in scary movies. The role of a depressive and sad kid wasn't for her. I liked her much better in Just Go With It (a terrible movie starring Adam Sandler, but she was the best thing about it) and Brothers (a drama starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman). I actually decided to watch this film because I wanted to see what she could do in a horror movie (besides the fact that I wanted to see Katie Holmes back in action). Don't Be Afraid of the Dark fails in so many levels and I was really disappointed. I really hope a good scary movie comes out before the year ends. I think the last horror movie I enjoyed was Paranormal Activity (and it's been two years already).http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**CONTAINS SPOILERS!!**I'll give a quick run down of the film. Starts off quite spooky, old guy ? E.Blackwood owns a mansion, turns out he's feeding these little goblin like creatures teeth in a bid for the safe return of his son (who the goblins have captured). He tricks his housekeeper into coming down into the basement and trips her over before knocking her teeth out while housekeeper is still conscious. Quite a distressing scene that you would think would set the tone for the rest of the film. Moving now into current times, Dad (Guy Pearce) and girlfriend (Katie Holmes) renovate said old mansion and have Guy Pearces little daughter (Bailee Maddison) thrusted upon him (for reasons we never actually find out properly) Little daughter being an inquisitive little toe-rag, hears voices coming out of an old ash pit in the basement and thus opens up the bolted door releasing the goblins into the house who proceed to terrorise her. No-one believes her until Katie Holmes starts to come round after paying a visit to their grounds keeper (who has just been attacked by the goblins and seems to know more then he's letting on) and visiting the library to do a bit of research on E.Blackwoods past!Anyway, film comes to a climatic ending with the little girl being taken into the ash pit before Holmes saves the day, sacrifices herself and thus bites the dust.Decent premise you'd think, until the gigantic plot holes appear.For example, with the grounds keeper being attacked and hospitalised by the goblins ? no police investigation, just a routine accident, no further action taken/need. Wtf?!The little girl squashes a goblin whilst being attacked by a fair few ... I bet your thinking "surely she told someone about the goblin, they saw the corpse, and then all hell broke loose as they ripped up the ash pit in search of little demons and dead bodies". Errrrr NO. The corpse wasn't even pointed out. Neither were the photo's she took of them on her Polaroid instant photo make camera thing!Throughout the film, occurrences keep happening where the little girl is put to bed on her own, or left alone time and time again. Now who would do such a thing to a little child who is clearly distressed! Holmes, after being sucked into some never ending ash pit, is forgotten about after Pearce and his daughter visit the house the next day to pay homage to her. WTF?! The film ends here and nothing more is said .. apart from a few "our time will come" lines from Holmes, who I'm guessing is now converted into a little goblin somehow.YES I know its a film ... but the major gaping plot holes .. they were bigger then the ash pit in the film, just make for a disappointing film in the end .. Guy Pearce was robotic, and his material was poor for such a good actor, Katie Holmes was her usual wooden self and Bailee Maddison as the was tremendous as the mischievous terrorised girlOther then that, I would class this film as a disappointment, and thus rate it 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First reviewed for Cambridge Film Festival (UK) - 15 to 25 September 2011* Contains spoilers *Guillermo del Toro liked the t.v. story underlying Don't be Afraid of the Dark, quite understandably in view of what interests him. However, he should have asked whether it would please anyone else.When he co-wrote the script, and Pan's Labyrinth holds together for me, this simply did not, and I ask why there are such flaws, why, with such an ill-conceived script, the film was even made. It is enough to list some, in no particular order:? Unless invoking magic, Polaroid® cameras with five clear single-use flash-bulbs cannot keep taking flash photographs indefinitely;? The extensive injuries inflicted on Mr Harris could not have been construed as an accident ? no one could get a wound (from the screw-driver) in his leg at the same time as lacerations to face and hands, and no one at the scene or in hospital would have missed the extent of the injuries;? It may be a given of these films (whatever sort it is) that people act stupidly, but, after seeing him there, it made no sense for Kim to go to the library and not rescue Sally;? Creatures that move objects without touching them (Mr Harris again) don't need the agency of objects to turn off light-switches, etc.;? Sally may have been shocked (by her father bursting into the library?), but why show a photograph, not the creature that she wasn't too shocked to squash?;? What suddenly persuades him to believe in her? I missed the trade name, but, despite her age (the States and medicating children again!), she's probably taking an anti-depressant, and so must be disbelieved! Setting aside questions of genre, making sudden loud noises does not constitute horror (or suspense), e.g. the gratuitous thump in the soundtrack when Mr Harris apprehends Sally on her first discovering the basement window. Later, when the pace of the attack has stepped up (as, of course, it could have done at any point), there is just an overloading of the senses, achieved by pounding music, other chaotic loud sounds, and confused visual displays ? all typical of any so-called action film, but which, if it is one's intention, do not make one afraid, but raise anxiety.We suspect that no one will make it out alive. Anyone doing so is a bonus, when the adults behaved so foolishly when they had the chance before. As to what the ending moments suggest about Kim's fate, who actually cares? True, it did seem, at one point, that Kim was suggesting Sally as their kill instead of her. (When she has been tripped on the stairs by these clever rhesus-monkey-like creatures, who know how to tension a wire ? not there later, when Sally comes down - and even which way she'll come down the stairs).And, yawn, there may be earlier ambiguities. Yet she does rescue Sally, she may or may not be dead (or transformed), and, if she isn't dead, who was the creatures' required victim?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like to call this movie "Gremlins meets Critters meets Jeepers Creepers." This movie could have been a lot better. It has a "What the hell is gonna happen next" appeal. Besides that: not scary, not serious, and too many mini-Gollums looking for their preciouses (Randall Graves style... laugh out loud) The little monsters were revealed way too quickly and they were not really scary. Not as predictable as most movies in this genre, but had enough aspects to say it was the best of this year. I think so far it ranks with Scream 4. And the open-end it leaves does not make any sense. Not recommended unless you scare way too easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many ways to make a bad movie (or to ruin a potentially good one) and this example shows us an abundance of them. What's good in it? The general concept, scenery, music and the kid Sally (Bailee Madison). What's bad? Everything else. For starters, the script was probably the beginning of the catastrophe. Clichés, more clichés and then some more on the top of them all. Some parts of the plot are so stupid they hurt your brains (example: if the creatures are so afraid of the light, why do they move through the house during the day and heavily lighted room?). The creatures speak English (lol!). Sally smashes one of them during the party in the house with the bookcase, but nobody notices or even cares. Of course, nobody believes the child that there is something around and so on. Blah, blah, blah. There are so many flaws and only 1000 words (= one picture) allowed. Acting is below average (Mrs. Cruise is awful) and directing is matching it. Almost nothing is in place. If only someone with only half-wit wrote the script, something that makes sense could have been done here. Oh, yes: the movie has a beginning and an end (sort of). Even something in between. Starts as a promising experience, but ends as disappointment. Don't waste your time on this one (as I did, to write you this warning, as a survivor). People who made this mumbo-jumbo were not up to it. Trust me, neither are you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Horror Weak Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie tells story of a house in which there is a hidden basement(as always)with some harry potter type daemons or animals. According to an old writer who disappeared in the house after his son, these creatures must take one life once they surface. They also take child's teeth for some unknown reason. Actually the writer and his son are taken into the fireplace by those animals.A man, his daughter and girlfriend come there to renovate the house and sell it for good profit. Man has used his entire bank balance on the house. His daughter from the very first day starts finding tunnels, basements and other hidden parts of the house which any other normal kid would never do. It felt so silly and irritating to watch a small kid going to the basement to open the door of sealed fireplace using all tools and equipment without letting anyone know. If girl was not enough to irritate, her father starts his turn. He does some irritating things to increase your anger. Things that any rational man wouldn't do. His girlfriend is the only sane character in the movie. There is nothing more interesting there and nothing scary or no great animation. At the end few questions pop-up in the mind of viewer like: Why those creatures come? why they want teeth? Why they take the girlfriend instead of kid? if they can take anyone why to insist on kid?? Why cant they just get out of the house when creatures are not so strong? why creatures come with weapons some times and why without weapons sometimes? Creatures can be easily crushed with the use of any tiny thing like torch light then why not kill them all like rats?It all doesn't make any sense. I am a fan of horror movies. Motive of the evil and suspense makes these movies enjoyable and not only sound effects and graphics. This movie is weak at story which makes all good acting, direction and everything go in vain. Better watch "Drag me to hell" again :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god. This is one bad movie. Please save the money and don't go to this film. The plot is ridiculous. As always, Katie Holmes shows no intellect or any emotions; it's very superficial. I can't believe Hollywood chooses fame over talent.The guy who plays the father should be ashamed. The only thing he does is looking flabbergasted and he doesn't seem to know his daughter at all.The first five minutes are pretty good, but then .... try to get your money back.Not scary at all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First you want it to start, then you want it to end...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First you want the movie to bring it on because it's so boring, and then when eventually something happens it's so hilarious you want to skip to the end. The creatures from the dark are ridiculous and the behavior of the actors is so pathetic, the movie gets unbearable. I mean, there is no reason after all this evidence in the movie (photos, etc.) to continue being pathetic, but still they do. Is this what we are to expect from remakes in 2010? I had high hopes in this movie, expected something like "They" from 2002, but unfortunately "Don't be afraid of the Dark" isn't even suspenseful. Not a single bit. I was skeptic before watching the movie anyways because Katie Holmes played in it. Rule of the thumb confirmed again: if a well known celebrity plays in a "horror flick", it will not be horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973) was one of the few movies which would justify a contemporary remake due to the fact that its cheap TV manufacture demerited its ingenious screenplay and somber atmosphere of "suburban Gothic". Now, we finally have the remake of that film, and even though it surpasses the original on various technical elements, it is very far from reaching it on the other aspects, specially the narrative one.The main problem from Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010) is that it reveals its "secret" during the first minutes (even before the credits!). As a consequence, co-screenwriters Matthew Robbins and Guillermo del Toro extinguish any possibility of mystery or suspense about the events developed into the sinister mansion. Besides, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010) is far from reaching the atmosphere and level of tension from the original one, not to mention that it does not generate on us the uncertainty of the reality of the phenomenons, which in the original film could have been simple hallucinations from a woman overwhelmed by the pressures of being a "perfect wife" for her exigent husband.What takes me to the second most important fail from the film...Was it necessary to introduce a girl to reconfigure the story and make it a "dark" fairytale? In my humble opinion, that cliché cheapens the narrative, because we have already seen it too many times as an easy trick to amplify the (null in this case) emotions from the screenplay. The life from an innocent girl is in danger! Robbins and del Toro surely supposed that the suspense was going to be bigger on that way and that the audience would squeeze their hands so that nothing happens to her. Yawn. And something which does not help at all either is that the child actress Bailee Madison shows a very limited range of expression and not even the minimum level of conviction in her role. I know that not all the young actresses can have the huge talent from Elle Fanning or Chloe Moretz, but I think director Troy Nixey should have made a better effort at selecting the actress.Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes do not show any credibility in their roles either, something which is exacerbated by the fact that their characters are quite superficially written; when the girl explores the disgusting basement, they are both conveniently absent; but at the first sign of "fantastic stories", they immediately call a child psychologist. So, in conclusion, I cannot recommend Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010), because I think it is a tedious remake with many negative elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Don't Be Afraid of the Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A precocious kid, a big mansion, and mean little creatures that go bump in the night. Essential ingredients for a typical horror film, if only the pacing was done right so that it won't be that much of a chore to sit through what was overly dramatic family relationship matters for the first half, where young Sally (Bailee Madison) is sent packing to stay with her dad Alex (Guy Pearce) and his new girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) in their new mansion in the middle of nowhere, one that has a gruesome past (as with almost all mansions) involving minute goblins with an appetite for children's teeth.With Guillermo del Toro lending his name to the production, one would have set expectations that it'll reach the dizzying heights of his films such as Helboy and Pan's Labyrinth, but first time director Troy Nixey allowed the focus to be put on the estranged relationship between Sally and the adult folks in the new chapter of her life, battling plenty of deep resentment especially with Kim who would be her step-mom sometime soon. Tantrums get thrown around, gifts and little nice gestures get ignored, and when she starts to hear whispers from the shadows who want to befriend her, it gets brushed aside as a relocation problem that with settling down will go away.As mentioned it gets a little tiring trying to keep up with the family drama of the usual fears when dealing with a potential step-mom, though I would say to hold on to your horses since it is precisely this aspect that packs its emotional punch when it mattered. What didn't work was Guy Pearce seemingly like fish out of water, being out of place and uncomfortable as the dad now thrust with the responsibility of a young daughter, when all he wants out of life at this stage is a hot wife who's also his business partner in their joint-renovation of the mansion to be sold for a handsome profit, if only they can get Sally to play ball and not spook everyone out of the house. It's money first, safety and sanity second. Not exactly what one would expect a parent to behave.The narrative only picked up from the midway point when the creatures come out of the closet, well, basement sinkhole, and appear in full glory, no longer playing peekaboo with the audience and characters. Creature design is excellent though, where like little gremlins the creatures may seem easy fodder to be stomped on, and with their inherent weakness for light make them easy targets so long as one is carrying a large flashlight. Thankfully these get compensated through swarming large numbers in highly organized fashion, and being ultra fast and cruel, sparing no thought at utilizing many household items from screwdrivers to boxcutters to inflict maximum damage and pain to the larger human opponents, and opens the door for some degree of gore on screen.Still, this bunch of critters took a little too long to make their unholy appearance, which in the meantime you'd have to contend with an overly long lesson on how not to behave as a parent, with upbringing methods on display both good and bad. There are clear plot loopholes that stem from goalposts being shifted to make way for a more emotional, touching ending, as well as inexplicable behaviour of seemingly rationale people, and if the pace had been tightened and unwanted scenes canned, this could have been a very taut thriller indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Threatening Children? Didn't Make It Any Creepier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1:39, R) ? Borderline, 3rd string, crossoverThere are a lot of people who have no trouble dealing with death, gore, torture, dismemberment, and similar awful things happening to adults but get seriously creeped out whenever kids are threatened. But stop and think about it. Children ? small, weak, ignorant, and curious ? are much likelier victims than grown-ups. If anything, we should be MORE accustomed to terrible things befalling them.That's the premise behind this theatrical remake of a 1973 TV movie. It shares with the recent Fright Night the premise that there's a young person (in this case a girl of about 7, instead of a high-school boy) who's the only one aware of a malign force at work (here a tribe of toothy rat-size homunculi in the furnace room instead of a vampire next door), and nobody will take the kid seriously. At least not at first; eventually the truth ? and the teeth ? come out, and the adults all get a hearty dollop of "I told you so" atop their main course of "You'll be sorry".Guy Pearce is Alex Hearst, heavily mortgaged owner and refurbisher of Rhode Island's Falling Mill mansion. He and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) live there by themselves, even tho the place could easily accommodate an entire village of Hmong refugees. The place had fallen into disrepair after the disappearance of its previous owner, wildlife painter Emerson Blackwood, many years earlier. As Alex's dotter Sally (Bailee Madison), just arrived from California, soon discovers, the whispering voices under the bed and behind the scrollwork ventilation grilles may have had something to do with that.I categorize this movie as borderline rather than outright fantasy, because it's just barely plausible that a sufficiently paranoid race of tiny humanoid creatures could in fact manage to stay hidden from human scrutiny for centuries, as implied here in a reference to the origin of the tooth-fairy myth. We've seen this theme before in legends of The Borrowers, leprechauns, fairies, elves, etc., and it doesn't demand a supernatural explanation ? tho many people are perfectly happy to supply one unasked.A certain amount of prestige attended this project, because the imaginative Guillermo del Toro co-wrote the screenplay. Unfortunately, the basic haunted-house plot is just so heavily formulaic that he wasn't able to find any way to spruce it up, and so it plods thru its paces until the expected ending. The score by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders is equally formulaic, filled with dark foreboding right from the outset.Really, I kind of hate to say that, if you've seen one haunted-house film, you've seen them all, but this one certainly does nothing to dispel that general impression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror movie that doesn't scare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic fantastic-horror movie, with some horror scenes that might scare a little but the whole movie sucks, first of all the plot has no sense in some scenes, it seems like a ten year old child write the story, and never check what he wrote. In addition, all movies that Guillermo del Toro worked in have the same kind of creatures, if you watch Hellboy or El laberinto del Fauno, you will notice this easily, i don't remember the name of the creatures that looks like fairies in Hellboy, but the characteristics were the same. In summary, don't waste your time watching this movie, watch another one, this is not horror, and not even an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you get past the gaping logic and plot holes this is an okay horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at the New York Premiere with the cast and crew in attendance. I also walked out on it about 45 minutes in because the film makes no logical sense, even in it's own world or even in a dream logic sort of way. However when I saw the film a second time I found that the film has some stunning set pieces but that the film doesn't hang together except by force of will.The premise of the film is that a little girl goes to live with her dad and his new wife in a big huge mansion that they are restoring. unbeknownst to any of them is that the house sits on the entryway to a cave system where little beasties live that like to come out and kill people.Based on a TV movie many people consider a classic, the film often has the bumped up feeling of a bumped up TV horror film...but with movies special effects.The trouble for me, and the reason I walked out the first time and the reason I still don't really like the film is that its a movie that doesn't make any sense even on it's own terms.If you want to know why, begin with how an architect could not notice a house he was restoring from the ground up. You can then continue with how it was that the creatures never released themselves from their prison for a century, and yet do so only after our heroine is dragged away after attempting to do just that. Equally baffling is why they would try to kill her before they were released. We'll not get into the whole thing about the monsters not being able to stand any light and yet frequently show up in places with light. There are more questions but I'll leave those to you.The thing that bothers me is that the film is full of creepy sequences, anyone with the monsters attacking is truly scary. These are mini masterpieces. Unfortunately the film fails to adequately link them. had the filmmakers actually cared about the plot they might have had one of the scariest films ever made instead of a misfire.wait for cable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very disappointing. I thought it was going to be over the top scary by watching the previews...but no. It started out way slow and didn't get into the action until the movie was almost over. I would not waste your money going to see this movie. Wait until it come out in Redbox. I'm afraid of the dark but this movie did not even freak me out. The creatures were small and stupid. Their history of eating children and taking teeth and leaving coins behind is like the tooth fairy. I thought they could of came up with a better story behind the creatures. The house was amazing but not realistic. I don't know anyone who would live in a house like that. the only thing going for this movie was the acting. Katie Holmes was good and I've never liked her acting. Hope this helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how is this a horror movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was nothing of what I expected it to be. Instead of being shocked and scared, this movie made me laugh and giggle. No one should be scared of a movie that has barely terrifying themes. Bailee Madison did a excellent job playing the role of the little girl, Sally. I know what it's like to see something that frightens you. And it's so hard to get someone to believe you are telling the truth. These creatures were so ugly looking. The first few minutes of the movie were spooky. The music was horrifying but it didn't bring up any paralyzing terror. The main thing I think was creepy were the voices whispering "Sally". The house was not even haunted. The basement was though. I wish I never saw this movie in the 1st place. This movie should have been rated PG-13. I expected this movie to create a petrified emotion to audiences. What type of monsters would only grab a hold of victims' teeth and leave coins behind? That makes them tooth fairies. It's truly a horrible movie. It's not a movie that would make you scream, and leave a wide-open mouth on your face. It's just gonna make you laugh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Worry, I Won't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know where to begin with this. There are bullet points of so many things wrong with this film. What sucks is that I waited for this thing to come out ever since I first saw the trailer with Paranormal Activity 2. When I found out it was postponed because of financial reasons, I was crushed. Now that I finally saw this dreck, I can honestly say that it should have never been made in the first place.Let's get this out of the way: Remember Gremlins? The Ghoulies? Or even The Gate? Yeah, sure, they were eighties films but the use of puppetry on their little monsters was far more effective than the CGI debacle that is seen in this film. There's something about watching actors being chased by cutscenes from a Playstation 3 game that doesn't sit well with me. It ruins the scare factor of the scene.Okay, okay, before I go on a rant, here's the plot: The movie opens with some guy named Dr. Blackwood knocking out his maid's teeth and offering it to these little monsters in a vent in his cellar so he could get his son back only to be grabbed and pulled inside. Years later, a family moves in with a little girl named Sally and her dad and his mistress. The house looks creepy but it is actually a boring place for one little girl to be. I can imagine it smelled bad like old dust. But then she thinks she found some new friends in the ventilation shaft only to find that they are little monsters trying to get people to be one of them.Let me start with the acting. Throughout the entire movie I kept thinking these were characters written on a page. There is no emotion emulating from the actors. They were just saying the lines from the script and the script wasn't even a good one. Sometimes they would point out the obvious like the scene where they discover a window looking out to their basement and the father busts through the wall and they look around in awe. Then Katie Holmes looks up at the window and says, "That's the window from the garden!" No kidding! Thanks for telling us! Then the most important factor of all: The scares. There are none of them. Like the scene in the trailer where the little girl is crawling under the sheets of her bed and some scary head popped up. Got you, didn't it? Well it won't in this movie. Not only will you see it coming, but you will guess what will happen next. There's also no tension either. Sure, there are scenes where the girl is walking and those little monsters are following her but there is no tension to that scene at all. There's also a scene where the girl was opening the ventilation shaft for the monsters. There was this one last screw there and when the girl turned around, the camera was pointed at the screwing turning and then she hears the noise. It would have been more effective if she heard the crash and then turned, without us having to see the screw turning.Then there's the climax. Even though I was praying for this movie to end, there is no buildup to the climax at all. It just comes without even knowing. I thought there would be tension here, finally, but it happens all so fast and the movie quickly ends. At this point, I was thanking God.The very last line of the film, someone says, "All the time in the world." Sound familiar? Yes, that was in the title for that horrid Spy Kids 4 movie. That should tell you a lot about this film.</fullReview>

Nothing.Perhaps if they had created more of an atmosphere of terror, rather than clichéd scary and comedy, it could have worked.About 10 people (no exaggeration) walked out of the theater before the movie was over.

		<fullReview>For Don't be Afraid of the Dark, we get a horror story that is actually, one may not know this, a remake of a TV movie from the 1970's (!) This being about little demanoid creatures that terrorize and haunt a mother and her young child (Katie Holmes). All of this would've probably had more resonance and emotion if the director (or, hell, producer-writer-presenter del-Toro) gave more to care about with the parents and the kid. But it's a well-constructed haunted-house movie imbued with the unique creature fx that only comes from the guy behind Pan's Labyrinth. Also extra points for a surprising climax that didn't take the route I expected. For design, scares and surface thrills it's a must-see. If only there was something underneath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am truly shocked that this film has such a low IMDb rating. Here is a finely crafted, skilfully directed, well acted, and beautifully filmed fantasy horror film. It is a shame that a good film like this has to be lumped with the likes of standard horror movie crap. I was hypnotized by the visuals, which reminded me of the great film Pan's Labyrinth (both films come from the same creator, Spanish director Guillermo Del Toro). Since nobody else seems to want to defend this movie, I will. It is based off an earlier TV movie of the same name which apparently inspired Del Toro to become a filmmaker. Sally (Bailee Madison) comes to live with her father (Guy Pierce) and his girlfriend (Katie Holmes) in their newly refurbished manor. This place has a history of death, in fact the last owner of it mysteriously vanished. Soon it becomes clear to Sally that there is something else living in the house with them, an ancient presence that whispers through the walls and that leaves coins under pillows in exchange for teeth. . . . Of course, nobody believes Sally, until it's too late! One of the things I really like about the film is it's look. I like the use of colour throughout, especially the autumn hues. Outside the house is always portrayed as cold, with shades of blue and grey. We are always drawn back into the interior of the house, with it's cozy shades of orange, yellow, and brown. I feel like the makers of this really put a lot of effort into making each shot look great, and it really pays off. The acting is good. Pierce and Holmes are competent, but the show is really stolen by Madison. She is very convincing as a girl haunted by demons, she seems actually terrified, and the film becomes all the more scarier because of it. There's only one jump scare in the entire film, that I remember, and it's not unfairly placed. This film doesn't limit itself to horror clichés, but delves deeper into the fantasy realm, which I appreciated. The atmosphere is palpable throughout. To finish off, I would completely recommend this film for lovers of fantasy horror. It's worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' has a lot going for it, as far as modern horror films go.(1) It has (almost) A-list actors associated with it, i.e. Guy Pearce, Katie Holmes in front of the camera and Guillermo del Toro behind it. (2) The little girl at the centre of the film is an incredible little actress who, based on her performance, will go a long way. (3) The monsters are indeed nasty and brought to life using decent computer effects. (4) The location, i.e. the big house, is a good, spooky setting for a supernatural horror. (5) There are even so 'jumpy' moments to rattle the popcorn out of your hand.Based on these points (and possibly because many of the posters advertising this film says things like 'The scariest film of the year') you may be thinking that it just might be. However, despite all the things Don't Be Afraid of the Dark has going for it, it has one major drawback - it's about a little girl who goes to live with her father and his new girlfriend in a big house. That's it. That's the problem. All the good elements are held together by a plot that we've basically seen a million times before in recent horror films. And, worst of all, it doesn't offer much that's new. The little girl's parents don't believe her. Therefore we're treated to them going through the disbelieving motions of slowly coming round to the fact that there's something supernatural going on.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is not a bad film. Like I said, there are some genuinely spooky bits. However, overall there's nothing new here to rave about. If you like horror, you'll probably enjoy it - just don't go believing that it really IS the scariest film you'll see all year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sally (Bailee Madison) goes to live with her dad (Guy Pearce) and new step-mother (Katie Holmes) in a new house that they're restoring and currently living in. Inside this house are fairy-like creatures who eat children and they're hungry for Sally. A horror film for the horror rookie. Bailee Madison was great in this movie. She is one of the better young actresses in Hollywood right now with Chloe Grace Moretz (Hugo) and Elle Fanning (Super 8). You really feel for her character, not really because of the writing, but because of her acting. I really enjoyed Katie Holmes' performance and her character was very likable. Guy Pearce seemed almost like an antagonist. Although, the little creatures that live in the walls are definitely the antagonists, Guy Pearce was the one who never believed Sally. His performance was pretty good, though. Guillermo del Toro obviously had a lot to do with this movie. Although Troy Nixey directed it, this film had a certain style, one that Guillermo del Toro seems to be familiar with in some of his movies like Pan's Labyrinth. He finds a nice divide between beauty and horror- looking elements and it translates well on to the screen. The color scheme in this film is almost entirely black and red and darkness plays a huge part in this film. Troy Nixey did a nice job directing. This is his first feature film he's directed and only his second directing credit but he made a decent horror film. Now, my main problem with Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is you're simply not afraid. I mean, I watched this with my friend who has never seen an actual horror movie before and they got scared. I wasn't in the least bit scared by this film, although it was suspenseful. You can't deny the plot is a bit clichéd but a bit creepy as well. Once you see the creatures, you're actually a little disappointed (not going to say anything else because of spoilers), but I simply wasn't scared. I'll call this a horror film for the horror rookie. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the film was executed, I just found myself wishing there were scares that were pleasing to horror fans. I give Don't Be Afraid of the Dark a B.

		<fullReview>Watch this if....you want to see a thriller movie with a horror theme. It is much more a thriller than it is a horror film that will scare you.Acting/Casting: 5* - I can't say that this is the best piece of acting by either Holmes or Pearce, but that should be expected for this type of film. Bailee Madison does a solid job in her role, but that is the highlight of this category.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 6* - I base this score on the fact that everything in the film is very convincing. The set, lighting, music, special effects, etc. are spot on and really make for a nice stage. However in regards to the directing, the movie has holes and gets a bit redundant at points.Plot/Characters: 5* - Really nothing new here and just an average story. A troubled little girl reluctantly goes to live with her architect father and his girlfriend in an old creepy home that has a secret. The curious girl unleashes the secret and has to deal with the wrath.Entertainment Value: 5* - It keeps your interest throughout, but becomes a bit redundant in the latter part of the film. I can say it is likely on my "one-view only" list.My Score: 5+6+5+5 = 21/4 = 5.3Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric, but misses any opportunity to be scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, there are a lot of good things this movie sets out to do. First of all is the atmosphere; the mansion and all of the environments are captured with amazing detail and the camera-work is also excellent in this regard. Visually this film is very strong, but the key element that should boost the movie from being atmospheric to scary, is sadly missing.A big part of that has to do with the fact that the CG monsters are introduced way too early in the story, and they are shown nearly all the time which kills the mystery. These are simply poor design decisions, that I feel don't do the story justice. Another thing is that the monsters look like something out of a comic book, and overall they seem designed after rats.Troy Nixey's background as a comic book designer shines through in his directing, and he has an eye for detail, but directing a scary story needs more then just that. There are plenty of horror/thrillers that create a scary story without a bodycount (The Others being a perfect example of this, in my opinion). Acting wise the film scores pretty good as well. The performances delivered are competent and overall convincing enough.Perhaps Troy Nixey or someone else on the team wanted to do a little too much with this reimagening. Its difficult to pinpoint what exactly went wrong during the making of this movie. It definitely scores pretty well on almost every level of production. It only needed a good scare factor to make it work, which it doesn't unfortunately. While it is not recommendable, for what its worth Don't Be Afraid of the Dark does showcase the directing potential of Troy Nixey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young girl, Sally (Bailee Madison) moves in to a new home with her Father and his girlfriend, played by Guy Pearce (Memento) and Katie Holmes (The Gift). Once there, she begins to hear whispers from the air vents and basement. It is not long before Sally is being tormented by a horde of small bald, CGI monkeys that are afraid of bright lights. The film dips momentarily into the history of the creatures and even playing on a twisted tooth fairy premise, but neither are enough to capture the viewer's interest or provide a solid back story.Still, the movie starts off well, the house and art work featured in the movie has its own darkly charming style complimented with some clever lighting which gives the scenes a soft, eerie glow. Unfortunately, the more we see of the creatures, the less scary they become. Katie Holmes and Bailee Madison deliver solid performances, but the script doesn't develop or build the relationship between the two. Subsequently the movie fails to chill or scare, leaving a handful of unanswered questions and little emotional connection to the characters.Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark isn't a terrible movie, not by a long shot and had I been in my early teens, I have no doubt, I would be hesitant turning off my light before crawling into bed after seeing it. If you can overlook a few minor plot holes and the cliché story I suspect you will enjoy it.Written and produced by Gullermo Del Toro, the creative driving force behind Pan's Labyrinth and The Devil's Backbone. This film is a loose remake of the superior, 1973 TV movie of the same name, which in turn was based upon Lovecraft's Rats in the Walls.http://wp.me/p1PoRy-1v</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good gateway horror film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered what the Tooth Fairy does with your teeth once it exchanges them for a coin under your pillow? Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) thinks he knows, and if you've seen any of his previous films, it will come as no surprise that his theory is dark, creepy, and anything but nice. Young Sally Hurst (played by the talented Bailee Madison) has been sent by her mother to stay with her father, Alex (Guy Pearce), in Rhode Island at Blackwood, a Victorian mansion that Alex and his new girlfriend, Kim (Katie Holmes), are restoring. Alex is consumed with the restoration in order to establish himself as a world class architect, and has no time to bond with his troubled and Ritalin-popping daughter. But we've seen in the film's gruesome opening sequence - featuring a surprise piece of casting in Garry McDonald (best remembered for his Australian comedy character, Norman Gunston) as Emerson Blackwood, an artist and builder of the mansion - that the dark, yet beautiful mansion has a disturbing past which the caretaker, Mr. Harris (played by Jack Thompson with an almost passable American accent), would prefer to keep undiscovered. Filmed on location just outside of Melbourne, the cinematographer and set designers offer a real treat, both indoors and out. I was envious as I watched the determined Sally explore the house and lush surrounding gardens (echoes of Del Toro's own Pan's Labyrinth), and finding the mysterious hidden basement which has kept the evil imprisoned within for 100 years. If you hear whispering voices echoing your name from deep within a subterranean ash pit, you'd remove the bolts securing the door to see what's within, wouldn't you? Sally does, and unwittingly unleashes the little grotesque creatures who proceed to wreak havoc upon the house. And of course, it's only Sally who (at first) sees and hears them. The creature design, visual effects and voice talent portraying the creatures are top notch, but the line regarding less is more is crossed too readily and they are simply not as effective as when they remained in the shadows, taunting Sally from behind teddy bears or hissing her name through the walls. I have yet to see the 1970's television movie which Del Toro, as co- writer and producer, has based this at times scary remake on but celebrated comic book artist, Troy Nixey (Mike Mignola's Batman, and Neil Gaiman's Only the End of the World Again), shows great promise as a genre director in this, his feature film debut. Bridging the gaps of logic in the script, however, proved to be a bit beyond him. Improbable actions from the adult characters left me not caring as much as the filmmakers intended us to, and Katie Holmes again shows her limited range in a role no doubt written to be a strong, sympathetic heroine but which she fails to bring off. The real fun to be had with Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark comes from Bailee Madison's great performance, and experiencing the terror through the eyes of the misunderstood Sally. Adults may no longer jump at things that go bump in the night, but kids know better than to close their eyes - or lose their teeth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, But not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this with my wife last night and even though it was an OK film, we both thought a few things were out of place, for example.There's a part in the film where the lights go out and instead of staying with the child who has already run away because she that scared and Katie assures her she won't leave her, she decides to go looking for her husband thus leaving the kid(Take her with you, you stupid cow, I almost shouted).Also, Katie later gets took away by the little creatures and what does her husband do? Go on Guess?..... Nope you're wrong.... He leaves her only to return days or months later to drop a picture off that the kid had drawn and leaving poor old Katie down the hold with the little CGI monsters........All in all the film was OK with a few jumpy bits, but I have to say Katie Holmes looked terrible..... You need to put some weight on love, because you're skin and bone....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good and stylish Del Toro horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been very excited for Don't Be Afraid of the Dark...it looked like good, creepy and effective horror, not to mention it was co-written and produced by Del Toro. It was a good film. It had good atmosphere, and it kept me entertained. Katie Holmes is pretty good here and very likable. Guy Pearce... well let's skip him for now. The real star is Bailee Madison. I have seen her in other films and she ALWAYS impresses me. She has such a great ability to really focus on emotion. It's rather outstanding to be honest. She will have a great career. The film never really hit greatness. It wasn't the masterful horror film I had wanted and expected to see. The screenplay was sorta... simple and sorta thin. Not weak, just thin, and not many stand-out writing. The direction was very good, although maybe if Del Toro had directed it would it have maybe had more impact. The fact that we saw the creatures as early as we did did ruin the scariness, but I loved that aspect of it as it went on. I enjoyed all of the creatures and the misfortune they wanted to cause. As a mater of fact, I wish the film had more outlandish and stand-out scenes with them. I think it could have done more outrageous things with them and maybe turned it into a more serious version of Drag Me To Hell? Anyways, it was a tad disappointing, but it still remains a good, solid effort. Oh, and Pearce... so frustrating and unlikeable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sacrifice of Kim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT first of all! I am so glad that Sally the little girl realized how much her dad's girlfriend Kim loved her. She had treated her so coldly in the beginning. Katie Holmes is a great actress and I hope they release that Kennedy miniseries she did because she proved herself to me in this film. Her character made the greatest sacrifice in a horror movie since Tina Williams saved Jamie in Halloween V. She loved Sally so much she gave her immortal soul for her! Way to go Kim! Your my kind of girl! Seriously, the set designers and constructors in this film certainly deserve a pat on the back because they did a hell of a job creating a haunted house. This is a nice little thriller that delivers with a minimum of gore. My only beefs were that the movies lighting is too dark at times and those little creatures really weren't scary. I was supposed to be terrified by them but I just thought the family needed to call an exterminator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK': Three Stars (Out of Five) Guillermo Del Toro produced and co-wrote (with Matthew Robbins, who he also partnered with on the 1997 horror film 'MIMIC') this remake of a cult classic 1973 TV movie of the same name. The film was directed by Troy Nixey, a comic book artist making his feature directing debut. It stars Katie Holmes, Guy Pearce and the young but talented Bailee Madison. The story revolves around a young girl sent to live with her father in a new home in which she finds herself coveted by small creatures living there. Not quite as scary or creepy as the hype lead me to believe but it is an effective little horror film none the less.Madison plays Sally, a young girl having trouble coping with abandonment issues from her mother who recently left her in the hands of her father Alex (Pearce). Alex is an architect who has recently taken on the task of renovating an old mansion known as Blackwood Manor (who's residents mysteriously disappeared several years earlier). He moves in to the mansion along with his interior decorator girlfriend Kim (Holmes) and Sally. Sally of course has troubles adapting to her new home as well as family, especially Kim. Her troubles multiply when she begins hearing voices calling to her coming from a hidden basement she exposes to her dad. The voices continue to call for her as she learns more and more about the creatures they belong to and her father has no interest in her cries for help, which he sees as a fantastical delusion Sally's conjured up in hopes of avoiding real issues. Sally is forced to fend for herself as things intensify.The movie was rated R for 'pervasive scariness' according to the ratings board and in my opinion this is ridiculous. There's very little violence or gore and the scares aren't nearly as frightening as a lot of much more disturbing PG-13 moves (like 'THE RING' or 'INSIDIOUS'). Del Toro and crew shot the film with a PG-13 rating in mind and they should have got one. This is yet another example of how useless the motion picture rating system is and it's a shame so many people rely on it (I highly recommend other sources, like just reading up on the film and asking friend's opinions). The film is scary but nothing too scary for any teenager I know. Having known this, before seeing the movie, is the main reason the film didn't live up to the hype for me; it wasn't nearly as frightening as I was expecting. It's well made, the atmosphere is staged right and I'm sure it would scare the s--- out of most little kids but for most over the age of 13 it's not anything too special. It works for the most part but it is pretty slow a large amount of the time and the build up is over done. Not a bad horror film by any means but certainly not an especially good one either.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4tG6zhJxO8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demonic Tooth Fairies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a decent Horror film. Let's start with the positive elements. Well for one it has moments with good spooky atmosphere as well as excellent Horror movie ideas that just sent chills down your spine. The plot of this movie is also kinda creepy, as demonic tooth fairies plan to take a cute little girl and make her one of their own. Also the acting is really good. Every actor is believable. Finally this movie dose succeed in have some pretty damn scary visuals, like the paintings of the creatures, those are guarantied to send chills down your spine. Now it's time to move on to the negative aspects of this film. First of all there are A LOT of plot holes. Usually I'd tell you what they were, but the IMDb message board for this movie already talks enough about them. Another flaw with this film is the fact that, although the actors are good, the characters can sometimes be inconsistent and stupid. At times it seem the evil tooth fairies would have been scarier if you never saw them, or only got brief glimpses of them. In the end the good moments do a good job at trumping the bad moments, so this movie is still enjoyable and I do recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know about you, but if I had moved into a creepy country mansion as a child, the last thing I would have done would be wandering around the cellar at night to investigate the source of ominous whispers. Written by Guillermo Del Toro, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark goes for a dark fairy tale approach, with its kid protagonist's casual reaction to supernatural phenomena - when malevolent rat-like creatures reveal they inhabit the house, she tries to befriend them instead of, you know, being scared out of her wits and ending up under psychiatric care for the next 20 years.A lovely-crafted Gothic story in the Arthur Machen / early H.P. Lovecraft mold, the movie is spooky, competent, mildly disappointing when you realize there is nothing novel about its narrative, characters and mythology. Cue disbelieving father, tension between daughter and stepmother, supernatural intruders becoming more and more aggressive. To call it a triumph of style over substance would be slightly ungenerous, but not too far off the mark.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has a simple enough title that makes it obvious that it is a scary movie, the DVD poster certainly made it look interesting as well, and I was made even keener knowing that Guillermo del Toro was writing and producing to see this. Basically in Providence County, Rhode Island, interior designers Alex Hurst (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) are restoring Blackwood Manor to be sold to their client, the estate is infamous as the owner Emerson Blackwood and his son disappeared many years ago. While the renovations go on Alex's nine year old daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) is staying with them, sent by her mother, she is depressed being on Adderall, but also because she has been forced to live with her estranged father and the girlfriend she hardly knows or likes, she rejects any attempts from her to get to know her. Feeling lonely and exploring Sally uncovers a hidden part of the house, and located through a passage under the staircase a hidden basement, Alex's employee and Blackwood's descendant William Harris (Jack Thompson) warns the little girl never to go down there again, but she overhears strange voices coming from the ash pit, and she removes the bolts and cover so that those speaking can get out. Sally assumes that the little creatures are friendly, but slowly she realises their hostility, as they make her look more hateful towards Kim, such as cutting up her clothes, and more frightening encounters with them occur, including during the hosting evening with the client Charles Jacoby (Alan Dale) and others. Alex, Kim and Sally try to flee the house, but the creatures ambush them and force them to stay in the house while they slowly provoke, torture and attack them, they ultimately want to feast on the bones of the little girl, but in the end Kim is the victim to the terror being dragged into the depths of the ash pit, the girl and her father return to the mansion to mourn their loss, it seems the creatures could threaten anyone else who would enter the basement. Also starring Julia Blake as Mrs. Underhill and Garry McDonald as Emerson Blackwood. Pearce is alright trying to be level headed and rational while weird things go on, Holmes looks pretty and is also alright, and Madison is a good young actress who screams a fair amount, with touches of Pan's Labyrinth stuff, a haunted house with ancient evil fairies and high tension at the right moments it does feel a thrilling dark fantasy, a watchable horror film. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad. A few starts. Good acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bailee Madison and Guy Pierce make this movie. The CGI was not as bad as some have said, but this was not a "big-budget" movie either so do not expect "Marvel" or Christopher Nolan-ish quality either.It did have some suspense and did offer me a couple of anxious moments. This movie is as much about the creepy little critters who want to eat the girl as it is about the relationship change between the daughter and potential step-mother.Other than being the voice saying "the little girl may not be crazy" and to forward the plot through research, Katie Holmes' only real contribution was that of self-sacrifice at the end. Her character is not well-developed (neither is Guy's for that much) but she lacks the "presence" to carry a scene to compensate for the weak character she was given. The only time she truly "owns" a scene is the one with the koi pond. The original maid, librarian, and the guy from Architectural Digest (played by the talented Alan Dale) all carry more screen presence than Holmes. I want to like Katie Holmes but she just does not seem to "step it up" in front of the the camera as do the actors with the performances which came off so much "stronger" Guy Pierce, on the other hand, does have a commanding screen presence and is able to somewhat compensate for his weakly developed character. Bailee Madison also does a good job at this although she lacks the seasoned emotional range of Guy. Bailee's character is also much better developed than the other two leads.All-in-all, it is not too bad. If you need a spooky movie fix without dropping down to the ones that are so contrived that they make your brain hurt (we all know and sometimes even like some of these cheesy films), then this version of "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" might do it for you........</fullReview>

The rest of the movie also fails to impress on any point apart from the girl's performance.

		<shortDescription>Re: the title. Don't worry, the film won't give you any reason to be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the title itself says Don't be afraid of the Dark, and don't worry this film won't give you much reason to.When an architect Alex (Guy Pearce) and his interior designer fiancé Kim (Katie Holmes) move Alex's daughter from a former marriage Sally into their huge fixer-upper estate for some bonding time, Alex sees it as a chance for Kim and Sally to forge a quasi mother/daughter relationship. And a chance to 'save' Kim from her overbearing, over protective Mother.But Sally resents both her new surroundings and the sense that she is but a problem to be handballed away, she shuts both Alex and Kim out and stays in her room for the most part.But a child's bedroom is small, and the estate is immense and enticing, with Alex and Kim nearly finished their vast renovations and refurbishment (a project that they hope will be set them up for life by being featured on the cover of a prominent architectural magazine). Eventually the allure of discovery drags Sally outside, where despite the gruff rumblings of the supervisor Mr Harris (Jack Thompson) that this home 'ain't safe fer kids' she manages to uncover an entire new area of the residence hidden under the main building.The trouble for Sally starts with voices. Voices only she can hear. Voices that implore her from behind a bolted grate to 'come and play'. Of course despite the protestations of most in the cinema audience Sally does just that, leading to an infestation of sorts behind and beneath the walls and floorboards of the building ? always at night.An infestation that Morbo from Futurama might describe as numerous and belligerent.From here we cue up the horror movie cliché bingo; the scene in the bathtub, in the bed, the hiding under the sheets, the trip to the library for disturbing news, the dopey, stubborn parent who refuses to believe? Speaking of dopey parents, Alex is indeed dopier than most. When a man nearly dies by a thousand tiny cuts in his own building he writes it off as an accident, when his own daughter clearly (and frequently) describes her reasons for fear he ignores them as symptoms of an active child's mind. Katie Holmes as Kim on the other hand has no excuse, I would have thought that being married to an intense, diminutive, fiendishly evil goblin for a decade would have taught her how to handle herself better? In any case Don't be afraid of the Dark is fairly formulaic fare despite the presence of Guillermo Del Toro behind the scenes, in the end while it wants to be a companion piece to The Gate, the 80's teen friendly horror flick is scarier, funnier and just plain better than this film.Final Rating ? 5 / 10. It's a movie alright, but a movie with precious few virtues to extol, and not one which will cause you any lasting nyctophobia (fear of the dark).P.S. As an Australian it is obvious early and often that this film was made here and features a great many familiar faces as supporting actors. This isn't necessarily a good or bad thing, just a thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Reviews: Don't Be Afraid of The Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of The Dark, is a horror film by Guillermo del Toro, that made a very brief appearance in theatres this summer. I missed every opportunity to see it, in fact i blinked and missed the opportunity to see it. This particular movie received generally positive buzz, but it lacked backing from its distributors and on top of that a less then enticing title "Don't Be Afraid of The Dark" was more or less handicapped in its delivery.Guillermo del Toro, is one of my most inspiring people in the movie industry these days- and his enchanting film Pan's Labyrinth (2006) is definitely one of my favourites. His films' somehow manage to combine fairy tale elements' with eery horror, he recreates your worst childhood nightmares. My Pan's fan-hood is what enticed me to give Don't be afraid of The Dark a fair viewing, i say this because based on the trailer- and once again that horrendous film title- not to mention the casting of Katie Holmes (yes she is in this movie, lets move on.) I had low expectations, the benefit of this though is if you approach something with lower standards your less likely to be disappointed.Truthfully this movie is at times absolutely terrific!, the premise is simple- fairy folk living in the depths of the basement of an old Manor- the whimsical elements that you would expect from Del' Toro are all there neat and tidy, a fairy tale about evil fairies that eat the bones and teeth of children, dragging them into the underworld- these demons described as "tooth fairies" are relentlessly evil and crawl freely about the house, creating the atmosphere of impending fear. The feelings that "Don't Be afraid of the Dark" inspire, are reminiscent of childhood horror- get your parents to check in your closet and under your bed.This film is highly unique in stylization, and well executed- The protagonist is Sally, an 8 year old girl, who is at times wise beyond her years, the other characters are fairly cookie cutter, but then you do not mind so much when they are tormented by the evil fairy demons. Typical to any film with a child protagonist, most of the suspense is driven by the fact that the adults refuse to believe in *insert generic haunting creature here*, whether it be ghosts or in this case evil fairies. This drives the story along, although as an audience member aware of the going ons, you cannot help but at times feel annoyed with the adult characters and take pity on poor Sally. It really is an emotionally investing movie- i felt exhausted by time things finally played out.I will let this movie off easy though simply because i found it enjoyable- but i will warn any potential viewers that there are some "weird" and awkward plot devices. Near the end of the film, things get a bit sloppy when the "fairies" begin conversing with Sally, and for whatever reason step-mom Katie Holmes goes into crazy "hero-mom" mode, a role that is actually outside of her acting range. Did i mention that Guy Pearce also is in this film, yeah he plays the dad- i think his only purpose was to remain in denial throughout the entire film. I sort of wish he'd fallen victim to the fairy folk- spoiler alert- He survives. The reality is, in order to enjoy this film you need to put your brain into just-go-with-it mode, just remember its a fairytale bedtime story- don't over think it. Personally, i hope that more people give "Don't be Afraid of The Dark" a fair chance- i know this is wishful thinking. *cough* I can't get past the title. *cough* But the film is entertaining and special in its own way. I know i sound like i am defending a deformed entity here; but trust me you can "allow" yourself to like this movie.On a final note, i want to revisit my praise for Del' Toro, this film is actually the result of the restructuring of a 1973 ABC-family Made for TV horror film, by the same unfortunate name. God bless the man for making rocks into diamonds as far has that goes- Review By Brandie Tschauner</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say the movie had potential but it didn't use it at all, I don't want to take anything away from those who actually did enjoy this at all , but to me personally I just didn't enjoy any of it at all. You will get a couple cheap thrills but the build up is very slow.There are scenes that don't make sense, in one sally is in the washroom taking a bath , she has been previously terrorized many times by these creatures yet she seems oblivious to the fact that they will strike again. Also she knows there weakness , yet she doesn't even use it to her advantage at all, ( they shut off the light so turn it back on). *spoiler I liked pretty katie holmes character for awhile when she started to believe but then she just seemed to kind of stop caring, and then she gets killed. Sad. Also the photos (the kid)? I don't get it, what happened to all the photos she took and the body of the gremlin she killed? Is that not evidence of the paranormal? *spoilerFor me personally, I don't like a movie where the adults don't act like adults they act very scripted and predictable when in truth human behavoir can be quite unpredictable especially when spooked and under duress.I liked insidious a lot better, although the end does not go in favor for the main character in both movies, it is done in a classy way where i can understand it is very clever in insidious. In this movie they kind of just give up, I mean there is monsters in your basement , the army the police, the media , so many people in reality would be interested in this, but of course concerning this the main characters are content to run away and let 6 inch little monsters have there way .I am disappointed and should of watched conan, at least conan has a character who acts like an intelligent adult. How often do you see little gremlins, this is a new species? Who could run away forever? This contradicts all that it means to be human, and be intelligent, and be curious. The world was not made to what it is today by running away. thanks hope this helps, if you still want to watch this or did watch it and enjoyed it, know that this is just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To make a great horror, or just a scary movie, you have to follow some certain rules. And they forget some very important rules, which makes this one too boring and it doesn't really develop. The only positive thing about this movie is the CGI-work on those creatures, they're just excellent! The worst thing about this movie is that they show the creatures way to early in the movie and generally shows to much of them, which make it lack in my horror-meter. The creatures is really well done, and looks so real at some points, but they're too small to be scary and to exposed to be really scary.When the movie starts and the girl gets some lines going, I already judge her as a bad actor. But in fact, the girl act very good, and really put in emotion, nervousness and realistic fear. The characters in this movie doesn't really develop, and when the creatures appear it's the same almost every time. It just didn't make me hold my breath, sit silent in chock, or bite my nails. The trailer looked like this was on of those scary movies you always look for, but it just wasn't, and to be honest, not even close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be as little reason to review this movie as there was to make it, but it was made, so I'll review it.It sucks.Well, that's not much of a review, although it's more than the movie deserves, since it isn't much of a movie, but I'll elaborate.I love Guy Pearce in supporting roles, but the thinness of his talent becomes all too evident the more we see of him. Add to that a character that isn't even remotely likable, and you've had enough of him before the first act closes. Likewise for Katie Holmes, who as an actress has little to offer other than being beautiful.In fact, the only character in the movie that is even remotely interesting is the house and its impending Architectural Digest debut. Being a fan of the magazine, I kept waiting for something that would warrant a cover, but even that never came through.All you end up with is these creepy little goblins, tooth faeries, perhaps, as it seems they feed on children's' teeth (is that even possible given their lack of any nutritional content?) And they fancy the teeth of Sally (Bailee Madison), poor little abandoned Sally whose mother and father just don't love her enough (cue violins).The tooth faeries hiss and sigh in an endless sibilant whispering that only little Sally can hear. In short order, she succumbs to the siren song and the beasties set upon her. The rest is all sound and fury signifying nothing except a few "boo scares" now and then, cheap and tawdry and really unnecessary, just like the movie.This movie is a remake of a cult classic made for television in the 1970's, twisted somewhat around a younger protagonist. Absolutely nothing about it works, and it doesn't improve on the original in any way. I really expected more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film very disappointing. The plot was boring, it was not scary and the story never really tied together. Some great moments ( approximately two in the entire movie) but I would save your money. Although the original is no masterpiece either, at least it has some neat 70's moments. I was left with a few questions at the end of the film: why do the little gremlin style faeries need children's teeth(they feed on bones, but why do they seek children when they can eat adults?)? Why do they wait to take the girl? How did the makers manage to make such a terrifying concept so downright mundane?my favourite parts where the throwbacks to the 70's movie,such as the trip wire scene and speaking at the end. this film could of been a truly scary film, with so many childhood fears wrapped up in fairy tale, but unfortunately it was slow, and ruined by the unrealistic portrayal of a child. the little girl did a great acting job, but her part was unrealistic. for an eight year old she was much too witty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark successfully revisits the haunting story of the original 1973 made-for-TV movie, which crafted a chilling tale of fantasy and horror. Like it's predecessor, one of the most unique aspects is the creature design, utilizing tiny, misshapen, devilish critters scurrying around on the ground like over-sized rats. For once, monstrous antagonists aren't the source of terror ? instead, an army of miniature villains provide plenty of scares with scissors, screwdrivers and straight razors. Although rated R by the MPAA, the bloody violence is lacking, with suggestive but unseen brutality in the forefront and atmospheric pop-out scares always at the ready. Still, however, the most agonizingly frightening scene was given away in the teaser trailer ? the slow lifting of bed sheets to reveal the first good look at the little tormentors.Alex (Guy Pearce) picks up his young daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) from the airport to welcome her back into his life ? a decision hastily made when her mother thinks it would be best to change her environment. Alex is joined by his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes), who is nervous about jumping into the role of taking care of a child. They cheerily bring Sally back to the old mansion they've been restoring; a creepy building once owned by the demented Emerson Blackwood before he mysteriously vanished shortly after his 8-year-old boy also disappeared.Sally doesn't approve of Kim, but finds a reason to start confiding in her: a hidden basement under the property houses a boarded-up, fireplace-like hole where gravelly whispers call out to her to play. Words of warning by handyman Mr. Harris (Jack Thompson) fall on deaf ears as the trio explores the private quarters of the tortured Blackwood. After Sally opens up the excavation, she realizes all too late that she's unleashed an army of sinister pygmy goblins hell-bent on capturing her sole, as required by their ancient code of barbarous existence.With eerie sound effects, a shocking opening scene, and ghastly scenery drenched in atmospheric visuals, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark gets off to a strong start. The Hitchcockian title sequence doesn't quite fit, however, and the pacing fumbles midway. The small cast is effective for character development but counterproductive for victim body count, lessening tension as only the child is targeted for torment. The odds of Sally gorily getting the business end of a sharp object is much less likely than the adults. Still, there's a slowly building dread, jumpy moments and a persistently morbid mood that presides nicely over the frightful events as the plot follows the original teleplay very closely. Sadly, the film as a whole doesn't break new ground in the horror genre, or even offer up any particularly startling moments not witnessed in the preview trailer.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be watching this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never walked out of a movie before. This movie was the first.It begins good, and within 20 minutes goes downhill. Hard. We get a protagonist little girl who is nothing like Pan's Labyrinth. This girl is spoiled, overweight, and doesn't act like a girl her age would act. The adults respond in kind, not treating her the way she would be treated in real life. So to begin with, the movie pulls you out of realism.And then the creatures. Utterly useless. At times they're hurt by the light and won't go anywhere near it, but then when the plot calls for it, they just walk around in it, and it doesn't seem to affect them at all. They have multiple times where they can get Sally and just don't.Katie Holmes' acting is like watching a elderly woman passing away in a hospital bed. While on the other hand, Guy Pearce's acting is like watching him say some lines so that he can leave for lunch.Add all that up with so many plot holes/plot contrivances, and you get one dumb movie. Also, rated R? For what? The most gruesome this movie gets is showing a pair of scissors stuck in someone's shoulder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After moving into a new house in the countryside, a young girl discovers the area home to a race of diminutive beings who need to feed on human teeth to survive and must convince her parents to help her stop them.This is quite a decent enough effort that does have enough going for it to make it work. The main thing going for this one is the fact that house itself is used to build the kind of atmosphere and presence that gives this a rather impressive amount of suspense throughout this. By being the kind of location that can accurately keep the creatures hidden so well as it does here by utilizing the darkened hallways, light-less rooms and generally creepy layout this gives off, it has the perfect hiding locations to allow the creatures to stay a rather impressive force by having them know the lay-out so that there's an advantage to them that's not available elsewhere. That gives this a few rather impressive attack scenes throughout this with there being the basement brutalizing and the ambush in the bathroom to give this a rather spectacular air about it to having the kind of action required to stay invested here. As well, the final half which is the assault on the dinner party and the guests there is quite a bit of fun and really works quite well, helped by the swarm of creatures there but also managing to get plenty of high-end spectacle coming from this so it all works out quite well. These do help somewhat to overcome the few flaws in here, though nothing overcomes the factor of having the father be so utterly clueless and careless towards his daughter's claims. The blatant dismissals here generally feel solely there to provide an excuse to stay in the house and keep the plot rolling along rather than out of any general kind of rational behavior on his part, as the kind of sequences ushered throughout here are far more worthy of investigation on his part and these are brushed off quite simply to move the plot along so these are quite unbelievable. As well, the constantly-changing tone of the creatures here is somewhat confusing, since it gives them a reverence and feel towards their behavior and general appearance that reads more like a fantasy than a straightforward horror effort so there's a rather alarming clash against the brutal and vicious actions they undergo here. It doesn't help the CGI looks atrocious and off throughout here as they rarely interact well with their surroundings and the size changes throughout, but when they have a whimsical attitude towards someone here only to suddenly swarm them with knives and surgical tools to violently begin hacking them to pieces, it's differing moods is a big problem. Otherwise, this one isn't so bad.Rated R: Violence, Language and continuous children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, it was refreshing to see a movie representation of fairies that WASN'T all tinkly winkly twee - the traditional view of fairies pre-Victoria and Disney was a lot darker and more dangerous - yes,in Celtic folklore they bring gifts, but all are dangerous.The film itself was full of warnings of what anybody involved in that house was in for - out of everybody, only the grandson of the original grounds keeper seemed to marginally recognize them. (It would be interesting to see a translation of the runes carved into the lip of the well that's really a burrow-mouth for this particular colony of faerie nastiness.) The tree imagery was interesting, is it a pagan "Tree of Life"? or a "Tree of Death", ie., a door to the underworld? I say this because most of the more obvious tree imagery is in the form of doors: every time you go through one, you enter another "world". The front door is beautiful, splendid with carving and stained glass, leading into a darkly splendid and somewhat safe home interior, masking what lies beneath. The hidden door to the studio which mirrors it, is dark and dirty, a blatant warning to everyone who sees it of the darkness it hides. When the inner, hidden door is opened, to reveal the studio and a THIRD door, this one a steel prison gate, the darkness held at bay gets out and goes on a rampage. I say at bay because gates don't banish, they keep out, and yes, gates can be opened.I also see the use of tree imagery by del Toro as an admission that Nature is beautiful, but it also has red fangs - fangs which devour children and baby birds alike - the mouth being the well into the earth/underworld - del Toro got that right, too! The spiral that Sally is seen drawing at the beginning fits nicely with that theme of the "Old hidden beneath the New" - it's a very ancient symbol for, among other things, eternity - and yes, the things that live beneath the house are eternal, they just dig deeper when threatened, always surviving. (Perhaps the Sally has a bit of Sight, if you want to carry the Celtic analogy further, leading to her need to be medicated all the time, to dull it, and that the spiral she draws is a prediction of the future...) Kim's explanation of why Koi in their beauty have to be tough explains what Sally is in for and why - I just wish he'd fleshed that out a bit more.It's also interesting that the things (Unseelie Court?) don't share the traditional aversion to iron that faerie has, and that you could see that they were adapting to the light as they grew bolder in their stalking/pursuit of Sally - finally showing up at the dinner party her oblivious father holds despite the warning signs he doesn't recognize (Kim seems a tad more on the ball - ironic that she winds up the sacrificial victim to the underworld and not Sally - it seems that the "Little Men" don't really care, in the end, about the age of the newest recruits to their ranks.)Other references to the ancient roots of the menace under the house: the maze, the antler ball in the maze, the face carved into the woodwork, secret places underground (the studio) and the reference to sinkholes and no basements in the area, and the modern housekeeper's last name, "Underhill" - a shout-out to Tolkien, who despised the more recent re-invention of faerie as all twinkly-poo and sugar as well as a blatant hint as to what was going on - a Faerie mound was beneath the place!!! The passing reference to the tooth fairy was a hoot, and there were no references to Judeo Christian symbols and prayers as defense - the cross didn't drive them away, in fact, a 5th Century POPE had to cut a deal with the nasty little buggers: teeth in return for coins! as appeasement, not an exorcism! (Anybody know where the story of the tooth fairy really comes from?)A dirty romp through the underbelly of twiddle diddle twee, this film is, complete with oblivious adults and fairies who resemble rats more than they do Fairy Peaseblossom - with a few WTF moments that should have been developed more, but still worth watching. Myself, I would have burned the house down, found the cellar hole after wards, pumped diesel fuel down that shaft and tossed a few grenades with the pins pulled in after before sowing the earth surrounding the resulting crater with salt at least an inch thick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would be remiss if I said this was a hit. However, I like Del Toro, and I appreciated the dark, atmospheric, aesthetically pleasing aspects of this movie. I also liked its attempts to recreate a vintage horror feel. If you can suspend your distraction caused by the numerous plot holes and easily solvable problems (i.e., the creature gets crushed by the bookcase, its severed arm falls to the ground, but dad and girl leave the room without a second glance or discussion), you might enjoy the film for its positive features. Sometimes you just have to take something for what it is in spite of its flaws. This is certainly one of those movies. Oh, and I found the evil fairies quite amusing-- not scary, mind you, but amusing. I also found the brief reference to Pope Sylvester II to be funny, as he was accused of consorting with the devil. I suppose in a creative writer's mind there's only a small step from devils to demon fairies, and an obscure reference always lends credence to a plot, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but showing too much creature and characters that lack common sense keep it from being great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As my headline suggests, this movie is by no means a bad movie. The actors do a good job, the story is interesting and the atmosphere is downright creepy. However, the mysterious small creatures that lurk in the shadows are revealed in the film far too early. Once you see them, creepy as they are, they become very un-scary quickly which makes you say things like "stomp on them!" etc. which kind of takes away from the dread aspect of the movie. If you never quite see the creatures, it'd be harder to discern a way to defeat them. However, Sally manages to crush one at the end of the second act which suggests they aren't all that formidable. Also having scenes where characters just do things that any sane person would be doing the opposite is a staple of the horror genre, so many of the situations in the film border on cliché. I understand that horror films can't have every character doing the "smart" thing, if they did there'd be no movie. However, there's also ways where they try and figure out what's happening which continually get foiled until the third act when all hell breaks loose. But having the young child who is terrorized and having all the adults not believe her has been done to death.Overall, a good movie with some genuinely creepy moments. But once the movie picks up pace it becomes more like an action adventure than a horror.</fullReview>

I never saw the original so I can give an unbiased opinion that is not based on nostalgia.I found the film entertaining it gave me a few frights (I am a horror film buff so I am not easily scared) it had my girlfriend hiding under the bed clothes! It is a film well worth watching, I would not say it is a 'family' film as some have suggested as it is quite gory in places. I would not say the director uses cliché's but rather he puts the frights in all the right places, which is nothing to be sniffed at.If you fancy a film that is borderline fantasy/horror this is perfect for you, little touches like the circle of mushrooms that hint at the creatures origin will leave some scratching their heads, and others tittering in delight.Overall 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mythological and horror tale, that could be have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Do not Be Afraid of the Dark" is a remake of a 1970 movie, with the same name, by it turn is based on a story by the early 20th century American horror author, H.P. Lovecraft, called "The Things on the Walls". It was directed by Troy Nixei, and has as producer and writer Gullermo Del Toro, starring Bailee Madison (Sally), Katie Holmes (Kim) and Guy Pearce (Alex) in the leading rolesThe film can be classified as a Thriller-Horror film with a theme drawn to fairy tales (a little scary and grotesque, like the Brothers Grimm tales), and that is happening today, in a Gothic-Vitorian style mansion in Rhode Island.The film starts the story with a prologue that shows the original owner of the manor, Lord Blackwood, who kills her maid to get her teeth, trying to please something mysterious, living in an oven in the secret basement of the house, in an attempt to reclaim his son back from them. At the present, the mansion was bought by a couple of architects (Alex and Kim), one of whom (Alex) is recently separated and has one daughter (Sally), who will spend time with them (against her will) as she is saddened by the events that occur in the marriage of her parents.Exploring the house, they find the old basement, and Kim has a fascination by the strange oven, and the whispered voices she hears in it, trying to attract her. Throughout the story, Kim tries to get close to Sally, but this has a minor role, although important, in the story overall.The setting and scenery that are observed in film are excellent with a very distinctive and high-level photography, as usually Del Toro movies are visually, with a touch of fantasy that matches the story. Especially the details of the house, call the attention, and the choice of colors used in general.Scenes with violence or blood are only seen in rare instances of the film, but by its content, do not fit very well with the rest of it, and the way that the story unfolds and events are shown and told.The story is based on the tale cited above (the tooth fairy one), but with some modifications, and different characters, and I noted that El Toro used interestingly almost the same "tooth fairy" character (with modifications, of course) in other movie, "Hellboy 2", of 2008. The inspiration for this mythological theme in turn, came from writer Arthur Machen, author and English mystic of turn of the 20th century, that El Toro is a fan (as he is a fan of Lovecraft also). This mystic-lore theme, also, is recurrent in other El Toro's works like "Hellboy II" and the "The Faun's Labyrinth".The story develops gradually after the discovery of the basement, but some facts later (and that would result in some "material evidence") are not well placed, or would not have much explanation (as well as the attitude of the characters in relation to them) if it all occurred into our "off-screen real world". The same can be said of Sally's attitudes about the creatures, which was initially of curiosity, then turns to fear and then, even fearful she takes some (dangerous) attitudes that a child would never take, for example.But overall this is a nice movie, with a general element more of suspense / mythological theme than anything else, having some segments with more intense scenes only at the beginning, a short part in the middle and in the end - which may not please everyone. My score: 6.2 / 10.0 .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...as to whether this is a "good" film or a "bad" one, so at this point I'm erring on the side of generosity and giving it a '6' instead of a below average grade; that may change should I ever watch it again. At any rate, "Don't Be Afraid...," remake though it is, has at least a few things going for it, including a very good child lead (Bailee "Bridge to Terabithia" Madison), decent support from the adults (Guy "Memento" Pearce and Katie "Dawson's Creek" Holmes as the girl's parents, plus a solid back-up cast), quality production/artistic design, assured camera-work from veteran DP, Oliver "The Cider House Rules" Stapleton, and perfectly fine tyro direction from Troy "I draw comics" Nixey. In fact, the only real weakness is the somewhat belabored screenplay by Guillermo "Pan's Labyrinth" del Toro and Matthew "The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings" Robbins, who once upon a time brought us a fine little B-movie called "Mimic;" let us not mention del Toro's many other notable projects.Adapted from a teleplay nearly four decades old, "Don't Be Afraid..." tells a rather simple "haunted house" story of a family (albeit somewhat fractured) discovering that their new home includes an unsuspected hidden basement, which is soon enough revealed to include a subterranean entranceway for "things that go bump in the night"--or worse. This time it's a child in peril rather than the wife, thus presumably escalating the tension (no one believes children's fantasies, of course), and the beasties' nastiness is a bit more visceral and they get a lot more screen time (and, no, the CGI really isn't all that bad); my (extremely) vague memories of the original--I was in college at the time--tell me that this revamp has plenty of nods to its predecessor. It's a shame, then, that the extra running time fails to add much of significance beyond amped-up atmosphere and explanations that were likely better left unspoken, and beasties in plain view that might well have stayed in the shadows to greater effect. Then again, modern spoon-fed audiences seem to prefer everything laid out nice and neat and tidy.Other IMDb scribes have noted various flaws in the script (like an architect buying a house without knowing it has a basement), but the one thing that struck me as most peculiar was the use of a Polaroid camera, which is now a niche market item at best, at least in the U.S. Perhaps this was an inadvertent result of "Don't Be Afraid..." being shot in Australia. No matter; "Don't Be Afraid..." sports loads of Gothic ambiance and general spookiness. It could have done without the bits of grue that gave it the "R" rating so apparently desired to draw the bloodthirsty American demographic; that stratagem failed anyway. It's far from a must-see horror film, but still has its charms. Recommended with reservations due to its essentially pedestrian nature.</fullReview>

I kept asking myself "why didn't they just do this?" and "why didn't they just do that?" I don't know why, but I felt like I was watching "The Spiderwick Chronicles" instead of a horror movie. The "scary" scenes just weren't scary. I wanted to see a ghost or some insidious spirit, not a pack of mutant zombie rodents that live in a fireplace!

What I can say, is that Guy Pearce seems to phone it in.Katie is as good as her role will allow her to be. Apart from that, people will either love the "bad" that is shown here or think that it isn't right for the movie. The expectations are high though and the movie is likely to disappoint.

I dare mention I'm starting to believe that there are PR firms that are paying people to negatively review movies, specifically with the intent to water down expectations for the movies that have even the slightest weight to them comparatively to the drivel that is the majority of big release films these days, so that the drivel still makes money and maybe even steals ticket sales from decent movies released at the same time.The main review on the front page for this movie compares it to Paranormal Activity 3... really!? is that the benchmark for horror or even thrillers these days?Don't be afraid of the dark; reminds me of older horror movies where the focus lies more on the story-telling than any big flashy effects. Don't get me wrong though, its got its use of effects too, they're just well used, and not over-used (most importantly). They gave us just enough of a look at the "monsters" but never for a long period of time. Enough to let our imaginations do some of the work for us as well. I'm not the biggest Katie Holmes fan, but she convinced me in her role. Guy Pearce is awesome as always. Bailee Madison looks amazingly like a young Katie Holmes despite the fact that there's no relation, and thats interesting at the least.I felt like this is what Pan's Labyrinth SHOULD have been.All in all I enjoyed this movie very much comparatively to the garbage thats currently being released as "horror" like the pg-13 "Shark Night" or the Paranormal Activity movies....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark ? 80/100</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro produced and had a hand in writing the screenplay. Now, you know at least something about a movie will be good if he's somehow involved in its production. And it's no less true in Don't Be Afraid of the Dark. This title starts out as most horror movies do, with an in-your-face prologue of sorts. Then, you get a break from the action to be introduced to our protagonists, to get comfortable with our environment, etc., as most horror movies do. Dark is, by all means, a conventional movie, but unlike most horror movies, and like most of del Toro's work, we get a little more than the standard twenty-first century horror movie fare of sub-par performances, excessive cheap-scares, etc., etc.The acting quality is typical, but our actors?especially the beautiful Katie Holmes and the young Bailee Madison?play their parts well enough to coax the audience into investing the least bit of emotional attachment. And that's very important in Dark's case. Very important, actually! Case in point: initially, when we're introduced to Sally (Madison), we meet a very, eh, bratty kid. But once proverbial sh?? starts to hit the proverbial fan, our bratty kid quickly changes her tune and, surprisingly, has our sympathy. A brief but integral clue coming in the form of a "Get Well" drawing to Mr. Harris removes any doubt in our heads as to Sally's genuine sympathy for others. This in turn lends a whole lot of needed credence to the whole "she's only being like that because of troubling family-matters" excuse as to why, initially, we have to put up with her crap. Most horror movies?and most sub-par productions, for that matter?that sling this excuse always forget that, while in reality it may very well be a valid reason to feel sympathy for somebody, in film it's the filmmakers' job to justify that reason. Our characters?or at least Sally?are written very well, and it's clever writing from whoever thought up that simple "Get Well" drawing as well.The characters Alex (Pearce) and Kim (Holmes), though virtual cardboard cut-outs from other films, get a good bit of meat too. Alex starts out as the caring father who's bravely "inherited" the task of looking after the well-being of his estranged daughter, Sally. Mid-way through Dark, Alex loses trust in her, his interaction with her becomes coarse as extra-familial stress mounts, and right before the finale reverts back to his initial humour, only this time with a tincture of perspective and a bit of much-needed skepticism. Kim, while in control of her professional life, is lost insofar as her expectations as a parental figure are concerned. Her insecurity gradually dissipates as she gleans the gravity of Sally's situation. When push comes to shove, Kim dashes any concern for her own safety and acts as any loving parent would toward the well-being of his/her child. So, when she pays the ultimate sacrifice, the impact of her lost hits us like a goddamn rock. (In all honesty, my heart was utterly rent the moment she's no longer with us.) Pearce does a good job of allowing us to vicariously feel the anguish into which Alex is so suddenly thrust. In short, we actually care about what happens to our characters, and this is what's missing from a lot of horror movies these days.Quickly, though: I must also add that there's a great sense of urgency once all the action is set into motion. Unlike most of my horror-movie- watching experiences, I paused the movie when I had to let the dogs out to do their business. I couldn't wait to get back into Dark, and that's almost always a testament to a movie's ability to engage us, something of which, again, is lacking in the horror movie "industry," if you will. All in all, given Dark's conventional approach, I was pleasantly surprised, and I hope del Toro and company have more quality like this to offer in the future.Zauber Zer?o, die zauberkatze</fullReview>

Scared the [ ]out of me that Guilermo, an absolute imbecile that could write such a steaming pile of garbage would a) be given the budget and talent to waste on producing his crud and worse... b) THIS bleep bleep bleep WROTE THE SCRIPT TO THE HOBBIT MOVIES...I give this movie a 5/10. 5 points for the special effects, art direction, camera work, acting. Well 5/5 points. The other 5 points the script gets a 0/5. Damn, I'd be poed to be working on this project and produce such good work, only to be destroyed by the ridiculous story.The story is a swish cheese slice of ridiculous plot holes and retarded character decisions. Check the other reviews for details, I'll spare you and just say, to make this work, and save it, would require minor edits to the script that somehow just didn't make it in. Like.. make an accident look like an accident and not a scene from Hostel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this "Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark" remake might be THE ABSOLUTE WORST thing that I've seen, and I once saw a girl with fake rainbow braids weaved into her head strutting around like a ghetto Rainbow Brite. I wish I had've spent the last hour and a half watching my cat lick his balls because that would've been more captivating. First of all, the little girl who you're supposed to worry about and feel for is stupid, snivelling, ANNOYING &amp; ugly in the face. Within 5 minutes of this movie I was praying for a meteor to strike her down. Stupid brat. Secondly, the suspense &amp; build-up of the original isn't here at all. You see the little creatures (who are made out of CGI and look like something from out of a Playstation 1 cut scene) within the first 15 minutes or so. BORING. Oh, and all of the other characters in this movie? They're all loathsome and forgettable, and the "story" that is supposed to be here is poorly put-together like a LEGO castle built by a severely mentally challenged child. Katie Holmes isn't ugly, but she has the sex appeal of a piece of wood. A pine tree is just as likely to give me a boner as she is. And isn't Guy Pearce supposed to be a respectable actor? What a piece of sh!t movie and an embarrassment to the original, which is one of my top 10 horror movies of all-time. Excuse me, I gotta go wash the tomatoes and spit from off of my TV now. This movie is like Tori Spelling - about a 3 out of 10...maybe even a 2. I would rather watch an armadillo f*ck it's own face for 3 hours straight than watch even half of this movie again. BOOOOOOOOOO! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is perhaps one of the best horror movies that I have seen in 2011, however I didn't know that the movie was from 2010, but hey a year late doesn't matter, eh? The story told in this movie is really great; it is a splendid return to the roots of horror movie. No more torture horror, no premarital sex, no pointless nudity, no! "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" takes you back to where horror belongs, in the dark. And there is every reason to fear the dark. Just watch this movie, and you will know why.I loved the story in "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", because it had a very King Diamond-like touch to it. Now for those familiar with his music and his stories, I am sure you will be nodding your heads here. For those of you not familiar with him, then you have missed out on a great horror story teller. The movie starts off pretty quiet and serene, though you know something is lurking just underneath the surface. And slow, you are introduced to more and more of the darkness underneath the surface (or in this case, down in the hidden basement). That approach is working so great, building up the suspense and thrills.The cast in "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" was quite good, especially Bailee Madison (playing Sally). She really carried the movie, and for some reason she was reminding me of Heather O'Rourke (the little girl from the "Poltergeist" movies) in a way. I am not a big fan of Katie Holmes (playing Kim), but she was alright in this movie though.Guillermo Del Toro knows how to put together a good horror movie, one that works around the suspense and thrills, a movie that sinks into the darkest corners of your psyche. And he have done a tremendous work with "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", because it was genuinely dark and spooky.One thing that really impressed me, was the creatures. The design of them was really good, they were miniature in size yes, but what they lacked in sheer size, they more than made up for in wickedness and cruelty. And the way they were preying on the child's naive beliefs was a really nice touch. And the CGI effects team had the creatures looking really awesome and life-like.And the house itself was so amazing. It really had that sinister feel to it brooding just underneath its stylish, old-fashioned design. And the attention to detail everywhere blew me away. I love it when there are so much work put into the small details of a movie. The way it was decorated and presented was really great, because it all worked out so well. And the details on the furniture, the walls, etc. was just amazing.If you like good old-fashioned horror movies that have the dark brooding horror in mind (and not all those slasher, torture and sex-crazed horror movies that are found everywhere), then you definitely should sit yourself down and watch "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", because it is a great horror movie in the way horror was meant to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tense but not scary movie that's more disturbing then anything. It's OK good ending. Worth watching. I say B</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This place isn't safe here, especially for kids." Sally is sent by her mother to live with her father (Pearce) and his girlfriend (Holmes) in an old house that they are trying to fix up. Sally is not happy there and while she is out running around she finds a hidden door. The older grounds keeper tries to warn to stay away. When Sally unknowingly unlocks a hidden evil the house and the family is in severe danger. This movie was much better then I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting much. This has a definite "Pan's Laberynth" feel to it, and that is enough to keep you watching. I wouldn't call this a scary movie as much as a disturbing movie. There are a few little stomach jumpers in this, but most of the time you are on the edge of your seat and waiting for what you know is coming to come. While the movie is tense and keeps you watching it's nothing really amazing. The ending of the movie really makes it better because the movie has the guts to end the way it does and that really changes the way you feel about it. Overall, a very OK movie that is made better because of the ending. Worth a watch though. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" suffers from an unfortunate affliction that effects many inferior horror films; something I'd like to call bad-decision syndrome. While showcasing an intriguing premise a promising start and some decent acting from child actor Bailee Madison the film constantly shoehorns "scary" and "atmospheric" situations despite the fact no sane person would put themselves in that position.Take for instance the scene where Sally (Bailee Madison) finds a human tooth on the grounds of the house her father (Guy Pearce) and girlfriend (Katie Holmes) are renovating. Instead of anyone going "Oh dear, a human tooth!" Sally is shuffled off and ignored as children often are in films.The bad decisions get more ludicrous as the film progresses. You'd think that an architect and interior designer who live where they work would be at home more often but alas they aren't and leave the babysitting duties to an elderly maid. When the groundskeeper is stabbed repeatedly they chalk it up to falling down the stairs and once the two principle adults finally realize something is amiss they leave Sally alone in her room passed out and medicated.The creatures themselves just aren't scary. Like a cross between Quasimodo, Gollum and the Gremlins, they might have been more effective if the film didn't take itself so seriously. But since it does the little critters who are revealed one too many times are just plain goofy looking.Luckily you can do something about bad-decision syndrome. When you and your friends are lost in the woods don't split up, when you're in a haunted mansion, you should probably leave at the first sign of trouble and, more realistically, when you're watching a bad film walk out and ask for your money back.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad movie. I love the set with an old house and the property chosen as well as the shots in and out of the house. Very good camera work, professional casting and pretty good acting. That could bring this movie pretty close to a good work. However, the movie pretty much search for its genre. From time to time it has a horror movie pace. Then it turns to action, drama or even comedy, at least to me. Everything would be just fine even with that giving the movie a special flavor if director didn't try to scare us with his little creatures. I must admit these 'evil gremlins' made me laugh and were even cute at the moment becoming angry when the things were not the way they want. I must say that movie has a pretty good plot and that is 'nobody believes the kid', the one that always make a movie dynamic and is pretty well executed above all. I also think that the end of the movie could be better done with less plot holes. All in all, we might say that the movie is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As what I had expected before the movie starts. It is not too bad. But the movie seems to be so cliché. Some parts of the movie did make me jump off my seat. If you don't have any idea what to watch, and there are no blockbuster movies ahead, you can try watching this alone. I repeat, ALONE! Katie Holmes does look older than she was before. And I'm wondering, is that her real child? Looks like Tom Cruise's daughter. Sorry, I'm not into their relationship much. They should end this movie well. The ending part is far beyond par from what you are hoping it to be. It is a good movie with good story lines. But personally I think, the director can do much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and bad in balance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 19th century, in an imposing mansion, an old man does desperate and bloody things to try to free his child from the grip of some unseen malevolence which lives behind the opening of an ashpit in the cellar, and which craves the teeth of children. In present day, Sally (Bailee Madison) is sent to live with her father (Guy Pearce) and his new domestic and business partner Kim (Katie Holmes) in that same forbidding mansion: the two of them are doing it up as a business venture. Sally does not want to be there and, at first, welcomes the friendship promised by the mysterious voices which whisper up through the heating vents. But then bad things start to happen...The good things about this film are very good indeed, and the bad things about it are very bed indeed. Let's start with the good.Bailee Madison, as she showed in Bridge To Terabithia and Just Go With It is a child actress of range and talent. In this film she is credible as the child filled with hurt and resentment at being uprooted from the mother she loves (and who, we realise, has greater priorities than her daughter) and dumped with the father she doesn't care much about and his new girlfriend who she cares even less about. And she is equally credible as the terrified victim of the unnamed creatures who are after her. The nature of the monsters is good and a little different to the routine nasties, and they are well realised. The production design is nicely creepy, and there is an eerie build-up to the "showdown." Now, on to the bad. Firstly, there are elements to which your attention is drawn but which are never followed up. The two which stayed with me afterwards were the spirals which Sally draws towards the start of the movie (they could have turned out to be something mystic in her makeup to be used against the foe), and the arm of the squashed thingie in the library - clearly displayed, so were were meant to notice it, but none of the many assembled people remarked on it at all. Oh, how different things might have been....Because the second worst element of this film is a hoary old chestnut: the mind-numbing stupidity of the father. Even at the end, when they finally have some idea of what they are up against, there is no sense of urgency, and they put the child to bed - sedated! - without anyone staying with her. Oh how I long for a film of this type where a script manages to blend a fight against malevolent forces with credible behaviour.And the worst element? I'm not against a downbeat ending, but it makes me angry when that is achieved at the expense of the one character who didn't deserve it, and that's what happened here.So I enjoyed this film, but it annoyed me to a broadly equivalent extent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable Remake of a TV Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" was based on a 1973 TV movie of the same title and basically the same plot. I took time to watch a copy of the original film before I watched this remake. I am not really sure that was a good idea, but I thought it was when I did it. The structure of the story is the same. An self- and career-absorbed architect named Alex gets a very old house and tries to renovate it. A blocked-up furnace and vent in the basement is disturbed which causes mysterious creatures to torment the household. From hence, arises the horror that the title speaks of.The major difference is that in the original movie and its remake is the central tormented character named Sally. In the original, Sally was the architect's stay-at-home wife (played by Kim Darby). In the remake, Sally is the architect's young rebellious daughter (Bailee Madison) from a broken marriage. She makes life difficult for the architect (Guy Pierce) and his new interior-designer girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes).Of course, having a child as the central character being terrorized by the furnace creatures adds another story dynamic and increases the tension and horror of the film.Also added was the back story of what those furnace creatures really were. A prologue having a grisly scene about teeth sets the tone for the film. But I must say that that scene involving teeth and hammer IS already the scariest part of the film for me! I hate scenes with teeth! I think being tormented by an unknown entity makes the events scarier, don't you think? Having the creepy crawly little CG creatures fully exposed out in the light too much (when they say light hurts them) also takes away a lot of the suspense.You really have to suspend your disbelief as several illogical scenes can be seen, especially regarding why some characters did or did not do certain things which we would ordinarily think of doing when faced with such situation. The ending sequence of mayhem was I think overdone in this remake to the point of making it annoying why certain things did not happen. Why didn't they investigate the severe injuries of the handyman? Why didn't they look at the photos the child was taking? Why didn't they see the creature caught by the kid in the bookcase? The additional character of the dad's girlfriend just added some storyline complications, but was not exactly necessary to the story. Overall, it is just alright. I did not think it was that particularly spectacular as reviews would make you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There Are Worse Things to be Scared Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say everyone is a critic and after everyone takes a trip to the local multiplex, if the experience was not to their liking, the favorite phrase of the inarticulate remains to be, "That was dumb," and little more. Unfortunately despite a year of build-up, which began a little over one year ago at last year's Comic-Con, ample talent behind and in front of the camera and a solid premise, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is just that ? dumb, silly, nonsensical (but don't worry, I have much more to say).Pursuing some gorgeous opening credits, the inaugural flashback scene is abundantly sinister and at times outright disturbing. Propelled then to present day, we meet our three main protagonists: Alex (Guy Pearce), a greatly ambitious architect obsessed with restoring a grand manor, Kim (Katie Holmes), Alex's interior designer and now serious girlfriend, and little Sally (Bailee Madison), Alex's daughter from a previous marriage who is unwillingly transplanted into her father's life and his all- encompassing labor of love. Soon after discovering a cavernous workshop beneath the mansion which once belonged to the famed former owner Emerson Blackwood, a force from beyond is released into the home taking an insidious interest in young Sally.Ever the optimist let me begin with what "Dark" does well. Much of the film's strengths lie within the production values, atmosphere and set design (would we expect anything less from a film godfathered by Guillermo Del Toro?) which create an extensively detailed and otherworldly stage for the tale to unfold. Specific camera shots are nothing short of stunning and the score is truly perfect for the style of the movie. Surprisingly, the strongest of the bare-bones cast is Katie Holmes who has both the best written character and also executes her character's arc very nicely. Pearce is fine but is given little to do except ignore his daughter's pleas for help, which brings us to newcomer Madison ? a fine young actress who has a ways to go but has the makings of a solid thesp.This brings us down to the nitty gritty of why Don't Be Afraid of the Dark failed to live up to my generally lofty expectations and why it is simply a mediocre horror offering all round. Notwithstanding the Friday the 13th Crazy Ralph character, Jacoby who points his trembling finger and utters cryptic warnings in the movie is simply not scary. The ominous atmosphere was palatable, but the shocks never came. I jumped exactly once, ironically at a scare I knew was coming thanks to an earlier trailer, and beyond that moment I sat tensely and eagerly, but never to have my palate whetted. Additionally, the creatures from the netherworld are revealed far too early on in the proceedings. That is not to say they are showed in full light right off the get go (coincidently they don't like light), but what they are in general is far too silly to be taken seriously as an unstoppable force of evil.A number of scenes are laughable as the pint-sized beings arm themselves with tools and small knives to ward off an unlucky member of our heroes who snoops a little too close for his own good; combined with the usual Del Toro mythology, we get Gremlins meets Hellboy II. The explanation behind the motivation of the creatures is shaky at best (provided by a suspiciously knowledgeable librarian), who seemingly need the bones and teeth of children to satisfy an ancient truce made with mankind, yet frequently seem perfectly happy with taking grownups. The fate of a "leader demon" also seems initially to be of some importance but is tossed away along with the dishwater and the common sense of a number of characters.What we are left with when the credits roll is a great looking haunted house flick with a talented cast, no scares and a few too many dopey sequences and plot revelations; it's decidedly divided and fully disillusioned. Having written the screenplay for capable first time director Troy Nixy, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a rare chink in Del Toro's armor which is composed of stellar works of fantasy and horror. There are minor miracles to be found absolutely, as the movie is graciously devoid of 3-D and relies on mood over gore. These attributes may not be enough to smooth over the greater structural issues in the storytelling, but it shows that there are much greater things to be scared of than the dark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a marvelous movie. This movie is not so much scary as it is engaging. The movie opens with a scene that is unnecessarily gruesome but then quickly settles down and tells a story that is greatly suspenseful and completely engaging. The story centers around a contest between a young girl and a group of small, furtive humanoid creatures who are both malevolent and fascinating. Unlike most scare movies, this movie does not overwhelm the audience with special effects. In this movie, it is whispering that sets the mood. The creatures are cunning for they must rely on stealth to conceal their purpose, and for a child, that can be most fascinating. Baillie Madison is magnificent as the young girl. She is the star of the movie. Her performance is outstanding. As for the creatures, they are dangerous and up to no good, but they have their story too and maybe that could be the basis for a sequel. In any event, after watching this movie, you may think twice before turning out the lights to go to sleep because you can never tell what may be lurking right underneath your bed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it For Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're interested in, or planning to go see this movie...then what you need to do is accept this notion that this is a suspense flick and the suspense will outweigh the horror. This however, is not necessarily a bad thing...unless you crave loud and gory and the top-frightening movies--which is where I believe the IMDb hate is coming from.While the horror is mild to moderate--more like PG-13, the premise and the suspense is strong. One thing the director does very well is building up the tension, step by step, letting you watch as dreadful events and chilling ambushes unravel. The atmosphere, of course, is very effective...from the topiary with the mushroom circle in the garden, to the wood-paneled walls and swirling staircases in the foyer...It adds to establish a creepy/on-edge feel (rather than blatant terror).Also, its nice how the movie reserves space for character development and change...I almost didn't care about any of the main characters in the beginning, (plus their character's actions really could've used some improvement) but by the end they had earned some sympathy from me.The scares consisted of some effective "jump scenes" and decent "trap" techniques, but if you go in expecting a suspense flick...you might enjoy yourself.Overall, decent moderate entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark was originally a 1973 ABC Movie of the Week starring Kim Darby that really connected with audiences like other hits including The Night Stalker and Trilogy of Terror. Guillermo (Pan's Labyrinth)del Toro produced this beautiful, chilling remake as a labour of love. A family moves into a secluded estate which is infested with demonic, murderous vermin. They live in the darkness, bolted behind a sealed fireplace. The creatures are determined to snare the little girl who now lives in the house before she can convince her father and his new girlfriend of their existence. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark wasn't a huge success but it's easily one of the finest, most suspenseful horror films in recent years. It will get under your skin and keep you on the edge of your seat.

		<fullReview>I'm a massive fan of Guillermo Del Toro and knowing how long this film took to come out I was excited to see it but I must say I was a little disappointed with this film. The film sets up quite nicely with an scene of the house some years before it wasn't a jolting start to the film but more intriguing. As the film develops it does convey a nice sense of eeriness for the opening twenty minutes or so but once these creatures are seen for the first time I felt the film lost it's impact. I'm in the school of thought that says less is more in these haunted house type horror stories but felt they used too much CGI and showed the ''monster'' too often. I thought the acting was fair and young Bailee Madisson did a good job, but there were a few holes in the plot though and a few things didn't seem to make complete sense. Overall it wasn't a bad film I was just expecting a bit more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is directed by Troy Nixey and written by Guillermo del Toro and Matthew Robbins. It stars Guy Pearce, Katie Holmes, Bailee Madison and Jack Thompson. Music is by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders, and cinematography by Oliver Stapleton.A remake of a 1973 TV movie, plot finds Madison as a young girl sent to live with her father and his new girlfriend at Blackwood Manor in Rhode Island. Upon finding a basement hidden by foliage, she discovers there are tiny creatures in her new home who want considerably more than to be just friends... One of the most pleasing aspects for me personally over the last few cinematic years has been the rise in stock of John Newland's TV horror movie Don't Be Afraid of the Dark. Since I manged to track down a copy in 2009 and review it with honesty, I have since found a fan-base for it that is quite something, people who like myself remember just how much that film chilled us to the marrow back in our younger days. Now we acknowledge its cheapness, even some of the cheese slices inserted into the production sandwich, but it has become a love that lasts for ever. Evidently one of our number is Guillermo del Toro, who makes no bones about how Newland's film affected him and thus we have the reason for this remake.So the remake, then! Off the bat you have to say that del Toro cheated us loyal fans by not directing himself, if you loved it so much then why resort to an act of friendism and give it to an unknown to direct? Oh it's true to say that del Toro's mark is all over the film, where as a producer and co-writer his fairytale as nightmare visions come to the fore, but really in his own directing hands you have to believe it would have been so much better.The new version has proved more than divisive, it kind of sits somewhere in between being a new age crowd pleasing piece of fluff or a nightmarish shocker. The CGI advancements for the creatures are hardly terrifying, but a requisite chill factor is still garnered by the general fear of those little critters who live behind our walls and fire places. Those impish demons who come at night in search of teeth, souls, breath and god knows what else. The story has been re-jigged here, bringing in a child as the central focus of the "haunting", whilst a back story for the critters is given via a fairytale narrative resplendent with scary painting.Unfortunately there are logic and plot holes bigger than the wonderfully designed house that hosts this series of goings on. So from my perspective I would find it hard to argue with anyone who is irked by the faults here (for instance the thread of the critters being afraid of light needs to be forgotten at the half way point), but low expectation levels from both fans of the original and from those seeking out ultimate bloody terror, will at least offer some forgiveness for the film's obvious failings.Cast are fine, making light work of an unadventurous screenplay that dallies in a fractured family dynamic and bad seventies hair styles, and the cinematography and musical cues are high grade in quality. I had fun with this one, even if it falls way short of what made the original stay with many of us for all this time. It's not a comfortable recommendation at all, especially to horror fans constantly searching for that something to get under the skin and stay there, but it doesn't lack for love of the source or in fact willingness to add meat into the original stew. A rickety 7/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young girl sent to live with her father (Guy Pearce) and his new girlfriend (Katie Holmes) discovers creatures in her new home who want to claim her as one of their own.This is Guillermo del Toro's re-write of a 1973 screenplay, based in part on H. P. Lovecraft's "Rats in the Walls". Sadly, I have not seen the original (starring Kim Darby), so I cannot compare them.This film is beautifully shot, with a bold style and even a visually striking opening credits sequence. This is probably not surprising, given that it was directed by comic book artist Troy Nixey (who most notably did "Neil Gaiman's Only the End of the World Again").IMDb gives the film a pathetic 5.6 out of 10, whereas Roger Ebert gives it a solid 3? stars out of 4. I would suggest more of a line between these two, with the weak part of this movie being Katie Holmes, who never seems to bring her acting to the next level.</fullReview>

However, there were some parts that reminded me of The Sixth Sense or Psycho and the little monsters were not that horrible from a closer look, they were much like tiny apes, but otherwise it was really worth watching. There was suspense from the very beginning and the story really looked like a whole to me. Little Bailee Madison is doing a great job! And, for the first time for me, Katie Holmes stopped being sweet and innocent Joey Potter (for avoiding any misunderstanding, I loved Dawson's Creek, it's perfect when you are 15, but Katie Holmes was quite the same since then, no matter what kind of role she had). So,making a long story short, creepy tale from a creepy house, perfect for getting rid of the stress of the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just found out that this was a remake of an older movie. Now i will have to find the first one and watch it. its not the first time this has happened.The story is great, the acting was really good from katie homes and the little girl. I did not think much of the guy that played her dad. The movie movie moved at a good pace. The only thing about the plot missing was the "creepyness" of the house. They did not set the mood right. But all around i liked this movie. IT was really good. I wish i could live in a house like in this movie, it looked really cool. You should watch it for sure</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made and entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good thriller set in a fairly spooky house with creatures lurking beneath. Bailee Madison as the central character the young girl, is very cute and acts very well. Guy Pearce as the clueless father looks younger than of late. Katie Holmes as the stepmother is quite likable but a bit tired looking. You know roughly what will happen but it's still effective. The pacing and directing were good. The story is alright no red herrings and the background is well explained. The creatures were a bit gremlin like. Although it's no slasher film it's not really suitable for young kids as there are some pretty intense moments and shock tactics. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never buy a mansion named Blackwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. While I really enjoy a good horror movie, I have never been too fond of those that featured unexplained or other-worldly creatures. However, with "Pan's Labyrinth" to his credit, Guillermo del Toro has earned my trust. Supposedly the 1973 British version of this film (Nigel McKeand teleplay) so frightened a young del Toro that it inspired him to become a filmmaker. Here he acts as producer and co-writer, while first timer Troy Nixey directs.What makes this one work is that it takes full advantage of setting and dark tones, rather than over-exposure of the freakish fairies that live in the ash pit. Blackwood Manor is one creepy, yet fantastic mansion that belonged to a famous artist who was killed in the basement. Also, the three leads are very good in their roles. Guy Pearce plays the struggling businessman who gets his 10 year old daughter forced upon him by his ex-wife. Katie Holmes plays Pearce's girlfriend and the interior designer in charge of the mansion re-do. The real gem of the film is Bailee Madison, whom you will remember from Bridge to Teribithia.Putting a cute kid in peril is one of the most over-used tricks in horror films, but here young Sally (Madison) is actually quite brave and rational ... she is trying to solve this mystery without bothering the oh-so-busy adults. As is customary, the dad (Pearce) is clueless and the last to catch on, but there is a very interesting dynamic between Holmes and Madison. Those are the kind of details that make this one worth seeing for all you lovers of horror films. Just remember the second rule of real estate: never buy a mansion named Blackwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be called Do Indeed Be Afraid of the Dark! Del Toro delivers in his valentine to a truly spooky TV horror flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK (2011) *** Katie Holmes, Guy Pearce, Bailee Madison, Jack Thompson. Executive producer and co-writer Guillermo del Toro's pet project big-screen remake of the cult 1973 ABC-TV horror flick about a de facto family's sojourn into refurbishing a cursed haunted mansion that houses a horde of nefarious beasties hell bent on being unleashed to claim a life for their own mission of evil manages to deliver some creepy crawlie oogieness with touchstones of its original and truly disturbing source. Kudos to the fantastic production design by Roger Ford, the opulent cinematography by Oliver Stapleton, and for the grave-faced Madison (oddly enough an uncanny twin for Holmes who plays her stepmother!) adding some solemn weight to the unsettlings unearthed. Director Troy Nixey makes an impressive directorial debut even though it appears his boss (and co-writer Matthew Robbins) has done all the heavy lifting (overshadowing if you will).</fullReview>

Remember the original with those creepy pixies in the basement making Kim Darbys life a living hell??? Yah, its more or less THAT MOVIE with cooler creepies. The basement things reminded me of some of those old school Ray Harryhausen movie creatures. Always a plus! And when these things are menacing a child, EVEN BETTER! If you watch this in your living room it will only be you shouting at the screen " WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT???" instead of those noisy guys sitting behind you. But heck, its nice to hearing screamy women in the crowd once in awhile, so go ahead and big screen this one. Its creature feature entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a good horror remake. Horror remakes are usually done with the same plot twists we have seen before. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is no exception to the rule, but the story is a classic which makes this movie exciting. Most horror movies follow a cause and effect story were the protagonist, plays a prank, opens a door, avoids a warning etc and creates a bad cause and effect scenario. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark has the protagonist opening a vent which causes great havoc. These cause and effect horror movies always have the character first try and ignore the problem, then try and correct it. Regrettably, this film genre must have a few people pay the price for the mistake made earlier on in the film. I found Don't Be Afraid of the Dark follows this storyline well. I will not ruin the movie by revealing anymore of the plot. I will give this summer film an eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not overly familiar with Guillermo Del Toro but from what i hear his work is usually extremely dark and atmospheric, and after watching this movie i see how this fits that description perfectly. The story is a remake of an old British TV movie which i haven't seen but would love too, I'm sure it is excellent, much like this remake.The horror elements are quite a bit different, instead of just being ghosts in the eerily dark and foreboding house its something else, which i wont say because if you're reading this review you are probably going to watch the movie and i will let you find out for yourself, i will say that they are genuinely creepy little horrors.The acting in very good in this film, Bailee Madison is easily this generations Dakota Fanning, each movie i see this little dynamite actress in she is better and better, and Katie Holmes is also quite impressive as the woman who is desperately trying to help this poor disturbed child.One thing that is great about the film is it's extremely dark ending, it could have gone for something cliché and cheesy but instead goes for something very intriguing and different.So if you enjoy dark, dreary and cold films which are out of the norm for the horror genre, this one is for you... Exceptional. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Some of the Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a number of reviews stating that this movie just isn't "scary" and some have recommended other films (such as Insidious) for a good jump, instead. Perhaps, these reviews are right. Then again, del Toro isn't one for making overly-horrific movies, so comparing his films with other slasher movies is like comparing apples and oranges.While del Toro turned the directing over to a newcomer, his writing and producing still lend to his style and fans of Pan's Labyrinth shouldn't be disappointed as this isn't a ghost story, but rather one of del Toro's messed up fairy tales.Overall, the story was solid, in my opinion, but the editing was sloppy at times, which did detract from the overall flow of it. The ending was disappointing and did leave one wondering about the relationship of Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes characters. I will disagree with other reviews that liked Guy Pearce's performance, as I thought this was his worst since The Time Machine. The young girl, however, was very convincing and stood out amongst the average acting of the rest of the cast.All in all, this film was very much a "del Toro film" and while it had some errors, I found it to be entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most boring horror flick i have seen in the past 20 years !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought i have seen everything but no... this movie is the proof that a theatrical release means abolutely nothing theses days. Plus, you have a not so bad casting but the actors put on a poor performance so it's horrible... i read about the little girl, Bailee Madison that she's good and everything, but i don't believe her for one second. Sure, for a newcomer, she's doing a good job but she dosen't put on a strong performance to make this film more believeble. It's more of a fantastic movie than a horror one, because there's barely blood, if there's one murder, i have blink my eyes for half a second because it could be a Rated PG movie. Little to almost no scares at all in this movie. Plus, Guillermo Del Toro put his name to this movie, it's a true shame. I can't believe he have seen this movie before relating his name to it! It's like Steven Spielberg putting his name next to a movie like the memorable Battlefield Earth (2000) staring John Travolta. Truly, one of the biggest turkeys i have seen in my whole life. And i watch at least 10 movies a week ! 0 out of 5 cinema stars for me, really disappointing ! I understand why it only makes 8 millions and rank as the 4th place in his 1st week ! It will be one of the biggest bomb of the summer !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I begin my review I must say, I am a big Del Toro fan! I love his work, although this did not seem like his best. I went into the theater with a great positive attitude towards the film, that positive attitude did not last very long. I found some major flaws in the script, a few scenes were dragged on too long for pointless reasons. I did have "fun" watching this film but that is not a word that should be used in a horror film review. So they did not succeed with this "scary movie" in my opinion. The acting was great and I loved the whole idea of the story, just was not executed good. I am somewhat disappointed in this film and do not recommend it. There are dozens of other films that are much more "scary" and just as "fun". Keep that in mind and skip this film. I give Don't Be Afraid of the Dark a 6 out of 10 for some good acting and a few nice set of screams! Skip this one or wait to rent it.</fullReview>

I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. It was very well done, the actors were awesome was well. Some of it was a little slow and boring, but it really made up for it at times!

		<shortDescription>Had enough of torture porn and unnecessary sequels? This is for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, it's become really difficult for Horror to shock anymore. This is so for many reasons, one of the biggies being a lack of subtlety. Don't get me wrong, I love gore as much as the next guy, but there are plenty of great genre films without it. This may be the 21st Century, but a Horror films that emphasizes mood, suspense, and genuine thrills never go out of style. In a time of multiple sequels to 'Final Destination' and 'Saw,' and remakes of the finest of the genre it's nice to see something that both hearkens back to another era of Horror and brings it up to date.Pros: Solid performances by all. Beautiful, haunting score. Strong directorial debut by Troy Nixey. Rich, unique production design. Well paced. Brooding atmosphere. A few memorable and scary sequences. Good job on the design of the creatures. Nice little homages to the original.Cons: Lacking suspense. Some writing issues, including some dialogue that could have used a rewrite. Not much we haven't seen before.Final thoughts: So often big budget Horror films lack what make them so memorable. This is an example of one that is miles ahead of most. It's also an example of a remake that does pay tribute to the original, but is different enough to be it's own entity. A real breath of fresh air after getting so much of the same old crap.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam, Tyler &amp; I just finished watching "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark."It is the 2010 version of this movie with Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce.To be perfectly honest, I was not expecting much from this film....especially ( especially!) after watching the opening sequence, which was far too violent, by my estimation.That is to say, I do not have a problem with movies that are extremely violent in nature; when priorly, I've foreknowledge this is the type of film genre I am attending...After viewing the opening and closing sequences, I stand by this opinion. To me, the movie's story is rich enough on its own without having to attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator of genre-hopping-ticket-sales.Oddly enough, I was extremely surprised to log onto the IMDb (http://www.imdb.com/) And learn that my estimation of this film was so far off the general public's opinion.Usually, I am able to guess-timate mass ticket appeal of a given film; however, having genuinely enjoyed the movie, I was way off-base. According to the public ranking on IMDb.com, the movie was only awarded 5 stars, out of 10 when I, myself, would have approximates a mass public opinion in the proximity of 6.5 to seven.Anyway, if you enjoy suspense and are able to avert your eyes during two especially gory scenes, you will find this movie very appealing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tooth faeries? Oh common... Even at that, if the movie actually contained one scary scene apart from the one already present in the trailer, I would be considering a better vote. Little ugly things living in a hole in the basement down which you could probably toss a dozen grenades and kill them all, and afraid of bright lights? Hmmm, shine a big freaking spotlight down the hole, then toss some grenades down...Do Hollywood producers and directors really think people are so stupid not to realize the otherwise simple solutions to problems presented in most movies, and not just this one? Not to mention that the storyline in this movie is awfully hollow! I know that I'm not the only person with this opinion, for if no one else, the entire cinema was laughing through most of the movie. So... how exactly do you classify a movie as a HORROR, if people are laughing instead of screaming on their way out??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is a Moody, Gothic Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I start my review for "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" I must confess one thing: I'm not a fan of supernatural horror movies. While I admire haunted house films like "Poltergeist", I've always found this sub-genre of horror to be painfully dull and its characters to be agonizingly stupid ("The Amityville Horror", I'm looking at you). They usually have the same formula: a stupid, yuppie couple (occasionally with children) buy a house, move in, hear strange noises, and bad things happen. Rinse and repeat. So, going into "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", my expectations were pretty low. After reading some not so positive reviews online, they sank even further. So is "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" worth screaming for? Well..more on that in a bit.The film begins with a gruesome prologue shows the home's deranged first owner, Emerson Blackwood, luring his maid into the dungeon-like basement and performing medieval dentistry on the terrified young woman. As he carries out the atrocity, he explains to the young maid that they, the goblin-like creatures known as Homunculi, have taken his son and will only give him back with teeth. As the young woman screams, whispering can be heard all around the room from the sealed up fireplace. Blackwood makes his way over to the fireplace and offers the teeth in exchange for the return of his son, only to be told his offering wasn't acceptable and he is pulled into the fireplace. The basement is sealed and forgotten over the generations.The movie then opens with a young girl, Sally Hirst (Bailee Madison), moving into Blackwood Manor, the Gothic mansion being restored by her architect father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes), an interior decorator. Her father is renovating the house they live in, in hopes of having it on the front page of a known magazine. Due to the fact that her mother recently abandoned her, Sally has become a distant child with emotional vulnerability. Although Kim tries to befriend her, Sally alienates herself from her.One day, Sally hears voices calling her name and follows them ? finding a hidden basement with a fireplace that has been bolted shut. She is drawn toward the fireplace, as she can hear voices that beg her to open it, promising friendship. One day she sneaks into the basement to open the fireplace, but her father stops her before she can get the door completely open. The Homunculi escape, however, and begin to torment Sally at night telling her to turn the lights out.As the days progress, Kim finds one of her dresses shredded. Shortly afterward, a teddy bear that Kim gave to Sally is found destroyed underneath her bed after she yelled for her Dad having been scared by the creatures. Sally claims that someone (or something) else is to blame for these things, but her father does not believe her and is preoccupied with renovating the house. Kim, however, begins to believe her claims, as strange incidents occur more frequently. But is it too late?"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is over-the-top, melodramatic, and full of plot holes. But, you know what dear reader, I loved every minute of it. This is the kind of movie in which logic is thrown out the door before the opening credits even begin. It is atmospheric in a way that has been missing from most horror movies today. Those that were disappointed by the lack of Gothic overtones in "Fright Night" will be in Heaven here. The sets are gorgeous and the fluid use of cinematography is inviting in a way that makes you feel at home with these gawkily little creatures. The acting here is a bit hit or miss. Guy Pearce is terrible as the father who doesn't seem to care whether his girlfriend or his daughter lives or dies. His performance is bland to the point of sleepwalking through his role. Katie Holmes, on the other hand, is a revelation. It's nice to see a strong, female role in which she is neither helpless nor a shrewd bitch. She thoroughly blew me away and has a few very touching scenes with Madison. Madison makes for a convincingly scared child but her performance is a bit hit or miss. Overall, if you are in the mood for a moody, Gothic treat, you could do far, far worse than "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid of Negative Reviews! See the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Guillermo del Toro and countless other kids, I saw the original Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973) on TV and lost some sleep to visions of goblins in the midnight shadows. This remake pays perfect tribute to its anscestor film, while reinventing the story with the dark fairy tale depth which del Toro is known for. The director, Troy Nixey, avoids pointless gore or boo scenes, using his cinematic tools wisely to build toward the inevitable critical mass. The creators of the film realize it is not the shock of things we see, but rather what is implied and left to imagination. Like the best horror films, simple elements blend to evoke emotions. Shadows swirl against a mansion as eerie as the Overlook Hotel, and the perfectly cast trio of Sally (Bailee Madison), Kim (Katie Holmes), and Alex (Guy Pearce) endure torments therein. Much has already been made of amazing young Bailee Madison and Pearce is solid as a man driven by career pressure, but Holmes--not a favorite of mine--is surprisingly agile in the role of the awkward girlfriend. Much like Naomi Watts in The Ring (2002), she plays a believable protector. Marco Beltrami's music sounds old school and builds up the Gothic art and sets well. The cinematography by Oliver Stapleton is dark and at times borders on dank and drab, but serves the story well. I would not ruin the succulent scares with spoilers, but suffice to say that the creators manage to expand the tale by linking the wicked imps of the movie to folklore and traditions (tooth fairies). Key scenes, such as a dinner, are clear homages to the original, and the finale pays the piper with Grimm satisfaction. Despite sometimes weak CGI, this movie honors its creepy roots with style. Other reviews have been moderate to harsh, and I suspect the reviewers expected something more akin to Pan's Labyrinth. Nevertheless, if you like crafty and creepy horror films, see Don't Be Afraid of the Dark in a dark theater!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror is kind of like porn. Either it's convincing and effective or it's embarrassing and laughable. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is the latter, and there isn't even any nudity. This haunted house of clichés shepherded by Guillermo del Toro brings nary a new idea to the table, and doesn't even execute on old ones effectively. Chalk that up to first time feature director Troy Nixey, who does suspense about as well as Jenna Jameson does acting. And in the end, it's the audience that gets screwed.Stop me if you've heard this one. A family at odds moves into a charming old mansion with a (gasp!) terrifying secret. If, during Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, you find your mouth agape, it's more likely your letting loose a yawn than a scream. Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes play parent and guardian respectively to Sally (Bailee Madison), a sulky Los Angeleno forcibly relocated to Rhode Island and relinquished into her father's care. While exploring the nooks and crannies of her lonely new home, Sally awakens a long-dormant evil, and yada yada yada.Where it isn't derivative, Nixey's film is asinine. Even the title makes no sense. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a movie that validates fear of the dark. The characters don't surmount their supernatural oppressors with courage; they fight them with light. That is, when they think to. Somebody ought to propose an "all lights all the time" policy in this house, because the amount of time spent fumbling for flashlights is entirely unnecessary.Del Toro co-wrote the screenplay with Matthew Robbins, and there isn't a fresh idea between them. A thematically faithful remake of the 1973 TV movie of the same name, 2011's Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is haunted by logical fallacies, dull stereotypes, and uninspired scare tactics. Has del Toro become so ensconced in his producorial duties that his writing has irrevocably lost its creative spark? I hope for The Hobbit's sake it hasn't.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is so uniformly sloppy, however, that no one person can shoulder the blame. The acting is subpar; I can't remember the last time I saw an entire cast deliver such a collectively mediocre performance. Whether fault lies with the actors themselves or the inexperienced director is debatable, but that the film suffers is undeniable.If a paltry few circumstantially effective jump scares are your measure of success, than by all means plunk down your 11 bucks for Don't Be Afraid of the Dark. Just don't expect to be afraid. Every year we get a few great dramas, and one or two good comedy and action flicks. What gives? Why should horror have the lowest success ratio, and its fans the lowest standards? When was the last time a film genuinely scared you?Audiences shouldn't settle for Don't Be Afraid of the Dark. Like a bad porno, we're left bored by its expository sequences in anticipation of the action. And then the action arrives and underwhelms. We can't even fast-forward. The whole dim, dumb movie is an exercise in textbook tedium, created as though by combining at random items from the approved horror glossary, 666th edition. Horror, like porn, leans on the believability of its flimsily constructed reality. When that spell is broken, it's only too apparent that you're staring at some guy's bare ass. In this case, del Toro's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie a lot. But not as much as the original. Having seen the original a couple of times on some cable network growing up, I was terrified of that foray into darkness so much that I had to see this attempt at a remake, with an open mind of course. As a matter of fact I would go so far as to say the original is one of the scariest films ever made. So how does the remake hold up?Well, it is a different entity being released in a different era. The creatures are inherently more exposed, but as such they still have a creepy factor because of their intentional similarity to rodents. They do maintain some similarities with the original creatures. For example their voices are filled with the creepy factor. Especially when they call out to Sally. It sounds eerily similar to the original creatures as they called out the same name. I agree with other reviewers who say that perhaps the movement of the film could have been aided by concealing the creatures a bit longer. But this lack of concealment is compensated for by making the creatures move like rodent packs, which can be seen as almost as creepy as them being hidden from view. What I especially like about this take on the story is the modern mythical "evil fairy" myth that pervades it. It certainly lends itself to the setting, an old, abandoned victorian house, not lived in for almost a century because of the events that took place there before. I especially like how we are tricked at the end, and the intended victim is not who we think it is going to be. Watch this film with an open mind and you will not be too disappointed because you will see it for exactly what it is. A slightly above average horror fantasy film that will be fun to return to for family viewings late at night over a glass or two of wine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts some time in the past at Blackwood Manor. The maid goes into the basement to be jumped by Lord Blackwood. He chisels out her teeth. He put the plate of teeth inside the furnace as an offering as he pleads for his son back. There is a deep hole which emerges a swamp of creatures that takes Lord Blackwood down into the depths.Now in modern day, Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) take in his daughter Sally (Bailee Madison). She was taking pills for depression living with her mother. He's restoring the old manor to be resold but the kid discovers the basement where the old furnace is. Kim isn't ready for a kid.The movie shows its hand right off the bat. I'm not sure that's a smart move. It robbed the movie much of the horror element. This is more of a thriller. It has the feel of a Guillermo del Toro movie but it isn't quite as fanciful. It has the look at times but the feel of amazement is missing. As always, there is the question of why stay. This is usually where most horrors fail, and this one is no exception. It just doesn't make sense that they don't take off right away after the failed dinner. Instead they drug the girl. Bailee makes a good scream princess. Pearce and Holmes are frustrating parental figures. It always seems to be struggling to be a better Guillermo del Toro movie.</fullReview>

And if some significant other doesn't like it? Too bad. There is a couch.Two rules of parenting broken.You shove the child up the stairs of the filthy cellar first. You follow. Then get reinforcements, such as ORKIN, Carpenters, LIGHTS. Then go around and make sure ANY suspicious openings are CLOSED. Mr. Harris got some of this right. (And if the anal retentive father/architect and interior designer gave push back? Safety issues. Period.)Third rule of parenting broken.Just general human being rule. What kind of stupid idiot hangs out in cellars going, "Gee, how interesting." I don't know about anybody else but if I got into a cellar OR attic and there are that many cobwebs, Orkin is going in first. Period. No negotiation on this. I lived in a house in England and when we first bought the house, cobwebs in the attic EVERYWHERE. I went up the ladder and went down again. Everyone else jumped around the attic going, "Wow, interesting." Until they found a wasps nest as huge as a hen house. AGAIN, call Orkin. It doesn't have to be the devil himself in the basement or attic, just a mere pestilence neglected for YEARS on end.Rule broken in this film without shame.I don't know about anyone else but as a kid I didn't like filthy, cobweb, dusty, scary artifact infested basements. And if of ANY of the ones I saw had any ONE remote area whispering my name I would have ran up the stairs so quickly it would have been at light speed and settled on someplace up a tree to suck my thumb. That's where the true sensible person is in this film, the eight year old kid. Next to that, a bloody good yarn. I like the fact the creatures do not turn off the lights by mystical force but actually have fashioned tools! Original.Except for the stupid parents. Watch it. It's a frolicking good yarn!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film I've seen Recently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this and while my opinion of it may drop with time, I don't see myself trashing it like other reviews.To me, this is a horror film, unlike the latest repackaging of Scream or Saw, or Final Destination...there's atmosphere and suspense here, with only minimal blood when it is necessary.Essentially, this film is about a girl who encounters evil creatures leaving beneath an old mansion her father has bought to fix up. At first they claim to be her friends but she soon finds them to be evil. Her father doesn't believe her, but her father's girlfriend is sympathetic. Through a series of events, the tension builds until the climax and the ending I didn't see coming.Spoilers:I thought the ending would be predictable; I thought they were either going to kill the creatures or I thought they'd all escape. When Katie Holmes gets dragged won the hole, I was very surprised, but kind of disappointed. Not until the very end when we hear her voice as a creature does it really hit you good.The acting is fine; not Shakespearean, Oscar-nomination material, but its not as bad as some of the reviews have it. The CGI was fine as well. No, it's not Avatar, nor is it intended to. I thought the creatures were done very well. They weren't simply gremlins re-done or chihuahuas; they were these little evil things that would scare the hell out of me if I found them in my house. I suspect reviewers who didn't like them are just jaded by big-budget crap.There were a few holes but not as many as one reviewer and I'll address them here.When the construction foreman is attacked by the creatures, the police wouldn't just investigate on their own, not when he is still alive and says "it was an accident." That's why domestic violence can happen, because police can't just open an investigation on a hunch and when someone says "it was an accident" they have to go along with it. The creatures aren't killed by light, they just don't like bright light. Again, these aren't gremlins. They can probably stand the light to accomplish what it is they are trying to.Anyway, this film is much better than the reviews on this site say it is. Then again, reviewers on this site gave the newest Scream a 6- something...This is a true horror film in the Gothic tradition, which is lost on most "mainstream" horror these days. Watch this if you want something fresh and good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro co-writes this dark screenplay. Not exactly horror, but scary... yes. Sally(Bailee Madison)is a young girl that is sent by her mother to live with her dad Alex(Guy Pearce)and his girlfriend Kim(Katie Holmes). They live in a large 19th century mansion in Rhode Island. Alex is a developer trying to refurbish the old place in order to get it selected for a prestigious magazine. Kim is an interior decorator; but her biggest problem is getting the little girl to like her. Sally begins hearing noises and then voices in the dark. Small strange creatures live in a once hidden basement and they are not very friendly at all. Some scenes will raise the hair on your neck. Holmes acting is fine, but nothing outstanding. Pearce quickly can get on your nerves. The true star is young Ms. Madison. The creatures do prove to be scary. Of course the big build up to the finale is the best part of the movie. Troy Nixey directs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I didn't even know this movie was a remake, so I am reviewing this movie as if I didn't know a remake existed or that I have seen it,(because I haven't seen the remake). With that being said, I thought this movie was really good. I have always been amazed by Guillermo Del Toro movies, because the time and the detail that goes into his movies is outstanding! he thinks of some creatures and provides a whole mythological background, that u can instantly believe its true, or have the urge to research it and find out more about it. This movie is no exception. It's visually entertaining and has more than no occasion that might cause u to jump! the only reason why I gave it 8 stars is because there are some plot holes in it that has me confused, and I didn't like the way the father acted towards his child. Other than that, I would definitely suggest that u give this movie a shot! I will also be checking out the original.!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched hundreds of horror movies. I enjoy all of them too, from the blockbusters to the lowest grade "B" movies that look like they were filmed in a basement. I found this movie to be better than I expected. This movie reminds me of horror movies when I was very young. It is not overly gruesome, it doesn't have million dollar special effects, it actually relies on your mind reacting to visual stimulus and creating a small tinge of fear. I imagine in younger children, this movie could be very frightening. Overall, I think a horror buff will enjoy this showing, and if you have kids that love to scare themselves, as I did when I was young, this is a movie you can watch together. Of course, they may sleep in your room that night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moving into a mansion with his new girlfriend &amp; his daughter, divorcée Alex (GUY PIERCE) has plans of renovating &amp; fixing up the pretty expansive place. But after finding a hidden basement, his daughter is immediately obsessed with finding out what is hidden inside an old furnace, especially when she hears her name being called &amp; whispered by someone of something. Within time she accidentally frees some midget fairy monsters, that wreck havoc on the child's life, while her dad thinks she is going crazy. DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is a remake of the 1973 horror film of the same name, which supposedly scared GULLMERO DEL TORO when he first saw the film on TV as a youngster. To be honest, I never ever did see the first film, much less heard of it, before seeing the remake. This film was is a pretty good, but ultimately nowhere near as scary, suspenseful or as dark as it could have &amp; should have been. I will give it this, the acting is very well done, with each actor making their characters very believable &amp; interesting. Another big plus the film has, is in it's atmosphere, with it's dreary, rainy &amp; cold looking fall look, that helps contribute to the films setting. A large mansion out in the middle of the country, true the film is not very original in this area (Come to think of it, it's difficult to find any ghost story or slow burning horror film of this nature, that doesn't take place in cold dreary weather &amp; mansion). The direction by director TROY NIXEY is very well handled, with the director able to milk out many suspenseful scenes, as well as edge of you're seat thrills, tension &amp; scares. All that out of the way however, the film as I stated above in my review, fails to be anywhere near as scary or suspenseful, or dark as it could &amp; should have been, basically because this is where the film drops the ball, in showing it's main villains far to much...midget creatures! that look like CGI created refugees from 1986's THE GATE. Once they pop on the scene &amp; snarl &amp; growl &amp; talk, the film (at least for this reviewer) starts to make one smile &amp; chuckle over how silly they look. A film like this needed to keep it's menace off screen for a good portion of the movie, barely allowing the audience to get a good look at the creatures, or only giving them a brief glance at the end &amp; it's truly sad when the creatures all the sudden pop up early in the film &amp; starts crawling all over the place, in plain view &amp; many plot holes &amp; plot inconsistencies only help to dampen the films plot even more. All in all, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is a pretty good movie, just don't expect it to knock you're socks off or scare you &amp; you should be entertained.*** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great look, cliché story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on my rating you probably think I didn't like this movie. In all honesty I did like it but there were enough problems to bump my rating down if that makes sense. The positives of this movie were Troy Nixey's directing. He used a lot of moving camera shots to tell the story which were effective and helpful. The cinematography was outstanding as were the sets and the art direction. The creatures were very cool to look at and their design was rather unique. Bailee Madison was the best character in the movie even though at times I found her dis-interesting. Now those compliments normally compile for at least and 8 of a rating. The problems that pulled it back from being an 8 was that Guillermo del Toro and Nixey did nothing original with the story. It's the typical horror movie scenario where there is this big mansion that just spells out trouble, the girl realizes that something is wrong, parents don't believe her, yada yada yada. Neither Guy Pierce nor Katie Holmes really checked in good performances till the last 30 min. There was no character development at all, and the first 40 min. of introduction to the main characters and the house was long and dull. This movie opened itself wide open to the average clichés of pretty much every horror film like this movie. This movie was predictable and the whole architectural story never had any real relevance to the story at all and just gave both Pierce and Holmes something to do besides deny that their little girl is insane. Holmes by the way is the step mom and the script blatantly makes it clear that Madison wants nothing to do with her until of course the creatures end up gobbling her up and she disappears with them at the end of the movie. The end of this movie really pi**ed me off because it suggests a sequel but you know damn good and well that we won't get a sequel. The story around the creatures is never completely clear and questions arise from the first scene of the movie that never get answered. Fine for a Halloween rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than a lot of people are giving it credit for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark," is a much better film than a lot of people are giving it credit for and the Director is the star of this one.This is a tale of a child, Sally (Bailee Madison), who is sent to live with her father (Guy Pearce),and his girlfriend (Katie Holmes). They move into a mansion that they have restored, but the house has an ominous past, one that might just take a young girls life.I have seen movies with this sort of storyline before, so that is not new, but Guillermo del Toro's signature is all over this one and that made it worth watching. His use of children, their innocence and fears, and also our fears for them have been a staple of some of his movies for a while like his genius masterpiece "Pan's Labyrinth," and the one I didn't care for, "The Devil's Backbone." He seems to be able to create a very nice blended line where fantasy and reality intermingle together and does so nicely in this movie. The scenery, mood, and overall feel he is able to create makes his Director skills become the star of the show instead of the actors.I do have a few issues with the movie though. One would be the cast. I have always thought Guy Pearce was a pretty good actor but in this one I felt he was just so-so, and really didn't add much to the story. The script was a little thin as well. Although Katie Holmes is a good actor, I don't think she will be winning any Oscars in the near future. After seeing this movie I kind of got a hint as to why she didn't do the "Batman Begins" sequel, "The Dark Knight." She was way out of her league. The little CGI monsters were a little over done as well, and could have been used more sparingly, and kept hidden a bit more but not completely distracting. The end of the movie had me pondering some practical concerns, but I can't get into it too much without revealing it.All that being said, as I stated before Del Toro's Directing takes center stage in his movies and maybe a little too much and becomes a detriment to the direction he gives his cast. This is my biggest reason for not giving it a 9 or 10It is definitely worth watching and I was surprised how much I liked the aesthetic and feel of it. Don't let negative reviews scare you away and judge it for yourself, I feel it was much better that a 6 or 7.Like my reviews? Disagree? Comments, or is there a DVD you would like reviewed?

My mom watched it and she looked scared she even said this movie is going to keep her up half the night. lol I don't get scared by movies like this one but this one was deferent.

		<shortDescription>typical Guillermo Del Toro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was I afraid to watch this remake. Why? Well, how many remakes did really work out? I knew that Carpenter's The Thing was better than the original one (guess how the remake will be, I attend to watch it Halloween night)but for example Nightmare On Elm Street was a Turkey. But here we have a problem. The original flick is well known in the States but overseas it's a bit unknown and only the geeks knew about it. That's a reason why some people didn't like it. The story itself is really based on the original, the only changes are that Sally this time is a child, but hey, that worked out fine. It reminded me a bit of Poltergeist. For that reason alone I have one negative point. Poltergeist wasn't scary at all but did have some great effects. Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark isn't scary too but it is again the effects and the storyline that made it a great flick. Congrats towards Troy Nixey as a director for making his first attempt into the big world. But he was backed up by a big name and you easily can see it in the way the monsters were created. Producer was Guillermo del Toro and it shows. If you will see the little buggers and have seen Pan's Labyrinth then you know what I mean. But also like in the original they made a good choice for the leading actors. Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes does a believable job but the biggest cheer has to go to Bailee Madison who plays Sally. To give as a child this kind of performance is unbelievable. She had to be scared of the monsters while playing before a green or blue key. All acting was believable.Naturally the most important acting were the creatures itself. And they do look adorable until they shown their real faces. And it's by that that you can see the influence of Guillermo. There's a lot of CGI but it had to be done to create the buggers. As a remake you have to add some scene's from the original, luckily they worked out well. The shower scene with the switch, the attacking of the gardener, the ropes on the stairs and I can go on. I really enjoyed it but if it will become a classic like the original one I don't know. You can see that it was made for the big audience and for that reason alone some will hate it. Make it an enjoyable evening, watch the original followed with the remake, you maybe will be afraid of the dark. Especially when you watch it with your teenies.

		<shortDescription>Morning and evening, maids heard the goblins cry: "Come buy our orchard fruits, come buy, come buy."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people may find it difficult to take goblins and fairies seriously in this day and age, but I'd argue that there is something inherently sinister about such mythical creatures, and this film toys with that. "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" centers on young Sally (Bailee Madison), who is sent by her mother to move in with her architect father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his interior designer-turned-girlfriend, Kim (Katie Holmes) at a remote 19th century Rhode Island mansion that the couple are renovating. Sally is upset and doesn't want to be there to begin with, but things go from bad to worse when she discovers that a basement fireplace is home to an army of goblin fairies that want to play... or eat.The screenplay for the film is adapted from the 1973 TV horror flick of the same name that starred Kim Darby, back when ABC was known for showing original horror and suspense films on Friday nights. Guillermo del Toro produced this update and co-wrote it, so it had some promise, right? And Guy Pearce is a phenomenal actor, and, say what you will about Katie Holmes, but she's turned in some respectable performances in her mixed-bag career. So what on earth went wrong here? First off, I have not seen the original film, although I ordered it this evening because I'm really curious to see how the source material compares.My biggest beef with this movie? it had literally no suspense. Like, none. Judging by the trailers, it looked like it would be oozing with suspense, but it was unfortunately nowhere to be found. Atmosphere was heavy and the sets and decoration were Gothic to the max, but the story did a terrible job at building any tension. I think this is partly because? now, this is my other biggest complaint? we, the audience, see far too much of these ominous creatures and we see it far too soon. After about 20-30 minutes in, we've seen them head-to-toe in full light. That killed it right there. They were obviously created with CGI, and it was fairly good CGI, though I think more practical effects would have been more appropriate. Regardless, the mystery about them is pretty much killed at that moment. My question is, why weren't they shown in full until the very end of the film? We could have seen glimpses of them, but not lingering shots and close-ups. It was just too much. I won't even get into the plot holes because there is quite a bit of nonsense that is left unexplained for some reason at the hands of the filmmakers. I don't even know, and don't ask me why.I did, however, like the mythology behind these creatures and the whole air of mystery as to why they were located where they were and the history behind them (despite the fact that all of this is explained in a lackluster monologue by an irrelevant character that has become a cliché in horror movies these days). It was something different, so I commend that. I find horror movies with archaic villains and themes to be fascinating, because it's almost like a history lesson (not to say that I believe in goblin fairies, but hey, people did at one point in humanity).The acting in the film is commendable, though none of it particularly impressed me. Guy Pearce is an amazing actor if you catch him in the right film, and this wasn't one of them. Katie Holmes surprised me, on the other hand. She's not Oscar material, but she's more than proved that she can carry herself (see "Pieces of April" or "The Gift" for further reading). The real highlight here though is young Bailee Madison, who almost out-acts Pearce and Holmes. She was a good choice for this role and hopefully it gets her more work, because she shined here.The film's ending is probably its greatest triumph, mostly because it's daring enough to do the unexpected. It's got a fairly intense climax and the eerie whispering and voice-over that closes the film is really chilling? too bad that the buildup to it was completely absent. Nonetheless, I commend the subject matter for being something different from the norm, and it has some spooky moments and thick atmosphere. The suspense factor doesn't even blip the radar, which is unfortunate, but considering what's in theaters at the moment, you could go worse than spend an hour and half with goblins in a haunted mansion. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be afraid to skip this &amp; its snail-paced tedium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro prefers his fairy tales to contain a certain amount of artistic fantasy, wonder, and even violence. Children today are exposed to a kinder, gentler sort of fairy tale than they were a few centuries ago when they were much more graphic and held dire warnings for wayward children. In the past, del Toro has successfully revived those stronger veins of story. Don't be Afraid of the Dark is based on what seems to be the tooth fairy tale but rather than the wonder and enchantment you may expect from a name like Guillermo del Toro shown twice during the opening credits, this film focuses much more on the suspense and horror elements.There are creepy-crawly things which live deep below a Rhode Island mansion and they crave 'child's teeth'. There is a brief prologue showing their modus operandi to obtain these items and then there is a cut away to the present day. Alex (Guy Pearce) appears to be a mansion/old house restorer and his live-in girlfriend, Kim (Katie Holmes), also serves as his interior decorator. Alex's daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) unluckily arrives during the restoration process to live with him for only hinted at reasons; her mother is not up to the task of raising a child who does not fit in very well with the other kids. This vague description is not intentional; the script's explanations are truly this vague. There are no overt reasons for Sally to move in with her father and any past psychological or social problems are only barely broached. Naturally, Sally has an immediate dislike for dad's girlfriend.This stage setting is not very quick either. The writers choose to take their time with the character introductions and young Sally's discovery that this house is not all it appears to be. Against the warnings of the cranky, old caretaker Mr. Harris (Jack Thompson), Sally stumbles upon the fact that the house has a basement which former tenants have creatively hidden for later occupants. Now, Sally begins to hear whispers and soft voices calling for her to come to the basement and play. This is the catalyst for a chain of events which at best are repetitive and monotonous but the descriptors of annoying and time-wasting are not out of the argument here.The tedious repetition of scurrying feet, nighttime shenanigans, and the increased skepticism on the part of the adults do not aid the tension and suspense, they instead kill the mood the movie is trying to create. Over and over again poor Sally is traumatized by happenings emanating from the basement and nobody will help her. The old standby that only the child understands and adults are stupid and too old is worked to death by the script and shatters any wonder or curiosity of what the heck is actually going on down there. An explanation and history of it all is so briefly brought to light and talked over it is actually maddening when they cut away from it for another scene of Sally in trouble. The writers make a fatal choice to ignore what would be the most interesting bit of the underground creatures, their past, and choose instead to stack whisper upon whisper and scene upon scene of monotonous, dark, and cringe-inducing boredom.Dark is definitely an important word here. It is dark outside even during the day. Every room in the house is extremely dim including Sally's bedroom which is truly one of the darkest settings ever shot. The house restorers did not give too much thought to properly lighting any rooms whatsoever. The basement has an excuse as to why it is so dark but it is actually one of the lighter areas since they included a handy skylight to brighten up the place. Normally, dimly shot scenes belong in a film which warns you not to be afraid, but no worries, any thought you would have of being afraid is erased after the third of fourth iteration of the exact same scene set-up you have already witnessed before.Katie Holmes does not show up in very many movies anymore which makes this film an odd choice for her to say yes to. Perhaps she wanted the prestige of being involved in a movie written by Guillermo del Toro. Most actors would also raise their hands to work with him considering he wrote Pan's Labyrinth, the Hellboy screenplays, and The Devil's Backbone. Unfortunately, Katie got her chance in his worst script yet. Guy Pearce's bumbling character gets a few scenes less than Katie does which maintains his current streak of supporting roles. Guy used to be a leading man but recently he has popped up only briefly in The King's Speech, The Hurt Locker, Animal Kingdom, and The Road. He was good in all of those roles, but they had extremely limited screen time. Don't be Afraid of the Dark, an extremely uninspired film title by the way, will not help him if he wants to be a headliner again in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I have been waiting to see DON'T BE AFRAID for about a year now. The preview left me creeped out. That bed sheet scene at the end of the trailer will never be forgotten by me. Well, I went to see this Troy Nixey/Guillermo Del Toro produced film and I must say, good job. This is a dark fairytale wrapped in a horror movie's shadow. The opening scene is very well done. It is a very creepy scene that I'm not going to explain, because you must see for yourself. Not long after the opening credits, which were an artistic genius, the movie somewhat switches from a horror movie to somewhat of a Pan's Labyrinth fairytale, then back again to a horror movie. The house becomes a character itself, with the designs reminiscent of other Del Toro film houses. Inside the house, young Sally (portrayed by the very talented Bailee Madison) discovers a basement, where something mysterious lurks...The performances in this movie are strong. Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes play the worried parents, and Bailee Madison plays the "child-in-peril" very well. Overall, I think this movie is an atmospheric gem that is great fun. Recommended.

		<fullReview>This film rocks! It's a charmingly nasty little piece of deviltry that has all the classic atmosphere and creepiness of a classic. Judging from the negative reviews on IMDb, too many of you are jaded to the point where you've forgotten how to enjoy a good horror film! You all sound like a bunch of grumpy, nasty homunculi yourselves! Case in point: Mr. "Plot Holes" lists what he sees as holes; but each one is easily explained by anyone with half a brain and who is at least half-willing to meet this movie where it stands and enjoy the ride. Maybe there are just way too many old fogies out there who are clutching onto their adolescent nostalgia about the original 1973 TV film. But give me a break, you weenies; this is no hack job, after all! It's a collaboration of outstanding talents and painstaking design that took over a decade to complete. Come on people! Lighten up! This film is loads of wicked fun and beautifully filmed! The cinematography alone is nothing short of sumptuous! In fact, I wouldn't balk too much at a sequel! the story idea could warrant one, if done with the same attention to detail and artistic excellence. Note to this film's detractors: Go watch your 1973 TV movie and shut up! Let me enjoy this beautifully conceived cinematic gem in Blu-ray High-Def without being annoyed by your incessant sour grape clamoring!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this film since I saw the trailer for it that came out last year. The movie looked like it could be a fun little horror film, with a creepy atmosphere to it. Did it live up to my expectations? Yes it did, but it still had its problems.The story in the film is simple, Sally is sent to move in with her Father and his new girlfriend. While living at their house, she discovers creatures that want to claim her as one of their own. While the story could be improved, I felt that they did a decent enough job with the material without making it come off as goofy. The only problem that I had with the story was the father, I get that this is a horror movie but he was just oblivious to everything and unlikeable. Even when his daughter shows him proof that these creatures are inside their own house, he still doesn't believe her. This is the weakest part of the story, the father was unlikeable and wasn't smart at all. For a horror movie like this to work, your going to need a likable father figure, this just didn't have that kind of character.The acting in this film is decent other then Guy Pearce I thought he did a pretty bad job with the role he had. I'm not sure if this was because of the script he was working with, but his acting in the movie was wooden and you never felt anything for his character. He could have done a better job with the character, but instead his acting just comes off as wood and boring. Everyone else does a decent job with the material they're given, but the actor that stood out in this film for me would be Bailey Madison she did a good job with her role, and she seemed to be having the most fun out of everyone. She delivers a good performance with what she has to work with, she's easily the best actor in the film.Don't be Afraid of The Dark is one of the better horror movies to come out in 2011, but it still has its problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are reading this before you have seen the movie let me save you your time and money. This movie looked a little promising with the trailers and commercials that i had listened to on the radio. But after my $12 and 1:45 of my time i came to the conclusion that this movie was horrible. I wanted to watch this because it seemed that it could actually be a bit scary as the past few years of the horror genre has completely gone to crap. Well this movie is no different from any of the others. The acting is terrible, the little girls face is horrible as well just made me hate it right form the start. But besides that the whole thing of evil Fairys living in the heater in your basement just didn't go over well with me at all. Complete waste of time and money. The plot is so stupid. Lets make a scary movie about little fairys that are about half the size of my hand want to eat children's teeth. That sounded like a great idea from the get go. NO ACTUALLY IT WAS THE WORST IDEA POSSIBLE. The only reason why this movie even made it to the theatres was because Kate Holmes was in it. She's hot ill give her that but don't tell Tom i said that. So in conclusion save your money for a movie that is worth your time, I would suggest seeing 30 seconds or less. Funny movie filled with humour and stupidity you can actually enjoy, oh and the best part no Fairys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nevermind the haters, true fans of Gothic horror will adore the fairy-tale-esque "Don't be Afraid of the Dark" remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was floored when I saw the user average rating for this film. Absolutely astonished that such a gorgeous, creepy, fairy-tale of a Gothic horror film could have such a "meh" score (a 5.6 at this current time). I'm truly saddened that people have become so jaded with films, that a unique, and truly well-done horror remake like this just gets dismissed, while run-of-the-mill Hollywood trash gets better scores and rakes in the cash at the box office.Troy Nixey directs this remake of the 70's TV-movie from a script co- written by mastermind Guillermo del Toro (one of modern films only true creative geniuses, responsible for the criminally underrated "Hellboy" films and the exquisite "Pan's Labyrinth"). Starring Katie Holmes, Guy Pearce and Bailee Madison, "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" is a fun, Gothic and downright eerie trip down memory lane, recalling a time long- since forgotten where horror films were actually creepy and, well, horrific.Madison stars as Sally Hurst, a troubled, sad young child who is sent by her mother to live with her father Alex (Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Holmes), in a creepy old mansion they are restoring that was once home to famed painter Emerson Blackwood. In an eerie opening scene, we discover that Blackwood was killed by mysterious creatures sealed under the home, who had taken his son from him.When Sally discovers a hidden basement beneath the house, she begins to hear strange whispers in the dark from the diminutive creatures beneath, calling for her to set them free from the fireplace in which they've been sealed. Sally does this, in a very fairy-tale bit of curiosity, hoping to befriend whatever is hidden inside. However, they are deceivers, and once free, the ghoulish little critters begin to stalk Sally, intent on taking her and making her into one of them forever.The acting is solid for a horror film. Madison is great as Sally, a sad girl whose mother put her on adderall, and whom keeps to herself. She is a very relatable, sympathetic figure. Holmes is actually a lot of fun as Kim, and is extremely likable, which was a nice change of pace, as her public image as Mrs. Tom Cruise has caused her to be, well, very unlikable in real life because of their radical beliefs. And Pearce, though under-utilized, is quite believable as a troubled father trying to juggle work and his crumbling relationship with his daughter. Supporting characters are also all well-played.Production-wise, this film is top notch. Nixey's direction is first class and extremely elegant. He seems to be drawing inspiration from co-writer and producer del Toro, as his visuals are all smooth, poetic and deliberate. I cannot wait to see what Nixey has in store in the future. The score by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders is good, creepy fun. And the set and creature design is flawless. Despite some occasional shaky CGI, the little creatures are quite startling and vicious, and the Gothic set is absolutely beautiful and haunting.The script, courtesy of del Toro and Mathew Robbins is a blast. As in the past, del Toro has a certain poetry to his writing, and he very much adapts the original film into a sort of fairy-tale. In a way, it's comparable to his own "Pan's Labyrinth" (one of the best films of the past ten years) in terms of tone and style. It's a great little fun horror tale, and most of the so-called plot holes people like to poke in it are easily explainable. (Then again, people never seem to understand the difference between plot holes and questions, anyways, so the plot-holes people point out aren't actually plot-holes.)It's really tragic that a horror film of this caliber is being passed on, disregarded and dismissed so much. There is more creativity in 5 minutes of this film than any other entire horror film that came out in 2011.I give "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" a strong 8 out of 10. It's not perfect, and there are some minor flaws, but take if from me- if you like a good, eerie horror film, or are a fan of Gothic horror... Or hey, even if you just like good fairy-tales, this film is for you. Check it out and disregard the misguided haters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and suspenseful. Will take you as far as Insidious did.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now what we have here is another eerie and suspenseful film from the mind of Guillermo Del Toro and new-coming director Troy Nixey. While Nixey directs Del Toro works with Matthew Robins to write this incredibly frightening film. The film builds with the power of its atmosphere as well as its three main actors. It is perfectly crafted to send chills down your spine and keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.Now Katie Holmes, Bailee Madison, and Guy Pearce come and put on amazing performances to create pity and anguish for you to feel from seeing these characters (mainly Holmes and Madison) as they go on this nightmare of a ride. Katie Holmes is perfect as the girlfriend trying to win the affection of her boyfriends daughter and ending up loving her like her own. Madison isn't the innocent little girl yet she is curious and throughout the film many start believing she is mentally unstable so that the only person listening to her is Holmes' character. Yet Pearce is stuck with the role of being the idiot (almost uncaring) father, however he does it well.Now what truly creates the films eerie mood are the voices and shadows of the creatures lurking deep within the bowels of the old mansion. The only complaint I have is that the creatures are not as scary as their voices and shadows make them out to be. That proves, however, that maybe it is our imagination that can make things scarier than they actually are. Any way you look at it the film is definitely chilling from these scurrying evil creatures. The movie keeps a mysterious tone by not going into the history of these creatures or revealing why they're there but that helps it keep the mood from the beginning.My final word on the matter is that this film is the scariest film to come out since Insidious and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Holmes and Madison steal the show while the voices cause your skin to crawl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible, Walked Out!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the trailer for don't be afraid of the dark and couldn't wait to watch it on big screen. I was the first one in the theater with my girlfriend for the midnight show of this film and the first one to walk out. If you are looking for a long scene by scene review of this so called 'movie' then you must look somewhere else since I couldn't bare to watch the entire film. i walked out after one hour and 15 minutes.The movie starts off really slow...slower then usual with predictable story line. The run time for the film is 1:40 and after sitting through 1:15 with literally nothing talking place in the movie, i decided to walk out. Please be warned that this review will get a lot of thumbs down by Del Toro staff or groupies but i can only urge you to refrain yourself 3-4 days from watching this film. come back to this site in a day or two to see the star rating of this film plummeted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Movie of The Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got home from an early screening of this terrible attempt at a modern day ghost story. It starts out showing off a house that Del Toro should have saved for use in his Haunted Mansion film, and begins spinning a G Rated web of terrible CGI fairies, weak character development, and most of all a TERRIBLE script. I realize this is a remake of a TV movie, so nobody should expect much going in, but I can honestly say that I was laughing through all of the "scary" scenes along with the rest of the audience in the full theater. The only reason this film gets 2 stars is for the young girl who plays the object of the dime sized villain's obsession. Seriously, these Gremlins rip-offs were easily killable and yet maybe one dies throughout the entire film. Sorry excuse for a film and anybody who wastes their money on this should go in looking to laugh. Oh, and about the R rating, what a joke! The film is full of PG-13 MTV cuts that make the Nightmare on Elm Street remake look classy. The dialogue and shots were nothing but cliché attempts at "looking cool". I'm afraid to say that with the stupid moviegoers of today who praised Transformers, this film will be a hit. Until people can wake up and realize that most modern films today are gimmicks the studios use to get their hands in your pockets, trash like this will keep getting released.-Michael</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, creepy little monster flick but with a terrible ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare experiences where an 8+ out of ten movies ends being a seven, all because of the last fifteen minutes to a half hour. The ending is just such a huge let down. BUT don't be steered away from the movie because it is a fun horror/monster flick with some great performances. Also don't let bad press and people's opinions about Katie Holmes make you not see this because she is still a good actress!! And she carries this film well.Guy Pearce is terrific as the doting husband and father, also focused on his career. He sort of takes a back seat as a character to Holmes and the young girl but he definitely adds something to the cast. As mentioned previously Katie Holmes is very good as Kim. If she is the stereotypical horror scream queen she is good in that aspect but her character does actually have depth. Stealing just about every scene in this film is the absolutely phenomenal twelve year old Bailee Madison. She looks so much like Holmes which is odd because even in this film she doesn't play Holmes' biological daughter. Madison is brilliant in this movie. She was terrific in Just Go With It, showing her comedic side and now her more serious side in this film. This should launch her career!! The three of them have a great chemistry and the sub-story of them trying to make a family together really does add to the movie.Guillermo del Toro is known for his imagination and this is sort of subtle compared to his other creature heavy films but it still shows some great imagination in the story. My guess would be that newcomer director Troy Nixey was handpicked by del Toro and probably took a lot of his advice which is good. Part haunted house, part monster flick, even some truly gory scenes which is a bit of a surprise for what seems like a B-Movie horror or even PG'd down. If you want a little creepiness to your movie or just something a little unique than I encourage you to check this out. But I warn you the ending will leave you so unsatisfied, it'll literally make you mad. Its so unfortunate being the rest of the film was so well made. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS FILM IS A REMAKE, FOLKS... Spoiler on the OLD film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film years ago, in the '70s. Kim Darby (of the original TRUE GRIT movie with John Wayne and Glen Campbell), starred as Sally. The little creatures came out of the wall, and after her husband left on a business trip, they began ganging up on her, trying to tie her up like Gulliver (in the story GULLIVER'S TRAVELS). They were quite sinister and did the same whispering thing; i.e., "Sally, we want you!", and so forth. I do not know how the new remake ends, but in the OLDER FILM, they dragged her off in the end. I have never forgotten the film, and at the time, I thought it was very creepy. I think it came out about the time I was starting college, which was in 1972.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope it ends differently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original movie ended with evil being triumphant. I hope it doesn't end like that. There are remakes that end differently than the original like Ocean's 11; in the end they lost the money they got. But in the remake with Clooney and Pitt, they got away. In the Thomas Crown Affair with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway he got away and the girl didn't go with him. In the one with Pierce Brosnan she joined him and he also made restitution. But there are also some that doesn't end nicely like the original. Like Psycho, in the original the psychiatrist gave a very detailed explanation of why Norman behaved the way he did, while in the remake, one would think that the psychiatrist is anxious to leave. The way the original ended made it difficult for me to sleep. Let's hope it's not a downer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Creepy Movie, Old style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical movie in the Del Toro style. Spooky and atmospheric, and even after the movie I am thinking about it (later at night when things are going bump! lol) - definitely not one for the kids (it isn't gory - just jumpy in parts). As I was watching it - parts of it reminded me of gremlins, but the spookiness, creepiness and atmospheric style of the movie was great. Dark and creepy sets, lovely music score, good acting and a good old fashioned spooky story - a great film.At the risk of getting an online slamming (I can take it) this is a really good creepy movie. Sure, the storyline isn't something never told before, but it does it well. Plus, it's a remake so it most definitely has been told before. But then most horror movies fall back on familiar themes (like the past coming back to haunt and threaten us, or what happens when you leave the safety of the path and head into the woods) but I certainly jumped and was really caught up in this movie. I've around thirty years experience of watching horror movies and this was a good little trip into the darkness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore The Movie's Title: Be Very Afraid, But See It Anyway!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With many sci-fi/horror movies, the less that is said about a movie, the better the advertising campaign. If you already know what the movie is about going in, the thrill and fun of the movie will be completely lost. The movie poster for "Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark" says enough: the main actors, the fact that Guillermo Del Toro ("Pan's Labyrinth" (2006), "Hellboy" (2004)) co-wrote the screenplay, and the title of the movie. That's all you really need to know, and you just go into the movie and prepare for a strange and creepy trip.The film's main strength is in the acting, actually. Bailee Madison, who's only 11 years old, does a fantastic job here as Sally, a girl who is forced to move from Los Angeles to Rhode Island to live with her architect father Alex (Guy Pierce) and his interior decorator girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes). Sally's mother is still alive, but sent her to live with Alex anyway.Sally doesn't like Kim, or the house they all live in. You don't blame her for feeling that way, as Madison portrays Sally not as a brat, but as someone struggling to adjust to her new surroundings. There may have been the temptation to play this child character as a pampered West Coast transplant, but that would have stripped Sally of her sympathetic characteristics, and brought the whole story down with it.Of course, you know early on that Sally is correct about the house, a Victorian-style mansion that Alex and Kim are working to renovate. It is when they discover the basement underneath that the unsettling story really gets going, and you can't help but frequently fear for this family.Hearing the whispering voices that come from the archaic furnace is enough to make everyone run. Sally, however, makes the mistake of opening the furnace door while hearing these voices. It's inconsistent, sure, but there wouldn't be a horror story without her doing that.To reveal what form the voices take would kill the thrill of this movie. What they do to their victims is also unsettling, but not so much that it's unavoidable. Bailee Madison does a really great job at being terrified. She could be the best child actor in a horror film since Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense". You really feel for her whenever the lights go off and directly contradict the title of this movie.After at least six years of co-starring in forgettable movies, Katie Holmes does a good job here as Kim, whose petrification is also very believable. She also displays great warmth and chemistry alongside Madison as their character slowly but surely bond.Guy Pierce also takes what would be the thankless role of the father who tells his daughter that there's nothing to fear, and makes it believable. He's not stupid, but he always comes into the room whenever the light switch is conveniently within his grasp."Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark" could make you afraid of the dark, but it's still a really good horror movie written by a movie maker who knows what makes horror fun, what makes it scary, and what keeps us coming back. The movie is effectively scary, and may make you put a padlock on your cellar door. It's really good, though, and worth seeing on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came back from the theater after watching this film. I was quite surprised by the poor reviews this movie is receiving here to be honest.I thought it was a very enjoyable Horror, old fashioned creepy house type of film with the visual imagination of Horror mind Guillermo Del Toro and some talented acting.Bailee Madison, the young girl who played Sally was very good for her age and she played the role of a helpless scared and frightened young girl perfectly for some one at her age. the plot centers around her, as she moves to her father's big house " mansion " and his girlfriend, only to find herself a target of an ancient and mysterious creatures, helpless and hopeless that any one would believe her.Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes were pretty good here, i never felt their acting was wooden or bad.I was intrigued, thrilled and spooked out. it certainly entertained me.I don't know what the other reviewers were mumbling about ?! the acting was wooden ? seriously ? the movie was not original !! sure it has some familiarities with other Horror films, but it still stood out in its own way. not scary !! what is ?? it certainly did spook me out and was intense.don't listen to the negative reviewers, go give this movie a try, and you will more than likely enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sally goes to live with her house decorator father and "stepmom" (they are not married as of yet) as they are renovating a spooky manor once owned by a painter who vanished along with his son. Once she discovers a basement (hidden by a deep batch of bushes), much to the chagrin of a member of the construction crew , Harris (Jack Thompson), terror awaits the trio who stay in the manor while it is being fixed up to be presented to a special select group who might consider it for the cover of a prestigious architecture magazine. This renovation is especially important to Alex (Guy Pearce, not the asshole I was expecting by some of the reviews for the movie) who has sunk all of his money into, including outstanding loans in the hopes of getting the manor appropriate for the magazine. Sally (Bailee Madison) hears voices calling her "wanting to play" and asking to be set free from an "ash pit". Feeling abandoned by her mother in Hollywood, Sally is resistant to Kim (Katie Holmes, not bad) and Alex although they both try to reach out to her?yes, a storyline cliché, we see the stepmom try to gain Sally's approval with the little girl not responding warmly. Anyway, Sally lightens a screw to the gate holding those whispering "beings" in the ash pit in the basement enough so that those held prisoner inside can escape unleashing a horror her innocent mind couldn't anticipate.Mediocre chiller with CGI creatures right out of a Henry Selick/Tim Burton stop motion animation nightmare world, reminiscent to scurrying rodents. "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" has plenty of those "dread moments" like a child trapped in the bathroom, the lights out, the little monsters surrounding her as the adults try to rescue her as the locked door proves difficult to break down. There's the "monster attacks" with the creatures, that are intelligent, descend upon victims, like Harris (the moment we first see him on screen, I knew he was doomed?it was too easy), with knives, razors, screwdrivers, and scissors. There are a few spooky moments such as when Sally is in her room and one of the creatures crawls under the sheets, as we get a shot of her looking for it (right out of Wes Craven's New Nightmare), or the aforementioned bathroom where Sally appears to be damned. The score has a bit of Hammer and Dark Shadows, along with loud music cues to make you jump. The manor and its grounds are Gothic art direction at its finest; there's even one of those musical toys with animal shapes that lights up on the wall for some added visual eye candy. Holmes and Madison try (Madison can tear up on cue really well) with what they are given, material that is shopworn thanks to plenty of those dramas about domestic turbulence deriving from a little girl's rebelling against a change from one parent to another, the stepmom only wanting to be friends with her. Sadly, the creatures aren't scary as much as ugly, but as a pack they can swarm a victim in seconds flat making them dangerous. A weakness for the uglies is that they are afraid of the dark so the film gives the family an advantage (Sally uses a Polaroid camera with a bright flash as a weapon, and flashlights (which, predictably, have those kinds of batteries that run out during the most inopportune times). The climax has the family in a fight for survival as the creatures need one human soul as part of some sort of ritual, the little girl a target, but Kim would do if push comes to shove. At times stylish, but ultimately forgettable, "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" I figure will come and go with little fanfare which is disappointing because I was so hoping for a blood-curdling spookshow. Alas..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that exactly captures my childhood nightmares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand some people find this movie not scary. But for me personally, I feel that it perfectly captures the fear I had when I was a child. When I was Sally's (the movie's protagonist)age, around 5-10, I always imagined about nasty, furry rat/monkey-like creatures with white bright eyes lurking behind furniture and underneath my bed. When the light was turned on, they hid. And I thought that was the reason why the adults weren't able to be convinced that they exist, why my parents always tried to convince me that it was just my imagination. I was so afraid that I requested my mom to either keep the light on, or accompany me when I slept. But just as what every adult would do, they would always turn off the light and leave the room after the child fell asleep. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night, and I thought I heard strange sounds (probably rats in real life). I would try to cover my self up with the blanket, shaking, desperately wishing that the sun would come out sooner. --Btw, I miss those childhood days lol.--- This movie has perfectly re-captured all those memories. I am almost 30 years old and not the squeaky kind (I'm a horror movie fan but I haven't really been scared by any horror movie in the last five years). However this movie reminded me of my childhood days when I was so afraid of the dark that I couldn't sleep with the light off. Since del Toro was able to so accurately capture my personal fear, I think the fear of furry rat/monkey-like goblins is probably not unique. If you're one of these people that shared similar childhood nightmares, please do go see this movie. It's nearly perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Suspense Film For A While</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually do be afraid of the dark. Be very, very afraid........An excellent modern horror/suspense film is a little difficult to come across lately and lovers of this genre of film have been let down several times. But now this has all changed with " Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark".A young girl, Sally, is sent to live with her estranged father in a great big mansion of a house that he is renovating with his interior design girlfriend. However things are not as quaint as they seem and when Sally starts hearing whispered voices she decides to investigate where they are coming from. Her investigations release a nasty surprise for the new residents and it's up to Sally to get her dad and his girlfriend to believe her about the danger they are all in before it's too late.The suspense is kept up all the way through the movie even though the reveal of the menacing creatures, that reside in the house, happens about half way through. And although the setting, the" haunted mansion"has been done many times before, the story is still fresh with a novel storyline and an ending worth waiting for. The young actress, Bailee Madison, who plays Sally steals the film with some excellent acting and i'm sure we'll be seeing her in some more films soon.Don't miss it.............</fullReview>

I was actually happy about this rating, because a horror film that's released as an R often relies on gimmicks to entice viewers (high body counts, very graphic deaths, loads of blood and a fair amount of nudity). This movie did things the right way, it created a feeling of terror long before the creatures were even shown. Instead of showing the creatures of the movie outright we're shown their eyes, their shadows, and we hear their voices that echo around the room.And this is terrifying in the same way that a knock on the door at three AM is terrifying: because you don't know what to expect. And once that uncomfortable feeling is cemented seeing the creatures is just an extra terror.The theater that I was in started full with a handful of empty seats, during the movie there was a slow exodus of people, a few of these people returned, but most did not. I can only conclude that the movie proved to be too much for them (and I admit that I was considering leaving at a couple of points) and they were too scared to stay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Throwback to the Days When Horror Wasn't All Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010)*** (out of 4) Handsomely made remake of the 1973 made-for-TV classic has a young girl (Bailee Madison) going to live with her father (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend (Katie Holmes) who are in the middle of remodeling a old house. Soon the little girl realizes that there are some creatures living in the basement who are trying to kill her but of course the adults don't believe her. DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK isn't a masterpiece and I'm not certain I'd say it's better than the original but in today's torture porn days it comes as a refreshing reminder of what horror movies used to be like. As with the first film, there's not any graphic violence and there's really nothing too offensive and instead of delivering gore the director instead goes for atmosphere and suspense. It's even rarer for a horror film to be laid back, quaint and rather sedated but that's exactly what this one is. Being so old-fashioned is going to please some but I could see quite a few people watching this and being disappointed, which would be a shame because you have to admire the filmmakers for what they attempted. The visual look of the film is certainly going to remind people of PAN'S LABYRINTH but I guess this is going to be a given since Guillermo del Toro produced this remake. It's clear that he and director Troy Nixey wanted to do something that built around suspense as that's what they go for from the opening sequence to the very last. I thought it was rather brave to make a horror film like they did but they also make an old-fashioned one by making the main target a young child. The child-in-peril formula died off during the 70s when it became too "damaging" to show children being stalked so this here adds a touch of freshness to the material. I will admit that I was a little shocked to see how far they went in showing the kid in danger and apparently this is what caused the film to get its R-rating. Without the suspense there's really no reason this thing couldn't have been PG because there's very little blood, very little violence and I can't recall a single cuss word. The suspense for the most part slowly builds itself up and finally unleashes full steam once the ending comes. The ending, which I won't spoil here, contained some very good suspense and I was really shocked to see how it ended, which again doesn't fit the norm for today's movies. Another strong aspect are the three lead performances with Madison really standing out as the child. Most films go for the "cute child" act but that's not the case here. I'm not saying the actor wasn't cute but it's clear they selected her for her great acting ability and I liked the fact that they wrote her character as a troubled child. This added a lot of depth to the film and the actresses perfectly nailed the part. Pearce and Holmes are also very impressive in their roles with Holmes really standing out. Her scenes with Madison where she's trying to understand her were very tender and rank as one of the film's highlights. I think the one issue I had with the film is that it ran about five or ten-minutes too long and there's a diner party sequence that I felt fell flat on its face. Outside of this, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is a pretty impressive little horror film but those unfamiliar with what the genre used to be like might need to be warned that this isn't your typical film. And yes, that's a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just watched Guillermo del Toro produce a horrible movie DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK starring Katie Holmes, Guy Pearce and Bailee Madison, directed by Troy Nixey. I am not going to spoil the movie for anyone that reads the reviews here. Just take my word for it. I arrived at the movie theater about an hour and a half before the showing outside in the San Antonio Texas heat. So not worth it.It officially comes out on August 26, 2011. I beg you to save your money and purchase this movie via Netflix or Redbox. On the bright side, it was a free movie date night for me and my better half. LOL!</fullReview>
