		<shortDescription>Did MGM plan a series out of this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film on TCM and it was a pretty good product from MGM's B picture unit. Walter Pidgeon was stepping into Bill Powell's shoes as a slick society lawyer.Pidgeon is a properly WASP attorney in what would now be called a white shoe law firm. But he has a taste for criminal law that doesn't sit well with the other members of his firm, including his prospective father-in-law. They agree to part professionally and later on Pidgeon's fiancé breaks off the engagement.That sets off a series of events that has the fiancé's former boy friend on trial for shooting a girl he dumps. At that point Pidgeon's services suddenly become in great demand.It really looked like this was a series that Walter Pidgeon may have been slated for. Playing his butler was Herbert Mundin who is always very funny. This was the last film that Herbert Mundin ever did, he was killed in automobile crash shortly after this film was made. Some of the incidents in the film with Mundin and Pidgeon are pretty funny as are those with Mundin and Virginia Bruce. He would have been an integral character in a running series. I'll bet that's why a series never developed.Some of the plot was a bit too coincidental for my taste. Still the players are all good in this. Besides Pidgeon and Mundin, Virginia Bruce is a nightclub chanteuse who's introduced to Pidgeon by former gangster client Leo Carrillo who has a key role in solving the case. Lee Bowman is the framed society boyfriend, Eduardo Ciannelli is another gangster, Ann Morriss is the murder victim and Tom Kennedy and Edward Brophy play a pair of inept bodyguards that Carrillo sends to watch Pidgeon's back.The film is a remake of MGM's earlier film Penthouse and since this one was now done under the Code, some of the innuendo of the older film has been left out.For a film entitled Society Lawyer there isn't one courtroom scene. Still this looked like a promising film series, stillborn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In spite of MGM lavishness, this suffers from a too far-fetched plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to really test my patience in accepting the falseness of the story here, telling the story of a powerful New York lawyer, having just gotten a charming gangster (Leo Carrillo) off on a murder rap, who now faces another challenge: proving that his ex-girlfriend's fiancée didn't kill his ex-girlfriend, who happened to have dumped a gambling racketeer for him in the first place. A road map may be necessary to recall who is who as this warped love hexagon gets more and more convoluted and the method in which the murder took place just doesn't make sense with the accused obviously innocent. Walter Pidgeon, as the attorney, does cleverly throw holes in the D.A.'s case, and Virginia Bruce, as a friend of the deceased, provides a decent love interest, even if her nightclub song, "I'm in love with Mr. So and So" is truly one of the weakest tunes I've heard in film, let alone one made by the mighty MGM.As the gangsters, Carrillo and Eduardo Cianelli are at opposite ends of the personality spectrum, Carrillo cheery as he plays with his model trains, and Cianelli so obviously sinister that victim Ann Morriss seems a fool to have trusted him, even if it was only revenge that she went back to him. Lee Bowman, as the accused, also plays a foolish character, agreeing to meet Morriss socially for no other apparent reason than so she can tell him off in public and that he can be set up for a murder with no real motive. So among the Nick and Nora's and Pidgeon's brief Nick Carter series, this one ranks a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>remake of Penthouse, and don't think about it too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Society Lawyer" is a B movie from MGM, and a remake of the precode "Penthouse" with Myrna Loy and Warner Baxter. This time around it stars Walter Pidgeon and Virginia Bruce. Other roles are played by Lee Bowman, Leo Carrillo, Eduardo Cianelli, and Herbert Mundin.Pidgeon plays a lawyer Christopher Durant, who works in a prestigious law firm, but he has a penchant for the lower criminal classes and is able to get mobster Tony Gazotti (Carrillo) found not guilty of a charge. Gazotti, who calls Durant "sweetheart" is deeply indebted to him.Christopher and his fiancé Sue (Frances Mercer) break up; she has fallen for his friend, Phil Siddall (Bowman). The two part amicably.Siddall winds up arrested for murder of his ex-girlfriend Judy Barton, which is the weakest part of the story. For some reason, she calls him and asks to meet him, just so she can tell him off - and he goes! A shot is fired, which Siddall thinks is a backfire, and then he notices she is bleeding. A gun lands at his feet, and he picks it up. Sue asks Christopher for his help, and he turns to Gazotti for the lowdown on people who might be involved. He introduces Christopher to a nightclub singer, Pat Abbott (Bruce) who lived in the same building as Judy and knows some of the characters.Pidgeon does a good, relaxed job, even if he's a little too high class for the perps he likes to defend. Herbert Mundin is very funny as the butler in his last film, as he died in a car accident after the movie completed. Virginia Bruce is lovely with a bright, upbeat presence. Eduardo Ciannelli is his usual gangster self. Ciannelli was an interesting person - he was an international opera star who became an actor and starred in a number of plays before hitting the movies.Entertaining mostly due to the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Bedfellows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Cleaned up version because of the super prudish Hayes Commission of the 1933 jumping in and out of bed by Marthy Loy &amp; Waren Baxter, among others in the film, "The Penthhouse". The movie "Society Lawyer" has the straight laced and waspish Walter Pidgeon as defense attorney Chris Durant fly the coop and leave his old mans's former Park Ave law firm and decides to become a full time criminal lawyer defending the biggest and most powerful hoods in town. After getting crime boss Tony Gazotti, Leo Carrillo, off on a murder rap that everyone in town were sure he wouldn't beat Durant felt that defending members of organized crime was the way to go. In it being far more exciting as well as profitable that being involved in boring legal case involving mostly tax money and inheritance matters for for the rich and famous that he's been doing for years.This all set off a chain reaction with Durant's fiancée Sue Leonard, Frances Mercer, leaving him in disgust for his best friend Phil Siddall, Lee Bowman, who in return leaves his girlfriend Judy Barton, Ann Morriss, who dropped crime boss Jim Crelliman, Eduardo Ciannelli, to marry Siddall! Now feeling rejected and humiliated for being dumped by Siddall Judy plans to rekindle her relationship with mobster Creillman. That's if Creilliman wants her back!It's later when Judy is invited to a party that Creilliman is throwing she calls for her ex-boyfriend Siddall to drop in to give him a piece of her mine in what a low down rat he was for dumping her. With Judy and Siddall going outside on the terrace to talk things over a shot is heard and Judy in found dead with a shocked and confused Siddall holding the .38 revolver that killed her! When Durant gets the news of Siddell's arrest for 1st degree murder he decides to defend him in felling that his actions,that lead to Sue after she left him planning to marry Siddell,in a way lead to Judy's death!As things turned out it was non other then mobster Gazotti whom Durant successfully defended together with night club singer at Creilliman's nightclub Pat Abbott, Virginia Bruce, who help Durant brake the Siddall/Barton murder case wide open. It's both Gazotti's mob connections and Pat's inside knowledge in what her boss Creillman was all about that lead Durnat to find out who really murdered Judy and planted the murder weapon on Siddall! Thus making him a candidate for a one way trip to Sing Sing's infamous electric chair!The cool as a cucumber sophisticated and blue-blooded looking Walter Piedgon as society and now mobbed up lawyer Chis Durant is a bit too clean and cultured looking to be around the likes of mobsters like Gazotti but manages to pull it off, in him being a mob lawyer or mouth piece, anyway. The one thing in the movie that seemed to be a bit out of place is that there was no sex or at least fooling around in it with all the wild and crazy love affairs, on and off the screen, going on in the film. But you couldn't blame the film-makers and writers in that they were restricted or handcuffed by the Hayes Commission not to add any spice to the movie that in fact desperately needed to be kicked up a bit, in the sex department, with a whole bottle of hot Tabasco sauce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A White-Telephone Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Pigeon and gangsters. OK.The plot is good. The haunting Virginia Bruce is as good as she always was. Those pale, worried looking eyes were unique! Too bad she didn't have a true A-list career. Lee Bowman is good too, in a small but pivotal role.The gangsters are not e believable. They are sort of goofy and sometimes comical. OK, this is not a film noir. But murder and corruption aren't cute. They are made to seem so here. It's a chic bonbon made to look like a thriller. Costume changes are the order of the day</fullReview>
