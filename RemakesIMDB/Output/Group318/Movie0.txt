		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's "perfect" movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Notorious* may not be Hitchcock's greatest film, but it may very well be his most perfect film. Rarely is a viewer treated to so much talent in all areas of film creation: Hitch directing, Gregg Toland photographing, Ben Hecht writing, Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains acting. And everyone is firing on all cylinders.What gives *Notorious* its singularity amongst the pantheon of Hitchcock's masterpieces is the highly symbolic, literate, and penetrating script by Hecht. Nominally, the film is about the OSS (the pre-natal version of the CIA) using a compromised young daughter of a condemned, unrepentant Nazi to infiltrate a cell of German expatriates in Rio de Janeiro just after the close of the Second World War. The plot hinges on some nonsense involving "uranium ore" stuffed in wine bottles in the cellar of Claude Rains' mansion. In actuality, the film is nothing less than a dark fugue on alcoholism, and secondarily (and of most interest to the director), invasion of privacy. Thirdly, we are treated to some more of the Master's endless fascination with Freudian slop: yet again, we get the Oedipus Complex in all its ardor, with a domineering old bat wielding the motherly whip-hand on Rains' cuckolded, castrated, romantic ex-pat Nazi.But Hecht is interested primarily in alcoholism, and Hitchcock obligingly complies, utilizing a dizzying myriad of symbols and reference points. In the original script, Bergman's Alicia is something of a whore: the filmmakers were forced by the censors to tone this aspect down, thereby bringing Alicia's dependence on booze to the forefront. Indeed, Bergman spends much of her screen-time woozy-headed, whether from alcohol or poisonous coffee (symbolically functioning as the same thing). Very early in the film, she declares at a party, "The important drinking hasn't started yet!" Exactly. Throughout the movie, Bergman drinks in order to escape her unpleasant circumstances or to wash away bouts of low self-esteem. A bottle of champagne bought by Grant becomes a phallic symbol: he forgets it at the offices of the OSS, with arid results when he arrives home to Bergman. Wine bottles are literally the "key" to the plot. Spilled wine in a sink blows her cover. And late in the proceedings, the simple physical act of drinking -- coffee, yes, but the point comes across -- almost kills her.There's much more going on here -- too much for a short review, really. Let's finish by asserting that Hitchcock's Forties period was every bit as cinematic as his later, grander, colorized period in the Fifties and Sixties. The slowly swooping shot from the crane, starting from high atop the ceiling of a ballroom and ending up focused on the wine cellar key in Bergman's hand, is merely one famous bravura moment. There are many others:Grant approaching a hungover Bergman in bed, in which the camera takes her up-ended POV quite literally; Bergman, overcome with poison, hallucinating the figures of Rains and his mother into monstrous shadows that grow larger and larger, eventually merging into one darkness; the two great tracking shots of Grant and Bergman kissing in her Rio apartment and later when Grant rescues her from her poison bed. The trailers for *Notorious* were already calling Hitchcock the "Master of Suspense" . . . it's easy to see why.As for the performances? Cary Grant proves to be a true soldier, spending much of his screen-time either expressionless or with his back turned to the camera (!), unselfishly giving the film to Bergman, even though his part is actually the more interesting one. Bergman, meanwhile, gives one of the best performances of her illustrious career. No two Bergman roles are quite the same; Hitchcock wisely allows her to do some of her own interpretation, particularly early on during the "character-building" scenes (before the plot moves all the characters into their appointed places on the chessboard). Perhaps best of all, both Grant and Bergman were at the very peak of the physical charms: the movie is some serious eye-candy for both genders. 9 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Notorious" is, of Hitchcock's "earlier" films, certainly the most durable and endlessly fascinating. Not, God knows, for its "brilliant" shots -- including the famous tracking shot from the foyer ceiling down to the key in Ingrid Bergman's hand.But for the frank eroticism Hitchcock establishes from the opening party sequence on, and Bergman's breathtakingly uninhibited playing against her "virginal" type."Notorious" is riddled with bad, jerky rear-projection sequences. The first is Bergman's drunken drive along the Florida highway before the policeman stops her.Then, every sequence where she and Cary Grant meet in the park in Rio. Sitting on that bench while the entire world "jerks" behind them.Pitiful.Do we care? Hell, no.Ingrid Bergman was never so starkly sensual and frank on screen, as she is as "Alicia." And Cary Grant, as agent Devlin, was perfectly directed to play cold and largely unresponsive to Bergman's unrestrained and ultimately heartbreaking heat.Grant is given subtle moments early on, to show his falling in love with Bergman. The brief glance he gives her as she leans across his lap in the plane descending into Rio, before Hitchcock quickly fades it out, is almost pornographic (for the era).Their repartee is so fraught with sexual tension and mutual challenge as to be unparalleled in cinema up till that time -- and perhaps even since.Bergman, so powerful an actress, is utterly vulnerable and natural in the early sequences -- emerging from her father's trial with her usual Bergmanesque stoicism, only to instantly become surprisingly, drunkenly, girlish and accessible and dangerous in the next sequence -- brushing windblown hair from her lips as she drives -- viciously fighting off Devlin when she realizes Devlin's an agent -- awakening to a hangover so realistic you can almost smell her breath steaming off the screen -- finally agreeing, out of patriotism, to help the "cause." The range of Bergman's performance, from drunken party girl desperate to escape her background, to duplicitous double-agent portraying "Madame" Sebastian in elegant surroundings, to helplessly, hopelessly lovesick Alicia finally in love with an unresponsive American agent (Grant) -- to an imprisoned woman dying of poisoning -- Bergman is simply brilliant.She was never more sensually presented on screen.Nor was Cary Grant. One does not expect emotional displays or outbursts from a government agent.Grant's / Devlin's professional reluctance to admit, much less act on, his feelings for Bergman's Alicia is evident from frame one. His self-control as an actor and as a man was never better realized. At any moment, he could sexually assault Alicia -- whether out of rage or love is never clear, until the final, tender, moments of the film.By the time Alicia and Devlin reach the infamous two-plus minutes on-off kissing scene in Alicia's Rio apartment, viewers of both sexes are watering at the mouth, wanting them to devour each other.That they don't adds another layer of suspense to what ultimately becomes almost unbearable tension after Alicia weds Sebastian and moves in with him, his mother, and the other Nazis.This is an amazingly daring film in terms of female sexuality, for its day or ours. Hitchcock asks us, as he asks Devlin, to sympathize with -- and love -- a woman who not only sleeps around just as men do, but who is willing to sleep around under false pretenses for the good of her adopted country. If that's a stretch for audiences now, consider what it was for audiences in the late 40s.Is there another "heroine" in cinema history who blatantly sleeps with a man she despises in order to win the love (and successfully) of another man whom she adores?Name one. Not "Mata Hari," who, no matter that she was played by Garbo, had anywhere near the emotional/political/moral complexity of Alicia.We still have to contend with those cheeseball rear-projection sequences. But Bergman and Grant play them so beautifully that the shoddy rear-screen technological primitivism is immediately forgiven.And the secondary casting is so flawless that, in "Notorious'" final sequence, as Claude Rains is called back into the mansion and walks up those steps to his inevitable death, and the door closes while Bergman and Grant escape to a new life, our feelings are a mixture of triumph and pity.Truly, one of Hitchcock's most complex, sexually challenging, political, adult, ambiguous and disturbing films.Forget the cheeseball rear-projections, please."Notorious" is several glasses -- perhaps too many -- of vintage cinematic champagne.Good grief!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Genius And His Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock introduces his stars with a cinematic blow that makes the opening of this dark, scrumptious thriller a monumental treat. He uses their star personalities and turns them round to dislocate us, teasing us with his unmistakable touch. The absurdity of the plot becomes totally plausible and the suspense is not merely unbearable but thrillingly entertaining. All of Hitchcock's favorite emotional and visual toys are present here. The icy blond, the sexual tension, the weakling villain with a castrating mother. A legendary kiss and a happy ending. Whenever I meet someone who hasn't seen any Hitchcock movies - and there are people in this world, believe it or not, who hasn't - I show them Notorious and always without fail, they are hooked forever. Just the way I was, I am and, I suspect, will always be. Cary Grant is allowed a dark unsmiling romantic hero and Ingrid Bergman lowers her strength to become a woman in love and in jeopardy but unwilling to appear as a victim. This gem of a film can be seen again and again without ever becoming tired or obvious. I'm sure you guessed it by now, this is one of my favorite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a young woman, back in the "olden days" days before video, DVD and TCM, I was always fascinated by this film, though it came and went on more obscure T.V. channels, with no clue of when it would return. Notorious has everything...inimitable Hitchcock moments, mystery, suspense, personal drama, high romance, passion, great character development, international espionage, nuanced acting, a visually stunning foreign locale, post-war period mystique, patriotism, fine supporting cast, a charmingly evil Claude Rains, a most sinister Mme. Konstantin, Grant at his most enigmatic and romantic, and Bergman her most alluring and luminous. As in all great films, it is a spot-on rendering of its own unique story in the ambiance of its own time, but timeless in its portrayal of human character and emotion. Like a handful of others, it is as satisfying a movie experience now as it was 40 years ago...probably more so...whether on first viewing or 40th.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grant + Bergman + Hitchcock = Chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Alfred Hitchcock's 1946 film, `Notorious', Cary Grant plays T.R. Devlin, an American agent who employs the assistance of Alicia Huberman, (Ingrid Bergman) a German expatriate whose father has just been convicted as a German spy. Devlin brings Alicia to Brazil in hopes to arrange a meeting with Alex Sebastian (the fantastic Claude Rains); another German spy who just happens to have a history with Alicia insofar that he was in love with her. The plan is to get them together so that she can spy on Sebastian and his colleagues so that the Americans can get a leg up on their mutual espionage. Of course, love develops between Devlin and Alicia, which complicates their operation and of course, their lives. `Notorious', despite adhering to the chaste Hayes Code of the time has some of the steamiest scenes between two actors that I can recall during that era. While the scenes never get beyond the standard close-ups of their kisses, the chemistry is a heavy physical presence. The acting in `Notorious' is top-notch; Grant and Bergman were at their best during this era. Claude Rains, who is a personal favorite of mine, is absolutely fabulous in this film. He gives his character, who should be hateful, a humanistic quality that makes him an even more complicated figure. Screenwriter Ben Hecht and Hitchcock team up for some pretty intense moments in `Notorious', and compliment each others styles and talents wonderfully. There are not many nail-biting moments in `Notorious', but the script is excellent. Coupled with the superior acting and direction, `Notorious' is certainly a Hitchcock film that should not be missed. --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, No, Notorious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do some of these "reviewers" come from? Calling Notorious and Alfred Hitchcock boring and outdated is the height of arrogance. Where are the obvious fake sets, that the oh great one, "TedG" is referring to? The mansion? Alicia's Rio apartment? I guess I'm just not in the same league as they are because I can watch a movie and be entertained by it. Personally, Notorious (in my uneducated opinion) is perhaps Hitchcock's most tightly knitted story-ever. There is no unnecessary scene, no irrelevant dialog, no padding or fluff. Outstanding acting abounds, intricate camera movements, (the reflection in Alicia's binoculars at the race track, the long camera shot starting at the top of the stairs slowly narrowing in and coming to rest on the key Alicia has secured in her hand, the fragmented images as Alicia realizes she is being poisoned)angles and shadows carry you along effortlessly.Bergman, Grant, and Rains, along with a superb supporting cast bring to the screen the ultimate stylish spy vs. spy yarn. Suspense is slowly built up, and then released throughout; Devlin and Alicia snooping in the wine cellar as the sommelier realizes they need more wine for the party, Devlin finding Alicia confined to her room, and trying to rouse her so he can get her away from the evil in the house are but two examples of the suspense that build to the climax of the film. In a day when we get the likes of Catwoman, American Pie II and Meet The Parents, I'll take the boring and outdated Notorious any day of the week. I'm crazy that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Hitchcock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is the daughter of a German-American who has been imprisoned for turning traitor to the U.S. during World War II. Despondent, she becomes an alcoholic and flits from man to man, until one day a mysterious government agent named Devlin (Cary Grant) comes to her and asks for her help. Some old Nazi acquaintances of her father's has taken up residence in Rio de Janeiro; he needs her help to spy on them. Somewhat reluctantly, Alicia agrees.Once in Rio, it takes some time for the couple to be assigned their mission. The trip takes on the character of a honeymoon, and Alicia and Devlin start falling in love. Then their orders do arrive, and Alicia is assigned to infiltrate the house and the bedroom of the Nazi leader, Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains).This movie delivers a very different kind of suspense from Hitchcock's more famous NORTH BY NORTHWEST. There are no strafing runs by malevolent crop-dusters, no cliff-hanging mountain-climbing scenes, no mad footraces. The suspense here relies all on subtleties that get under your skin and chill you much more than the in-your-face antics of Hitchcock's later piece. The popping of champagne corks signals time running out for two spies in the wine cellar; an impassioned lover seeks to kiss the hand of his lady who has a deadly secret concealed in her palm; a victim of poison sees the shadows of the poisoners merge together on the wall. The final scene is the best of all. Who but Hitchcock could imbue the innocent sentence, "I wish to talk to you," with such chilling power?This is one of Ingrid Bergman's best performances; Alicia is hardly perfect, but brave and lovely. Hitchcock was far ahead of his time in discarding male chauvinist attitudes that elevated a woman's chastity and "ladylike" attributes over her courage and intelligence. When a superior disparages Alicia for the lack of "character" she has shown by following the orders he himself has given her, Devlin sarcastically lashes out: "She may be risking her life, but when it comes to being a *lady,* she doesn't hold a candle to your wife, sir, sitting in Washington playing bridge with three other ladies of great honor and virtue." Yet Devlin himself is often unsympathetic and harsh in his treatment of Alicia, and the unfairness of that treatment is sharply highlighted in a manner very sympathetic to her.Not to be overlooked is Rains' magnificent rendition of Alexander Sebastian, a villainous but human and rather weak man who genuinely loves Alicia. I have never seen Rains better except for his immortal portrayal of Cap. Renault in CASABLANCA. Also superb is Leopoldine Konstantin as Sebastian's domineering, scheming mother.NOTORIOUS is intense and meticulously crafted, and benefits from the best acting in any Hitchcock movie. While NORTH BY NORTHWEST or THE 39 STEPS might be a better introduction to Hitchcock for people used to the slam-bang action of modern cinema, NOTORIOUS is the best I can recommend for those who have already learned to love Hitchcock's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is absolutely one of Hitchcock's best films. The suspense sneaks up on you, and I found myself on the edge of my seat. Cary Grant is in love with Ingrid Bergman, (but who wouldn't be) caught in a triangle of love, deceit and lies. They both shine as the super stars they are in this meticulously filmed masterpiece. Hitchcock's hand is all over this film. And as is usual for the master, he never misses a beat, never puts in a sloppy scene, and sees it all in his mind's eye (and on paper) before committing it to film. This is why he is The Master of his craft. Bergman is at her lovely best, that sometimes smiling, sometimes pouty mouth, that cute nose, and those stupendously beautiful eyes. This film, which I've just seen for the first time (why, oh why, did I wait so long?) is up there, near the top, I have to see it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman and Grants chemistry goes unsurpassed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bergman and Grant are the true romantics of cinema. They move throughout the film as if they were acting naturally toward one another. Hitchcock puts them both in closeups especially the illuminating Bergman, capturing the power of the medium.When Bergman says "Oh, you love me-you love me" in that wonderful close up I have to think to myself, how much I look forward to becoming a film maker. Why can't Hollywood capture moments like these in today's features?Note how long the kiss lasts as Bergman and Grant move from the balcony to the living room. The lighting and camera positioning are phenomenal. Do not expect the typical Hitchcock here but then again it is hard to say what a typical Hitchcock is. Each of his films contain so many different elements yet, at the same time possess the true signature of an auteur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's most thrilling examinations of psychosexual ambiguity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's most thrilling examinations of psychosexual ambiguity, with the Grant-Bergman relationship veering from an initial meet-cute to genuine (beautifully conveyed) mutual delight to sadistic manipulation - he makes a whore of her and forces the fact again and again into her face, seldom giving an inch until the very end, where his change of heart has a largely tacked on feeling. We first see him from behind, quietly, predatorily watching at one of her drunken parties; they go for a drive and we see his hand poised to grab the wheel even as he pretends to submit himself to her drunken control over the car - it sets the tone, for Grant never relents on his desire to possess her, and reacts all too like a spurned lover to events, belittling her love even as she continually reasserts it; the callousness with which he distances himself from her after learning of her assignment is breathtaking. The main plot can hardly match the complexity of the central relationship, even though it's an excellently constructed yarn, with the fine set pieces of the party and the ultimate escape, which is essentially a battle between Rains and Grant for possession of the weakened Bergman - a finale which emphasizes how she's always been a prisoner, of her father's myth, of the male system, of her own emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Hitchcock movies, and was expecting Notorious to be in the same genre as North by Northwest and Charade---and I was initially disappointed. However, I watched it again and fell in love with this movie!The plot, if you take the time to think about it, is amazing. Also, it's pretty risqué--everything about it. Bergman is absolutely superb--as is Cary Grant. Ingrid Bergman should have won an Oscar for her performance. Every line is classic and I've ended up seeing the movie three or five times. However, if you're up for a thrilling movie at home w/friends or at a party, this wouldn't be the one. I wouldn't say this is the type of movie for a romantic date either...it's in its own category where you just have to watch it with true classic film fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second viewing of this great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nostalgic revisit for me. Unlike many of our other young posters in our community, I didn't grow up with a strong background in the classics. Notorious was the first Hollywood classic from the studio era that I went out and rented. I had seen several others, but they were either Disney movies, The Wizard of Oz, or forced upon me in my first film class (e.g., Stagecoach, which I despised for years!). Notorious wasn't even my first Hitchcock movie; that was The 39 Steps, which I also didn't care for. But Notorious was suggested to me by a good friend, so I went to the video store, went to the classics section for the first time, and picked it up. It isn't responsible for the path I took afterwards (I would probably give that credit to Citizen Kane), but I remember liking it. This was the summer after my Freshman year in college, in 1998. It's amazing how much I've learned in the five years since I saw it first. I liked it quite a bit, but it certainly wasn't one of my favorites. This was the summer I discovered the American cinema after the studios collapsed, movies such as The Godfather and 2001, so Notorious seemed a little dated to my uneducated eyes. I remembered a couple of the more showy scenes, like the one where Ingrid Bergman realizes why she's sick. I especially remembered the entire final scene. But I was unprepared for the subtlety.On this second viewing, I was shocked at just how intimate Hitchcock's direction is in Notorious ? it's easily one of his very best works as a director. He utilizes close-ups to an almost uncomfortable degree. At first, I thought that Grant's and Bergman's love affair felt kind of forced, but that scene where they make out for two minutes straight pretty much sold it for me! Notorious was first suggested to me as an example of screen eroticism, and I would have been far too unrefined to feel that power five years ago. I do still have a couple of problems with the film, but they're minor. Well, they're worth mentioning, anyway. I don't really like Cary Grant in the film. He's good, but he's not at the level of the rest of the film. I really think he's best suited for comedy; he has such a gift for comic timing. He has problems shifting between the passion he has for Bergman and the anger he has for what she's doing. I'd love to see what other actors could have done with that (Montgomery Clift comes to mind, for some reason, although he was still a couple of years away). I also feel that Devlin's anger with Alicia (talking strictly about the characters now, not the the actors) is maybe a little exaggerated. I realize that this is 1946, but I might imagine that spies and secret agents would not be so offended at this sort of thing. This is, of course, the main conflict of the film, so I guess I just have to accept it as the premise.As for the other actors, they are uniformly brilliant. Ingrid Bergman gives one of her best performances. Claude Rains is brilliant as the villain. He's one of those Hitchcock antagonists whom I shouldn't care for, but, for some reason, I really feel sorry for him. He's so pathetic. The sequence where he discovers who his new wife is is quite heartbreaking, really (although I think that the musical score, which is generally excellent, goes overboard on the sting when he discovers the broken wine bottle). Perhaps another thing I hold against Grant and Devlin is that final, cruel moment when he locks the car door on Rains. I know he's a Nazi, but it's hard not to feel sorry for him at that point. I also love, just love, Leopoldine Konstantin's performance as Rains' mother. She is simply frightening. Reinhold Schünzel is also rather intimidating as the scarred Dr. Anderson. I love the suspicious look he gives Rains as Grant leads Bergman down the stairs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very flimsy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this about 4 times and I return to it occasionally hoping to see the merit people find in it. I never do. You can see that this movie would have been useful in establishing Hitchcock, but that moment is quite over. He surpassed it (technically and artistically) quickly after with his own work. It's value is only in context. It's not good Hitchcock by my standard. It has one daring idea for the time; that a tramp may show greater nobility and heroism than the off-screen prim and proper 1950's housewife that is mentioned; and one interesting performance; a German mother more threatening than the harmless, effete villain.Unfortunately Hitch is more interested in the technical aspects of Notorious, and then only in places, making it a weird, lopsided production. It's chilly, and many scenes are crappy genre clichés. It's technically "on" but emotionally off. I never feel a thing watching this. It's an academic exercise.If the apparent level of a movie is so disappointing, why would a viewer be interested in learning more about its symbolic or semiotic level? Which, by the way none of these reviews even touch.TECHNIQUE: All the major scenes are showy but hollow.The classic camera shot zooming in from an overhead full-room shot to Alicia's hand holding a key embodies the problems here. It's pointless. The plot has set up the moment. We've SEEN her steal the key, and we know she's handing it off to Devlin at the party. The shot is vapid because it adds nothing but conspicuous technique to the moment. The shot is pivotal but it changes nothing. After it we know exactly what we knew before; that's not mature Hitchcock. What does it mean when he makes such a laborious, self-conscious shot, but the rest of the movie is so hideously fake? The rear-screen projections are fatal here: whether it's a park bench, a courthouse, a café, or all of Rio, the movie is about one yard deep. I can't believe people love a movie with such phony methods of getting imagery into a camera.Worst of all is the convention of the actors betraying necessarily clandestine reactions on their faces for the benefit of the audience; looks that would give them away over and over again. The acting here is all about making faces. Forget body language or something subtler.Cary Grant plays a petulant, vindictive ass. It's a miracle we won the war with unprofessional jackasses like this working for us. After one drunk date he's a snotty lover? I have now seen all the Grant/Hitchcock movies (after seeing Suspicion yesterday) and I dislike each one for different reasons.HOLES: Over and over again Hitchcock chooses the dumb &amp; cinematic over internal logic or common sense. It's as if he assumes the audience left their brains at home.Why such tension developed over handing off the key to Devlin upstairs at the party, when Alicia arranges to be at the wine cellar door WITH HIM when he opens it? This is the films major setpiece and it makes absolutely no sense. Why is neither Devlin or Alicia concerned with devising a way to get the key back on Sebastians ring? Because Hitch needs that tension-building wine cellar sequence more than he cares to fit it convincingly into a romance or a spy plot. Why can't Devlin piece her fate together, after say ten seconds of thought, where he realizes neither he nor she gave a damn about being detected after the fact? Because he's the worst agent ever scripted in a Hollywood movie. This isn't rocket science.Devlin and Alicia meet 4 or 5 times in public to hand information off. They meet at a racetrack, or on a park bench talking out the sides of their mouths, so as to avoid discovery. But what would anyone need to 'discover' about their conversation if they were seen together? Just being seen together would betray them. Sebastian knows Devlin is an agent from the start and has figured out that the two are in love. What's the point of sitting an extra foot apart on a bench pretending to have idle chatter? Two people in their situation would never choose to meet in public.When I read fawning reviews of this movie, it makes me sorry Hitchcock used such constant motifs across his career; because shallow fans can watch engaging nothing but a checklist of elements: *the directors appearance, *a technical trick, *a stairway, *a camera gimmick, *a domineering mother, *a character falling to their death, *an icy blonde, etc. They can't wait to declare it a masterpiece and congratulate themselves. But they couldn't tell you why this is important or discuss it's ideas for ten seconds because they lack any criteria that would tell them when those elements construct a shallow movie. In Hitchcock's great movies that checklist is supported by convincing psychology, a bit of humor and satisfying depth that yields layers of meaning. Not so here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously Lifeless Hitchcock B-Movie Redeems Itself In The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today is the third time I've sat down to rewatch Notorious the past few years, and I was determined that this time I would get through it. I am a HUGE Hitchcock fan, and have seen all but three or four of his 40+ sound-era films, most multiple times, and have a particularly soft spot for some of the less celebrated films like Secret Agent, Sabotage, Saboteur and The Trouble With Harry.'Notorious', though, has always been a puzzle to me - it's one of his most highly esteemed films, up there with The 39 Steps, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Psycho, Vertigo and The Birds, yet it seems to have none of the inventiveness, wit, magic and charm that all these others overflow with, well at least to start with. Where are the great lines of dialogue in 'Notorious'? Where is the great theme music? The unforgettable bit parts and fantastic plot twists? Where is the suspense? For the first hour Notorious has none of these, and apart from the celebrated crane shot (even that a pale imitation of the earlier, better one in Young And Innocent), there are few truly memorable set pieces, whereas all Hitch's best films have at least a half a dozen apiece.The acting, too, is below par, with the leads both stiff and uncomfortable and struggling to find anything to do with their parts. Cary Grant in particular is playing entirely against type, playing a cold, distant and unsmiling government agent with zero charm or interest. In essence, what this means is we get a Cary Grant film without Cary Grant in it. Which is not good, obviously, and it makes me wonder why on earth Hitch chose him for this role when there were a hundred hard-boiled character actors that could have done the job much better - and a lot cheaper - and perhaps found some corners of the character to draw out and illuminate. As it is, for the first hour Grant brings nothing of any value to the role, and one can only assume it was his box-office draw potential that influenced this strange miscasting. Oddly enough the only other film I've seen where Grant is so badly used is yet another Hitchcock misfire: 'Suspicion'.Bergman is solid enough, and continually improves as the film goes on, but it is Claude Rains who really gives the best performance in Notorious. He hasn't much to do either, but at least he invests what he does get to do with some genuine feeling. He's not really much of a bad guy (another flaw of the film), just a man having his heart played with and broken by a woman he loves. The nicest twist of the film is that his mother is far more diabolical than he is.In essence, the problem of Notorious is this: the first hour drags abysmally, and is just as limp and lifeless a film as Hitchcock ever allowed his name to go out on. If it wasn't for the names involved, it's doubtful anyone would find any of what goes on there to be worth any attention whatsoever. But after that it picks up astoundingly, with the bit about the key and the wine cellar finally ushering in some much-needed suspense, and it becomes a recognizably Hitchcockian film at last. The acting all round improves and deepens, the tension mounts and Grant's sex appeal returns. But by then the damage is done, considerably more than half the film is over and you only get to see the good bits if you've stayed awake that long. Maybe the people who rate it so highly only remember the last half hour.In the end, for the most part this is just another of those odd-fitting films Hitchcock made for Selznick when he first came to Hollywood. It has all the big names and all the money in the world to make and promote it, but little sparkle or imagination. Well, until the end, anyway: it crosses the finish line in style. But is that enough to save it? Does that make it a great film? I'm not so sure it is. Bt then, as Voltaire so perceptively once said: "Fools admire everything in an artist of reputation".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance -- Hitchcock style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark, cruel, beautifully photographed, and deeply erotic, Notorious in one of Hitchcock's very best. It's remarkably sexual and sophisticated story from a time in Hollywood where the power of the Breen Office was at its apex. Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is the daughter of a convicted Nazi. American agent Devlin (Cary Grant) contacts her and convinces her to spy against some of her father's Nazi colleagues in Brazil. The chief of these of Alex Sebastian (Claude Rains), one of the most genial Nazis depicted on the silver screen, who has a crush on Alicia. Of course, Alicia has fallen madly in love with Devlin, and he with her, though he could never admit it, and instead pushes her to seduce Sebastian to obtain his secrets. He wants her for the mission when she accept, he brands her a whore. Only a whore would sleep with a man for his secrets, right? Hitchcock gathers some of Hollywood's best and casts them against type. Ingrid Bergman, who hitherto had played a fair number of virginal ingénues, plays Alicia Huberman, a powerfully sensual woman but also a drunken nymphomaniac. You get the sense that she can merely stroke Devlin's cold, frozen face and bring him magically to life. The great comic-acrobat-sophisticate Cary Grant is cast as the emotionally stunted and almost sadistic T.R. Devlin, a mysterious secret agent who recruits Alicia to work for the government. Cary Grant utilizes his inherent reticence to create a character who is isolated and closed off, who can lash out and act disinterested so easily toward the woman he loves. Claude Rains, with his rich English voice and amiable face plays Nazi Alex Sebastian, a rather nice fellow who happens be plotting against the United States. He is genuinely in love with Alicia and when he learns of her betrayal, his despair and terror is palpable and moving. Madame Constantin, imported especially by Hitchcock from Germany for this film is the brilliant and icy cold Madame Sebastian, Alex's powerful mother. In one particular scene she smokes a cigarette with a malice unequaled by any actress in Hollywood history. It's like she has it clasped in her talons. Louis Calhern is Devlin's boss, breezy, narrow minded, and casually misogynistic.Notorious is a very stylish production. Ingrid Bergman, who usually wore little makeup in her films, has a very natural sensuality and wears lovely 40s hats and suits very elegantly. Cary Grant is hitting his stride as the fashion icon he later became in the 50s. The suits are slimmer than they were in earlier roles and help emphasize Grant's lean and powerful, but graceful, physicality. Hitchcock's camera is characteristically authoritative, shaping the audience's impressions. It is very open to Bergman and very closed to Grant. Bergman is often shot in close ups and medium shots, and in flattering soft focus, and in accessible to the audience. Her heartrending luminosity, used so brilliantly in Casablanca is used again here by Hitchcock. Grant, on the other hand, is several times shot with his back to the camera, looking away from from the camera or with his face obscured by shadows. You suspect, but you never really KNOW what Devlin is feeling for the majority of the film. Grant is inscrutable and here is really demonstrating his economy --and brilliance-- as a performer. Sometimes he does seem a bit too stiff, especially since we know that he's capable of doing Dr. David Huxley and Editor-in-chief Walter Burns, but most actors wouldn't have dared to give such an understated performance as Grant does here.The world of Notorious is very insular. Most of the film, with the exception of the love scenes, is indoors. Any other scenes that find the characters outdoors find the characters closed off. Barricaded between objects or people. All this gives the film a claustrophobic feel, like Devlin and Alicia have no place to hide and no place to breathe. People said that Hitchcock disliked actors. I don't think that's true, but Hitchcock seems to have extraordinary control over the technical aspects of filming. In order scenes to work actors must explicitly follow direction; they are the tools of film-making. All this attention to detail is absolutely necessary considering the complex composition of many of his scenes. The reputed "Longest kiss in film history" where Devlin and Alicia embrace and talk and kiss for several is a very intricate piece of blocking as the characters move from one room to another, Devlin speaks on the phone, reach, turn etc... If Hitchcock worked like someone like Howard Hawks, for instance, this sort of scene wouldn't be possible.Since this is a Hitchcock film, people may be mislead into thinking that it's a thriller. It's not. It's really a perverse romance. The characters are more intricately drawn than they are in thrillers. Indeed, plot and character development seem to be equally important. The story does not move quickly but you don't really notice, you're too busy being immersed in Hitchcock's world. Thrilling, sexy, and moving, Notorious is highly recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's reputation as the Master of Suspense was built largely upon his ability to create suspense out of thin air. Now that he was completely settled into a stylistic method for making effective thrillers, it was time for a bit of showing off, building tension from the simplest of situations. Notorious is one of his purest pictures in that regard ? a plot you could condense onto the back of a postcard, but a tour-de-force of suspenseful technique.The screenplay is by Ben Hecht, a writer who fully understood Hitch's aims ? the two are very much in synch with the structure, pacing and presenting of the material. The first twenty minutes are incredibly fast paced, full of jump cuts and thirty-second scenes. We waste no time in establishing the romantic link between Grant and Bergman. The political background is briefly stated, but not dwelled upon, and to this end Hitchcock shoots the court scene in a distant point-of-view shot from outside the room, before sweeping the camera into the Bergman's attention-grabbing entrance. This is not a film about motives ? it's a film about consequences.After this, once Bergman is assigned to her spying mission and the "game" as it were begins, there is a shift in pace. From now on Hecht and Hitchcock's aim is to place us inside the experiences of our two leads ? with a slightly different angle for each. With Grant, the focus is upon his pain and bitterness at having to give up Bergman to Claude Rains. So, when Bergman and Rains first meet in the horse-riding scene, we do not see what dialogue passes between them ? instead we are shown Grant's point of view, and his distressed reaction.With Bergman however the focus is upon her fear and vulnerability as she carries out her work. As opposed to the snappiness of the opening, many of Bergman's scenes unfold in excruciating real-time. Hitchcock's camera technique emphasises the sense of danger, making the nazi stooges appear more menacing by having them fill the frame. Another very effective trick used in the party sequence is to cut between close-ups of Bergman to point-of-view shots that show off the vastness of the rooms, which make us feel her disconcertedness.The slow and deliberate pace of the main part of Notorious also allows for the effective staging of several suspense set-pieces. The simplest of scenes, the simplest of acts are drawn out to breaking point, cut up into numerous shots and carefully timed to turn them into heart-thumpers. The ultimate example of this is of course the final scene. You can also see when looking at scenes like the business with the key or the wine bottle why Hitchcock disliked last-minute twists ? the suspense wouldn't work if the audience weren't aware of the actions and knowledge of all the characters.We have here one of the most stellar casts Hitchcock had ever bagged, with both Grant and Bergman at the height of their popularity. Both are in quite demanding parts, as characters who have to stifle their emotions and play a role within the role. Unfortunately Hitchcock was no master when it came to motivating his cast, and while the leads are good they are not outstanding. Claude Rains too has a complex part, as a man who has to come to terms with his own gargantuan mistake, and it was his steady, deep performance that got the Oscar nomination.In the end though, it is Hitchcock's utter devotion to suspense over substance that is the Achilles heel of Notorious. The purely functional screenplay is lacking in humour and sparkling dialogue, the romance lacks chemistry and the characters lack motivation. It is undoubtedly one of his most carefully crafted thrillers, but it is ultimately a slightly hollow experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman/Hitchcock collaboration ensures lasting success of Notorious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. Like so many of his later features it is saddled with a highly suspect plot that is driven by a set of poor decisions made by a handful of characters of such alarmingly low emotional intelligence it is a miracle they survive the first half of the film at all, yet it works. It keeps company with the likes of Strangers On A Train, Psycho, Rear Window, The Thirty-Nine Steps, North by North-West, The Lady Vanishes: it is a classic. It is tempting to put it all down to Ingrid Bergman's portrayal of Alicia Hubberman - which is faultless - but Bergman alone could not have made Notorious what it is: she also starred in Spellbound and Under Capricorn and was unable to save either of those films from limping into mediocrity. It is also appealing to suggest the obvious: that it is the combination of breathtaking cinematography, flawless supporting cast and Ben Hecht's cracking script that make it so good. But I believe that the primary reason Notorious excels is because of the abiding friendship, professional respect and unrequited love that existed between Alfred Hitchcock and Ingrid Bergman as they stepped up to make the film. The archetypal &gt; themes that comprised their professional partnership inspired, amongst other things, Hitchcock's/Hecht's Alicia - a woman in a barren marriage desperate for love - and all those tender beautifully lit close-ups. It also allowed Bergman - and here a precedent was broken - to contribute, and to act upon, her insights as to the motivations and behavior of her character.Hitchcock didn't suffer the opinions of his actors lightly, yetwhere Notorious was concerned, he made an exception. For the duration of the shooting of the film, Bergman was Hitchcock's closest collaborator. I have a strong sense that the very thing that could have made Notorious lame - Hitchcock's unrequited love for Bergman - is also the very thing that saved it from obscurity and that we may have much - we will never how much - for which to thank Bergman.There are many moments that make Notorious Bergman's picture, but I think the most extraordinary is the kiss outside the wine cellar. In all her films, Bergman always brought a vulnerability to her love scenes that imbued them with a real sense of intimacy, and Notorious is no exception: think of her in the infamous balcony scene or during her final descent down the staircase. Yet when Dev - ever the mercenary genius of improvisation - makes full use of Rains' approach and, pulling Alicia to him as they stand outside the wine cellar, orders her to kiss him, Bergman actually surpasses her own track record.Suddenly in the arms of the man she really loves she is overcome with emotion; and for one second, maybe two, she separates her mouth from his, and in an attempt to give voice to the indescribable and to forge, experience and register a moment of pure intimacy, she utters one word, his name, 'Dev!' and all hell breaks loose. Never in the history of cinema has one word carried such an erotic charge. They could not be closer. He doesn't flinch. They barely move, but it is all there. And it's not just her voice, it is also her eyebrows. Just as she utters his name, Bergman furrows them. They tremble. They, along with her tremulous whisper, betray her true feelings, so that within the space of two seconds we witness Bergman experience both the heightened rush of intense sexual desire as well as the instantaneous relief afforded her by the act of surrender to it.All this with one word - 'Dev' - and the furrowing of a pair of eyebrows. So much emotion conveyed with so little and in such a brief period of time.It is because of moments like these that Notorious is timeless - the film gets under your skin and into your psyche - and given the history of the film and her beautiful performance at the center of it, it is fitting that it should be Bergman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is on my short list of movies that I can watch anytime, anyplace, no matter how recently I have seen it. It never grows old. Many people have described the plot and cinematography but I'd like to give a more personal view of the film. Why do I find it so endlessly enjoyable? Here are a few good reasons: 1) Ingrid Bergman has never looked more beautiful. Perhaps no actress has ever looked as beautiful, alluring, vulnerable and sad as Bergman in this film. From her bare midriff in the opening scenes to her marvelous riding outfit when she meets Sebastian I cannot take my eyes off her.2)Notorious has one of the most adult scripts in the history of the movies. I'm not talking about plot -- but just *listen* to the dialog! Devlin and Alicia don't just spar or joust -- they verbally rip at each other with a venom that only wild passion can explain. If you listen to all the dialog it can be quite uncomfortable -- there is no lighthearted banter between them. It's open sexual warfare -- "right below the belt every time" as Alicia so accurately observes. The dialog is about sex in language so bald that I can hardly believe it survived the censors. And not a dainty, pretty sex, but raw, intense, wounding, needful, adult sexuality that almost never gets explored in mainstream movies. That Hitchcock did it in 1946 is nothing short of astonishing. Ben Hecht gave Notorious one of the great screenplays in the movies -- perhaps only Chinatown can compare to it.3) Cary Grant &amp; Claude Rains. I love their competition for Alicia and the way that Hitchcock and Hecht have inverted their roles. As Devlin, Grant is cruel, cold and repressed in his dealings with Alicia. He is her lover but he can hardly reconcile his love for Alicia with his fear of losing her or with his own self-loathing. Sebastian, as played by Rains is a perfect gentleman. We never doubt that Sebastian, the Nazi, deeply and truly loves Alicia. He is tender and caring with her in ways that we can't really imagine Devlin ever being. Their love triangle is endlessly fascinating to watch.4)Perfect form. Hitchcock was a master stylist and he was at the top of his game in Notorious. The movie is like a elegant, formal dance. To complain about realism in a movie like this is totally beside the point. It's all artifice and all art. No scenes wasted, no scenes that are designed to shock. Everything locks together in perfect symmetry.I have sat through Notorious with many people who simply don't get it. I feel sorry for them. This is one of great experiences that the movies can offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece from Master of Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much tension in this film. Not just the culminating scene. There is the basic distrust that weaves its way through the psyches of the characters. We know from the beginning that the consequences of the characters' actions are of global importance. Something must be done, but critical actions in the past (the "notorious" element) put everything up a notch. We have the developing relationship between Bergman (whom I think has no peer for softness and sensuality on screen) and Grant. We have the wonderful Claude Rains, who in many respects is a nice fellow, except for his traitorous, dangerous persona. We Americans don't always tolerate spies and snitches, even though we would all be dead without them. I agree that some of the visual nature of the film is tacky. Hithccock sometimes went with the story line and didn't go for total visual verisimilitude. I've never like scenes in the front seat of a car. What is happening behind the characters always seems strained. But like we do in the theatre, we suspend our disbelief for a moment and ignore such things. See this for what it is. A great grouping of stars who lit up the screen, creating a tense, tight, watchable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary film of intrigue, tension and romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the Second World War (1939-1945), the father of "Alicia Huberman", a Nazi spy, convicted of treason against the United States. After the trial, "Alicia" gives a party in which appears a handsome stranger named "Devlin" (Gary Grant), an agent of the intelligence services which calls for collaboration to catch "Alexander Sebastian" (Claude Rains), the head of the Nazis in Brazil. At first "Alice" is reluctant, but finally agrees, mainly because of the attraction is in love with American actor.The film is a tense thriller blending passionate romance,complex intrigue maintained throughout and a twisted and chillingly suspenseful ending.Here the ¨McGuffin is the uranium,for Hitch the McGuffin is a gimmick and isn't important in the writings,its origin is a Scottish name.Hitchcoch says in the famous interview with Truffaut(said to be his best film) that he along with the screenwriter(Ben Hetch) went to speak with famed nuclear scientific and later were pursued for FBI during months.The main characters are played by excellent actors and legendary classics. There is a special chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant, their romance begins quickly, with just two scenes, because what matters is not how fast but everything that happens later. They are wonderful in those sequences in which to be in public can not speak clearly, but their eyes say it all.The simplicity and subtlety of this film is mixed with a master in handling the camera and action at all times, with that memorable scene at the party where we see a long shot to be approaching until a foreground closed hand it in and we only know that it is the key.It is his masterpiece and time does not pass it. With an argument that in other hands would have been unlikely in theirs becomes an absorbing thriller and love and love is the tension between Grant and Bergman almost breathe.The sequences are masterful, as the party that is running out and drink bottles disappear as our concern is increasing reaching nearly lost her breath, or that majestic plane from the top down to the hand in which she hides the key.The resolution could not be better: the mythical scene down the stairs leading to the exit, which handles time Hitchcock masterfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Master Craftsmanship Carries Slow-Moving, Sometimes Uncomfortable Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not as exciting as many of Hitchcock's other movies, "Notorious" is as carefully crafted as anything he did. The story is somewhat slow, and at times is even uncomfortable, but it is held together by the director's masterful planning, along with some good writing and a high-profile cast.The plot concerns an espionage assignment, but the thrust of the movie is really much more about the persons involved, and about how they are affected by the job, than it is about the spy scenario itself. The American spies (Cary Grant &amp; Ingrid Bergman) both have deeply conflicting feelings about their mission, and the audience often feels their inner torment. The plot itself moves rather slowly most of the time, so that we can make sure to appreciate the ways that Grant and Bergman are torn between their feelings and their perceived duty. As their opponent in the spy game, Claude Rains may have turned in an even better performance than the two head-liners. His too is a complex character, who has some sympathetic qualities in spite of being the "bad guy". Thus, when moments of suspense arise, they are that much more effective for having been slowly built up, and combined with an awareness of the characters and their feelings.The writing in "Notorious" is very good, as is the directing, with every scene and practically every line having a purpose. Despite the deliberate pace of the movie, there is really nothing superfluous.The overall effect is not as much fun to watch as "North By Northwest" or "Psycho" or Hitchcock's other more fast-paced films. But "Notorious" is effective in a different way, and most Hitchcock fans should find it a worthwhile experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Iron Fist in a Velvet Glove</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Hitchcock fan to the max, and either like or love all of his films (I've seen everything that's in print and just bought a couple on DVD that weren't available until recently). I can talk for hours about the pluses and minuses of VERTIGO, PSYCHO, REAR WINDOW, ROPE, REBECCA, MARNIE, THE LODGER, THE 39 STEPS, both versions of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, you name it. But only two of his films approach perfection, in my eyes -- one of which is NOTORIOUS. NOTORIOUS is like black velvet glove covering a steel fist. The slow, fluid, subtle, constant interplay between Cary Grant and Claude Rains (as Devlin the lover and Alex the husband) and Ingrid Bergman (as Alicia, the object of both men's desires) is breathtaking in its complex simplicity yet terrifying in its blunt attitudes. For it's a love story about a woman being made into a whore to serve the US Government, and the two men who both love and hate her. The psychological depth of the characters is stunning. Devlin dutifully pushes Alicia to do something he finds repugnant, then when she does as he asks, uses her willingness to help him as proof of her unworthiness. Alicia tries to please Devlin and redeem herself by becoming the government's whore then realizes it's for nothing and slips into a depression that blinds her to her growing danger. Alex uses Alicia to supplant his mother in his life, all but blackmailing her into marrying him, then has to go back to mama for help when he realizes what has happened. These characters would be complex, even for today's films, let alone 1946. Not one word is wasted in this story. Not one image is wrongly imagined. Not one moment is without a dozen layers of meaning. And all lead up to making the simple act of a man discovered walking up the stairs into one of the most terrifying moments in cinema history. Not once when I've seen this film with an audience has that moment not elicited a scream from several people. All of it done without one gunshot, without one stabbing, with nothing more than the suggestion of violence that is always committed off screen (except for one moment at the beginning between Devlin and Alicia) That NOTORIOUS was all but ignored by the Oscars and other awards is next to criminal. See the movie once to enjoy it...then see it, again, to truly appreciate how perfectly it fits together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For my money, Hitch's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having neither the literary versimilitude of REBECCA or the roller-coaster thrills of NORTH BY NORTHWEST or even the heavily-Freudian psychobabble of VERTIGO, I think NOTORIOUS tends to get a little lost in the Hitchcock canon. It deserves better; in some of the most important ways, this is his best film.Reason number one: the characters. Cary Grant's Devlin, Ingrid Bergman's Alicia, Claude Rains' Sebastian, these are all among the deepest, most convincing characters to grace a Hitchcock movie. As questionable as each's motives may be, they are all utterly believable. Rains in particular is one of the more remarkable film "villians"; we almost feel sorry for him and his fate at the end.Reason number two: uncharacteristic restraint. I've always loved Hitch's techniques and innovations, but even his biggest fans have to admit that his inventiveness could be a tad distracting in some movies. NOTORIOUS isn't devoid of dazzling technique (that famous tracking shot to the key in Alicia's hand or the later, similar shot as Devlin takes Alicia from Sebastian's house), but here it seems to serve the story better.With its very human characters and confident technique, NOTORIOUS has come to be my very favorite film from a highly-favored director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Film - Notorious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notice what I said in my summary, THE perfect film. Not A perfect film, THE perfect film. How can you get any better than The Master, Alfred Hitchcock, and arguably two of the greatest actors of all time, Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman? The result is a chemistry that cannot be resisted by anyone, even the most hardest of critics. Bergman, and her gripping performance as a sad, confused, and war-torn soul looking for love is simply stunning. I have to admit, as great of a star as Ms. Bergman is, before Notorious, I had never seen her in a film before. I was blown away by Notorious. If Ms. Bergman's performance in this film does not suck you into this film, maybe Cary Grant's will. What can I say? Mr. Grant is, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors of film's history. His work in Hitchcock's Notorious is no exception. As great as Ms. Bergman and Mr. Grant are, we cannot forget, shall we say, the real star of this perfect film? Alfred Hitchock. Mr. Hitchcock and his camera are superb. The way he uses the lens to capture images that tell the story is an inspiration to every director as the way to use the visual medium of film. But his amazing direction does not stop with the camera. You can see his masterful work in every aspect of the film, through his actors, through the story, through the writing and dialog, and through his trademark suspense. What more can I say? If the combination of Bergman, Grant, and Hitchcock doesn't stir you enough to want to go and rent this movie as fast as you possibly can, then I don't know what to say! See it and be transfixed, thrilled, and amazed by the perfect film.</fullReview>

If i had been keeping keys in my pocket for long, the moment i touch my keys i would feel the difference between having 3 or 4 keys.

		<fullReview>This isn't Alfred Hitchcock at his most befuddling, even as you expect that the MacGuffins on display (or at least one of them) might arouse some suspicion as to where the plot will really be going. But like with the other grand, A-list movie of the year, The Big Sleep, Notorious has two things really going for it- an exquisite, amusing but also dark and nefarious way about it, and a near unbeatable combination of starring talents. Where Bogie and Bacall were on one side of the aisle, as the all-Americans directed by Hawks, Hitchcock had Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant on the other, yet it's still arguable to this day which pair takes the cake (I might go with the former, but there's probably a stronger actual romantic connection between Bergman and Grant as opposed to witty banter and panache). The plot goes around a Nazi plot, where secrets will have to be uncovered and lives put on the line.Many things still strike my memory- the opening scenes of Bergman's character getting drunk (oddly enough Grant, who's the not-too-oddly sober one in these scenes, would trade off this in North by Northwest). There's also amazing scenes in a fancy home, where Bergman and Grant share glances with each other from a staircase to the main level during a party. Hitchcock's able to get so much out of so little tension-wise, yet doesn't seem to ever lack giving the film as much a romantic vibe as even Casablanca, if not with a good shot of his usual wicked fun in doing a spy movie. Only here, with the stakes raised, the stars have to meet the challenge of making it more about behavior than exposition. As mentioned, I do have the feeling more than ever to see this one again, as it was the kind of classic 40s thriller- and by Hitchcock regrettably no less- that I watched late at night and, while it stuck with me, it didn't blow me away on first sight. But I want to be around these characters again, and with the chemistry and sort of appeal-by-proxy that only the likes of Grant and Bergman can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious Scheme, Glamorous Style, Illustrious Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been acclaimed as "the most elegant expression of the master's visual style," (Roger Ebert), "brilliant because of how simple it is," (Ted Prigge), Master of Suspense's ninth American film appears to be a picture of humanity and artistry's collaboration. Based on the 1921 John Taintor Foote's short story "The Song of the Dragon" and enumerated as one of the displays of the director's hallmarks, NOTORIOUS still leaves a viewer positively responsive to its spell and thrill.The reviewer Ted Prigge (1997) observes that "the strength of the movie is really in the characterization and writing." One can agree with this him when we highlight the marvelously clever script by Ben Hecht (Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay). Seldom do we find such absorbing moments where the precarious situations are so intensely resembled in the screenplay. The moral and emotional resonance of the story indeed lie in the flawless characterization and writing. But what truly shines throughout the movie are the skills of the director where all major aspects are imbued with style and vibrancy - something that has made the Master of Suspense one of the most renowned personalities of cinema. And this movie depicts that in fullness. No wonder many Hitchcock fans draw right parallels between NOTORIOUS and his greatest productions. "Simple story" made into "a gem" (Ted Prigge) with "the maximum effect from the minimum of elements" (Francois Truffaut) that absorbs its audience through the attention paid to single details to visuals and haunting camera-work that gets its climax with the close-ups of the objects, the 'non human' characters of the movie.A BOTTLE of champagne (with its prelude of explosion), a KEY (with its hold of entry into the hidden secret) and a GLASS (with the relief from reality or senses in jeopardy) constitute wonderful tools for the MacGuffin, Hitchcock's plot device which is not only mysteriously uncovered by both the characters and the viewers but also powerfully evokes the repression and hypocrisy of the super-villains of the time, the Nazis. From the precise opening at the beginning of the movie to the admirably powerful crescendo in the finale (which "remains stuck in memory for eternity" (Ted Prigge), the action supplies us with supreme thrill, visual experience, some good laugh and lots of thought provoking moments. The 'representative' (so to say) of these villains is a supporting character of Alex's mother who really has her methods to keep other people on a leash...Played memorably by noble Leopoldine Konstantin, she incarnates evil.However, the Hecht screenplay and the Hitchcock direction do not resort to mere 'who are a goodies' and 'who are the baddies' childish approach. They manifest themselves best in performances, in this case, an outstanding trio of Bergman/Grant/Rains who build a complex development of characters, even a case study (something much ahead of the mid 1940s), which symbolizes an exceptionally modern approach to personality in general. Let me consider these performances in more details.The fact that Charles Ramirez Berg refers to NOTORIOUS as the theme of "the feminine sacrifice-of-identity" is pretty much thanks to Ingrid Bergman. Within a variety of blonde beauties that Hitchcock selected for his thrilling stories, it is not the first time Ms Bergman was cast in the Hitchcock film (she had been cast one year before in SPELLBOUND), yet, her role in NOTORIOUS is rightly placed along the world acclaimed masterpiece CASABLANCA. Ingrid Bergman is truly convincing as Alicia, a spy who discovers the mysterious places at Rio mansion, who is saved from euphoric feelings, who falls victim (in part fortunately) within a devious conspiracy. Roger Ebert rightly points out that Ms Bergman "subtly combines the noble and the carnal." But, above all, she is an object of love. And her leading man/men?There are actually two men...and as, again, Roger Ebert observes ""both love her but the wrong man trusts her." What a revelatory difference, however, is marked between these men both in looks and personalities. The brooding Cary Grant, a "star everyone loved, a star no one knew" (Deborah Kerr) brings charm and mystery to the role of Devlin. Peter Viertel who met Cary Grant while NOTORIOUS was being filmed observes that Hitchcock saw something more in the actor, something more in his face, something far more than a leading man. With Bergman as his leading lady, they provide a memorable chemistry, particularly in the much appraised kiss scene still evoking curiosities of the hilarious censorship times. But the man who provides something truly thought provoking and constitutes an intriguing reinforcement of the duality within human nature is Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian. He is a man torn apart, a man caged within a true web of hypocrisy. He stresses the right conclusion of the content that both men love Alicia but one cannot be as lucky as the other. Leading to the final crescendo, he marks the final conclusion to the top notch performance for which he got the Best Supporting Actor. Being kept on a leash by his mother and the band that never gives up wishing to talk to him, Ted Prigge is right referring to Alex as "a semi-villain" a nearly victim who "has a heart and feelings."With the right note of Hitchcock's experience at Germany's Ufa, all this 'light and shadow' show-off plays a decisive role. Magnetic camera-work! Unforgettable visuals, for example at the discovery of Sebastian's mansion, so much shrouded by shadow of secrets and schemes. A sort of 'virtual' journey to the place that evokes certain mental and psychological placement. Another milestone moment is the rotating image, a haunting camera achievement that parallels with the heroine's delirious condition and changes in perspectives. Therefore, NOTORIOUS is a perfect movie with top notch performances, stylish direction, clever screenplay, stunning visuals, and the most magnetizing finale you can ever imagine. You wish to see it again and again and constantly find something new in this 10/10 masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion '40's thrillers are often being forgotten and underrated. Thrillers from the '40's always know to create a perfect tense atmosphere, which truly enriches the movie's its tension, making those movies often genuinely tense ones to watch. "Notorious" is one fine example of this '40's thriller making movie style.Alfred Hitchcock movies in general from the '40's and earlier, are often more or less forgotten ones, or at least not as good known as his later works. His '50's and '60's movies are much better known. A shame, since he truly already did some amazing things in the '30's and '40's, of which this movie of course a great example. Of course he also had some misses in his careers but this movie really hits the mark.What I first noticed when watching this movie, from pretty early on in the movie, is how incredibly similar the story and some sequences are to "Mission: Impossible II". Sounds strange, since "Mission: Impossible II" is by no means a great movie, or one that is being praised for its amazingly clever story. Yet "Notorious" follows a very similar plot line but yet it works out an infinite times better in this movie. I must say that this is probably due to the Hitchcock touch, that provides the movie with lots of style and flair as well as some incredibly well build up and executed sequences.The movie has some real classic thriller moments, such as a sequences involving champagne bottles (not going to spoil any more of it) and a great memorable ending.Like basically all '40's and older movies, the movie starts of rather slow and formulaic but once things really start to take off (from the moment on they land in Rio) the movie just grabs you by the throat with its story, characters, atmosphere and thriller moments.It's one fine looking movie with some real great camera-work. The movie uses a couple of really innovating shots and some incredibly good compositions, also often with a symbolic value for its story in it. The more times you'll see this movie, the more you'll notice.The movie is also really well cast, with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in the main leads. It was not the first collaborations between this director and actors and it also wouldn't be the last. But the man who perhaps plays the finest role in the movie is Claude Rains, as the movie its 'villain'.Seriously, spy-thrillers can't really get any better than this!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After her father is tried for being a German spy, Alicia is holding a party where a mysterious stranger keeps her company. After she's sent the others away and starts getting friendly with the stranger, he begins to reveal who he is... and he has a job for her.This movie is dazzling mostly for its very well-written characters. Each character has real personality, and the actors pull them all off with grace and subtlety that is amazing to behold. Most of this movie is really complimentary to other parts of the movie, and it's a real joy to see something so finely tuned and crisply presented.Furthermore, the various camera-work presents an interesting viewpoint, that of Alicia's perspective, which allows the audience to follow her empathetically and understand her confusion and anxiety in a very entertaining way. The ending will grip you, I promise.Why didn't I give it full stars? Well it's a little slower paced than most noir, and despite its quality some parts of it are just not as engaging. It's certainly very worth the time and I suggest seeing it, just make sure you have an attention span and maybe a cup of coffee beforehand.Otherwise, enjoy yourself and immerse in the brilliance.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a good example of how Alfred Hitchcock's films are generally way overrated. I say "generally," because of two of his - Psycho and Rear Window - are considered two of his best and are two of my all-time favorites. However, in the 1940s I thought he made a bunch of films that would put an insomniac asleep. This is Exhibit A for that.Cast-wise, it's difficult to imagine not liking a film with Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains and Louis Calhern....but this story is just agonizing in its slowness and incredibly stupid in its romance angle. It's hard to picture a better-looking couple than Grant and Bergman in the mid '40s but they can't overcome this tedious script and they don't quite cut it as believable spies. The "suspense" is nonexistent, too, and the plot is preposterous.Just because it's "Hitch" directing, it doesn't mean it's automatically good, especially in the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best known films, and probably his best from the 40s. Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is the German-American daughter of John Huberman (Fred Nurney), a Nazi who has been recently imprisoned for treason against the US. Alicia is approached by federal agent TR Devlin (Cary Grant) who wants her to spy on a group of Nazis in South America that her father used to know. She reluctantly agrees. Whilst there she and Devlin fall in love, while at the same time one her father's old friends, Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains) is falling for her. It goes further when Sebastian asks Alicia to marry him. It's a fantastic Hitchcock masterpiece and has become something of a landmark in film history. Give this one a watch sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil is in the Details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few films that I have watched where it is so absorbing that when it's over you feel like you have awakened from a dream. Also, I don't feel afterward that I wish it didn't have to end. Instead, thanks to that 'damn jigsaw cutting' that Selznick bemoaned, it feels at the end like everything has fallen into place and resolved itself just as it should.The love story between Grant and Bergman is so sensitively and elegantly portrayed that the emotional content of the film seems to obscure the fact that this is a story about state sponsored prostitution for 'the good of American interests'. I also cannot help but feel that NOTORIOUS is the actual template for the James Bond films that are later to come. As well, I see it as a statement about the role of women in a patriarchal society dedicated almost solely to promoting the interests of men. Due to fear, guilt and shame about prior associations with fascists, Alicia Huberman, as played by Ingrid Bergman, is willing to be served up as the sexual bait in a den of devils in order to prove her allegiance to her newly adopted country. Cary Grant playing Devlin, comes to the party as a stranger, and you can almost hear the James Bond theme playing in the distant background, but not quite. This is an Alfred Hitchcock production, thank you very much.The chain of cause and effect, lacquered over with one arresting image after another is all there in its famous Hitchcockian reticulation. There is the kiss within nuzzling within a kiss within nuzzling within a kiss that everyone finds so remarkable and the long crane shot from on high to the tight closeup of the key that opens up the door to the rest of the plot. There is the masterly way that Grant extracts Bergman from this den of political iniquity without shedding one drop of blood or firing one shot. It is all very high handed how these government agents pimp Alicia Huberman in exchange for important secret information before Devlin revokes her Mata Hari card on an afterthought. Drolly ironic how Claude Rains is left standing outside in the cold unknowingly preparing to die for the woman he loves.Classic Hitchcock with something for everyone and worthy of study for those who seek a Cinema less dependent on the clichés of Sex and Violence and the centralized concept of Society as a State of War. I found myself feeling for all the characters; I guess that's why they call it the Hitchcock ensemble. It is all wit and charm and death before dinner and as a nightcap before everyone's privileges to the wine cellar have expired. This is a film worth talking about with friends in a restaurant afterward or discussing at length about philosophically in some French Cafe. It makes you feel like you have a brain as well as a heart. This is one of the things I have most admired about Hitchcock; the way he can tickle your intelligence as well as your fancy and sentiments.Many will speak of Hitchcock as the consummate auteur. They often do this without remarking upon the fact that he is a constantly engaging and interesting host serving you up the finest in storytelling cuisine. Some of it you will devour avidly, other items on the menu might be too rich for your tastes. But there is always something left over for the mind and the heart that you can take home with you in a doggy bag.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This premi?red less than a week after the nuclear bombing of Japan and thus the MacGuffin of the uranium ore can subtly link itself to those events. Everyone's minds were still on World War 2 even after Hitler's defeat and so the villains here are Nazis, but what they are planning is irrelevant. I always saw this as a romance wrapped up around an espionage thriller rather than the other way around, which perhaps soured my expectations when the film did not match them. However its legacy has cemented it as one of Hitchcock's finely constructed masterpieces, if not one of his greatest. It is a love story then, but not one that seems conventional when Grant and Bergman are embracing and kissing mere minutes after their introduction. There is a third, and there are themes of jealously and rivalry and loyalty that further muddle the relationships.Bergman's Alicia, surprisingly for its time, has a reputation for promiscuity, and this is the one issue of interest that drives the film's tensions. Hecht knew exactly what he was doing, of course - in a period where the production code fiercely rejected anything the least bit risqué, he manages to portray exactly the right response to these 'conquests' of hers through Grant's clipped, guarded replies and let the audience know exactly what is being done. It's a riveting dynamic; Alicia completes the task out of love and affection for Devlin, while Devlin cannot imagine being with a woman who would do such a thing for him because of the nature of the deed. Simultaneously he pushes her away yet embraces her - does patriotism and the mission come first, or does his own desires and possessiveness overpower this goal? And perhaps even more surprisingly, as many have noted, is the sympathetic tones for none other than our Nazi Sebastian. He proposes to Alicia mere days after they bump into each other again, and follows her around like a puppy dog during the party whilst being overshadowed by Devlin himself at every turn. Oh, how pathetic it is in the view of all the guests. His character is made doubly minute by the emasculating mother figure, mama Nazi, who has of course predicting the turn of events regarded Alicia. No doubt she hardly believed her eyes when her son brought home a new bride that beautiful. So while Grant and Bergman lash out at each other, trading blows and then embracing intimately a second later, Rains is standing there in a corner fiddling his thumbs - his meek love for Alicia is no match. Hitchcock's visual prowess is unmatched, and Notorious is a great show for it. There isn't a single frame that doesn't belong in this film, that does't add another layer of sensuality or intrigue or tension. When Alicia first wakes up, it takes her a moment to re-orientate - and the camera twists and turns with her. There is that iconic 3 minute kiss that brings the pair together again and again to bypass the censoring rules, while the camera roves around them from the balcony and through the phone call. Or that famous zoom that instantly characterises Alicia's strung up worries and fears of being exposed. As they make their mysterious discovery, the cross-cutting eases a slow, building tension into the scene, as if Sebastian's grasp was surrounding them closer and closer, as the upstairs band's music snakes it way subconsciously into our ears from afar. To introduce Hollywood's biggest leading man, he shows the back of his head as if we should know already - something that has been mimicked time and time again. And that final descent on the staircase, a scene of unrivalled tension and unease, where the alliances morph and take on a different appearance, but which nevertheless ends with that final powerful image, symbolically and literally closing the door on Sebastian's life. It has the same quiet, haunting acceptance of death as dear old Emil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is an espionage thriller with Ingrid Bergman as Alicia the daughter of a German convicted of treason. She is asked by the US government to infiltrate a group of Nazis in Brazil with links to her father, especially Alexander Sebsatian (Claude Rains), who once had a romantic dalliance with Bergman some years ago. Her handler is Devlin (Cary Grant.)Like many other Hitchcock films there is a lot of backdrop footage once the setting moves to Brazil and the film's thriller elements takes place alongside a budding romance between Grant and Bergman and Grant's dilemma as to whether to place her in further danger with Rains and his rather suspicious mother as well as his gang of conspirators.The film starts out as a romance between the two mismatched couple before her orders come through and the film switches gear to a more film noirish setting as she infiltrates the Rains household.Whilst the final part of the film gives you edge of the seat thrills I did find the film rather plodding until then, with too much of Bergman wanting Grant to show affection while Grant torn between duty to his country and devotion to her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deceiving others. That's what the world calls a romance." - Oscar Wilde Alicia Huberman (played by Ingrid Bergman) has been recruited by the OSS (Office of Strategic Services ? precursor to the CIA) to keep tabs on Alex Sebastian, a Nazi agent who operates in Rio de Janeiro. Alicia is assigned an OSS handler called Devlin (played by the suave Cary Grant) and pretty soon finds herself on a plane bound for Brazil. Her mission once there: infiltrate Sebastian's gang and ascertain exactly what the Nazi's are up to.Though this summary makes "Notorious" sound like one of the many "running man" or "espionage" thrillers which director Alfred Hitchcock specialised in, it's actually a twisted romance in the vein of Hitchcock's "Rebecca" and "Vertigo". And so its no surprise that Alicia and Delvin are a pretty macabre couple. She's a notorious libertine whose "been with many men", whilst he's another one of Hitchcock's smooth misogynists. They love one another, but Devlin judges Alicia to be a whore (just as Jeff judges Lisa to be more promiscuous than she really is in "Rear Window") whilst she views him as a needlessly cruel monster who delights in watching her jump through increasingly dangerous hoops and hurdles. In order to prove her love for Devlin, Alicia thus infiltrates the Nazi gang and marries their ring leader. Once she does this, she in effect becomes both Uncle Sam's whore and Alex Sebastian's whore, much to the annoyance of Devlin, who condemns Alicia for her misguided attempts to please him. But of course, it's Alicia's very whorishness which Devlin finds attractive. She's a spy like him now. He wants her sullied.This theme, women accepting a little misogyny in order to please the men they love, is common in Hitchcock's filmography. Think Kim Novak doing anything to please Jimmmy Stewart in "Vertigo", or Lisa and Jeff's relationship in "Rear Window", a film in which Lisa cheerfully "goes along with a murder fantasy" in order to prove that she is as tough and rugged as Jeff.In the book "The Life And Times Of Alfred Hitchcock", Professor John Russell Taylor calls Hitchcock "the great exponent of male sadism". While this may be true for some of Hitch's films, there are many in which the point is precisely to sympathise with the woman being tortured (or forced to undergo a "make over") by her man. In "Vertigo", for example, Scotty forces Judy to become a blonde and dress as Madeline, the woman he's infatuated with. It's a similar case in "Notorious", Devlin forcing Alicia to "put on a performance" and "become" a Nazi spy. In both films, the actions of the leading men are akin to that of a film director (guess who) manipulating or "making over" an actress into a theatrical ideal of either saintliness ("Vertigo") or whorishness ("Notorious"). Yes, this has a sexual pathology and a strong streak of misogyny, but Hitchcock also positions us to sympathise with both women. What's odd about "Notorious" is that whilst Hitch spends the entire film highlighting how possessive, cruel and manipulative Devlin is toward Alicia, the film nevertheless climaxes with him running to the rescue and saving her life. Like Melanie Daniels at the end of "The Birds", and the wife of Henry Fonda at the end of "The Wrong Man", "Notorious" ends with Alicia Huberman rendered virtually catatonic. It is only when she reaches this disempowered state that Devlin is able to treat her with compassion and waltz in like a salvific white knight. What does this say about their romance? Where does this leave them? Won't Devlin prove to be a possessive mate? What exactly are we to make of this ending? (I think a better film would have emphasized the creepy nature of Devlin's rescue, rather than portraying his actions as heroic)Hitchcock, of course, leaves the interpretations up to us. Indeed, the film's ending seems more sympathetic to Nazi spy Alex Sebastian, who suddenly realises that his life is now in jeopardy.7.9/10 ? There are two great set pieces here, but its mostly the twisted psycho-sexual melodrama that makes "Notorious" work. There was nothing like this in the 40s, and even today few "romantic movies" venture into such dark arenas. In terms of flaws, the film is a bit stiff, a bit too wordy and melodramatic, and of course it can't hold a candle to "Vertigo" and "Rear Window", two far superior Hitchcock flicks which tackle similar themes.Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious is filled to the brim with suspense. In order to do this Hitchcock employed many different techniques. The romance between Alicia and Devlin certainly sucked the viewer always waiting for the two fall in love after their first meeting and then to be reunited after Alicia has married Mr. Sebastian. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergmen were a perfect match. The chemistry between the two was entertaining from the very beginning.Claud Raines was wonderful as well because he was able to make the audience feel badly for him and dislike him a great deal .In one aspect it was clear how much he did love Alicia, however, the revenge he takes out on her is awful. Besides the turbulent relationship between the main characters, Hitchcock used a variety of camera and editing work to allow the audience to feel as though they were experiencing everything the characters were. Camera distortions were used when Alicia began getting sick to give the impression she was becoming weak and disoriented. The use of light and dark also helped to signify the mindset of the characters. The lack of lighting was used most frequently in Mr. Sebastian's home to portray Alicia's unhappiness. However, when Alicia is outside of Mr. Sebastian's estate it often sunny and bright. Both the acting and the filming made this film very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a new experience to watch the movie that the main actress was the spy. It is different from the spy movie that I have been watching because it is not complicated ,and there is no tool to help the spy to be successful in the goal. For example, in the scene that she had to steal the key so that she could open the secret room. It would be better if she had something that could copy the print of the key, and she did not have to take out the key. However, if everything was fine, the bad situation would not happen. Moreover, another scene that she knew something was wrong in her coffee, and when she stood up, the filmmaker used the technique to make the scene blur. I think it is very creative. Furthermore, in the beginning of the movie, after the police had gone, the main characters both were in the car. When I heard the sound of the main actress that was quite loud, I felt they were not in opened area because her sound was reflected from the wall. Finallly, I like the end of the movie that we do not know what is going on, so we can imagine in the different way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directs this classic movie about two people who fall in love at the worst time you could possibly imagine. T.R Devlin played by Cary Grant is sent to the house of a daughter of a convicted Nazi spy. This is where he meets Alicia Huberman played by Ingrid Bergman who he happens to fall for. This leads to Devlin telling his superiors that Alicia is not right for this job because he is secretly falling for her, but when he returns to see Alicia he acts as if he doesn't care at all because of her past relationships. This is yet another Love story shaken by unforeseen circumstances and trust issues that are real in everyday life. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman come together for some of the most steamy scenes you will see in the hays code era, but you could still see the restraints they gave the writers who had to have Alicia Huberman say she was sleeping with Alex Sebastian played by Claude Rains instead of actually portraying it which is pretty fascinating. Alfred Hitchcock does a great job of adding different levels of tension and fear as the movie progressed forward causing you to wonder about the Love between Grant and Huberman while wondering if you'll ever truly find out what's the true reason for the uranium. The script written by Ben Hecht is marvelous with a lot of deception and twists that keep you floating on the edge of your seat. The greatest part of this film though is the filming and the use of different shots throughout the movie. The best examples would be the POV shot when Devlin goes to meet with Alicia and the camera spins up side down with her as she looks up at Cary Grant. This shows you the very exact way she would have looked at him. The second example would be when she is drinking the cup of poison and the camera shows Bergman hallucinating two figures which happen to be Raines and his mother and eventually turn into one black blob which showed that the poison had been working and the fear that Alicia Huberman was carrying. Overall, A must see Hitchcock film that will have you scratching your head when its all over.</fullReview>

Like when Alicia Huberman wakes up hungover and is in bed you see that the camera moves kinda sideways so you can see T.R. Devlin staring down at her. Alicia is made a spy to watch Alexander Sebastian. She does this while she is in love with Devlin. I also like when at the party how the camera comes down the stairs and focuses right on the key that is in Alicia's hand.I thought the movie had some suspense when Alicia and Devlin went in the wine cellar because at the party they were running out of wine and those two were down there to see what Alexander was hiding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time today.Not that it shows that I'm any giant at recognizing talent, but without knowing anything about this movie I did recognize that the director was great. It wasn't until I came here to IMDb that I learned it was Hitchcock.This is a great movie, just like everyone else here has said so I won't bother to repeat the various ways in which it's great. I enjoyed the way each scene moved the story steadily forward. I enjoyed the careful use of setting shots (like briefly showing the exterior of the house before cutting to a scene in the interior), and the reaction shots. The subtle acting done by Cary and especially the so subtle but so clear acting done by Bergman like the darkening of her brow.I especially enjoyed the suspenseful climax.I was watching this movie in bed beside my sleeping wife. For two hours she lay there and snored while this movie fascinated me. At the climax, on the walk down the stairs, my wife stirred for the first time in two hours and told me I'd better go to sleep. I said CLIMAX!!!!! Luckily she went back to sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1946 thriller, "Notorious" by Alfred Hitchcock, was yet another amazing film. Hitchcock cleverly approaches storytelling from a whole different way, which makes it merely impossible for the audience not to become engulfed within his films. This is just another great example of his magnificent story writing. I also think that the acting by Cary Grant, and Ingrid Bergman in this film was flawless, and i literally felt the connection between them. I thought that Hitchcock captured this film perfectly with the angles he used, along with his usage of lighting and shadows. So with all this being said, I give, "Notorious" 5 out of 6 chicken nuggets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious was great film, but I did not care for Cary Grant and Bergman together. This was Bergman as a different character than Elsa in Casablanca-a bad girl who likes to drink, but a patriot none the less. I loved the camera angles, from above, sometimes they focused on nothing at all and then something pertinent to the plot. The camera followed the action quite a bit. One thing I noticed that I hadn't before was the background music which enhanced the suspense. There was one close up of Claude Raines when he discovers that his wife is an American Agent that was great, and really made me feel sorry for him. I thought that he was so in love with her and that his heart would be broken, but really, he was worried about his colleagues and that both him and his mother would be killed. It was not clear what this group was up to, outside of helping the German Army. It took me a while to figure out why Emile was killed. All in all a great Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I really love Hitchcock movies. He has this amazing way of directing a film where you are on the edge of your seat watching it the whole time. He has this way of using high key lighting and making elaborate sets and scenes come to life and pop out at you. Grant as always is captivating. I see why women are always falling in love with him. This Hitchcock movie, as well as others as an amazing way of drawing you into the movie, feeling and relating to the characters. I love how Hitchcock portrays each character, their feelings, it isn't just one sided. He shows each and every character. The details in this movie were incredible. If you really payed attention you would notice all the little things done in this film to make it seem real. An example was when Devlin (Grant) and Alicia (Bergman) were watching the horse race and Alicia has the binoculars in her hand you could see the race from her binoculars. I haven't seen that in too many films from the 40's. I found it amazing how such a small detail made such a big impact. The plot was wonderfully complicated but understandable. Hitchcock has an amazing way of making a thriller romantic at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great Director, Dream Lead Pair and star cast and a wonderful plot makes Notorious a remarkable film . Set in Brazil, this is a story about a German woman who is assigned by the Americans to spy the German activity in Brazil against America. This particular girl is chosen because her father was a traitor who betrayed America and killed himself in prison. Detestation of her father's activities, a sense of patriotism and some coaxing by American intelligent officer and love interest makes her take this job. The person who she is supposed to spy upon also is a blast from her past who offers her to marry him and she does even that for the job.If you are expecting this movie to be full of thrills and suspense which is a trademark of Hitchcock movies, then you may be disappointed. The pace of the movie is also a tad slower than his other notable movies. But still it kept me engrossed and anticipating till the end because of the sheer genius of the director. Hitchcock movies are also known for their remarkable climaxes and endings (Psycho, North By Northwest, Rear Window etc). The end of this movie is abrupt and makes you feel it is incomplete. But I personally think this also is a Hitchcock way to say 'Surprise' ! About the Lead Pair, it can only be called as a dream to see these two screen legends together. Cary Grant as the American Intelligence Officer is as good a casting you will get. His screen persona is simply amazing. But I am in complete love with the leading lady of this movie - Ingrid Bergman. She is slowly but surely becoming one of my all time favorite actresses (I have watched Casablanca, Gaslights and Notorious).She is a pure Screen Goddess with a deadly combination of looks, grace and exceptional acting (She has won 3 Oscars in her career for acting). Overall, watch it for the lead pair and the treatment by Hitchcock.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the last great screenplay by Ben Hecht. He wrote many great ones over the years - Underworld, Viva Villa!, The Scoundrel, Wuthering Heights, Angels over Broadway, and my favorite, The Front Page. He has collaborated with Hitchcock before in eight films, of which this is probably the best.It's a love story, no matter what the setting, and who better to star in a love story than Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. They would go on to do another 12 years later, but it could not capture the charm of this movie.The movie also prominently featured Claude Rains, who many would remember as Captain Renault in Casablanca or Sen. Joseph Harrison Paine in Mr. Smith goes to Washington. His inclusion in a film is always welcome. As the "other Man" in this love triangle, he was duped by Bergman and ultimately received his just deserts. Though, being married to her for even a short time is compensation for an early departure, wouldn't you say? A great love story in a film noir setting that has to be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This tale about the conflict among the love and the duty is set Rio Janeiro, Brazil, post-WWII;it concerns about an enticing spy(daughter of a Nazi convicted traitor)named Alice(Ingrid Bergman).She's sent by Chief(a cynical Louis Calhern)US government to marry an old spy called Sebastian(Claude Rains)adored by his mother(Konstantin) and Agent Devlin is assigned to survey her.It's a tense psychological drama with espionage and packs various set pieces with usual Hitchcock touches as the exciting love scene,the McGuffin-uranium,the final climax downstairs.The film is a tense thriller blending passionate romance,complex intrigue maintained throughout and a twisted and chillingly suspenseful ending.Here the ¨McGuffin is the uranium,for Hitch the McGuffin is a gimmick and isn't important in the writings,its origin is a Scottish name.Hitchcoch says in the famous interview with Truffaut(said to be his best film) that he along with the screenwriter(Ben Hetch) went to speak with famed nuclear scientific and later were pursued for FBI during months. The actors give a magnificent performances all around.Ingrid Bergman(Under Capricorn,Spellbound) as distinguished and brilliant spy is marvellous.Gary Grant(Suspicion,North by Northwest,to catch a thief) as embittered and lovesick agent is sensational.The mommy's boy,Claude Rains(1889-1956) is top-notch,he was nominated to Oscar for his sensible interpretation.Besides Louis Calhern(1895-1956)(I confess) as cynic and elegant spy and excellent Madame Konstantine as possessive mommy.Wonderful black and white cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff(also director).The film is considered one of the finest Hitchcock romantic thrillers.It's remade for television in the 80s by Colin Bucksey with John Shea and Jean Pierre Cassel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious vs. MI:2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, I'm not movie expert, but shouldn't have some credit been given to the writer of Hitchcock's Nortorious for what is seen in MI:2? It's changed a lot, but the basic plot is still there. I looked and looked for a credit in MI:2 and no credit is given to Ben Hecht. Is this because Paul Hitchcock is related to Alfred Hitchcock? I don't know, but is sure doesn't seem right to me. Even the track race scene is a direct lift from Nortorious. Notorious has Cary Grant's character recruiting the former lover of a the German bad guy. Not a spy by trade, Ingrad Bergman's character falls for the suave Grant who is conflicted in his love after learning the role that this woman of notoriety will have to fill. In the end of the film, Bergman is discovered and is slowly poisoned. Now, compare this to MI:2: A beautiful thief is recruited by the Cruise character only to find that her role is to spy on her former lover. She too is eventually discovered and put in jeopardy. She is threatened by death because of a virus and not poison, but the idea is the same: the spy has to save his love before her sacrifice to save the world ends in her own death. As I said, the race track scene in MI:2 is a direct lift from Notorious giving further proof that MI:2 writers stole Hetch's plot or in some way legally managed to possess intellectually property rights that belong to the Ben Hecht's relatives. It seems to me that someone should have at least gotten a credit there somewhere. OH!. Notorious is a far better film even if you are a John Woo and Cruise fan. It is a true classic.</fullReview>

The main male character, Devlin, played by Cary Grant, is a hardball throughout the entire film. He almost never says how he feels or what he really thinks, making the film more complicated and confusing than it has to be. The main female character, Alicia, played by Ingrid Bergman isn't much better, although she does appear to be stronger emotionally. Together they make quite the dysfunctional couple and this greatly distracted me from the rest of the film. The editing between scenes was cool as the old scenes would fade away and the new ones would appear. I personally do not see the great appeal of Cary Grant and I feel like another male actor, one with a more emotional side, would have played Devlin better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know it's a classic, but try as I might, I can't get into it. Here's why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Notorious several times. It is considered one of Hitchcock's great movies, and it certainly contains some skillfully created suspense scenes (the champagne in the ice bucket is kind of brilliant). Yet, I have never particularly enjoyed the film, and have only rewatched it in hopes of figuring out why people like it. But this last time, I got a clearer idea of why I don't.First off, there's the cast. Claude Rains is great, but I'm not so hot for Grant and Bergman. Bergman is simply totally unconvincing as a party girl. She is a girl you cast as a nun or a secretary, not as a hard- drinking girl who likes to sleep around.And while I usually find Grant very likable, in this movie he is anything but. He is an out and out jerk. Yes, I understand a lot of the conflict is between her need for words and his for actions, but it doesn't make him less of a jerk, nor make her anything other than an idiot.The story itself has many issues. First off, the whole idea is a bit scatterbrained, and the fact that Bergman isn't told her assignment until she's done there seems pretty ridiculous; nine out of ten people would take the next flight home. This movie is one where Hitchcok's McGuffin concept fails. For those not familiar with the anecdote, the McGuffin refers to that thing everyone in the movie and no one in the audience cares about.It's a clever conceit, but it only works if you care about what happens to the people in the movie. It didn't matter what was going on in North By Northwest, but we were rooting for Grant to survive. There is simply nothing I care about in Notorious. It is just two miscast actors chasing after something no one is even supposed to care about. If you want to see Hitchcock the technician, it's a good movie to watch, because he does a lot of nice things in it. But for me, it's just a difficult movie to love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great study of certain character relationships on top of an interesting espionage story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's early work is usually very interesting to go back to and view. Notorious is no exception in that it demonstrates Hitchcock's ability to set up a situation and get across a great deal of suspense and angst through very simple techniques. If art cinema thrives on emphasising the ordinary or seemingly unnecessary and making it come across as quite broad and epic then Notorious succeeds at exactly this at certain times, specifically when champagne and champagne bottles are involved as tension and foreboding is racked up.Made during America's 'Golden Age'; the classical Hollywood era, Notorious delivers an interesting story second to an equally intriguing character focus revolving around T.R. Devlin (Grant) and Alicia Huberman (Bergman), one an agent and one wrapped into helping said agent and his organisation in tracking down some Nazis whom have escaped to South America. This springs forward two things that come to immediate attention. The first is the year in which the film was made and released that being 1946 and the historical significance in the sense World War Two had just ended ? the other being the move by the studio to have an American character and a German one get so involved with one another shortly after such a war took place.But like I said, the concentration of this film is the chemistry between the two lead characters and the dialogue and exchanges they are involved in. The genius here is that everything is established between the two individuals in such a quick and effective manner that we don't need long and complicated build ups to these leads. Similarly to Double Indemnity from two years prior, the two are introduced and the script just takes over. The dialogue is snappy and sharp, the delivery cynical and humorous and the instant feelings we evoke towards the exchanges plant a seed within our sub-conscious that sticks throughout the duration of the film whenever these two are on screen together. Again similarly to Double Indemnity we get the feeling these two together, working together, will provide us, the audience, with dramatic or explosive results and the film does not disappoint.Part of the reason the relationship works so well, even today, is the sense and feeling of the characters. We feel as if Alicia has seen her fair share of situations and whatever ammunition Devlin has for her can be easily dealt with. Whatever position or situation she might face, we get the immense notion she's up to it and this combined with the fact she's German at a time of great unrest towards said nation, must've totalled up to an enthralling viewing back in the day. But the plot for the film introduces a little more to read into as far as supporting and antagonistic characters go. If the primary focus of relationships is on Devlin and Alicia then the secondary focus is certainly on the relationship between Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and his mother, Anna Sebastian (Konstantin), in all its disturbing glory. As a twosome, Anna acts as the superego over her son and attempts to dominate him in a mother/son partnership not experimented with by Hitchcock until he did so on a much greater scale in 1960's Psycho.This mother/son antagonism acts as a sort of pit-stop for the audience away from Devlin and Alicia's relationship which, as I said, begins cynical and oppositional but blossoms into something much more; something Devlin himself finds very painful to take when the scenes involving Alicia and Alex play out during which Devlin is a witness. The eerie thing here is that while Alex's lust for Alicia could be read into to ring true, it is Devlin that Alicia really loves and thus, any embrace with Alex is false. Throw into the mix the earlier scenes of motherly domination and you have a cocktail of love, lust, embrace and Freudian theory all cooking on a slow burner simultaneously.But Hitchcock's skill in unfolding a relationship whatever the nature is not his limit and this film demonstrates it perfectly. His use of suspense through an inanimate object and basic editing is something you could learn from, particularly through method of set up. At one point, a character must gain access to a key on a chain that is difficult to remove but that is only in order to move onto the next suspense set piece: a trip down into the depths of a large house to find something else. Questions arise of a specific nature: 'will this character succeed in getting the key?'; 'will the other character notice said object is missing?' and once they're down in the basement, the constant cutting to a from the champagne bottles running out acts as a wonderful cut away. As an actress playing a character, Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia with a stone faced efficiency. She is betraying people of her own nation and has an expression that pains her to come to terms with who and what she is: a seductress. But the fact her character is so good at what she does only adds an extra layer of disturbance. Notorious was, I suppose, quite daring for its time given the relationship it had going on between an American and a German character a mother and her son but if anything, it still acts as a fascinating espionage tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best endings ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Notorious' is the latest discovery in my ongoing Alfred Hitchcock Film Festival. Never seen it before, had no idea what it was about. First impressions- Ingrid Bergman acts circles around Cary Grant, whom I have never seen in a more unappealing role. Don't get me wrong, he's very good too, as is Claude Rains... but this is Bergman's show, maybe the best performance she ever gave, which is saying something. Made and released in 1946, 'Notorious' may have been the first mainstream film to feature a 'Nazis after the war' plot. God knows there have been hundreds since; as critic Joe Adamson succinctly put it, "the Nazis, though recently defeated, were embarking on a long cinematic career that will probably stretch well into the next century." Sure enough, here they are scheming in South America, a small group of them, living well off plundered loot no doubt, adhering to a strict code of secrecy and trusting no one, not even each other. It is a very paranoid clan, that paranoia embodied by Madame Sebastian, the old but crafty and domineering mother of Alex Sebastion (Claude Rains), first among equals of the Nazi group. (Hitchcock does love his domineering mothers.) Alicia Huberman (Bergman) is recruited to infiltrate the ring and find out what they're up to; her father has just been convicted of being a Nazi spy, and so she has connections with the group and Alex Sebastian in particular, who has something of a crush on her. Alicia, however, is a patriotic American, something the Nazis are unaware of; they just assume her loyalty was to her father. Devlin (Cary Grant) is the government agent who recruits her and acts as her contact during her mission. I suppose if I have a problem with 'Notorious,' it's the relationship between Devlin and Alicia. Apropos of nothing really, they strike up a romance, though you'd be hard-pressed to call it that judging from Devlin's behavior. He is constantly casting aspersions on her character with crude and spiteful remarks, acting as though he holds her in complete contempt most of the time. The suggestion is that she's a drunk and worse than that, a prostitute for agreeing to the very mission he recruits her for! This misogynistic attitude is shared more or less by the other intelligence officials to whom Alicia reports, including Prescott (Louis Calhern) and frankly, it bothers me. It is compounded by the fact that Alicia is in love with Devlin, again, for no apparent good reason. Is it because he looks down on her? The fact that Devlin's true feelings are made known to her in the last five minutes does not make up for the way he treats her throughout the rest of the movie. I know times were different then and I generally have no problem making allowances for past attitudes, but this strikes me as a very unattractive male fantasy of sorts, one that was very common in the forties and fifties. But that aside, 'Notorious' is most intriguing and full of tension in that unique Hitchcock style. Alicia is finally found out by Alex, but by this point they have been married and he realizes he cannot expose her without coming under suspicion from his fellow Nazis himself. So he and his mother hit upon the idea of slowly poisoning her, over the course of several weeks. She misses a meeting with Devlin and so he goes to Sebastian's home to check up on her, where he finds out from her what has happened. Alicia is very weak as Devlin leads her down the stairs; they are met by Alex and Madame Sebastian as the other Nazis watch from below. Alex must watch helplessly as Devlin and Alicia walk slowly from his house to his car; Alex follows and whispers desperately for them to take him, too, but Devlin refuses. The final shot shows the Nazis asking Alex to come back inside; they have a few questions. An absolutely brilliant ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Notorious" Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of an Alfred Hitchcock movie, it is obvious that you would think of the word classic. Notorious, his riveting 1947 drama is no exception. Notorious is an extremely well written fast paced drama with superb directing and outstanding acting. The story centers around Alicia (played by Ingrid Bergman) and Devlin (Cary Grant). After her Nazi father is convicted to twenty years in prison for treason, Alicia is pursued by Devlin, an American secret agent. Devlin wants Alicia to go undercover and infiltrate her father's Nazi friend's home for information. The eventual love that Alicia and Devlin find for each other leads to Alicia's decision to agree to this assignment. Alicia expresses her loyalty to her country, and agrees to go to South America and forge love to her father's friend. In order to succeed, Alicia must be willing to sacrifice her freedom and possibly herself. Devlin must put his love for her aside and allow her to do so. What follows in the storyline revolves around the question, how far will both Alicia and Devlin go in order for the mission to be a success?Despite the fact that Notorious' writer, Ben Hecht, was nominated for a 1947 Academy Award for best original screenplay, I feel that majority of the story is told through the movement and placement of the camera. The camera portrayed how the characters were feeling, without them having to say it. The actors themselves should also be credited for performing so well, but most of the acclaim should go to the cinematography and direction of the film. Hitchcock's choreography of the camera was a work of art. Frequently during the movie, while Alicia and Devlin were conversing, the camera is strictly on them, and unfocused on the scenery around them. This is done purposely by Hitchcock, to portray that regardless of what is going on in the two characters surroundings, they are intensely focused only on each other. The fact that this is revealed without words and through the camera is one of the finest aspects of the film.At the time of making the film, the Production Code was in full effect. Many directors and writers were limited on what they were permissible to show on screen. Hitchcock, however, did not take the production code as a hindrance to his work. Instead, he worked around the code to make the film just as well, if not superior than it would be without the code. The best example of this is what Hitchcock did concerning the three-second kiss rule. The script had a scene involving a long passionate kiss involving the two main characters of the story. However, the production code stated that no kiss can be longer then three seconds long, yet the scene wound be being referred by many as "the longest kiss scene in film history." The "longest" kiss was actually a serious of short kisses with passionate dialogue in between each kiss. According to Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, the three-second rule led to a much better scene. I could not agree more. This shows how much talent Hitchcock had as a director. He was prohibited to make the kiss long, and he transformed it into a masterpiece of a scene. All throughout the movie, Hitchcock used ways to get around the production code, and still tell the story the best he can.After viewing Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious, you will be left breathless. However, all of the credit should not be only directed to Hitchcock. It is a combination of amazing acting, writing and directing that makes this such a classic. Notorious is a definite recommendation for anyone who enjoys cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few perfect Hollywood films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was hitting on all eight cylinders when he directed this classic film. Every scene seems to be shot with care, not only with concerns of camera placement/movement, but also acting. Cary Grant is surprisingly somber, even hateful, in one of his most un-Grant-ish roles. Ingrid Bergman is simply magnificent, far better than even her great role in "Casablanca" and she rarely ever achieved this level of perfection again. Claude Rains...the third lead in the film...is one of the bad guys, yes, but he is also kind, polite, considerate, caring. A real gentleman.This last point is worth pointing out because Hitchcock always seemed to be interested in showing us not only villains, but also heroes, who go against type. Think of "Secret Agent", with Robert Young playing a very nice guy, but wait....he turns out to be the villain! Or, 1971's "Frenzy", Barry Foster is a wonderful guy, a friend to all, certainly a more likable guy than the boorish hero. Now take a look at Claude Rains. In an era when Nazi's were portrayed almost to the point of wearing a handlebar mustache and a black cape, Rains (with Hitchcock's direction) presents us with a true gentleman who just happens to be a Nazi. Several scenes in this movie have been singled out over the years as a sign of Hitchcock's genius: the two-minute kissing scene; the revelation of the key; the discovery of the bottle; the poisoning of Bergman's character; the final sequence where Grant finally rescues Bergman. I have a personal favorite scene: the scene, on the plane, where Grant tells Bergman that her father has just committed suicide. Her speech (supposedly written by Hitchcock himself and inserted into the script) perfectly wraps up her character's complex emotional state. Simply filmed, wonderfully acted.One last note: the ending of this film is one of the most perfect, ever, for a Hollywood film. Once again pay attention to Claude Rains' facial expressions; they convey his fate as well as anything that could have been graphically filmed.**** out of four; 10/10; A+...all these ratings and grades describe this true classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to assert just what the keys are that make this a classic. Is it Hitchcock's direction or is it the acting of the three leads? Truth is, I guess, it's a combination. The script is tight and the story-line intriguing as the master builds the suspense, although, in truth, suspense plays second fiddle to the characters. Sebastian (Rains) is a Nazi sympathiser involved in a plot to develop atomic weaponry, presumably for a revivalist Nazi Germany of the future. Given this situation how easy it would have been to portray him as the personification of evil. But Hitchcock, by this time, was aware that black is not always black, any more than white is always white. So, Sebastian comes across, especially towards the end, as vulnerable and, if not deserving our support, at least we have a morsel of sympathy and understanding. Crossed in love by his `arranged' wife, Alicia (Bergman), and oppressed by his cigar-chewing dominant mother, he is no representative from the evil empire.At the same time Devlin (Grant), the `good' guy, treats Alicia cruelly, knowing that she loves him deeply. So whilst we should be with him we are so only reluctantly. Alicia comes over as the character most deserving of our sympathy, despite her loose living and love affair with the bottle. And what a performance from Bergman! The scene on the balcony over-looking Rio must be one of the outstanding love scenes in the history of cinema.With these characters and plot Hitchcock weaves a story of manipulative relationships based on love, desire, greed, politics, indeed the whole kit and caboodle. Unmissable cinema and well deserving of its high place in the all-time rankings.</fullReview>

This is Ingrid Bergman's best performance, apologies to "Casablanca" fans, and Ben Hecht's screenplay is masterful.(He didn't just dip his pen in rattlesnake venom, his pen was immersed in MAMBA venom and the result is deliciously vicious).Hitchcock's camerawork is among his best and the swooping camera scene with the key is a feat of genius and deserves the praise which it has garnished. The wine cellar scene is as suspenseful as Hitchcock EVER got. He was a brilliant director, now on to what I really love about the film.Cary Grant was a passable dramatic actor. He is passable in this film, and in some scenes he's quite good. He wasn't miscast but his real strength--genius in my opinion--was comedy and lighthearted comedy dramas. His best comedies are his early ones but since this is a Hitchcock film, allow me one title: "North By Northwest." Need I say more?Ingrid Bergman is flat out superb in her best role (she deserved an Oscar) as the daughter-of-a-Nazi-who-makes-good-by-helping-Uncle-Sam and infiltrates Rains's ring in Rio. (Rains is marvelous, as always, in his role as a Mama's Boy who somehow heads an organization of much tougher Germans). In fact, I have more than once read that the relationship between Rains and his mother go to unholy extremes. That notion makes some sense, as this film was released less than a year after World War Two and Germans were then fair game.But from the opening scene to the closing one, it's Ingrid who bedazzles. She is completely believable in a somewhat unbelievable role, and the early scene where Grant puts a handkerchief around her bare midriff, "better wear this, you might catch cold," (as if in South Florida a hanky around the waist would make some kind of difference) is brief but very erotic and renders absurd the belief that "less is more" is untrue. Be it learning of the death of her father, her badinage with Grant, her wonderful English which she worked very hard to improve (and succeeded) her remorse, her liveliness; anything else one can imagine, this is Ingrid's film. Period. My favorite aspect of "Notorious:" Ben Hecht's script.Allow me a few quotes. Please remember the justifiable fury Hecht had for the Germans; the dialogue is still shocking and saturates the film. Just a few, beginning with the best and most famous one:"We are protected by the enormity of your stupidity." Mother to Rains, and THAT one is worthy of Bartlet's!"Look, I'll make it easy for you; the time has come when you must tell me that you have a wife and two adorable children and this madness between us can't go on." Ingrid. "I'll bet you've heard that line often enough." Grant. Ouch!"I'm terrified!" Ingrid in the wine cellar. "Pretend you're a janitor, janitors are never terrified." Grant."I'll have to be more careful, I turned my ankle the last time." The most brutal of the German gang saying (while wolfing a chicken leg) to the others that when he kills Emil via car, he'll need to jump farther than he previously had when he murdered by car an earlier person. Pure ice. And I love it! "Dry your eyes baby it's out of character." Grant to Bergman at the race track."I miss Emil. [Doctor Anderson, sounding contrite but then, after one second] He [Emil] was a first class metallurgist." Cuts to the bone.I love "Notorious" because of Hecht's script, and because Ingrid Bergman was never better. On a scale of ten, a 9.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of Hitchcock's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just, wow. Every part of this movie is suspenseful, and the performances are great, especially from Claude Rains, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and Leopoldine Konstantin. The conversation between Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and his mother (Konstantin) at the racetrack is one of the funniest scene I have ever seen in a Hitchcock film.During the part when Alex sees Devlin (Grant) and Alicia, Alex's wife (Bergman) kissing is so sad. I can literally feel his heart breaking, that's how expressive Rains was just with his face and eyes. He is the most sympathetic Nazi I've seen in a movie from this time period. This is a powerful movie about Nazis and spies, just the thing you would expect from Hitchcock. This is a masterpiece, not only of the genre, but of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it that makes Ingrid Bergman so irresistably sexy? Those chestnut eyes? That elegant nose? Those lush lips? Her heavenly soft hair? Her Swedish perfumed voice? Maybe it's her elegance and sophistication. But there's no denying it. She was gorgeous.Here she is teamed up with her sophisticated sex symbol male counterpart of the 1940s, Cary Grant, in one of Hitchcock's best movies. I have lots of respect for Hitchcock and it's movies like this that makes me look deeper into his resume of films and find overlooked masterpieces.I saw this for the first time in a film class that, for a long time, presented classic films which I was very familiar with. That may have made NOTORIOUS even more fun to watch.It's more of a romance to me than an espionage thriller, but it has all the paranoid themes that are so familiar in the work of Hitchcock. Bergman works as a spy for the Americans to bring down ex-Nazi Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains). Grant goes off with her to South America as an informant and falls in love with her.The sexual tension tightens when Bergman ends up marrying Rains to further investigate. But you can tell there's passion between Grant and Bergman (check out the wonderfully overlong kiss that blew critics through the roof in 1946) even though Grant threatens to leave his post and pretends he feels nothing for Bergman.Cary Grant is effortlessly suave and funny, while Ingrid Bergman plays a nice action heroine. They are respectively at their best here. Claude Rains, who made a wonderful co-star with Bergman in CASABLANCA a few years before, makes a nice Nazi, though the true villain is undoubtedly the mother played by Leopoldine Kanstantin.Check out Hitchcock's genius in the 360 degrees shot of Cary Grant. The suspense in the wine cellar. The hilarious drunk car ride in the beginning. Ingrid Bergman slyly stealing a key to a secret door in the house of the faux husband she detests.Those are only a few reasons, that I can think of, for you to see NOTORIOUS. But if you have the patience of going back to an older movie, definitely view this suspenseful romantic thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Notorious" is a knockout of a film, in my opinion, the most satisfying of Hitchcock's films from the 40's. One marvels at how he was able to get away with the perverse situations in this film at a time when censorship held sway. The fact that he did, and so skillfully, makes one wonder if a bit of censorship might not be so horrendous in Hollywood today, but then are there any directors today who can compare with the most stylish of all time, Hitchcock? Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman make a dazzlingly romantic team here, with Bergman in a very atypical role for her at this time, as a drunken playgirl turned spy. Lush, ultra-romantic and suspenseful, with a great script and a brilliant performance by Claude Rains in support of two of Hollywood's greatest stars at their peak. Who could ask for more?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingrid Bergman doesn't completely convince as a party-girl who, in 1940s Florida, is asked by U.S. government agents to become a spy against a group of Nazi-associated old friends down South America way. Bergman, whose father has just been sentenced to 20 years for treason, is sexily drowsy, wryly funny and reckless, but she's far too emotional (with her heart on her sleeve) to be taken as a devil-may-care woman of the world. Certainly Bergman is capable of anything as an actress, but the writing here never fills in the gaps concerning this character, and the woman is a real puzzler (she shows more hurt when Cary Grant rebuffs her on the balcony than when she is told her father is dead). Grant's suave American agent is enigmatic too, and when the two would-be lovers icily press together in a clinch, the plot of "Notorious" doesn't crackle (at least not the way something similar--such as "Casablanca"--crackled). Director Alfred Hitchcock mounts this espionage suspense-drama very carefully (some may say methodically), and the results are frosty and smooth (and occasionally quite enjoyable). But the film isn't high art, nor is it a genuine classic. It's pulp in fashionable dress. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1946, in Miami, the German John Huberman is convicted for treason against the United States of America. His daughter Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), who is notorious for her affairs and drinking problem but loyal to her country, is contacted by the cynical government agent T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) for an assignment in Rio de Janeiro spying a network of Nazi's friends of her father. They travel together and Alicia falls in love for Devlin that is her liaison with the chief of the spy ring Captain Paul Prescott (Louis Calhern). However, when she is ordered to meet the German Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains) that has a crush on her, she feels disappointed with the lack of attitude of Devlin. Sooner Alexander proposes her and Devlin does not object when Captain Prerscott asks her to marry Alexander. Alicia snoops the mansion and discovers that the wine cellar is locked. Devlin suggests her to ask Alexander to give a party to introduce her to the society in Rio and invites him. He discovers that many bottles are filled with uranium. Nevertheless Alexander discovers that she is a spy and together with his mother, they slowly poison her to avoid raising suspect in the other Nazis."Notorious" is a good movie of Alfred Hitchcock and nostalgic for those like me that were born in Rio de Janeiro. It is wonderful to see my city in 1946, without the demographic explosion and construction and slums boom. I like this feature a lot, but it is not my favorite Hitchcock's film. Claude Rains, who is much shorter and older than Ingrid Bergman, is miscast in the role of her husband and Cary Grant has a wooden performance without any chemistry with the wonderful Ingrid Bergman. Further, the plot deserved a better ending instead of a rushed conclusion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Interlúdio" ("Interlude")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Effective Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Hitchcock's work is as good as any to study for the impermanence of style. Let's completely set aside the clothes, the conceit about German spies/mothers-in-law, the obviously fake sets and the trite plot devices (uranium in bottles, poison in coffee). We are still left with two levels of style. I suppose it is arguable whether these are styles. I call them styles because they are imposed by society, were a major part of the original charm of the work, and now are noticeably out of place, replaced by a new set.The first concerns what it means to be cinematic: the staging, the framing and the relationship of lights to eye. Hitchcock was both a master and an innovator of the first two. But he was steeped in the theatrical tradition. Every actor showed that they knew where the camera was. The action comes to the camera, not the other way around. The perspective is constant, and at seated eye-level, seldom moving about as a disembodied observer might. This is obsolete today, even in the most mundane films. The second deals with modern acting. Hitchcock WAS modern sixty years ago. While he had one foot in the theater and an obligation to tell a story, he has the other foot in modern self-awareness. Incidentally marked by his walkons, his more pervasive use was how the actors winked at the camera. Grant was a master of this with his smile that was intended primarily for the viewer. So we have Grant in two persona: Devlin, and the actor playing Devlin. Now Hitchcock adds a familiar mix: Devlin and Alicia's characters become actors themselves. She to deceive the bad guys, he to deceive he.Actors playing actors is quite old (Shakespeare's favorite device) but to make it all self-referential comes from modern French comedy. Inserting the notion into `realistic' film was the Hitchcock innovation. But this style is passe today, as the sophistication of viewers has moved on. Now we have extremely multileveled, simultaneous roles even in our most low-brow films (`Nurse Betty'). Now we have the camera acting as a character. Now we have shifting narrative stances.All this shows the danger of being a stylish filmmaker -- you go out of style and your film just stops working. This film is of historical interest only -- it only works if you deliberately assume the mantle of the past -- which is enjoyment enough for some.Bergman IS lovely, and I think if she were acting today, she wouldn't be so stiff; and I presume this would detract from her appeal. Check out her daughter for instance in "Fearless."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compound excellent director, screenwriter and great cast resulted in a superb film. NOTORIOUS is a great, exciting and tense melodrama. Hitch has combined what is expected of him for years. Exquisite romantic story and very intelligent thriller that follows her.The elements in the film do not differ much from previous works. In other words, they are great. Thematically, the film is remarkable. Alcoholism and uranium in trace. Nazi gang in exile and emotionally damaged girlfriend as an American spy. The emotional drama of the main character is likely to overcome everything else. I would not say that emotion is based on courage, morality or cynicism. Although these elements are exaggerated, I think they are a danger, doubt and love pain incomparably stronger for romance in this film.The situations in the film are a bit old-fashioned and it definitely could have been tighter, but on the other hand I wonder how much it would damage made emotions and romance. It's all about the kiss. Love scenes are candid and disturbing. Rare are such a sensitive emotional scenes. The main actress leads the expression of the rich and real emotions.Ingrid Bergman as Alicia Huberman is the heart of this film. It's all about her character. It is the most important link and did a great job. Cary Grant as T.R. Devlin is amazingly strong. Type detective who falls in love. Expected are his feelings prevailed profession, but firmness and strength of character is maintained to the very end. Claude Rains as Alexander Sebastian is a "big shot", which has engaged in something that is not up. Rains is the right choice. His character does not give cruel leadership than jealousy, suspicion and fear.This movie is a wonderful experience, great genre blend, elegant style and excellent visual expression left a deep mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Notorious" is wickedly suspenseful and beautifully shot. Carey Grant is great as usual here but it's Ingrid Bergman who steals the picture. There is no better Alfred Hitchcock film that perfectly sums up his sensibility as a director. Only Hitchcock can deliver such fantastic camera movements and great suspense at the end of the movie. I knew that Hitchcock could build suspense, but I was unaware of his ability to tell a ravishing love story .Where the film shines is in the visual style, and the fact that while very few people in the film make any real mention of the love "affair" in the film, everyone can clearly see it. Often is the case that the audience sees it and it's plain that everyone in the film should be seeing it, but for some reason unknown to the audience, they're oblivious. With Notorious you can clearly see via facial expressions, inquiring dialogue, and mannerisms that anyone close enough sees there's something more going on than simply a professional relationship. Not one of my favorite Hitchcock films (I've never been much for a simple romance film) lovers of the genre should find plenty of enjoyment of this happy ending tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never looked carefully at a movie. A close look at a lens. Hitchcock's movies are crafted by product, before the shooting every detail will be considered in the design. Alicia and Sebastian first in the dining room, two people sitting very close. But in the pros and cons of the shot, from the Alicia here to look at the past is slightly farther away, while the other side is more close, do not know whether it was used different lenses. This film is Hitchcock McGovern by example. In this department is considered to be the theme of love although the film Hitchcock will the hero and heroine of the emotional entanglements as plot, but they have to explore the secret and the film to make atomic bombs of uranium ore is the core to promote the development of the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock does not often work with romance but I'm this he excels. Aided by the skilled Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman he incorporates a great love story into a thrilling tale. Grant plays an out of character role quite well. A subtle approach is out of his usual center of attention style. Hitchcock does a great job of alluding to the illness of alcoholism without it being so obvious it becomes annoying. Hitchcock also touches on the subject of sexuality without being too blatant. This is where his subtly shines. It course the suspense is always palpable. This is a great movie that deserves a high spot on the list of Hitchcock classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious (1946) was written by Ben Hecht and directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It stars Cary Grant as Devlin, an FBI agent, and Ingrid Bergman as Alicia Huberman. Huberman's father has been convicted of treason against the U.S., because of his postwar Nazi activities. Bergman is drinking her life away among friends who are drinking their lives away.Grant recruits her to join him in South America and seduce the Nazi leader there--Alexander Sebastian, played by Claude Rains. How can a movie miss when it stars Bergman, Grant, and Rains?The plot is Hitchcockian, and not very subtle, but who can resist star power like that? Some of the scenes make us groan 70 years later. Bergman is a "loose woman," so it's OK for her to marry Rains in order to help the FBI. Everyone smokes. Evil people look evil, and good people look good. Actually, that's an asset. Leopoldine Konstantin as Rain's mother, Mme. Sebastian, looks very evil and she acts even more evil than that. She only has a supporting role, but it's what she does with that role that counts.We saw this film at the excellent Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum, in Rochester NY. It was great to see it on the large screen, but it will work almost as well on a small screen. IMDb raters have placed this movie in the top 250 movies of all time. That's not a mistake--it deserves to be there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is a delightful spy movie delivered by Alfred Hitchcock that carries strong themes from the recently concluded World War II. Now, I myself am a big fan of spy movies, and I actually hold the James Bond franchise near and dear to my heart, this movie fits into that category suitably. Today's standards for such movies would deem it as lackluster, with all of the top-notch action we are presented with today, however, this was a relaxing deviation away from said formula. To me personally, the movie as a whole was commendable, but the two aspects that really intrigued me were the camera work and the disobedience to the Hays code, while subtle and still remaining within boundaries. The opening scene where the key is revealed is the scene in specific that captured my attention. Now, the other scene is where Delvin and Ingrid kiss for about two minutes. Hays code dictated that it was inappropriate for actors to kiss for more than three seconds at a time, but they stopped short of three seconds in succession for allotted two minutes or so, nothing too special, but it was interesting to see such blatant disobedience to a paradox in the code.</fullReview>

In this quest she fell in love with the federal agent who asked her to do this and when she gets involved deeper to her job, things getting more complicated.I think that this movie is not one of the best of Alfred Hitchcock but is an interesting one to watch. The only negative in this movie I believe that it was the plot which was not as I expected to be, and it was predictable. Although the direction of Alfred Hitchcock was as good as I expected to be. About the interpretations I have to say that I really liked the interpretation of Cary Grant who played as Devlin and the interpretation of Ingrid Bergman who played as Alicia Huberman.Finally I believe that "Notorious" is a good movie to watch and spend your time on it but do not expect much from it because you are going to be let down. If you want to watch an Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece then I am sure that you will find plenty of others but if you want just a simple movie of Alfred Hitchcock then this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid espionage thriller-romance from Hitch. I bet Kubrich was inspired by this film especially when he made BARRY LYNDON and EYES WIDE SHUT. Hitch gathers a bunch of sinister looking people to play Nazis in this film and put them to great use especially in the scenes towards the end. You don't need special effects or cheap thrills when you have such a stellar supporting cast.CARY GRANT and INGRID BERGMAN are not too convincing in their roles. CLAUDE RAINS is excellent as a Nazi sympathizer who always looks up to his mother for help. Hitch was pretty obsessed with this idea of sons being abnormally attached to their mothers and their lovers having to compete with the mother for their affection. I really wonder if this is something from his own life. He used this theme in THE BIRDS as well.Anyway, there is a lot to appreciate in this film like where the camera is placed at times and how certain scenes are composed.</fullReview>

American agent Devlin(played by Cary Grant) enlists her aid to infiltrate her fathers group of Nazi friends, led by Alexander Sebastian(played by Claude Rains). She agrees, and(because of her father and beauty) ingratiates herself with them successfully, much to Devlin's resentment, as he has secretly fallen in love with her, but can't admit it, and she gets uncomfortably close to Alexander. She then is assigned a crucial task to perform against him, that could endanger all their lives if uncovered...

The photography in the film was stunning. The actors meshed wonderfully together. This was also the first film I'd seen with Cary Grant in it, and only my second with Bergman. I thought that they work brilliantly together and their performances were very impressive. I enjoyed how the story unfolded. The character development throughout was great and I liked how we got to see who was really on Bergman's characters side. The two plotting against her towards the end actually threw me off and surprised me. I wasn't entirely expecting Alexander Sebastian to end up being the character that wanted to off Ms. Huberman. However, I lost interest multiple times throughout the film. I thought many of the scenes and dialogue tended to drag on. At times, I found it unnecessary and I actually dozed off a couple of times and had to rewind to re-watch the parts I'd missed. All in all, it was a good film. At times, a bit slow, but Hitchcock really knew what he was doing and was a master of his craft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Notorious was directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1946. The American thriller depicts the story of spies undercover on a mission to take down an evil Nazi villain. The main character Devlin(played by Cary Grant) compromises his mission by having romantic relations with the woman they send undercover(played by Alicia Huberman) whose emotions and actions put them on thin ice but love prevails and all is good. Hitchcock filmed different scenes and edited them in a way to show that they are occurring at the same time, keeping the film fast paced and entertaining. The Production Code guidelines were followed by Hitchcock, but he poked fun at them with his kiss scenes. To get around the 3 second kissing rule the best he could, he filmed the actors kissing, then snuggling, and then back to kissing. This method ensures that the strength of the scene is preserved without breaking the rules. Hitchock's camera angles and shots are unique unlike other directors of his time. An example is his ending that leaves you guessing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only other movies of Hitchcock's I had seen before this was The Birds(1963) and Psycho(1960) so I had high expectations for a well put together horror/thriller film. Although my expectations were not met, I still really enjoyed this film. It has a little bit of everything in it. It's a love story; the relationship between Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant. Which is no usual relationship, they both don't even acknowledge it till the very end. There relationship is a love hate because neither of them really trust each other because of there past. The movie is also a thriller/action because Ingrid is used as an American spy to infiltrate the Nazi's. There are tons of suspenseful scene where you wondering if shes going to get caught. The movie also has a sort of horror aspect to it. While she is getting poisoned the movie takes a dark turn with only Claude Rains character and his mother knowing what was going on. Had that same mysterious vibe that Psycho(1960) had. The cinematography of this movie was done excellent. There's a great shot where its suppose to be in Ingrids view as she follows Grant walk towards here, the camera goes upside down. The shots that are a little blurry when there suppose to be drunk really make it more believable. I also really like the mirror shots in the car and on the binoculars. Overall this was a good movie even though I had other expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious***1/2 (out of 4)101 mins/UCast: Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude RainsDirector: Alfred HitchcockPlot: After her father is convicted of treason, Alicia Huberman is recruited by Devlin, a government agent, to spy on an old family friend's network of Nazi scientists. Despite falling in love with Devlin, Alicia is forced to marry her father's friend to fulfil her task.JJ's verdict: Hitchcock's Casablanca, sharing two cast members, having a foreign location, Nazi characters, and one woman with two lovers, one a trusting gentleman, the other a harsh control freak. It's just a shame for Alicia Huberman that the one she has to hurt is the nicest one.Featuring the longest kissing scene in film at the time Notorious is one of the 1940's best films. All three principal cast members act their scenes with huge love, hate and emotion towards each other, mostly used in and around a scene in which, to keep the secret safe, Bergman's character kisses Grant in front of her loving husband, Rains' Sebastian. What makes the film so brilliant is that Rain's, the film's antagonist, is actually a nice person who is madly in love with Bergman, who devastatingly is only with him to fulfil her mission. And although it's mainly about love, the master of suspense uses his powers to create a hugely emotional last scene in which one character knowingly walks straight into his death. The only fault 'Notorious' has is it's pacing in the middle section but this really is one of the great classic romances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingrid Bergman's Greatest Performance...But Where Was The Academy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn.The film she won for was TO EACH HIS OWN, a rather moldy soap opera about a woman who has a child out of wedlock and then spends the rest of the film trying not to tell the young man she is his mother.It's a swell performance, but the movie is not worthy of her; the story was dated even when it was made, and today it is hopelessly antiquated and de Havilland is too good for the movie and upsets its dramatic balance as a result. She would win a well-deserved Oscar three years later for THE HEIRESS, and made a number of other films in this period that would have been more worthy, like THE DARK MIRROR and THE SNAKE PIT.All this digression is my way of leading up to presenting my own choice for Best Actress of 1946: the incomparable Ingrid Bergman in her greatest performance with the possible exception of AUTUMN SONATA, in Alfred Hitchcock's classic espionage tale NOTORIOUS.Bergman's image in Hollywood up to this point was squeaky clean: she played either spotless heroines (as in CASABLANCA) or innocent victims (as in GASLIGHT, which won her the Oscar that should have gone to Barbara Stanwyck for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). NOTORIOUS must have given her fans a bit of a shock: she plays Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted German spy who has committed suicide in prison. Alicia is no traitor; she loves America and harbors nothing but hatred for her father. She's no angel, either: she likes to party and she drinks too much (and it is made fairly clear that she does more than that).One day after a drunken party, she awakens to find that one of her guests has not left: a man named Devlin (Cary Grant), who crashed the party and managed to prevent her getting arrested when she insisted on going for a drive three sheets to the wind and a cop stopped them.Alicia realizes this is no ordinary guy. And she is immediately suspicious of him, with good reason: he is sizing her up to take on the job of going undercover and involving herself with one of her father's compatriots (Claude Rains), an assignment that ends with her actually marrying the man. In the interim she has fallen in love with Devlin, which places the character in the (for its time) shocking position of being driven by the man she loves into another man's bed.This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films. Its frank sexuality is decades ahead of its time, and Ingrid Bergman, who was already well-known as one of Hollywood's great beauties, is quite frankly sexy in this film, one of the few times she was allowed to be so overtly carnal.The film has the usual extraordinary twists and turns Hitch was so fond of, and its greatest irony is that the "hero" (Grant), despite being in love with her, is a real bastard to her for most of the film, while the Nazi criminal she eventually marries not only loves her, his love blinds him to what she is up to.NOTORIOUS has long been a favorite of mine. Ingrid Bergman was a magnificent actress who never really gave a bad performance, but Alicia Huberman was one of her greatest roles and I shall never understand why the Academy did not even see fit to give her a nomination.I should add, in closing, that Bergman is aided and abetted here by one of the best casts Hitch ever assembled. Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible.Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect: probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic. And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous "second choice" since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman as the romantic spy - a classic Hitchcock thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is a 1946 espionage film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and stars Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The story takes place just after the end of WWII. While the Allies have one the war, there is still concern of Nazi influence. The film opens with Alicia Huberman (Bergman) watching her father be convicted of treason in a federal courtroom; he does not atone for his actions and dies shortly thereafter. Devlin (Grant) is a CIA agent that enlists Alicia to spy for the US government on her father's friends. At first she is reluctant but then agrees. Alicia befriends her father's closest friend, Alexander Sebastian (Rains) and begins a romantic relationship with him. Now Devlin must manage Alicia in a much more complex situation, while trying to restrain his own passionate interests with her.Hitchcock is a master at building suspense and intrigue in films. Notorious provides an excellent example of how Hitchcock can take a mundane event ? the depletion of wine bottles at a party ? and turn it into a suspenseful event for the movie audience. The scene is the large dinner party; Alicia is trying to sneak Devlin into Alexander's wine cellar where Devlin hopes to find clues on Nazi activities. Hitchcock constantly focuses on the open bar where wine is being served, and one observes the stock supply of wine dwindling. Will Devlin be able to inspect the wine cellar before Alexander needs to obtain more wine? Notorious has a run time of 101 minutes, and provides a compelling story. The characters of Alicia and Alexander are well developed, but this reviewer felt that additional time was needed to develop Grant's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those who tend to call 'Notorious' as well as other Hitch movies cannot appreciate the true magic of movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far, my favorite director of all time is Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense and in fact, the master of movies. There is something about every Hitchcock movie that I just so love.Notorious is a romance/spy movie in which a young woman named Alicia must spy on one of her father's friends as part of a task given to her by her newly met boyfriend.What I love about every Hitchcock movie is that the story is so simple, the characters are soooo likable, the acting and direction is fantastic, the dialogue is entertaining and every single shot is done so well that you are never once bored during his movies. Notorious is nothing but what my expectations by Hitchcock movies were: A STRAIGHT TEN! This film achieves that expectation quite simply due to the fact that never was I ever bored during this movie like some have said. As a young teenager who has mainly watched sloppy CGI action movies, Notorious as well as all Hitchcock movies are nothing but masterpieces and a joy to watch Ingrid Bergman was truly fantastic in the movie as was Cary Grant and the two shared such great moments during the film. They really are the strong hold of the movie not to mention the guy playing Alex was fantastic, giving such a frightening yet loving performance.Notorious is nothing but a Hitchcock masterpiece and is easily on par with North by Northwest and Rear Window, my two other favorite Hitchcock movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love classic movies and, unbelievably, saw Notorious for the first time in my life today, Cary Grant's birthday. I am one of the unfortunate flu epidemic victims, stuck in bed for a week so far..Enough of me. Notorious is a brand new film to me. I was glued to the screen from the opening credits. The film captured every moment of tension, suspense, and is one i would call a Hitchcock masterpiece. I watched every moment, fixed on facial expression and looking for clues at every turn, from wine bottles to champagne corks popping. I'm sure that, at its time, it was probably considered almost traitorous. Devlin rescued Alicia just in time, and left Sebastian to his own group of traitors to face their judgment which, while not captured on film, the director and script leave no doubt as to his fate, along with his mother. Camera work was superb, musical track was not off by a note and I will make a point of seeing this again and again. Highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves patriotic movies, spy movies, and love stories, Notorious is a movie that combines all three, without any one part slowing it down. This movie hasn't aged, and is still timely today. Using Cary Grant in a role opposite his usual was genius casting. As dark, brooding Devlin, he embodies a man who has to push his desires aside, to allow his job take precedence, and leaving Ingrid Bergman to shine in a non-traditional role for her...the downtrodden, guilt ridden woman who is the daughter of a traitor, burying her guilt in a bottle, and by letting men take advantage of her. Devlin steps in at the right moment, to recruit her as an OSS agent, but falls in love unintentionally. It is also a time-honored theme of ultimate love surviving an evil empire, starting back to Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unequaled Hitchcock Espionage Thriller Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is a thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock that features Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains as three people whose lives become intimately entangled during an espionage operation.It is about an American daughter of a convicted Nazi spy that is recruited by a government agent to infiltrate a group of Germans living in Brazil after the war.Alicia Huberman, the American daughter of a convicted Nazi spy, is recruited by government agent T. R. Devlin to infiltrate an organization of Nazis who have relocated to Brazil after World War II Devlin is ordered to enlist the libidinous Alicia's aid in trapping Alexander Sebastian, the head of a Brazilian neo-Nazi group. Openly contemptuous of Alicia despite her loyalty to the American cause, Devlin calmly instructs her to woo and wed Sebastian, so that that good guys will have an "inside woman" to monitor the Nazi chieftain's activities. It is only after Alicia and Sebastian are married that Devlin admits to himself that he's fallen in love with her. The "MacGuffin" in this case is a cache of uranium ore, hidden somewhere on Sebastian's estate. Upon discovering that his wife is a spy, Sebastian balks at eliminating her until ordered to do so by his virago of a mother. Tension mounts to a fever pitch as Devlin, a day late and several dollars short, strives to rescue Alicia from Sebastian's homicidal designs. Of the several standout sequences, the film's highlight is an extended love scene between Alicia and Devlin, which manages to ignite the screen while still remaining scrupulously within the edicts of the Production Code. In later years, Hitchcock never tired of relating the story of how he and screenwriter Ben Hecht fell under the scrutiny of the FBI after electing to use uranium as a plot device which was futuristic as this was made before the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Hitchcock's Notorious is the most elegant expression of the master's visual style, just as Vertigo is the fullest expression of his obsessions.Also,it is characterized by a richly dense meditation on romantic love, featuring exquisite performances by Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant.Added to that,it is a nearly flawless espionage thriller that has been mimicked many times since, but never equaled. This makes this a bona-fide classic worthy of a watching at present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman were a real awesome duo! This is a brilliantly written film, I thought the plot was exciting and gripping, it had a good amount of tension, which kept the mood of the film. The romance was great, however it didn't follow the perfect romance, which I liked, it was perfect for the ending scene where Grant has to save Bergman. Even though I would have liked to have seen Ingrid get better and them live "happy ever after" I did like how it ended. I liked how Hitchcock left you with the assurance that the bad guy was going to meet justice, and I was okay with the rest being left to my imagination. I loved it, when I saw a short exert of it I knew I had to see it, and I am glad that I did, it was an EXCELLENT film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock is one of the most important directors ever, someone who changed film rules, film codes, who introduced a huge number of new terms to film grammar.He mastered and built new things around cinematic uses for camera movement, framing, and he bent narrative in marvelous brilliant ways. His top achievements can and must be studied by us today, they were the milestone for much of what followed, and in narrative terms, some things that he has done are still unsurpassed.But, even if today, i look at really old Hitchcock films and detect in them bits and pieces of what his intuition might be getting at, I really believe that the 50's were the the decade when he developed all the things for which i love him today, and believe him to be one of the masters. With Rope comes the first time in which he really builds something totally new, in that case bending camera movement, creating a cinematic eye, bright and new. Dial M... Rear Window, Vertigo, even Psycho. All those are works which you have to see.But before Rope, what we have are hints. In this film, there are a few bits of framing and camera movement which are really cleverly and conceived. The coffee cup framed while a dialogue is going on. The crane shot that begins opened to the house lobby space, and closes on Bergman's hand, holding the key. Those are really nice, and do something very hitchcockian: a scene where apparently nothing relevant happens (a trifle dialog, the simple arrival of guests), but through the camera movement and framing, a new meaning is given to a detail of the scene. Purely visual, few people worked as a purely visual mind as well as H.. But the grand picture, here and in nearly every film before Rope, is just not that great. As noir, this fails, because the world of this film is explained all the way, it's a simple spy story, which we follow based on the tension of the "is she gonna get caught?" scenes. Noir would require a bizarre unexplained world, something about us not knowing what's happening. This is a "mcguffin" type of construction, that stuff about the wine bottles, which are only good to make us want to follow. And Hitchcock always mastered that device, but his best results come when he uses that distraction to deliver us an incredible visual presentation for it. Not here.We do have Grant and Bergman, a hot couple back than. They do deliver their performance well enough. They do exhale some cinematic magic. And Ingrid was a real woman, and a real actress. But this film is mostly based upon style. And style, we know, fades in no time. So this film gives us not much today, because the master hadn't yet reached the perfection of his later cinematic manipulations of our visual minds. A few times before Rope he was close to achieve that. But here, he's just trying out a few solutions, but this film is a pure exercise in style, a style that is no longer the one we look for today.But Ingrid Bergman was some kind of a woman.My opinion: 2/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

He is just an amazing directed and especially in this film. I love the plot of this movie. I was little annoyed that it was another romantic film that they obviously end up together in the end. I loved the actress Ingrid, I thought she was great. I loved her accent and that she was one tough cookie, what she wanted that is what she wants.

		<shortDescription>The film will remain Notorious forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman had chemistry that came right through the screen. You almost feel as if this really happened to them. Ingrid's character was devoted to everything she did. If she was going to drink, she drank, if she was going to love she laid it all out there, and if she needed to marry someone she didn't love for the sake of the case, she married. That's probably why Ingrid seemed to be Alicia because she devoted herself to the character. Also, Alfred Hitchcock created some great moments with the camera. When Alicia was hung over and Delvin came over to her and how the camera turned as if it would have through her eyes. It was something I've never seen before as a perspective. The car ride was also such a great scene. They could have just had the background swivel and speed up and what not, but the addition of doing it in front of the car and through the mirror was smart to add.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb text book film, but with very little to teach about life and love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Notorious" is a textbook film for using dramatic irony to structure a story. Unfortunately, like the rest of Hitchcock's films, it left me emotionally cold. The film has a great deal to teach about screen-writing and film making, but very little to teach about life and love.It's a poor love story, and a poor spy story - the genre beats for these types of story are mostly missing from the film. It's the dramatic irony that makes it fascinating - different characters having different levels of knowledge at different times. All the main turning points revolve around a character having a "realisation" and catching up with what the audience already knows. Each moment of realisation creates a wonderful sense of peril and intrigue that are sustained right through the next sequence of scenes until the next realisation.Ingrid Bergman is astonishing to watch - her face tells us every thought she has. The film is slanted so that it's her story, rather than Cary Grant's.Is it a good film? No. But its a decidedly wonderful film to watch for writers, film makers, and Ingrid Bergman fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What might be in a champagne bottle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is unique in the Hitchcock pantheon, for something he rarely did - he made his "MacGuffin" mean something for a change.Made just as World War II ended, NOTORIOUS (like Orson Welles' THE STRANGER) picked up on the theme of what were yesterday's bogeymen (the Nazis) up to after they suffered the 1945 military defeat. There was a general suspicion that certain Latin American states (read Argentina, Paraguay) were havens for war criminals fleeing justice in Europe. This was true (we now know that Eichmann and Dr. Mengele were among those criminals who hid there for decades). But the issue was were they simply nursing their wounds or planning more evil actions in the future.The general feeling was that Nazis who fled remained Nazis, and would be preparing for a future come-back. This actually never happened (neither the Peron Government in Argentina nor the Stroessner Regime in Paraguay felt inclined to do more than protect these people on their soil. Argentina had potential as a major state, but it was still in a state of development. Paraguay was among the poorest countries in the world. But people were aware that there were vast untapped natural resources throughout South America, and large German communities in most of the countries. It was easy to jump to the conclusion that the fleeing Nazis would be trying to develop (in "secret") all kinds of weapons.From what he later said, Hitchcock had picked up on the subject of uranium in his reading. He always claimed that he had little real knowledge of it's use in atomic weapons. One finds that a little hard to totally believe, but in this one film he did use a sensible "MacGuffin" (his term for a secret that spins the plot of his stories along, which he thought nobody would really be interested in). He would have members of "Farben" (obviously the I.G.Farben company from Germany) in Brazil working on getting bottles full of uranium out of the mines of that country.The film itself is remarkable for the love triangle of Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. Grant is a Federal agent (O.S.S.?) who recruits Bergman for the government so she can distant herself from her father, an unrepentant Nazi agent convicted of treason. Grant realizes that Bergman is trying to clean her image up from being a party-loving slut, and the two do gradually fall in love. But the nature of her mission (to romance Rains, who formerly dated her) strains the relationship between them: she thinks he could have objected to his bosses (Louis Calhern and Moroni Olsen) choosing her for the job, and he thinks she could have turned it down flat if she really had changed. Rains problems are that he does love Bergman (who he does not suspect of double dealing with him), but is under the thumb of his mother (Madame Konstantyne) who has always disliked her "rivals" for her sons affections, but is particularly suspicious of Bergman turning up again.Hitchcock got some excellent film moments here, the two best being the "longest" kissing section of any film of the 1940s, and the suspense building section at a party in Rains' home, when Bergman and Grant are examining the wine cellar, while Rains' butler is keeping an eye on the declining number of champagne bottles in his ice bucket. The conclusion, when the principals are leaving the mansion for a car, and Rains' associates are watching is also a great conclusion, with it's ominous overtones as it ends.I will add one final point...as mentioned earlier the business about the champagne bottles and the uranium is a running theme in the film, but oddly enough Hitchcock did use champagne in another sequence - when Grant is going to have a cooked chicken dinner with Bergman, he buys a bottle of champagne. But in the moment of shock when he learns what her assignment will be, he leaves the bottle behind (absent minded), and subsequently recalls it at the end of his mutual recrimination scene with Bergman, when they find that the chicken dinner is cold. Then Grant discovers he does not know where the champagne bottle is. It is like Hitchcock had champagne bottles on his mind throughout this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well acted, intelligent film hindered by a disappointing end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is one of Hitchcock's most greatly revered films. In knowing this I tried to stay away from reviews and comments before launching into it, in order to try to keep my first viewing pure from outside influence. The plot is set up effectively in the first half an hour, presenting our two heroes Devlin (Grant) and Alicia (Bergman) as people who while come from very different backgrounds but share an impenetrable bond from when they first meet till the end of the film. This relationship these two characters share is the finest thing about 'Notorious', the chemistry between Grant and Bergman and the story of unrequited love they tell through it is a mastery of subtlety and gesture, particularly towards the end of the film. When without Grant, Bergman also shines playing Alicia, a woman who is thrust into a situation where she has to covertly investigate Alexander Sebastian; an accused traitor who the government believe Alicia can gain access to. While this in itself creates a successful thrilling plot device it also works very well as a comment of dehumanisation. To those in authority she is nothing more than tool to gain information and they urge her on to constantly put herself in dangerous situations to get the much needed evidence. When they finally have what they need, she is essentially discarded from their concern, even when she goes missing for an extended period of time.The direction from Hitchcock is true to his form, well paced, controlled and when necessary intense. The primary flaw with the film I would suggest is the ending. One could argue it was leaved in such an open manner in order for the audience to fill in what happens next, but because the final ten minutes are so romantic, intense and suspenseful it feels more anti climactic. Sometimes using this technique for the final of a film works well, but if feels like the story and characters need more explanation sometimes it can do substantial damage to a picture and I believe this is the case with Notorious. It felt like the film was just getting to the core of the relationship between Grant and Bergman and also the intricate relationship between Sebastian and his partners. But as both are becoming more visible and interesting, they are abruptly severed, leaving the audience not necessarily seeking resolution but further development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious (1946) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Alfred Hitchcock's thriller about a government agent (Cary Grant) who hires a woman (Ingrid Bergman) to spy on some spies connected to her father. Once again, it had been a while since I watched this film but I liked it a lot more this time than in the previous viewing, although I still had the same problem with it. Over the past couple years Cary Grant has become one of my favorite actors but (don't kill me) I feel his character is really poorly written here. Grant is up to his usual self but I think the film would have benefited by giving him a stronger character as it seems most of the time he's just sitting around not doing too much. True, by doing this he gives the film over to Bergman but a lesser actor could have done this role so I feel the screenplay isn't up to Grant's talent. Outside of that this is a perfect thriller with a terrific and suspenseful ending. That walk down the staircase seems to take minutes when it only lasts a few seconds but that's the director putting his usual greatness to work. Bergman is certainly the highlight here along with Claude Rains who delivers another very strong supporting performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film has just etched out a few of Hitchcock's other films of my all time Hitchcock films. ( 39 Steps still being #1) It is a film that honestly never lets up one bit and it contains one fantastic performance after another. The film's two stars: Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman also share a chemistry together that is just a must see for any actor, or movie fan. The basic plot of the film finds Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) going undercover to infiltrate a group of Nazi's who have relocated to Brazil after World War II. Cary Grant plays US Government Agent Devlin, Alicia's handler, who is ordered to convince her to marry Sebastian (Claude Rains), one of her convicted Nazi father's friends and one of her former lovers, to find out what he's plotting. But just how far will Alicia go in this assignment, and how far will Devlin allow her to go? This is what is at the heart of Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious. Tough yet very vulnerable Cary Grant has never been better. As Devlin, he hides true feelings for Alicia the entire film. This is the theme of love vs. duty done at it's best: as Devlin is torn between his true feelings for Alicia and his perceived duty. The entire film, he can't reconcile his love for Alicia with his own fear of losing her or with his own self-loathing. I think one of the greatest scenes of Grant's acting career is in a scene-in which his CIA superior disparages Alicia for her apparent lack of "character" she has shown by following the same very own orders Devlin and his superiors have given her. Lashing out Devlin simply says: "She may be risking her life, but when it comes to being a *lady,* she doesn't hold a candle to your wife, sir, sitting in Washington playing bridge with three other ladies of great honor and virtue." Also, how in the hell did Ingrid Bergman manage to be skipped out of the Oscar's for this movie? She wasn't even nominated! What? The range of her performance throughout the entire film is astonishing... vulnerable, strong, and simply gorgeous Bergman is simply brilliant. Not to mention that pout she does...... There are so many moments I could list as my favorite. But, I wouldn't even know where to start. So, I'll just mention some of the scenes that just knocked me silly. The first one, is the scene where Sebastian realizes that something is up and he goes to his mother (Leopoldine Konstantin) confessing that " I'm married to an American Agent." Konstantin's acting in this scene is so chilling, jeez. She basically says nothing except for a smile of grim satisfaction (she was right about that rival for her son's affections after all) grabs a cigarette and lights it up. The second is the scene where Alicia realizes she has just been poisoned and Hitchcock just centers on a huge close up of Sebastian and his mother. Brilliant. "Darling. What is it?" And lastly, is probably the scene of the film where Devlin carries a very poisoned Alicia out of the mansion in full view of the conspirators, leaving the hapless Sebastian to the non-existent mercy of his "friends". "Alex, will you come in, please? I wish to talk to you." "If you only once had said that you loved me. Oh, Dev." "Listen. You chalked up another boyfriend. That's all. No harm done." "I hate you." "There's no occasion to. You're doing good work. Number 10's out in front. It looks as if Sebastian knows how to pick 'em." "Is that all you have to say to me?" "Dry your eyes baby.

		<fullReview>There was something very minimalistic about this film as it started out.But as the story progressed, especially in the 1 hour mark, Hitchcock performs his usual sleight of hand as a filmmaker. From the best stylized POV shots, to the foreground shot of the evil coffee cup that you see in many film-making textbooks today.But all throughout the film is a study of subjectivity vs. objectivity in storytelling, most of the time we are privvy to what goes on in our hero, and especially our anti-heroine Bergman's mind, but then that privy-ness of information is then passed on to our antagonists - yet audiences still in the know. And that is where the suspense comes from.Grant is as suave as always. This is definitely better than To Catch a Thief, but I am having trouble deciding whether I should rank it above North By Northwest (which had better storytelling, imho).NOTORIOUS is all about subtletly, in suspense, in exposition, despite the presence of Hitchcock's cinematic wizardry in it. The ending has one of the most quiet yet intense scenes where our 2 main characters come to terms and realizations. And despite the darker tone this one has over "Northwest" or even "Rear Window", I'm glad it doesn't end morbidly like Psycho or Vertigo. Spoilers for those films there.NOTORIOUS is 5/5 in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully structured film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is definitely one of Hitchcock's best films. The topicality of the atom bomb set against the eternal theme of love and redemption make the film timeless. I was particularly struck by the symmetry of the first and last scenes. The movie begins and ends behind the door of courtroom in the opening shot and what has become a courtroom for Sebastian in the final shot. Similarly the recruitment by Devlin of the hung-over Alicia at the beginning is mirrored by his rescue of the poisoned Alicia at the end - similar POV low angle shots and lighting. In between these bookends there is all the great stuff written about in these comments- the extended, claustrophobic kisses, the I-hurt-you/you-hurt-me relationship of Devlin and Alicia, the extraordinary acting from all, and possibly the best line in cinema from Mrs Sebastian - "We are protected by the enormity of your stupidity. For a time." One other interesting note- Selznick sold the contract of Hitchcock to RKO in order to finance his out of control production of the rather horrible Duel in the Sun, his paean to his then new flame Jennifer Jones. RKO gave Hitchcock much more freedom than he ever had with Selznick as a producer and he came though with a masterpiece. After Notorious he completed his contract for Selznick (who had brought him over from England) with the very mediocre The Paradine Case. All this was covered in a wonderful PBS American Masters episode on the two men. Free of Selznick, he then went on to direct a series of popular films in the 50's and 60's that I think are unequaled by any director in their quality and impact on the culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The daughter of a Nazi sympathizer agrees to marry a strange man in a foreign country in an attempt to clear her father's name. The plot is preposterous and the characters are undeveloped. Bergman meets Grant at a party and is madly in love with him by the end of the evening and is willing to ruin her life for him. Why? In a weird bit of casting, Rains' mother is played by an actress who was three years older than him and they look about the same age. It is surprising that this espionage drama is regarded by many as one of Hitchcock's best. The story is mildly interesting and the suspense is minimal. Still, it's always a pleasure to watch a couple of pros like Bergman and Grant and there are enough Hitchcock touches to make it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's greatest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The definitive film of suspense legend Alfred Hitchcock, NOTORIOUS is one of the purest exercises of grueling suspense that has ever been captured on celluloid. Few films can successfully mesh political intrigue with gloomy romance and top it off with a slowly-building murder plot, but Hitchcock effortlessly pulls off the near impossible by managing to weave all of the various plot threads into one haunting tragedy. This is a truly character driven film - although the containing numerous examples of the masterful set pieces that Hitchcock is known for, the technique never overshadows the film's characters, who emerge as living human beings rather than shallow plot contrivances. Arguably, viewers make a stronger emotional connection to NOTORIOUS' characters than that of any other Hitchcock film.Having already been Hollywood's most successful male star for more than a decade at the time, Cary Grant took a considerable gamble when he accepted the role NOTORIOUS' anti-hero, T. R. Devlin. Grant had flirted with playing potentially unsympathetic characters before in Howard Hawks' HIS GIRL Friday (1940) and Hitchcock's SUSPICION (1941), but never before had the charismatic actor been so willing to risk sex symbol image on such an embittered characterization. For perhaps the only time in his lengthy career, Cary Grant truly plays a vile misogynist - and the actor has seldom been more brilliant. Mr. Grant has long been my very favorite motion picture actor, so it is with considerable praise that I proclaim that NOTORIOUS is the best showcase for his monumental talent.No stranger to controversy herself, Ingrid Bergman is every bit Grant's match in a conflicted portrayal of a woman who is perpetually misused by her father, her lover, and even her own government. Bergman's Alicia is arguably Hitchcock's most tragic heroine, and the complex character is perfectly suited to Bergman's incomparable strengths as an actress. A faultless blend of strength with vulnerability and love with hatred, Bergman is one of the only thespians (living or dead) who could pull off such a difficult balancing act with falling into caricature. In addition to the mesmerizing leads, the film is further enhanced by a flawless supporting cast, particularly the gravely-voiced Claude Rains in a chilling-yet-sympathetic performance as a Nazi spy, and a bravura turn by Leopoldine Konstantin as the silver screen's most sinister mother.The film has several of the elaborate set-pieces that Hitchcock built his reputation on, and they all rank among the director's best. Alicia and Devlin's discovery of mineral deposits in Sebastian's wine cellar, Sebastian noticing the re-appearance of a particular key on his key ring, and Alicia's horrifying realization of exactly what is occurring to her are all classic moments in Hitchcock's massive cannon of films. Even more impressively, so much of the action is carried out in complete silence without relying on the benefit of dialogue to explain the on screen occurrences. Few directors posses the necessary skill that Hitchcock displays in creating sequences like these, and they all come together perfectly in NOTORIOUS - which is the director's greatest achievement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is I can say without regret the best film director ever to live. He has had many masterpieces. His best is in my opinion Psycho and this film Notorious is likely second place just before The Birds and The Man Who Knew Too Much. Hitchcock has had many other masterpieces such as North By Northwest and others but these would be his best. Ingrid Bergman gave what is in my opinion the best female lead performance ever in Casablanca and her performance here in Notorious is not much worse although I could probably think of one or two other performances that are in between these two wonderful performances. Claude Rains is also wonderful as is Cary Grant but they can't match the magic of Ingrid Bergman. The direction is as you would expect from Alfred Hitchcock. Amazing. The script is also flawless in it's crafting and writing. A wonderful classic film that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After meeting a government agent named T. R. Devlin (Cary Grant) at a party, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is offered a job in Rio de Janeiro where she must spy on a Nazi named Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains) who has drawn some attention from the American government. With a past of affairs and alcoholism, she seemed like the perfect woman to seduce a Nazi, but finds herself in a complicated relationship with Devlin, as she rapidly becomes more intimate with Alex Sebastian to the point of marriage.Alfred Hitchcock made many incredible films, but Notorious is most certainly one of the best. With an Oscar-worthy performance given by Ingrid Bergman as well as splendid editing and screenplay, Notorious is simply stunning in every aspect. Hitchcock takes an already terrifying situation and turns it in to a classic hear-thumping thriller, proving once again to be the master of the drama. There really isn't that much needed to be said about the film except that the performances are blissful and the editing is some of the best I have ever seen. Overall, Notorious is a highly enjoyable classic thriller by the master of thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock.I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Or: How Hitchcock turned an average script into a good film (again)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film underlines precisely why Hitchcock is, justifiably, regarded as one of the all-time greatest directors. With Notorious he basically took a fairly average script and turned what could have been a lacklustre film noir into an involving thriller, full of Hitchcock's trademark apprehension and suspense. All the Hitchcockian devices are there - the MacGuffin, those eerie pans and focuses on suspect devices (though, curiously, the heroine is not a blonde for a change but Hitchcock's one-time object of desire, the one and only Ingrid Bergman).Say what you like about Hitchcock, he understood, possibly better than many of his contemporaries, that the script itself is merely the skeleton of a film. Neglect the rest, ie. camera, sound, editing, casting, etc, and you still end up with only less than half a body of work. The story itself is nothing special; it's the techniques Hitchcock used to tell the story which matter and which draw you into the narrative. While the set admittedly does look somewhat outdated (Grant and Bergman obviously never went anywhere near Rio De Janeiro, instead being cast in front of a screen), you can't fault Hitchcock or anyone else directly involved in the making of this film for constraints put upon them by film-making procedures of the day. In other words, blame the studio system, not the cast or the director.Notorious, alongside Rebecca, was the movie which firmly established Hitchcock in the Hollywood elite and gave him the platform on which he could create his more experimental works, starting with Rope and moving on to Rear Window and Vertigo, and in a way it can be seen as part of the bridge between Hitchcock's noir-ish work of the 1940s and what was, to all intents and purposes, his avantgarde period of the 1950s. In other words, it's a benchmark film.Recommended to fans of the director (though I'll suspect most of them will have seen Notorious already) and 1940s film noir in general.</fullReview>

This is Alfred Hitchcock's best film, even better than great films like Vertigo, Psycho, Rear Window, and North by Northwest. Although Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant give incredible performances, Claude Rains steals the show. He was deservedly Oscar-nominated for this film.In the movie, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is recruited by government agent named Devlin (Cary Grant) to spy on Alicia's father's friend, Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains), a Nazi. Alicia is in love with Devlin, and is surprised when Sebatian asks her to marry him. Devlin and other agents convince her to accept so that she can find out Sebastian' secrets.The movie is filled with memorable sequences. Hitchcock creates an enormous amount of tension in a scene in a wine cellar, and the ending of the movie is done perfectly. I heavily recommend this movie to anybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film by Hitch that neatly bridges his early, period with the later stuff in the 50s and 60s. Great script, camera work, and acting from Bergman, Grant and Raines.Like many of Hitchcock's best films, the details of this thriller are not really the point. Raines is a Nazi, living in Brazil post-WWII, and Bergman and Grant are out to get him. If you pay too much attention to the details, it all seems rather silly. Why are the Nazis hiding uranium ore in wine bottles? Does Bergman really need to marry Raines to pull this off? And so on.Instead, the movie is really about a love triangle, and the ability of people to change. Add all that great dialogue, and some slowly building suspense (which probably seems a bit dated by today's standards), and you've got one of Hitchcock's best.A must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Plot line; A Fine Production; Bergman is Wonderful Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film with a very absorbing plot line, Ingrid Bergman's interesting character brought to life by her luminous performance, and solid but unspectacular technical achievements. The wonder of it, for me, is that it is a film as watchable as it is. Alfred Hitchcock did not invent but did advance the non-crime noir film--the film about a central character whose ethical purpose places him beyond the help of those authorities and agencies whose defined job it is to help a citizen like him. The character played by Bergman, Miss Huberman, is recruited by Cary Grant's agency in the film to do a job for them, to erase her father's guilt in espionage matters. When against his will agent Devlin, played by Grant, finds himself forgiving her past , caring about her and falling in love with her, the already-complex task she has been assigned, marrying the bad guy played by Claude Rains and finding out how he has been committing his crimes--and getting out alive--becomes all the harder for both of them. In the cast besides Grant who does better than one might expect and Miss Bergman are Rains, Leopoldine Konstantine as his abominable mother, solid Moroni Olsen, Louis Calhern, evil Reinhold Schunzel, Fay Baker and many others in smaller parts. Cinematography is by Ted Tetzlaff, a noted director himself, music by prolific Roy Webb. The sets by Claude E. Carpenter and Darrell Silvera and Edith Head's wardrobe for Bergmann are outstanding. But the film does not have the spaciousness nor the flow of Hitchcock's best. What is does have is a fine, taut and well-crafted script by Ben Hecht, Clifford Odetts and director Hitchcock, that makes all the difference. The pace is that of a drama, but the action is that of a clever mystery story, featuring gradual revelations, tense scenes between a doubting Devlin and a bitter Huberman and a bang-up climax and ending satisfying to all. What keeps it from greatness is the idea that Grant won't love Bergman and nearly gets them both killed because of that failing. But this is a B/W gem, even better than its reputation, a film worthy of many screenings, in my judgment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another great film by Alfred Hitchcock. "Notorious" was good then, is good now and will still be good in 100 years from now. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman are both at the top of their game. Bergman is actually stealing the show from Grant in this one. She's got the leading role. The chemistry between the two is palpable and although they can't long at each other the way it would be depict today, you can still feel the growing love between Devlin and Alicia. Some scenes are funny: Bergman driving while drunk. Suspense is also a prominent ingredient of the film: when the Champagne is running down, when Sebastian learn that his wife might not be telling the entire truth. Hitchcock makes great use of the camera. Some shots are superb: Alicia lying in bed, suffering from a hang-over, looking at Devlin entering the room; the transfer of the key, etc. And I like how the movie ends without any useless frills. In fact, I saw the movie on DVD and in the extras, there was the alternate endings to the movie. Thank God Hitch chose this one.88/100 (***?)

		<fullReview>I have read recent comments that suggest this film is one of the weaker Hitchcock films based on the current relevance of the storyline. I would debate this point, as I find Cary Grant's reluctance to believe that, in Ingrid Bergman's character, he can be so in love with a less than perfect woman, to consistently provide me with entertainment, no matter how often I watch the film.However, I think the primary strengths of Notorious lie in its execution. With the possible exception of Psycho, I think this is Hitchcock at his most assured. He was at his prime making this movie and he knew it.Observe how little acting takes place. Instead, camera movement and angles show us insight into character. When Claude Rains tells his mother he has been "had", there is an astonishing shot from above that puts us into his state of mind. Alicia's realisation that she is being poisoned is shown to us via marvelous editing.And who can forget the two staircase shots? The first, in which the key in Alicia's hand is revealed and the second, in which Dean Devlin and Alicia descend the staircase with either death or freedom awaiting them at the bottom...</fullReview>

Hitchcock doesn't take the time to develop or even explain the whole plot behind the stakeout or the sand in the wine bottles, but that's because it isn't needed. The love story is so passionate, and there are enough thrills to keep you glued to your screen.

		<fullReview>Anyone wondering why Alfred Hitchcock got his reputation as "the master of suspense" has only to view NOTORIOUS to see how he directs two of the biggest box-office stars of the 1940s in his suspenseful spy classic.Basically,it's the story of twisted love with Bergman marrying Nazi (Claude Rains) in order to infiltrate herself into his plans against the U.S. while falling in love with the American agent (Grant) who gave her the mission. Rains is dominated by a strong-willed mother, played with chilling menace by Leopoldine Constantin. The suspense really goes into high gear when she and her son discover that Bergman is an agent and must be slowly poisoned so as not to expose themselves to Nazi brutality.Bergman is radiant as the reluctant Mata Hari. Grant shuns most of his well-known tricks so effortlessly displayed in comedies. Here he is a more subdued, more serious romantic leading man. His extended kissing scene with Bergman that begins on an outdoor terrace and ends by a wall telephone is typical Hitchcock romanticism.As usual, it is Claude Rains who turns up the menace at an appropriate moment. His sudden discovery that Bergman's marriage to him is a sham is conveyed in a chilling close-up that reveals the crafty plan he has in mind for her demise.If you're a fan of Hitchcock, Grant or Bergman, you can't afford to miss NOTORIOUS. An added plus is Roy Webb's effective background score, lushly romantic while setting the tone for suspense.</fullReview>

Grant and Bergman are magic and I especially love her as the drunk partygiver/driver out to have a picnic. Rains brings 3 dimensions to his character (at least!). Interesting parallels between many simultaneous levels of interpretation: i.e. appearance, reality, and what one believes of oneself. This is my personal favorite Hitchcock movie; I'm not really a big Hitchcock fan, because he tends to be too removed from the emotions involved and too in love with the images he projects. But this is a really heartfelt movie, and a lot of the credit has to go to the man who may be the greatest Hollywood screenwriter of them all, Ben Hecht.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films just don't come like this one anymore. First of all, NOTORIOUS is directed by Alfred Hitchcock--which is always a good reason to see a film, and often one's only reason to pick it up in the first place. NOTORIOUS is a stunning work of art: no one made black and white work for the film and the actors as much as Hitchcock did; Ingrid Bergman has never looked lovelier, nor Cary Grant handsomer. Some of the shots, such as Alicia (Bergman) looking up at Devlin (Grant) from the bed, are so simple and yet wonderfully effective. The way Hitchcock's camera closes in tightly on the faces of Alicia and Devlin during passionate scenes adds a new level of intimacy to their relationship that one can't get even with the best actors in the business (and that's what Bergman and Grant were). In other words, his direction--the placement of an object, the reaction or long shot of another character--isn't of the 'hey, take a look at me' variety. It's unobstrusive and subtle, and yet one can't help noticing it while watching the film. Second of all, the film stars Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant, Bergman in surely what is one of her finest roles (and I'm saying this with NOTORIOUS being the first film of hers I've seen to date). The love story between Alicia and Devlin happens so quickly that one really couldn't believe it if Bergman didn't play a girl in love so very convincingly. The look on her face each time Devlin refuses to speak up for her in her presence (he has no problem doing so when she's not around!) is positively heartbreaking. And since it is also difficult to believe that anyone could fail to fall in love with Ingrid Bergman, who surely must have one of the most luminous and photographable faces in the history of film, Cary Grant doesn't have all that much work to do with his slightly mysterious character of an intelligence agent named Devlin (whose first name we and Alicia never learn). His role is decidely a supporting one for Bergman to really show her stuff, and like the gentleman he is, he plays the role he's given and doesn't try to steal her scenes. That said, he really is just perfect in the role, and every time Dev pretends that Alicia's dates and marriage with Alex (Claude Rains) don't bother him, it's easy to see his heart break just a little more beneath the cool undisturbed surface. Bergman and Grant together are, of course, electric, from their first kiss to their passionate scene in the Sebastians' bedroom. ("Tell me again. It keeps me awake.") Watching the actors acting in this film is almost a good enough reason to watch this film again... almost only because the whole film itself provides the best reason one could have.Finally, NOTORIOUS doesn't have a shoddy script--to the contrary, it's full of great lines and dialogue, even though the plot itself has now become quite typical of spy-thrillers. (Girl becomes intelligence agent, falls in love with her contact etc. etc.) It still feels fresh with this film though, and one still cares deeply about what happens to the characters. The dialogue is quietly witty, peppered with little things that make the viewer smile but don't detract from the atmosphere simultaneously being built up by the film. In fact, one never knows what kind of people Devlin and Alicia really are; what information you have you pick up from conversations between the characters, so in the end all you really know is that Devlin and Alicia are in love, and that's all that matters. Do yourself a favour and watch NOTORIOUS, preferably knowing as little about it as possible (I've tried to keep my review more or less spoiler-free). It won't take you long to fall in love with it--it really is quite a film for so little story.</fullReview>

A perfunctory "nest of spies" story takes a back seat to the strange love triangle of Cary Grant, Ingrid Berman, and Claude Rains. This latter element is brilliantly played by the three stars and features typical Hitchcock irony: the man she loves (Grant) doesn't trust Bergman, while the man who loves her (Rains) trusts her too much. The film also includes two classic sequences, both involving the key to wine cellar, and one of Hitch's memorable supporting characters, Rains's mother. It also includes one of the screen's greatest kisses, by Grant and Bergman. As a love story, it gets a 10; as a thriller, a 7.</fullReview>

A film that targets to viewer's psychology, based on what he/she wishes to see. Is it a Romance or Thriller? In both, or better with both, we have a masterpiece, nothing less. It's a classic romantic espionage thriller, done in the classic Hitchcock style, and involving two of his favorite things: romance and suspense. Notorious is a flawless movie that holds up in 2015 and seems completely fresh. The characters are complex, due to a note perfect script by the great Ben Hecht, one of the great film writers, surprisingly naturalistic and intense performances from film icons Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains, and of course, Hitchcock's visual mastery. One of the very best works of the American period of the great Alfred Hitchcock with both fist-class names in Hollywood, Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman . Golden moments of thriller, which managed to be written as one of the greatest masterpiece of Hollywood Golden Era. Hitchcock rocks in that film, Ingrid Bergman gives her best performance ever, Cary Grant suits perfect his role and Claude Rains gives his best performance. Definitely in my top 20 films and also in my top 5 favorite Hitchcock flicks. The friendship and chemistry on-screen between the protagonists (Grant, Bergman) is truly my favorite of all. I believe that this masterpiece is even better than the all-time classic Casablanca, plus the screen couple Bergman-Grant is better than the all-time classic screen couple of Casablanca (Bogart-Bergman). A real gem...all the performances are on great. I love both Ingrid and Cary Grant in everything they have performed.Furthermore, Notorious is a finely crafted, sumptuously produced romantic thriller that has the distinction of featuring director Hitchcock, and stars Grant and Bergman at their collective best. I still cannot believe-accept-understand that this masterpiece has only 2 academy award nominations (Best Actor in a Supporting Role : Claude Rains, Best Writing, Original Screenplay : Ben Hecht), 1 Cannes Film Festival nomination (Grand Prize of the Festival : Alfred Hitchcock). Thank God it receives 1 award (Bambi Awards : Best Actress - International for Ingrid Bergman).How Academy Awards couldn't award or at least give 1 nomination for this masterpiece. I still cannot realize how Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant have never won an Oscar. What did the Academy think of? And what is the Academy thinking of now? To conclude, Notorious is one of the best films ever. In the last few decades our society has lost so much class, especially in cinema. Notorious never gets old and I fall in love with this gem again every time I watch it. They just don't make movies like this very often!!! Wherever you are Mr. Hitchcock, thank you. Not only for this masterpiece,but for all your films and your overall offer to cinema. You will always be the Master of Cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World's Scariest Mother In Law</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:One of the crown jewels in the Hitch library featuring a cast without equal: Grant, Bergman, Rains, Callhern, you need this in your library. After Alicia's Nazi father is put in prison, and later kills himself, Devlin is a Fed that puts the arm on Alicia to go undercover in Rio to ferret out a Nazi spy ring currently up to no good. Devlin gets Alicia so enamored with him, after a little wining and dining, that she reluctantly agrees to be Sebastian's squeeze again. Wait until you meet his mother, a human tarantula, with piercing, malevolent eyes. Even when she attempts to be cordial, she circles Alicia like a scorpion studying where to sting you. Alicia fools Sebastian, who is not thinking with the right part of his body. Who could blame him, she looks gorgeous. The mother in law starts in right away looking to pries the two apart. Alicia discovers that the Nazi ring is concealing something in champagne bottles because when one of the Nazi's creates a ruckus, in front of her, over one of the bottles, he disappears forever. We see what happened, one of the Nazis takes him on one of those one way rides over a cliff. The movie is very suspenseful. There is a room that only Sebastian has the key to, Alicia has to steal it, get a party set up, and get Devlin into the wine cellar. Suffice to say, things do not go well. They discover the uranium ore alright but Devlin knocks a bottle off shattering the ore and glass all about the floor. Sebastian almost catches them, they pretend to be making out, but he sees the dirt and glass; the bottle's vintage years do not match. Sebastian and his evil mother start poisoning Alicia to death. They are forced to, they know what the Nazis would do to both of them for a lapse like this. It is done cleverly, with her coffee, but the Nazi doctor makes the error of almost drinking the poison cup; Sebastian and his mom freak out and Alicia knows why she is so sick. I will not spoil the rest for you. It is a very well written and acted little treasure. Sociologically, study how the Nazis are portrayed; not a trace of revisionism, this soon after the war. They are delineated as ruthless, cruel monsters just like they were. It never strains credulity like the dreadful remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much. You will return to it over and over for the performances of a great ensemble. One of Hitch's Best Movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch's Darkest and Most Powerful Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant is the most amazing actor in the 20th century. You know that comic genius in His Girl Friday? Hey, it's the same guy. What a dark performance from a master comedian. Here Grant is so contained, so cold, so wary of women. This movie is James Bond for grown-ups. He's a good guy, but he's also a bad guy. What makes this movie so amazing is that Claude Rains, the Nazi, is nicer to Ingrid Berman than Cary Grant is. Way nicer. He's a better man. For most of the movie Cary Grant is like the Nazi mom. He and she are both wary of emotions and love and how vulnerable your heart can make you. And love makes you vulnerable. It's true. Nazi mom is going to die because she loves her son, and her son is going to die because he fell in love with Ingrid Bergman.Notorious is a movie about the dangers of love and sex. It's dangerous to be vulnerable and open, like Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains. When you're a nice, open person, you can end up a whore, or murdered by Nazis for sexual indiscretions. Repress! Close yourself off from your own emotions, like Cary Grant or Nazi mom do. Be mean and controlling and strong. And then you find out that you're cold and evil. This is a movie about restraining your passion, hiding it away. You need to do this if you want power and authority, but you lose your humanity when you do this. You become an ideological tool and a bad person. What a great film. What an amazing artist Hitch was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Slow and plodding post WWII espionage drama by the "Master", Alfred Hitchcock, himself that has to do with this band of Nazis, "The Boys from Brazil", who fled to Rio De Jenerio after the fall of the Third Reich and are planning to make a comeback in bringing the Reich back to all its past glories. That's by arming it, when it comes back from the dead, with nuclear weapons that they plan to build with uranium ore deposits from a secret uranium mind hidden deep in the Amazon jungle.It's up to US Government Secret Agent T.R Devlin, Cary Grant, to find out just what these Nazis are up to and nip them, and their plans for world conquest, in the bud before they ever get off the ground. In Miami Devlin recruits the, at the time he met her, almost dead drunk but strikingly beautiful Alicia Huberman, Ingrid Bergman, to get inside the Nazi group by her marrying one of their top men Alex Sabastian, Claud Rains. It's Alex, a friend of her father convicted Nazi war criminal John Huberman, whom Alicia had a hot and heavy love affair with before the war. This isn't easy for Devlin since he falls in love with Alicia and the thought of her marrying Alex, even for God &amp; Country,totally repels him! Everything works like clockwork with Alex meeting Alicia at the exclusive Rio De Jenerio horse riding club and soon, within 48 hours, marrying her. But it's Alex wise old momma Madam Anna Sabastian, Leopoldine Konstantin, who smells a rat in Alicia and soon, to her son's Alex great shock, proves to be right! Dead right! For both her son and herself! The movie goes on and on endlessly with both Devlin and Alicia blowing their cover by smooching all over the place right in front of Alicia's outraged husband Alex who seems unable or unwilling to do anything about it! It's when Devlin finds a wine bottle, vintage 1934, in the Sabastian Mansion's wine cellar that's loaded with uranium ore that the truth is finally discovered, in analyzing what's in it, in what Alex and his Nazi friends are really up to. That's besides them partying the night away,which is all they seem to be doing, and getting smashed on champagne every night of the week!**SPOILERS*** It's when Alex finally comes to his senses in that he's being used, by Secret Agent Devlin and his wife Alicia, to destroy the "Boys from Brazil" Nazi gang that he's a member of that he and Momma, Madam Sabastian, plan to murder Alicia! That's in order to prevent Alex's fellow Nazis from finding out that she's a US Secret Agent, that he was married to, by slowly poisoning her by spiking her morning afternoon and evening coffees! This works for a while until Devlin gets a whiff of what the two, Momma &amp; Son, are doing but by then with Alica near death from coffee poisoning it may be too late. Too late for Alicia that is! Almost laughable ending sequence with an on the brink of death Alicia being carried to safety to his parked car by Devlin, who crashed into her bedroom, as Momma Alex with the rest of the on the lamb, from the law, Nazis just standing there having no idea, with the exception of Alex &amp; Momma, what's happening right in front of their eyes! Alex left out in the cold in being exposed in exposing his fellow Nazis secret plans for world conquest can now only wait for the end to come when his Nazi cohorts finally get their hands on him. In the end Agent Devlin gets the girl, Alicia, and Alex gets the business, from his fellow Nazis, despite the fact that he and Alicia were cheating on her husband Alex Sabastian! Something that the Hollywood film code at that time considered a no-no with both of them, according to the code, having to end up dead by the time the movie ended! But with Alicia's husband being a die in the wool Nazi I guess this one time the both strict and uncompromising Hollywood code overlooked that fact!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me, it's a flawless film--camera-work, story, acting, and editing are superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious (1946)Such a tumultuous, ever-changing plot, filled with real romance and political intrigue, filmed with visual panache, and acted to perfection. What is there to not like here? It strikes me as a perfect movie, really. Okay, yes, I don't like one line the Brazilian police official offers a meeting. And Cary Grant can't, as usual, kiss like her really means it. But this is nitpicking a really full blooded, interesting, beautiful movie.Alfred Hitchcock was always a little proud that he foresaw the importance of uranium as he was filming the movie, and along with "Detour" it is among the first movies in an atomic age to confront the problem. Ingrid Bergman acts her heart out here, and is more than a match for both Cary Grant and Claude Rains. This might be when Hitchcock said to her, "Ingrid, it's just a movie." Which says a lot about both of them--Hitchcock, wanting to remind everyone that movies are an entertainment, a commercial product, and Bergman wanting to show that movies were an outlet for the most intense kind of acting. By the way, the writing is by the incomparable Ben Hecht.The film was shot in the U.S., as usual, with lots of back projected scenes of Rio to make it seem like it was Brazil, where the story was set. Most of this is fairly convincing, but in usual Hitchcock fashion, I don't think he fully cared, as long as you got the idea. (This is a little like the backdrops on a stage set, where you know fully well it's all a sham, but you go along with it because that's how theater works.) The famous kiss between Grant and Bergman outside the hallway by the wine cellar got around the Hays Code rules about passionate kisses by having them stop and start kissing over and over. This makes it even sexier, really, even though they never quite actually kiss--even Bogart and Bergman have better kisses in "Casablanca."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You're sore because you've fallen for a little drunk you tamed in Miami and you don't like it. It makes you sick all over, doesn't it? People will laugh at you, the invincible Devlin, in love with someone who isn't worth even wasting the words on."This is an excellent movie. That's all you really need to know. This is going to be one of my gushing reviews, because I absolutely loved Notorious. If you'd rather not sit and read through a few paragraphs of nothing but praise, you can stop now.&nbsp;I thought I had seen the best of what Hitchcock had to offer. I had already watched most of his most popular movies, and the last few lesser known films of his that I had watched were good, but not great. I expected Notorious to be of similar quality. I was completely wrong. By the end of the movie, it had jumped right up to third on my list, behind only Rear Window and Psycho. It's just that good.Notorious is&nbsp;essentially a spy-thriller with an excellent, mature love story weaved throughout. I won't reveal many details, to preserve the story, but it's one of the very best of its kind. A wanton party girl (and daughter of a recently uncovered Nazi traitor) is pressed into service for the U.S. and used to spy on a sinister but nebulous Nazi plot in Brazil. That may sound like familiar territory for the genre, but most of the films that came later and copied it don't manage to be nearly as fresh and well-made as this movie from 1946.Two more things absolutely have to be mentioned, and I'll be done: Ingrid Bergman's performance and the ending. This was my introduction to Ingrid, and holy $@*!, this lady could act! I finally understand her inevitably high position in any credible list of the best actresses in the history of Hollywood. The majority of the acting burden rests on her shoulders, and she pulls it off effortlessly. Her character is completely different in the beginning, middle, and end of the movie, and she's consistently excellent throughout. I'll be seeing more of her work, that's for sure.As for the finale, it's one of the most tense, suspenseful, menacing and masterful that I've ever seen - and there's nary a gunshot or an explosion to be had. There's not even much of a confrontation. If you want to know why Aldred Hitchcock is considered to be one of the greatest directors ever, watch that sequence.If you love spy movies, you must watch Notorious. If you love classic movies, you must watch Notorious. If you want to love classic movies, you must watch Notorious. Basically, you must watch Notorious. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cruel Costs Of Love &amp; Duty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Notorious", a troubled atmosphere grows as the audience's expectations are repeatedly defied. What seems to begin as an espionage thriller rapidly develops into an intense and twisted love story. An elegant visual style is used to portray acts of deception, betrayal, vicious plotting and attempted murder. An apparently honourable and patriotic man conspires to deliver the woman he loves into the arms of another man and an important member of a Nazi spy ring is actually a charming, sincere and sympathetic character. Even more strangely, the daughter of a convicted Nazi spy, who has a reputation for promiscuity, partying and drinking exploits, agrees to take part in a U.S. Government assignment which she knows will place her in mortal danger. The unsettling impact of all this is also complemented visually by the use of camera angles which seem to disrupt any natural symmetry and some unorthodox shots such as those which focus on the back of the main protagonists' heads.The conflicts encountered by characters who have to choose between patriotic duty and love, the inherent lack of trust that exists between people who are actually in love with each other and the complicated motivations involved, all serve to create a palpable sense of tension which is further heightened by the desperately dangerous and life threatening positions they frequently find themselves in.After the father of Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is convicted of treason, she hosts a party where she meets T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant). She soon realises that this is no chance meeting and Devlin, who is a U.S. Intelligence Agent, offers her a job which involves infiltrating a group of Nazis in Brazil to gather information about their activities. She agrees to go to Rio with Devlin and during the days immediately after they arrive there, the couple enjoy each other's company and gradually fall in love. Things change however, after Devlin is called to a meeting with his superior officer who explains that the proposed assignment would require Alicia to seduce Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains) so that she could be well placed to discover the precise nature of the group's activities.When Devlin returns to Alicia, he adopts a much colder and more distant manner and then explains what would be required of her. She becomes uncertain and seeks his advice. He, possibly for professional or patriotic reasons, refuses to oblige and she presumes that this is a sign that he doesn't genuinely love her and so she accepts the job.Sebastian had been a friend of Alicia's father and it was well known that he'd had a crush on her. This made Alicia's task relatively easy and in a very short time, she marries Sebatian as planned and after returning from the honeymoon, quickly familiarises herself with the layout of their new home. She is able to gain access to all areas of the mansion except the wine cellar and discovers from the butler that Sebastian has the only key. After reporting back to Devlin, she agrees to throw a party, which he attends, and she takes the key from her husband's keyring and passes it to Devlin so that he can slip away and explore the contents of the cellar. This leads to the discovery of a bottle in which a mineral (later identified as uranium) is stored.Although the operation is successful, Sebastian realises almost immediately what has happened and recognises the part which Alicia has obviously played in the plot. He's unable to tell the other members of his group who are utterly ruthless, as he's certain that they would readily "eliminate" him for such a mistake, so he seeks advice from his mother. A plan is devised to poison Alicia and eventually her deteriorating health alerts Devlin to the level of danger that she's in and the course of action that he then takes, brings matters to a dramatic and powerful conclusion.A remarkable amount of drinking is featured in the story, primarily because of Alicia's predilection for consuming copious amounts of alcohol but also alka-seltzer is seen beside her as she wakes up with a hangover and she also goes on to consume numerous cups of poisoned coffee in Sebastian's mansion. In his cameo appearance Alfred Hitchcock is also seen drinking champagne.A notable feature of Hitchcock's direction is the prominence that's given to certain important props such as the coffee cups, the alka-seltzer and the key to the wine cellar. In one scene at the mansion where Alicia is holding the key in her hand ready to pass surreptitiously to Devlin, the camera descends from an extremely high starting position and in one spectacular, continuous movement zooms in to provide a very effective close-up which heightens the viewer's awareness of the level of risk that Alicia's taking.Cary Grant is typically smooth and sophisticated in his role but is also rather tense and guarded as he struggles to control the internal conflicts that are obviously plaguing his character. Ingrid Bergman is magnificent as someone who finds herself in a very unfamiliar predicament struggling with complex emotions at the same time as having to deal with the need to function in an extremely threatening environment. Claude Rains was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and is excellent as a kind and vulnerable man who has to cope with a domineering mother, the betrayal of the woman he truly loves and the fear of extreme punishment for the error of judgement that he'd made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Notorious' is one of the strongest Hitchcock films in terms of story and character. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman have a lot of chemistry together, which helps the story along no end. This film isn't one you'll want to take breaks from ... you really want to know how this spy story ends up.In support, Claude Rains (always reliable) puts across vulnerability and menace as Sebastian; usually such a part is reserved for women but in this film, it is the man who is stung because of love.Shot in luscious black and white, this film zips along full of energy and tension, and keeps the viewer's attention fixed to the screen. And that opening shot where we first see Cary Grant, back to the camera, is unusual, and very effective.</fullReview>

If you've ever had the kind of relationship where you can't say the things you want to your lover, and he/she never says the things you want to here, yet there's no doubt about the passion you feel for each other, this movie is for you. It is difficult to watch the art in this film without getting caught up in the story. Hitchcock does films like no other.

		<shortDescription>A few points to ponder over a superb film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Truffaut, I consider this film to be the finest work of Hitchcock. Why? Ingrid Bergman presented a role that was more complex, alluring, manipulative and real than her other roles on screen, including her Oscar winning "Gaslight." The film owes its brilliance to her as much as Hitchcock. Sex is the weapon in this film and the fascinating kisses add to the passion.But beyond the obvious there are a couple of intriguing facts in the film. The character of Devlin does not have a first name, merely the initials T.R. Now there are many who like their lovers to call them by the initials, but never have I encountered an intimate lover calling the other partner by the surname. Why does Alicia call T.R. Devlin as "Devlin"? Is it Ben Hecht's idea of distancing the spy from his world outside (Decades later, Lee Marvin played a character named Walker who does not have a first name in "Point Blank")? Interestingly towards the end of the movie, Alicia calls him "Dev?" before the word is muffled by a kiss.Hitchcock liked to copy himself. The brilliant opening courtroom scenes, captured from outside the courtroom, with key lines heard and other lines unheard, were copied in the courtroom scene of Hitchcock's "Frenzy" some three decades later. Did Hitchcock like the pattern so much or was he just plain lazy? My guess is Hitchcock felt that he owned the idea (a delicate and intense economic balance of editing and camera-work) as a trademark.This movie is one of the rare Hitchcock films where humor is almost absent. When humor rears its head, there is a somber overtone (Devlin leaving behind a champagne bottle after finding out what he needs to tell Alicia or the drunk German noticing the wine bottle with uranium at dinner) that drowns it. The film is full of flawed personalities?not one is honest, while the more evil ones gain our sympathies.The camera angles trying to mimic the eyes of Alicia (first when waking from a hangover, and later when realizing that she is being poisoned) are a delight to watch. Performances, direction, screenplay and editing make this film a true team effort. It is not merely a Hitchcock film; it is a complete film?a statement I would not make of most other works of Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock and Bergman at Their Zenith in Brilliant Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to identify the exact pinnacle of Alfred Hitchcock's masterworks, especially as he had a most fruitful period during the 1950's until the 1960 classic "Psycho", but 1946's "Notorious" is arguably his most perfectly crafted and cast film. First, there is a sharp, intensely plotted script by the estimable Ben Hecht that focuses on Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted Nazi spy, and T.R. Devlin, an American agent hired to convince Alicia to spy on a clandestine group of neo-Nazis based in Rio de Janeiro. This means she would have to seduce and eventually marry Alex Sebastian, a key group member who has never gotten over Alicia in his heart.This triangle is embodied by three stars at the height of their powers. A primarily poker-faced Cary Grant portrays Devlin close to the vest and charismatically hides his emotions under a veil of cold arrogance. In a series of scenes that pierce with a subverted eroticism, Devlin falls in love with Alicia but cannot find the courage to admit that to himself or to her. Claude Rains, on the other hand, imbues Sebastian with such an open romanticism and sad streaks of jealousy that we can actually sympathize with a Nazi war criminal a year after WWII ended, quite a daring feat within the film's historical context.At the vortex, though, is Ingrid Bergman, who probably gives her most accomplished performance as Alicia. At the time, she was deified as the chaste Mother Superior in Leo McCarey's harmless "The Bells of St. Mary's" with Bing Crosby. Bergman turned a smart corner here as a "loose" woman in love with the bottle until she is transformed by her love for Devlin, at which point, she becomes a stylish decoy to draw the na?ve Sebastian to her alluring charms. Ethereally beautiful and constantly pained, she conveys much of her character's feelings through her eyes and subtle facial expressions because she and Grant portray two people who can't admit they desperately want to be together even if her life depends on it. Their failure to communicate leads to Alicia sinking deeper into the morass of some nasty espionage business that ultimately puts her life in jeopardy.The chemistry between the two legends is palpable, especially in the then-controversial, three-minute kissing sequence that put censors into a tizzy. However, above all, this is a Hitchcock film, the film is filled with his genius for ingenious subjective camera-work and suspenseful set pieces, the latter perfectly illustrated by the party sequence at Sebastian's mansion starting with an unbelievable dolly shot right into Alicia's hand clasping the cellar key, which she passes to Devlin to find what is being hidden in the wine bottles. There are intriguing performances on the sidelines with Louis Calhern as the head of the American agency in Rio and the intimidating Madame Konstantin as Alex's ice-cold mother, both displaying a Machiavellian spirit to get what they want. This is a true classic and required viewing for any fan of Hitchcock, Bergman, Grant or Rains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a person interested in quality film-making and acting, get the DVD of this movie, watch it, and then listen to the film scholar's commentary.This movie is not for everyone -- the plot is, in my critical opinion, not the best. And of course those accustomed to fast-paced modern action need to understand that old movies have a very different style where scenes are more fully developed - this is done because they are jam-packed full of nuances that add immensely to a much fuller understanding of the characters and themes. As I said, if you want to understand the art that goes into Hitchcock direction, and witness him excellently direct two outstanding actors, whose acting talents you will probably more greatly appreciate, then watch this movie as well as the commentary.</fullReview>

The central situation, that as Bergman's correspondent, Grant must advise and encourage her to pose as a love interest to smarmy ex-lover Claude Rains, in order to obtain secret information from him for the secret service they work for - despite the fact that Grant loves her. It may sound melodramatic, but its so perfectly executed by the leads that we believe it fully, and it provides a wonderful premise for the story.I was utterly spellbound by Notorious - not something i've been by a Hitchcock picture for a very long time. I thought it was absolutely stunning. Claude Rains still has his big, wig-like hair, but even he is good in this. Grant and Bergman have never been better - each line perfectly nuanced, delivered as if there was no other way to say it.They light the screen up with their chemistry: the vital ingredient which makes every moment absolute magic in this exciting Hitch picture. I cheered right the way through.10/10. This one's goin' straight to the pool room for me. In the absolute upper echelons of Hitchcock's canon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, serious Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the example that Hitchcock used to point to when describing the MacGuffin. The MacGuffin, as everyone now knows, is the fuzzy plot device that the story is plotted around. It can be anything -- an odd statue filled with microfilm, a wine bottle of uranium ore, an ordinary melody in code -- as long as it motivates the characters. As Hitchcock tells the story, two men are on a train and one asks the other, "What is that device you have there?" The second man replies that it is a MacGuffin. The first asks, "What is a MacGuffin?" The other says that it is a device for trapping lions in the Scottish highlands. "But," says the first, "there are no lions in the Scottish highlands." The other says, "Well, then that's no MacGuffin." (I know, I know. Sorry.)The MacGuffin here is the wine bottle filled with uranium ore, part of a scheme some agents of a German industrial organization have for presumably making an atomic bomb. Cary Grant is some sort of counter-espionage agent who enlists the help of Ingrid Bergman, who he thinks is a drunken reprobate but with whom he falls in love anyway, and vice versa.Under instructions from his superiors, Grant sends Bergman to seduce (and marry) Claude Raines, part of that group of ex-Nazis. Their relationship turns bitter, because Grant and Bergman feel betrayed by each other. It's the kind of misunderstanding that could be cleared up by five minutes of honest conversation, but then there would be no love story. What would have happened if Hamlet had killed Claudius right off the bat after chatting with the ghost? No play, that's what would have happened.This is Hitchcock at his most serious, rather like Vertigo. Usually he puts in comic interludes, or at least an amusing few seconds, but none of that here. Not once does he wink at the audience. He puts his prodigious talent to work at involving the audience in the romance and the tension associated with the spy story. Nobody else could have made this movie except Hitchcock. And I can't think of any of his movies that pays more meticulous attention to material details. We never for a moment lose track of what's happening with the key to the wine cellar or with the hot bottle of wine. And Hitchcock gives us one of those swooping crane shots, down from the top of the staircase, to a close up of the key in Bergman's hand. During this party scene, the director makes his ritual appearance gulping down a glass of champagne at the bar.Hitchcock rarely gives us films that make easy judgments about the characters, and this one isn't really a snap either. We meet the group of Nazis at Claude Raines' mansion. We are introduced to them from Bergman's point of view as they bend to kiss her hand. They are uniformly rather odd looking, clearly cases in which the hand of the potter shook. Creepy, yes, but not entirely nasty. Ivan Triseault is nasty and a murderer to boot and looks it. But Dr. Krupka is kind of comic with his thick glasses and naive smile. (He gets promptly bumped off by his pals for a making a minor scene.) Another of the Nazis is Queequeg from Moby Dick. But Dr. Anderson, although he too has a face that is a rude lump of foul deformity, is rally a rather nice guy, gentle, polite, concerned about Bergman's health. True, he's making an atomic bomb to blow up the world but that doesn't mean you're a bad person. And no one can help feeling sorry for Claude Raines. He has a baggy appearance but his behavior is shot through with a genuine love for Ingrid Bergman. On top of that, he's saddled with one of Hitchcock's icy distant domineering mothers. When Raines wakes his Mum up early in the morning and tells her he's in serious trouble because Bergman isn't what she seems to be, one might expect her to frown. But, no -- a smile of grim satisfaction suffuses her features. (She was right about that malignant rival for her son's affections after all.)But, with all the talent on display, I still have a problem with the movie. Nobody in it is any good. Who are we supposed to identify with? Bergman, who should have refused the assignment and told the ungrateful CIA or OSS to shove it? Grant, for biting his tongue and sending his inamorata into someone else's bed? The FBI, a bunch of dull bulbs? The Nazis? At the end, Grant drives off with Bergman and leaves Raines to his fate, which is I guess to be driven off a cliff by Triseault. I felt a little sorry for the short guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Key and the Staircase (10/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three things about this film that make it especially noteworthy, and they are (in no particular order): Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and Suspense. And with regards to the latter of the three, another title for this one could have been `The Key and the Staircase,' in reference to two elements of the story that will absolutely have you on the edge of your seat. The film in question, of course, is `Notorious,' directed by Alfred Hitchcock, a thriller steeped in fear of the unknown and the paranoia generated by the uncertain future of the world in the wake of World War II. The game of espionage was afoot in 1946, and the rules had yet to be established; diligence was the operative word and indifference could not and would not be tolerated. And Hitchcock was right there to explore, probe and examine the heart of the matter, long before the appearance of McCarthy or the other bug-eyed `cinematic' monsters that would ultimately become a metaphor for the ambiguity of the ?50s. A black rain was descending upon the earth; fallout born of the marriage of technology and Evil, the effects of which would be neither known nor understood for many years. Meanwhile, Hitchcock delighted in provoking his audiences into a sweat of disquietude and apprehension. And he did it SO well.The war has ended, but there are those within certain agencies of the American Government who do not believe the threat from Hitler's minions has been eradicated. They are convinced, in fact, that a nest of Nazis has been established in South America, where they are currently at work on a secret project which, if left unabated, could rekindle the fires of worldwide conflict. But there is no proof; what they need is someone on the inside, someone they can trust, to get to the bottom of it all before it's too late.Toward that end, agent T.R. Devlin (Grant) is dispatched to enlist the aid of Alicia Huberman (Bergman), whose father has recently been convicted of conspiring with the Nazis during the war. The agency feels that she is perfect for the job, inasmuch as during her father's trial it became evident that her political sympathies lay in direct opposition to that of her father, as well as the fact that she was at one time very close to Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains), the man currently playing host to the suspected Nazis, now ensconced in his mansion in South America. Initially, Alicia resists any involvement; but after some persuasion from Devlin, she acquiesces. And the next day she is on a plane headed south.Working from a tightly written screenplay by Ben Hecht, Hitchcock has masterfully crafted and delivered a suspense/drama that will hold you in thrall from beginning to end. No one can build and sustain tension and the uncertainty of a situation like Hitchcock, which he proves beyond the shadow of a doubt here. He makes a seemingly simply thing such as who is in possession of a certain key at a specific time beyond riveting. And what other director has ever used a staircase to greater effect? As the story unfolds, Hitchcock adds one element after another, layering detail upon detail and weaving it all seamlessly together with his own unique touch. Furthermore, he doles out the most pertinent information with a deliberate pace that may induce the burying of fingernails in the arms of chairs on the part of his audience. When it comes to leading his viewers down the path to a satisfying climax, Hitchcock not only plays the game, he designed it and established the rules that have become the universally accepted standard in the business. It's impossible to merely `see' a Hitchcock film; indeed, he makes sure you `experience' the story fully, and this one is a superb example of the expertise he employs in the plying of his craft.Is she a victim, heroine or pawn? As played by the lovely Ingrid Bergman, Alicia Huberman is perhaps all of the above. There's a finesse to her performance that lends distinction to her character as she conveys so well the bitter inner conflict born of the path Fate has placed before her; it's an emotionally charged portrayal that evokes empathy and will win the sympathy of the viewer as she plays out the hand she has been dealt. Besides which, Bergman has never looked more beautiful on the screen than she does here; in this film she is absolutely captivating.The role of Devlin is something of a departure for Cary Grant, as it is decidedly one of his more serious portrayals. His character, of course, is dealing with a highly volatile and sensitive issue, and Grant responds to it with the kind of performance that addresses it most effectively. Absent is the trademark whimsy he generally infuses so successfully into his characters, and whether it was his decision, Hitchcock's, or a collaborative effort between the two, it was a wise choice that does much for the credibility of this particular character. It also makes the relationship between Devlin and Alicia tenable in light of the brevity of their acquaintance, as it puts it within the context of character and response to a given situation. It's a memorable performance by Grant, aided in no small part by the natural on-screen chemistry he shares with the ravishing Ingrid Bergman.Claude Rains, meanwhile, brings a subtle menace to his portrayal of Sebastian, within whom you can detect a restraint of evil that's almost palpable; it seems to emanate from his countenance in waves, and you can see it reflected in his eyes and his designed-to-conceal expression. And that same sense of the nefarious is concisely captured by Leopoldine Konstantin in her portrayal of Madame Sebastian; another staple in Hitchcock's bag of cinematic tricks, the matron/villainess. It's all a part of what makes `Notorious' so thoroughly entertaining and memorable; it's pure Hitchcock, and it just doesn't get any better than that. 10/10.   </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock at his very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite of Hitchcock's films and also my favorite film of all time because it covers the entire spectrum of emotion. Not only does Hitchcock give us some of his most suspenseful shots but he captures the deepest level of intimacy as well. Although I appreciate the value of novels, 1,000 pages of writing could not capture the emotion that Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant display through a single movement or a flicker of the eyes. This film is about betrayal, loyalty, and love, but above all it is about being human. We are all victims of ourselves and of others and never has there been a movie that so convincingly captures this. I have seen this movie many times and each time I am equally intrigued and moved. Unlike some of his other movies where a second viewing can sometimes be slightly boring because you know what is coming, this movie never ceases to captivate me. This movie was made in the middle of Hitchcock's directing career in the US, and fittingly enough it maintains the optimism and love of life of his early films while also including the more profound ideas of his later films. The last moments of the film contain one of his greatest sequences of shots, reminding us once again who is the master of cinema. Notorious is overwhelmingly beautiful from start to finish. The camera was invented to make this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the Lady Still a Tramp if She's Doing it for Uncle Sam?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SLIGHT SPOILERS!In one of Hitchcock's most romantically charged suspense tales, Notorious, sultry Miami socialite Alicia Huberman's (Ingrid Bergman) father is imprisoned for being a Nazi operative. Helpless and heart-broken over her father's crimes, the innocent Alicia takes to the fast lane - booze, men, and carousing. The shamed daughter is now considered a reckless and notorious tramp!When approached by the CIA to act as a spy and infiltrate the hiding Nazi community her father knew in Rio de Janeiro, Alicia agrees. She is led to Rio by suave operative T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) who will act as her contact with the CIA. Of her father's former friends in Rio, Alexander Sebastian (dapper Claude Raines), is the most welcoming to Alicia. As Alicia pries information from Alexander and clandestinely feeds it to Devlin, the film takes an unexpected turn - Devlin and Alicia are falling in love. The budding, secret love affair between spies only complicates Alex's offer of marriage to Alicia. Can she, for the good of the US, credibly marry Alex (the very man she is spying on), be part of his inner circle - pumping plenty of information to the CIA, while she's desperately in love with another man?? Alas, a cloud forms on the plans for nuptials, while Alex is clearly smitten with the sultry Alicia, it is his sinister Mother (the fiendish Mdm. Konstantin) who smells a rat. In Hitchcock's world this mother-in-law isn't just a battleaxe - she's a vicious and entirely unsympathetic Nazi!Notorious is the most beloved and successful of the Alfred Hitchcock/David O. Selznick partnership years. It remains a frequent topic of discussion as so much of it crystalizes what is known as 'quintessential Hitchcock'. Firstly, there's a simple situation that spirals out of control in ways that the audience might not expect. While certainly there's the standard drama and tensions of a 'love triangle', the sinister fourth party element of Alex's mother gives it a perverse and ultimately lethal edge. Secondly, there's the use of standard objects as signifiers of suspense: a key and a wine bottle. So important do these props become that the mere sighting of them within the frame generates attention.In Notorious one also gets a sense that Hitchcock was honing and strengthening techniques he'd been developing for years. There are numerous shots that stand out as memorable and clever. He takes many risks that pay off and his technical sensibilities really begin to solidify. He's employed one of Hollywood's best screen writers Ben Hecht to pen the humorous and romantic script that seems very contemporary and free-wheeling. There's a distinctive, sexy flair in the dialogue between Devlin and Alicia and the conversations among Alex and his mother crackle with danger - more specifically, their scheming is frightening. Also, the musical score begins to emerge as a central character (something that later in his career Hitchcock would be well known and praised for). Roy Webb's lush romantic music for Notorious is now-a-days often heard floating through air-line easy listening stations and no one is the wiser that it's music from a Hitchcock film!As the years go by, Notorious seems to get richer and more exceptional. What strikes me as most unique about the film is it's sophisticated mix of passion and suspense. When Devlin and Alicia first kiss it's electric - it's a moment and a kiss that the audience waits for. There's a wonderful sense of intoxication and danger when both of them are together. Also, these actors (true 'stars' in the classical Hollywood mold) are in the top of their form here - presenting career defining performances that light up the screen. I should also note that Notorious' climax - waiting to see how and when the cat will be let out of the bag is harrowing in the best sense of the genre! It's an excellent film - a sublime note in a brilliant career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is a fantastic piece of filmmaking. In addition, it has Hitchcock written all over it. The premise: a woman (Ingrid Bergman) whose father was found guilty of treason is hired by a U.S. agent (Cary Grant) to romance a Nazi scientist (the brilliant Claude Raines) hiding in Rio. Of course, Bergman and Grant fall in love, and this is the real point of the film.Hitchcock uses many of his regular techniques: rapid editing to evoke suspense, long pull-in shots to direct the audience's attention, and his "mother figure" motif. Also present is a terrific door motif which at times represents a prison, isolation, and at other times, doom. There are a number of fantastic shots in this film such as the closing shot (which I won't give away), and the crane shot that moves into a close-up of Ingrid Bergman's hand. Wow!!!Also, the parallels of the beginning and the end of the film are great. The first scene of Bergman's isolation is paired with the isolation of Claude Raines at the end. The second scene is paired with the second-to-last scene, and so-on for a couple more scenes. Wow!!!Notorious is an exciting film with great acting and directing. It is one of "The Master's" finest masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do think this is one Hitchcock's best. The chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman is electrifying, and I think their kiss in the wine cellar is one of the sexiest moments ever committed to film. As far as Claude Raines--well (with the possible exception of Kevin Spacey), they just don't make character actors like that any more. Also, the ending was very atypical of '40s movies, grim rather than light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant's second Alfred Hitchcock film. Grant is an American FBI man who has recruited Ingrid as an agent to infiltrate a group of Nazi refugees operating out of Rio De Janeiro.Ingrid's the perfect plant, she's the daughter of an American who was a traitor in the late war. Ingrid's a jetsetter, but a patriot at heart. Of course she has some qualms about betraying a betrayer father. We never see the father, he's in jail when Grant approaches Bergman. Later on we're told he commits suicide while in custody.Grant has his problems also. She's an agent and he's her handler, but he's falling for her and she likewise. Not good while on a assignment.Cary and Ingrid are fine, but the acting honors here have to go to Claude Rains. He's a traitor also, but the FBI can't prove anything. That's what Ingrid's job is, to infiltrate his ring.She succeeds beyond anything imaginable. Rains falls for her and asks to marry her. That gets things really complicated for everyone concerned. But she marries Rains.This is where Alfred Hitchcock's direction comes in. Even though Rains is a traitor, Hitchcock gets a portrayal out of him that makes you actually feel sorry for him. It is one of the best roles in a very distinguished career for Claude Rains.This is a good movie, could have been a whole lot greater for a different studio though in the next decade. Later on Hitchcock went on location to Monte Carlo for To Catch a Thief, to Morocco for The Man Who Knew Too Much and London for a whole slew of films. Notorious would have been much better had RKO spent some money and actually shot the film in Rio De Janeiro. As it was the sets are about as good as Crosby and Hope's, Road to Rio.Still it's a good story and great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchkock, with Ingrid Bergman's best performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much to admire in this restrained and unsentimental story of a patriotic American woman named Alicia Huberman who agrees to spy on her traitorous father's NAZI associates.Cary Grant is excellent as her hard-edged agent-handler Devlin, who fights his feelings of love for Alicia.Claude Rains gives his usual superb performance as the NAZI who completes the eternal triangle.The Ben Hecht/Cliford Odets script, Alfred Hitchkock's direction, and the Ted Tetzlaff/Gregg Toland cinematography are all first rate.But it is Ingrid Bergman's mesmerizingly erotic performance that sets this movie apart. Bergman is sexier with all her clothing on than other actresses were disrobed. During her long career, Bergman was never better.There is little action in this black and white classic. It's a suspenseful character study and love story.Hitchkock used similar themes in his later hit "North by Northwest". Compare Bergman's performance in "Notorious" to Eva Marie Saint's in that later film, and you will appreciate the difference between greatness and mere competence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: Alicia's father has just been sentenced to 20 years in prison for treason. He had been collaborating with Nazi agents working in the U.S.. What she doesn't know is that he is about to commit suicide. She doesn't share his convictions anyway. That's why she is approached by Devlin, an American agent. Alicia's father's companions seem to be working out of Brazil. But their network is tight and Devlin and friends has had little luck breaking it. But maybe Alicia can gain their trust, considering her father. Alicia agrees reluctantly. What she didn't expect though, and neither did Devlin is that they would fall for each other. Now their feelings might endanger their mission and put them at great risk.Comments: A classic Hitchcock, with good reviews. But in my mind not close to being one of his better movies. I seem not to catch on. The movie, to me at least, seems never to get into gear. The story stumbles, seems to repeat itself, not really able to move on. And the catch up is the love story. It doesn't seem believable. Especially Grant, or Devlin, is hard to believe to be in love. Sure, he is a trained agent, he must be in total control of his emotions. But he never for a moment lets on. He says the word but doesn't seem to believe them himself. He carries the same facial expression all the time, when he meets Alicia or his boss. So why should I believe they're in love when they don't seem to believe it themselves.The spy story works, but it is a little too easy. The Nazi agents are never ant real threats to Alicia or Devlin, not even at the end, the supposed climax of the movie, do they pose any real threat. The threat instead is Alicia's and Devlin's love for each other, but when that part falters, also the threat vanishes. The entire movie depends on the love to be true, to be the threat to their lives but something they can't deny or walk away from. But when it isn't, the entire story falls in on itself. The spy story isn't complex or thrilling enough to entirely save the movie.Still watchable, though. Both Grant and Bergman are stars, and directed by Hitchcock, that's enough to watch it once at least.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock delivers vintage sand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Hitchcock in general, Vertigo being my favorite film of his. I also like North by Northwest with Cary Grant, and I like Casablanca with Ingrid Bergman. So Notorious was looking to be a very nice movie, but oh no, it was far from nice. Instead of great champagne, all I got was vintage sand.The film starts off with a bang, having the lead character go drunk driving. At this point I just don't like her, but things get much worse quickly. The next morning we are treated to a recording that shows her as the greatest patriot ever, loving uncle sam over her own parents. I should have known that a 1946 movie about Nazis would be hilarious nationalist propaganda.Then we have a montage of an extremely unbelievable love story, which gets quickly interrupted by the fact that the lead character must go undercover. This is one of the fundamental problems I have with the film. The love story is not believable AT ALL, especially with Cary Grant playing a mannequin.The movie is also filled with tons of little stupid moves that characters make. A healthy amount could be explained by the lack of brain power of the characters, but when every single character is stupid - it just leads me to believe that the screenwriter, Ben Hecht, was dimwitted.Spoiler. An example of what kind of stupid moves do I have in mind, lets take the ending of the movie where Dev is taking Alicia to the hospital. He refuses to take Alexander with him and this really blows my mind. Lets analyze the situation shall we.If they take Alexander with them: a) Alexander survives and is most likely willing to cooperate in order to save his life b) Alexander knows a ton of nazi secrets that can immensely help uncle sam, not to mention Dev's career c) Taking Alexander with them will make it more likely that the other Nazis don't flee just yet d) Alexander knows what kind of poison Alicia was given. Taking an antidote might be a question of hours - hours which will now be spent trying to figure out what the hell she was poisoned with.On the other hand, if they don't take Alexander with them: a) Everyone from the house will flee or be killed b) Stuff will be covered up, leads will disappear, the investigation will run into a dead end c) Alicia might very well die, because nobody has any clue what she was poisoned with d) Dev can privately talk to Alicia in the car, about how much he loves herThe only good thing about this movie is Claude Rains, who single-handedly keeps me from calling this movie total garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notoriously Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Notorious" starts out slow and fails to pick up the pace, resulting in a painfully dull movie to watch. The idea had so much potential?the story of an undercover spy working for the betterment of her country. However, this is no "Alias". Can the life of a spy really be this dull? Probably. But that doesn't really make for a good movie.On a more positive note, the camera work is very genius. The point of view switches between third person, the character's perspective, and even so that it is like the audience is actually there (the drunken car ride with Ingrid Bergman's hair blowing in your face). When she is poisoned, the frame is stretched and warped.I began to care less and less about the basic plot as the movie went on. You end up not caring about the weird, pseudo love triangle because it progressed so slowing and was lacking basic chemistry and compatibility. This is not to say that the acting was bad. In fact, the actors were very talented. I just don't think they should have been cast opposite each other. Either that or the script needs a major overhaul (which is the more likely case).All in all, "Notorious" did not live up to the hype. It was slow and boring, boring and slow. If you read into the movie, it accurately predicts a Nazi defeat and an Allied victory. It was also interesting to see the Miami skyline so undeveloped. And it is a sad thing when all you think about it construction and urban planning throughout a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the best of Alfred Hitchcock's films, along with North By Northwest, although Notorious is far more subtle and intuitive. Cary Grant as the agent Devlin and Ingrid Bergman as the alcoholic daughter of a spy are perfect. And so is Claud Rains, who plays Bergman's ex and the Nazi leader, to a tee. The classic Hitchcock staples are all here: dominating mother, weak villain, famous kiss and a happy ending. Much like Cary Grant being the master of talking with his facial expressions, Hitchcock can get more suspense out of a movie than almost any other director ever has. Simply put, this is one of the best films of all time and definitely worth watching. My Grade: A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is a movie brought on by the famous Alfred Hitchcock in 1945. This movie brings up very relevant topics to the time of its release. A setting of a Nazi infested world is given to the viewers. There a genres of romance, mystery, and a real world issues. Besides the obvious Nazi issue, there are issues of inner self that we see reflected in the main character played by Alicia Huberman. This film is easily one of Hitchcock's most memorable films. His use of camera angles, such as close ups is very evident throughout the entire movie. This movie definitely helped pave the way for more Hitchcock films to be developed and watched by many different viewers for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak story, strong everything else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to get a personal problem with the film out of the way first. I know not everyone will share my opinion but the issues sticks like a bone in my throat. If your father or mother are in trouble with the law and you disown them just because of that, you are not a good person. No one can be that much blinded by silly patriotism, surely. The beginning of the movie left a bad taste in my mouth.Moving onto a more general problem, Notroius does not have a very good story if you care enough to think about it. For example, the main character goes from "No way I am doing this" to "Ok" in an instant. Characters start talking about someone while right next to that person and the movie pretends that the conversation is not overheard. The main villain plays an intelligent person but is very oblivious to what is going on, when it should be very obvious if you think about it. His manner of acting and dialogue say "I know and understand everything" but his actions say "I am completely clueless".The movie clarifies that the characters take a number of days to fall in love (which may be enough time to get a crush on someone I suppose), but it only takes a minute of montage in real time so it feels very forced. And it happens within the first fifth of the film, mind you. It was at this point that my partner who was watching with me commented, "What is it with these old movies?" referring to a similar situation in Singing in the Rain, a movie we saw the other day, and indeed she was right: it is noticeable that films from that era do not treat romance properly. Instead, these two are in love now, because we say so; deal with it.The place where it was decided to end the movie also felt very strange. It felt like the makers forgot to show the final third of the movie.This awkwardness in story is contrasted by the high quality of acting and dialogue. "Don't you need a coat?" "You'll do.". If you just take this film one scene at a time and concentrate on the actors, it is great. There are several tense scenes, which Hitchcock is so good at. And the scenes with the lovers are emotional (once you get over the fact that the relationship came to be at a snap of the fingers).This movie was an Ingrid Bergman's show. Unlike a movie like the much celebrated Casablanca, where she felt diminished to playing a romantic interest with pretty lips, in this film her full professional range is revealed. Cary Grant as her counterpart plays a very calm and collected person, which can come off as emotionless at times, but the skillfulness with which he loses his composure is all the more deserving of praise.There are a number of interesting scenes with long tracking shots and effects, like the lenses of binoculars showing a very clear reflection of what is going on in the font.Overall, the story has many weaknesses. As in another one of Hitckock's movies I watched, the story requires one or more of the characters to be dim-witted and there are some issues with the story's flow. But everything else is skillfully done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When in Rio, why not be someone else?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a film about assumed identity and espionage, the act of being someone else is expected and the inherent danger accepted among viewers. With Ingrid Bergman used to flush out post WWII Nazis, the danger is heightened and suspense opportunities abound. Hitchcock knew how to keep the audience personally involved but a few things keep my suspense of disbelief from taking over. This is unforgivable to some of us. The sets were so stock foot of Brazil that it was comic to think this was anywhere but a glorified Hollywood stage. Shame on the budgetary limitations. Seeing Cary Grant, again, play an American with his rare yet patented Englishman delivery also was hard to swallow. But seeing Claude rains sit across from Ingrid Bergamn for long scenes (while we all know she got on that plane in Casablancea!) made this just a 100 minute excursion into old film school. I did like the overbearing mother / spoiled son bit playing out and Ingrid is so beautiful no matter what role. I wonder is my vote of 7 is gracious or arrogant.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock fans will know that the famed director fell in love with his leading ladies and with Ingrid Bergman it was no different. What he couldn't achieve in real life he portrayed vicariously through his characters and the actors that played them. As the Hitchcock stand-in, Cary Grant achieved brilliant career success as national security agent Devlin in "Notorious" because it proved to audiences that he could successfully deliver a dark side. He had always been a fine comic actor up to this point, but critics casually dismissed his serious roles as offbeat. By playing against type, Grant was now hailed for his ability to 'act', and credit Hitchcock for understanding that the best way to direct Grant was to focus a spotlight on his shadowy side.As the romantic tension between Devlin and Alicia (Bergman) begins to heat up, I was amused by a line that Grant's character says to Alicia in the Rio apartment - "I've always been scared of women, but I'll get over it." Indeed, during most of his early career in the States, Grant and live in lover Randolph Scott dodged repeated questions about their sexuality while studio owners pressed them to appear in public with adoring starlets to keep the public at bay. But just like Hitchcock, Grant seemed to fall in love with most of his leading ladies as well, and managed to marry five times until he got it right.In "Notorious", the Rio de Janeiro home of Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains) is a cover for whatever the Farben Group, a Nazi cell is doing in Rio. In a way, the Sebastian character is another take on the repressed sexuality of the director, severely crippled as a momma's boy who takes his frustrations and insecurities to Madame Sebastian (Leopoldin Konstantin), his mother. She's the apparent power behind the throne who calls the shots in Rio, protecting her son when it becomes apparent they've been duped by an American agent. Alicia, who married Sebastian in a patriotic effort to avenge the Nazi ties of her own father, realizes the pair have allied against her when they both shriek their warning to Dr. Anderson (Reinhold Schunzel) about the poisoned coffee cup.What's fascinating about the story is how closely it paralleled Cary Grant's real life up till then. There's an early scene when Devlin slaps Alicia following the drunken car ride (his back to the camera, presumably because to show it would shock audiences of the era); during his first marriage to Virginia Sherrill, she accused him of slapping her for real. More astounding however is Grant's own real life involvement with the FBI. He and Randolph Scott were both investigated for ties to a Phillipine bond scandal case which was eventually dropped. Some time after, the British Secret Service prevailed upon Grant to cooperate with the FBI by keeping an eye on suspected Nazi sympathizers in Hollywood. Grant's second wife, actress and Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton had been married to a Nazi collaborator, Danish Count Haugwitz-Reventlow. Her payoff to Reventlow to secure a divorce opened the door to marrying the actor.Hitchcock often recycled various plot points in his movies and with this one it was no different. 1941's "Suspicion", also starring Grant and Joan Fontaine, used the 'poison in a drink' scenario (that time it was milk) to heighten tension and suspense before the final resolution. This film's fascination with the 'key', note the dramatic tracking shot from ceiling to Alicia's cupped hand hiding it, was later used in 1954's "Dial M for Murder". You catch enough Hitchcock films and the repetition becomes apparent. Along with the director's famed cameos - this time it occurred when Devlin and Alicia join the party at the Sebastian mansion to have a drink. Hitchcock is visible downing a glass of champagne and beating a hasty retreat, quite a clever touch.As with almost all of Hitchcock's films, I'm generally wary with the way they end in terms of credibility. As Devlin escorts the drugged and virtually immobile Alicia down the stairs of the mansion to rescue her from the Sebastian clutches, he's prepared to make a scene and/or shoot Alex if he tries to stop them. The door of the mansion closes and with it, one presumes that the proverbial jig is up for Momma and her boy. My question is, knowing how ruthless the group could be, why didn't they just step in and off all four of them at once?Note*** My source for the information on Cary Grant's personal life are from the Marc Eliott biography, "Cary Grant"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Hitchcock film with a predictable end. A movie about a spy who falls in love with the daughter of a traitor and then this girl is sent to a mission owing to the relations of her father with the criminals. Then there occurs a mental dilemma of choosing work upon love and all those choice oriented things. The stuff looks good but gets the outcome is not that good. It is a 90 min movie more about the making the right choice and less of suspense which was a serious letdown because I always watch a Hitchcock movie to get some awesome entertainment. The only part of the movie I liked was Ingrid Bergman. She was lovely and adorable. Even she gave full justice to her character. She portrayed the sorrowful daughter, the romantic lover and the person who would do anything for the love of her life, the insecure lady etc. There is more i want to say about her but Pardon me for the lack of my vocabulary.I just fell in love with her from the very first scene of her with the wine. She was too damn perfect. An really she made the movie worth watching for me. But apart from this there is nothing at all interesting in the movie. Some stupid plot which is not even shown properly and the love between the two leads is just simply shown as if they fell in love straight away. There are many loop hole s in the movie. I do not want to say more about he plot because it would make the movie even less interesting. The direction was good, of Hitchcockian standard, the love scenes were really lovely. The emotions of the two leads was felt. Both leads did a good work. But it was Ingrid who stood apart. Simply exceptional work from her. The picturization is good. Overall the movie is not that bad but still for me it would be of a lower scale but you could surely give it a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Hitchcockian Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is a highly regarded classic from Alfred Hitchcock and it is an taut, tense thriller, that is entertaining and stands alongside his best films. It is an entertaining romp of a film, having many Hitchcockian tropes, an ordinary untrained person forced into an extraordinary situation, plenty of espionage skulduggery and a complicated romance. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman are both excellent together as spy and handler who end up being lovers and the film is enhanced by Hitchcock's direction. Hitchcock keeps a fast pace, making sure there is no fat in the film and he knows where to place and move the camera to heighten the tension during scenes as the stakes get higher during the film. A superb classic thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Direction, Remarkable Scriptwriting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We might first ask ourselves to whom does the title refer? The word "notorious" means "famous for something bad; well known for some undesirable feature, quality or act" (according to the Bing Dictionary). This film has its villains, so we could immediately assume it is a reference to them. But let's consider the other possibilities.Ingrid Bergman plays the role of Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a man convicted of treason by the U.S. She has a reputation for being a boozer and for not being too picky about her men. She surely fits the definition of "notorious". All of these factors play a part in her selection by the U.S. government to gain useful intelligence.They send their agent, Devlin (Cary Grant), to recruit her. She eventually acquiesces without knowing exactly what her task will be. Alicia and Devlin are flown to Rio, Brazil, to await orders. While there, she overcomes her distrust of the American authorities as represented by Devlin. He overcomes his distaste for the seedy aspects of her reputation. They become involved. Though he won't utter the L word, clearly they both fall for each other.Then the assignment comes through: Alicia is to infiltrate a suspicious group of Germans, a remnant of the "German war machine". The local faction is headed by Alexander Sebastion (Claude Rains), a former friend of her father, and a man who used to be in love with Alicia. Clearly, they expect Alicia to insinuate herself into Sebastion's life romantically. At first, Devlin is outraged, but his distaste for the mission is tempered by patriotism. And a part of him wonders if Alicia will accept the mission, given their feelings for each other.What follows is a standoff. Devlin waits for her to reject the mission, proving that she truly has changed, proving her love for him. Alicia waits for Devlin to object to the mission, protecting her and proving his love for her. In the end, she agrees to connect with Sebastian. An emotional wall is erected between Alicia and Devlin, over which they lob insults at each other. At this point, we might ask if Devlin now possesses some undesirable features? He certainly becomes much less sympathetic, perhaps notoriously cruel toward Alicia.Once Alicia gets inside the Sebastian household, the suspense incrementally increases. Hitchcock is the master of suspense and he employs many of his usual tools to put the audience on edge. Note how the conventional ticking clock that counts down to disaster is replaced by the popping of corks, the dwindling champagne supply, the mere display of champagne flutes on screen.The camera zooms from the second floor to the foyer below and spots the critical key in Alicia's hand. It follows the key and like a conman playing a game of three care monte, even follows the hand where we think it might be. The camera repeatedly focuses on items and actions that represent danger: the coffee cup wherever it is, the visual clues that something has been disturbed, Sebastian watching from across the room.Hitchcock's use of the camera in "Notorious" is remarkable. In many of his films the story is about a "common man" accidentally caught up in a story of intrigue. In "Notorious", Alicia is the one who is caught in the web--even if voluntarily--and who is most victimized. Hitchcock uses her point of view repeatedly in the story, personalizing the action and making the audience identify with Alicia's fears.As great as Hitchcock's direction is in this film, Ben Hecht's script is remarkable. Note how the film starts, with one mystery after another: What is this trial? Who is this woman at the trial? Why is she partying after the judgment? Who is this faceless man at her party? What is his authority?As the story moves along, one must marvel at Hecht's dialogue between the two lovers. Just enough is said and all the right things are left unsaid. Notice how little dialogue is used to take Alicia from a hard-boiled tramp to a soft-skinned romantic. He knew that it is better to show it than say it.Edith Head's design of Ms. Bergman's wardrobe is worth noting, making Alicia an object of desire that is worth fighting over or fretting over.Cary Grant's acting is up to its usual standards. He plays the devoted lover and the spurned ex-lover with equal gusto. Bergman's acting is worthy of even more note. In some scenes, you can watch the varying shades of emotion move across her face like passing clouds. The two of them were, apparently, most responsible for the long kiss/embrace sequence that starts on the balcony in Rio. It was noteworthy in its day and it still tells us so much about the characters."Notorious" is, at its center, a love story between two people who, due to circumstances, cannot allow themselves sentimentality. Their lack of communication actually becomes an element of suspense. This is one of Hitchcock's great films, of which there are many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is one of the most suspenseful films that I have seen. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time while watching it. The scenes are all shot in such a way that you can't help but to be in awe at how much of a genius Hitchcock was. The lighting and camera angles used throughout the film really stuck out to me in a way that no other film has. It made me appreciate the crazy Hitchcock style. Also, the cast of this movie was phenomenal. Grant and Bergman's chemistry is so apparent that it seemed more natural than something that they were actually acting out. Every aspect of this film, directing, editing, cast, writing, so on and so forth is what made this movie the classic that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1946, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is trying to get past the conviction of her father for treason. She drinks too much and parties too hard. She's approached by government agent Devlin (Cary Grant) to spy on her father's Nazi friends in Rio de Janeiro, and old friend Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains).The best thing in this Alfred Hitchcock movie is Ingrid Bergman. She glows on the screen. She outshines even Cary Grant. This is a great looking Hitchcock movie due in no small part to those beautiful people. The story moves slowly as Alicia infiltrates the group. It's not heavy on the action, but it's got great tension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's very best, which I suppose makes this one of the best movies of all time. The stars certainly fell into alignment here, as apart from the Master's input, we get a David O Selznick production, Ben Hecht original script and three A-list actors, all on superb form, namely Grant, Bergman and Rains.The story is at once suspenseful, believable and involving. Hitchcock eschews much of the melodrama that figured in his earlier Hollywood pictures to here give us a grounded story with no great dramatic twist or turn. Events succeed each other in a completely natural way even as the plot both darkens and thickens and for-by the story takes in Nazi sympathisers and CIA agents, there's no gun-play, fist-fights or dramatic car-chases.Grant and Bergman play out their twisted romance with great skill, he, cool, professional and distant, she, confused, needy and vulnerable. Rains too is excellent as the mummy's boy but whose selfish, jealous and ruthless nature manifests itself when he realises that his wife is against him.Above all though, we see Hitchcock rising to the top-drawer writing of the brilliant Hecht, with a wonderfully intuitive camera, always nosing the plot along, with many of trademark touches, but this time with more subtlety and less bravado, entirely in keeping with the more grounded nature of the narrative. The best examples of these are Bergman's first 360 degree view of Grant filling the doorway, the brilliant dolly shot down the stairs at Rains' party, focusing in on the key in Bergman's twitchy fingers and finally the whole of the final scene when Grant rescues Bergman and Rains has to turn back to his ruthless masters to face the music.Arguably the best of his 40's movies and a high-point for his three lead actors, "Notorious", in terms of classic Hollywood movie-making, more than lives up to its title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense, romance, and Nazis galore; in all of it, Ingrid Bergman shines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Notorious" plays out like many of Hitchcock's earlier films, treading the line between romance and full-blown espionage chaos. Ingrid Bergman stars as Alicia, the daughter of a German man convicted of treason, who is asked by a government agent, Devlin (Cary Grant) to infiltrate a group of Nazis with connection to her father; specifically Alexander Sebsatian (Claude Rains), who had a romantic interest in her years before.One of Hitchcock's more superior thrillers, "Notorious" takes the archetype of the reckless boozy débutante with a dark past, and places her in a series of dire and often frightening circumstances. But, as with many of Hitchcock's films, it treads the line between dark film-noir thriller and unabashed romance film. In fact, when stripped down, what we have here is quite plainly a romance tale dressed in the clothes of an unhinged thriller full of governmental cover-ups and Nazis galore. As far as performances go, Ingrid Bergman was made for this film, and the film was made for her. Her stoic yet vulnerable performance contains a breathtaking duality, and Cary Grant counters her as the kind government agent whom she quickly falls in love with. Claude Rains perhaps turns in his most disturbing performance here as the smarmy Nazi leader of the secret society, whose obsession with Alicia goes back to their original acquaintance years before.Stylistically, Hitchcock delivers on all accounts; to say the film is beautifully shot would be a horrible understatement. Rich in tone, shadows, and colors, it delivers some particularly memorable shots, including the POV silhouette scene, the tracking shot to Bergman's hand clutching the wine cellar key during the party scene, and the unusually confrontational long take of Mme. Sebastian descending the staircase and coming face-to-face with Bergman's character; It is small touches like these that really shine in Hitchcock's work, and are on full display in "Notorious".The film ends in a rather abrupt but positive fashion, and at the end of the day, all is well for the sobered Alicia; but the trials and tribulations of this 'notorious' woman in the film do not go unremembered, and the sense of danger still lurks behind all of the preceding frames. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a sure hand Hitchcock directs with here. The scenes flow like a glassy stream, while the camera set-ups appear effortless. Thus the story is allowed to unfold in vivid, unimpeded fashion. Yes, this is darn near a flawless film in terms of both casting and execution and one of Hitch's best. No need after this many reviews to echo consensus details or aspects. I guess my only reservation is with Alex's (Rains) unexpected turnaround. I wish Rain's performance had hinted at more emotional conflict previous to that fateful walk to the car. That is, some prior sort of conflicted behavior over Nazism, on one hand, and Alicia Bergman), on the other. Instead he appears to sit passively by while Alicia's being poisoned. Real ambivalence would have allowed the last scene to show which side of his conflicting allegiances had won out. As things stand, unless I missed something, his turnaround appears sudden and scripted rather than felt.Anyway, it's a rather minor reservation to one of Hitch's most accomplished films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious: Roger Ebert once said he never leaves a film early, no matter how bad it is, he always wants to stay until the end. Notorious is a great example of Ebert's mindset on watching movies. The first third of Notorious is difficult to sit through, the plot is muddled and not explained as crisply as Hitchcock usually does. The film takes off, though, and the second and third Acts are phenomenal. I have the same opinion of Ingrid Bergman's performance as I do the film itself, I thought the exposition of the character was terrible on her behalf, but Bergman skyrockets in the later scenes. At times, the editing chops the film with short, quick cuts, but it's also used to create great suspense. The scene that hit me like a bulldozer was the party/wine cellar/key sequence. One of Hitchcock's finest scenes ever. Claude Raines gives a superb performance as the antagonist; he never makes him the "villain" and Raines steals the picture from it's enormous stars. A little inconsistent, but so worth the time you put into it. Rating: A-Grade: 8.5/10</fullReview>

Visually, this is a sexy film, and it's heightened by the chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Their sexuality simmers. Terrific performances from all three stars. Grant is über-suave; cool as a cucumber and is at home with such a noirish character. Bergman is beautiful as usual, and really gives her character a sensual edge. And Claude Rains has the hardest job of making us care about an ex-Nazi. But he does. I was surprised at just how tense the ending turned out to be.

But whereas before it was always 90% Hitchcock at most, this is the first where he seems to have mastered everything, breaking loose from the production companies, totally feeling like Hitchcock and not like anybody else at all. Notorious is so glamorous, stylish. It just drags you along for the ride. But stiff it ain't. It is very spontaneous and vivid. Bergman and Grant have great chemistry, one of the best matched screen couples I ever saw. Grant is great here, less snappy happy than usual, more subdued, yet very stylish. Seeing him here, it is no wonder he was Ian Fleming's first choice for Bond. Bergman shows a spontaneity that is infectious, lively and sensual. The script is rock solid, well-paced and exciting. The romance isn't tacked on here as an audience warmer, but is equal to the espionage story. The two elements of the story are so intertwined that there is a flow of tension between these two story elements, that it is hard not to care. Visually this is stellar from start to end, with a look that is lush, rich and sexy. The camera work is great (take for example the stunning ball room overhead shot, zooming in on a hand with a key), always in tune with the scale of a scene.</fullReview>

It is a compact and completely focused affair with the emphasis on dialog as much as movement. The Movie seems to be suffocating at times and that could be the intent, to cause breathless anxiety, and it does. This works well but is not the best of full blown Hitchcock and should not be rated as one of his greatest, there is much emptiness and a feeling of only a minor menace in the form of tiny little greasy men in the corner of a room talking, and talking, and talking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance and Suspense all into one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie Notorious, by Alfred Hitchcock, the point it is trying to get across is trust. Devlin must trust Alicia as a partner and that she will do the task at hand. Then there is Alex who must also trust Alicia that she really loves him and won't go running back to Devlin. The most important item in this movie is the key. This small item represents so much more than what its purpose is intended for. It's so important because of the fact that it unlocks the secret they are looking for throughout the film. The film also has constant zooming in on the key to signify its importance. Once Alex knows Alicia has stolen the key he loses all trust in her and decides that she must die. This film has many scenes with alcohol in it and it's important to take notice of this. The characters, like Alicia, use it to escape from reality. After the trial, at the beginning, Alicia is shown at a party drinking away all her pain and trying to escape from reality. In some scenes alcohol is also meant to bring harm. The best example of this is when they find the uranium in the champagne bottles. The meaning behind this is that uranium is used to create bombs, which kill people. I learned the different camera angles showed the importance of certain scenes or how people viewed things. One example of how the camera angles showed a characters view is when Alicia wakes up after the party, Hitchcock gives you her point of view by showing everything upside down. An example of how Hitchcock uses the camera to show an items importance is when Alicia and Alex throw their party. The shot starts off on top of the stairs balcony and looks down to the crowd and starts to zoom in. As it zooms in more and more you realize its zooming in on Alicia but it keeps going till all you see is her hand behind her back and you are able to see in her hand she is holding the key that unlocks the wine cellar.Hitchcock uses light and dark colors to tell the moods of Alicia and Mrs. Sebastian. When the characters are wearing dark colors it represents the character feels trapped. When they are wearing light colors it represents they feel free. These two characters are usually wearing the opposite colors throughout the movie, since they are kind of like enemies. Lighting is also a major element used throughout this movie. Most the time Alicia and Alex are together is in darkness. Alicia is able to find safety in the darkness and represents her own world. Alex tries on many occasions to enter into it but is always rejected. The best example of this is the ending scene when Devlin gets Alicia into the car and Alex asks to come with and is denied. The best example that shows Alicia likes the darkness is when she goes to the CIA office during the day. She says the sun bothers her and wants the binds shut so it is dark in the room. Hitchcock has many scenes when the characters go from a light room to a dark room, or vise versa, and it's important to note this because the light changes how the characters interact with one another. An example of this is when Devlin and Alicia leave the wine cellar, a light room, and go outside into the darkness. Alex shows up and spots then outside right when Devlin tells Alicia to kiss him. This film zooms in twice on a cup of coffee that Alicia is drinking. The first time it is full and the second it is empty. After the second zoom in on the cup Alicia realizes she drank poison. From this point on it makes you conclude that she is going to die. Once she finishes her cup of coffee Alex and his mother appear as blurry shadow figures. Another time two shadow figures appear is at the very end. This is when Alicia and Devlin leave in the car and Alex turns to the house and his two business partners are standing in the doorway waiting for him to face his fate. I felt Ingrid Bergman, who plays Alicia Huberman, did a great job. This film depended a lot on facial expressions because of close shots on characters faces. She did a great job of getting the right expression at the right scene and made the movie much more enjoyable. The best example of this is when she realizes she drank poison and then there is a zoom in on her face.

		<shortDescription>A romantic stealth operation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time i watched the feeling, i had this dissatisfaction arising from unmet expectations, mainly because of the other works of Hitchcock i watched prior to this. I thought it was anti-climactic for Cary Grant and Ingrid to just drive off from Sebastian's house.It took me an year to coax myself i need to watch it one more time to judge it better, and it worked.The movie may not be as thrilling as North by Northwest or as mysterious as the romantic Vertigo but the movie is a melange of some brilliant photography and acting.So this is what i think of the climax once i thought was anti-climactic. Hitchcock has shown us what could happen when plans go astray instead of sticking to successful execution of stealth operations. As Sebastian becomes aware of the mole in his house, he is petrified and becomes cautious which leaves Alicia clueless as to what the proceedings of their clandestine conversations were. Devlin refuses to leave for Spain and braves to call on Sebastian and check for himself what Alicia was up to and finds her poisoned and manages to carry Alicia to his car insouciantly leaving Sebastian behind to answer his fellow Nazis.I am forced to budge. What a wonderful movie it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tied with ROPE as my favorite 40s Hitchcock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love suspense and you love espionage then it's hard to not love this one. Best film of 1946 and one of my favorites of the 40s at this stage. ROPE was my favorite 40s Hitch film. Now that I've seen this one I can't decide. I love both about evenly I think. Maybe I'd give NOTORIOUS a slight edge if pressed.So my favorite 40s Hitch films would be:1) NOTORIOUS 2) ROPE 3) SHADOW OF A DOUBT 4) FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT 5) SABOTEUR 6) SUSPICION 7) LIFEBOATOf course I still need to see REBECCA and SPELLBOUND. Maybe UNDER CAPRICORN and THE PARADINE CASE too. But those are considered to be Hitch's lesser films.Anyway, not being a huge Cary Grant fan (he comes across as too nasal-sounding and snobby/annoying most of the time) I really enjoyed him here. Played it very straight and had a dark edge to him. Ingrid Bergman really stole the show here as she quickly became the center of attention. And Claude Rains definitely should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Brilliant performance! His Alex Sebastian rivals his Louis Renault from CASABLANCA. Also you gotta love the mood that Hitch creates. Love all those camera angles. C'mon, when Bergman is in bed with a hangover how cool is that tilted camera shot showing Grant standing in the doorway? Or when he approaches her and the camera pans upside down? Or the famous "elevator shot" where Hitch had a special elevator platform built to film the scene at the party - where the camera slowly pulls in from a very wide and high shot down to an extreme closeup of the key in Bergman's hand. No other director would bother with "trivial" things like that. But Hitch does and that's why his films stand out from the rest.Also I enjoyed the "ticking bomb" scenario in this film - regarding the champagne bottles. There was also great tension in the wine cellar scenes. And then the finale on the staircase was very suspenseful. Also I love how we dislike and yet at the same time feel sorry for Sebastian. Especially at the very end.My list of 7 "great" 40s films would be (in no particular order): CASABLANCA, GASLIGHT, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, NOTORIOUS, ROPE, KEY LARGO, SAMSON AND DELILAH.There are others that I would consider good (TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE) or very good (SHADOW OF A DOUBT) but those 7 are the must-see ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingrid Bergman is the "notorious" Alicia, whose father has been sentenced to jail for being a Nazi spy. She, in turn, is recruited as a spy to work alongside Cary Grant (Devlin) in Rio de Janeiro to uncover the plottings of Nazi Claude Rains (Alexander) and his gang. Her mission is to get close to Rains and report back. She marries him but Rains discovers what she is up to and colludes with his mother Leopoldine Konstatin (Mme Sebastian) to dispose of his new wife. Can Cary Grant save Bergman from what has been planned for her...? This film ends up as being worth the watch, despite a bad beginning. The story takes a while to get going as we are subjected to a rather dull romance played out between an unlikeable Cary Grant and a miscast Ingrid Bergman. This is not the first time I have seen Bergman miscast as a street girl - see Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde (1941). She has a vulnerable, feminine face that is very good at registering certain expressions, ie, realizing that something is wrong, paranoid glances, etc but she is totally inappropriate as a wild, drunk, party-going type. She does, however, come into her element once Claude Rains is introduced and her performance becomes credible as she is vital to all the scenes of suspense, a mood that she is expert at playing. Cary Grant, however, is just unlikeable. He becomes likable at the end when he goes in to save Bergman but this is only because we know he is Cary Grant who is likable in all his other films. His character has an attitude problem and given that he is a spy and schooled in the ways of being a spy, his treatment of Bergman is totally unconvincing when she is given the assignment of getting close to Rains.My two favourite of the cast are Leopoldine Konstatin and Claude Rains. They stand out for me as they manage to let the audience know that they have a few more layers of nastiness up their sleeve and you don't quite know what they are capable of. Konstatin, in particular, is good at being evil.Get past the beginning nonsense and the film gets it's act together with some tense scenes and at the end of the film, you feel that it has been worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious (1946)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's finest. Notorious follows a young woman going undercover, after her father is arrested for treason. Just before going undercover, she falls for Agent Devlin, the man that has recruited her. What may come across as a spy espionage thriller, is really a romance in which two people wrestle between their romance and their professional lives. It also has early signs of feminism, as Grant refuses to tell OR ask Bergman to do anything. Everything is up to her, and her journey sees her becoming reliant on herself, and not the pain she causes herself and others. Having watched Lust, Caution) this film seemed tame. But luckily Bergman and Grant are able to deliver the lines with venom and spite that makes it just as uncomfortable to watch. The way Bergman says "You can add another playmate to my list?" and Grant's facial expressions are all we need to get a punch to the stomach. Best of all is Rains. He deserved his nomination for this performance. We are told he is the villain, but he does come across as charming in the least presumptuous way. He genuinely loves Bergman, which makes his betrayal a hard thing to watch. He is also wrapped up in a world that is hard to pull away from, making him such a tragic character. The final scene is simply glorious, and shows Hitchcock for the master that he is. The climax is three people walking down the stairs, but they are a nerve shattering few minutes on screen. The facial expressions, the dialog, it's all so brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly remarkable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is an espionage thriller set in South America that deals with escaped Nazi elites who have escaped to Rio de Janeiro after the war to work secretly on advanced weaponry. Directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock, produced by David O. Selznick, written by Ben Hecht, and featuring such acclaimed actors as Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains, Notorious is one of the best, if not the best, of Hitchcock's films from the 1940s, though others may prefer Spellbound, Shadow of a Doubt, or others.In the film, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), the daughter of a convicted traitor is recruited by government agent Devlin (Cary Grant) to prove her patriotism by taking on a special assignment which is not made clear to her until she reaches Rio. With a reputation for being promiscuous and a heavy drinker, Devlin maintains his distance form his recruit, worried about her unsavory past but assigns her the job of cozying up to the expatriate Germans and finding out what she can about their plans.Things get juicier when she learns that her target, Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains), was a former lover who wants to renew the courtship. This could be a problem because now Devlin has also fallen in love with her. Forced to make a decision when Sebastian asks her to marry him, Huberman agrees over the objection of Sebastian's stern and humorless mother (Leopoldine Konstantin), but finds herself becoming more deeply drawn into a no-win situation.The suspense builds in typical Hitchcock style when Devlin, invited to a wedding party, makes a startling discovery while snooping in Sebastian's wine cellar and the film keeps us hanging until its conclusion, one of Hitchcock's most talked about endings. Bergman is magnificent as usual, convincing in her dual role as a love object and a spy, with enough charm to keep everyone guessing. Grant is a master in projecting a self-confident, smooth, but distant and aloof persona, though, to me, he is unconvincing as a romantic lead. This did not get in the way, however, of enjoying a thoroughly remarkable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably my third favorite film I've ever watched (so far), and the first one with what is not a downer ending (monkeying around with the ending of BRAZIL does not count). I suppose this also makes it my favorite spy movie. And if this is a person's favorite spy movie, then it means he or she also likes a splendid love story. Who woulda thot I had it in me?Serious and generally unflappable spy Devlin (Cary Grant giving a brilliant performance--and this has got to be one of the most likable heroes we've got who really never gets to endear us the easy way, with jokes or a crazy moment or two) is meant to recruit the daughter of a convicted Nazi for spywork in Rio. The mission planned for her: use that unfortunate familial connection to infiltrate a scheming Nazi nest with a new, hidden agenda. The problem is: Devlin and Alicia (Ingrid Bergman looking stunning and matching Cary Grant in her performance) seem to be falling in love just when a crucial mission-detail filters down--Alicia is to seduce an old flame in order to join the Nazi circle effectively. Devlin and Alicia both push each other to admit that the Job will destroy the feelings that have been growing between them, but it all goes wrong as Devlin decides to seal his vulnerability up tight, and Alicia takes a similar tack. trying to goad Devlin into admitting his feelings rather than admit her own and abort the all-important mission. The day the mission actually starts--and Alicia "accidently" bumps into former lover Alex (Claude Rains at the top of his game, in the Lovesick, Jealous, Vulnerable, Mama's Boy, and finally Royally Peeved, Depts.)--Devlin and Alicia seem to hate each other. Two stubborn people who could have been the Romance Of The Ages are tougher on each other than all those Nazis hovering around them. Even if they win (or even just survive), it feels like they'll lose the most important thing.Of course, Hitchcock makes sure that The Disintegration Of The Romance Of The Ages is somehow actually The Romance Of The Ages Anyway. With every cruel verbal barb Devlin and Alicia hurl at each other--and with the fleeting moments of shared vulnerability earlier, they each know exactly where to jab and make it hurt most--we know how much these two proud people are in love. But duty first, and suspicions can easily be aroused if supreme care is not taken.The film looks stupendous; there are several famous visuals, among them Cary Grant's face as he turns from an airplane window and finds that heart-stopping Ingrid Bergman face closer than he thought (all this as the picture fades to another); and of course the wonderful creep-down from an all-encompassing swanky-party shot that zeros in on the key in our heroine's tense hand. Personally, I think the extended kiss of the early portion is out-done by the wonderful intimacy that just won't quit in Grant's and Bergman's final scene alone together, before they attempt to get down those stairs.A perfect film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notoriously silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched Notorious, I am utterly bewildered by all the 10/10 votes here in this forum...pages of them...are you kidding, how does anyone think this film is anything other then a LEMON?? The acting is average at best, the film work is a pretty poor effort with all the fake jerky backgrounds and the plot is a real stinker. This is one of those movies where each scene blunders into the next probably because they simply made it up as they went along. I can not help but feel that someone with a trunk load of money said lets hire the best director and actors, have a wild time making a movie and make a ton of cash no matter what the result. The only reason this movie floats is due to Grant and Bergman's charisma and the expectation that they will produce something memorable, but alas they are no match for an illogical and poorly constructed story line. Even though Hitchcock's directing is brilliant as always, it seems that no one is keeping an eye on the plot. Grants portrayal of a government agent is uneasy, you can tell he is uncomfortable with the role as it compromises his well trod persona of the flippant shallow charmer and thus he appears to be a bit out of his depth. The result of this is a stilted chemistry between Grant and Bergman. Bergman seems to fall in love much too fast and desperately to be believable and Grant doesn't seem to fall in love at all...because he is, I feel, attempting to play to the best of his ability a serious secret agent but is deprived of his own natural creative input unlike the carefree Romeo roles he is used to. Notorious is after all, supposed to be serious thriller and there's the problem - someone should have mentioned that to the writer. Do the secret agents have a plan - well, kinda...send the daughter of a nazi collaborator into the home of an ex-nazi to find out what he is up to because they suspect he's up to something being the nazi that he is..and that's it, no other reason. Nobody has staked out the house, they have no idea who comes or goes. These guys are not believable as secret agents, especially the handsome one...what's up with that anyway, twice he is referred to as good looking - what for, are they making fun of his HUGE nose or is it some kind of in-joke on the set. So they set up Alisha to accidentally meet Alex..with Devlin right next to them. You might be thinking, well that doesn't matter because the agent is going to drop out of sight and won't be seen again - wrong, Devlin doesn't give a stuff if they suspect him or not. So Alex has a dinner party and invites Alicia who can't help herself but look extremely suspicious even though nothing unusual happens. The chap jibbering at the wine bottle may well have been drunk for all she knew. You can't understand a word he said anyway but nevertheless they knock him off just for good measure...true Nazis indeed, too bad he was their only metalurgist. The next day they go to the races where Devlin meets Alicia to exchange information, right under Alex's nose, but alas, no alarm bells just yet. Alex, like an insanely jealous 10 year old, has fallen in love with Alicia almost instantly and wants her to prove she doesn't love Devlin by marrying him...in a few days time. Up to this point she seems to be just uncomfortable around Alex who fails to notice there is ABSOLUTELY zero chemistry between them. This woman is one cold fish but she goes along with it anyway, Mata Hari could get a few lessons from this girl. This is where the alarm bells should be ringing off the hook. Do the Nazis put him on a plane back to berlin for such crazy schoolboy behaviour, do the agents pull her out because Devlin may have jeopardised her cover, why hell no, the stuff-ups are just getting going. In a dazzling moment of stupidity Alicia takes the Key to the wine cellar from Alex's key chain whilst he is getting changed. She is suspicious that he is keeping something in the cellar so instead of simply asking for the key or alerting Devlin who, like all good secret agents doesn't need a goddam key....she just goes ahead and steels it, an action from which no amount of plot twist can possibly redeem her buns, she has without doubt blown her cover as soon as Alex goes to the wine cellar. Had she forgotten they are having a big party with lots of WINE that night, what the hell was she thinking...that Alex might think the key just fell off the chain. But lets ignore this for a moment and assess the brilliant plan Devlin comes up with. He simply shows up at the party and is all over Alicia in front of Alex and his cronies but are they suspicious...nope, not in the slightest. Cary Grant's good looks are enough to unnerve any man and send them into spiralling depths of depression so they overlook his little indiscretions. Off to the cellar go Devlin and Alicia where they discover the secret wine bottle amongst thousands of other bottles in about 25 seconds. They high tail it back upstairs but Alex busts them on his way down just outside the cellar door, so Devlin executes stage 2 of his ingenious plan by grabbing Alicia and kissing her in front of Alex after which Devlin simply says sayonara and takes off, good plan dude, save your own butt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had a little bit of mixed feelings about the first 30 minutes or so about this show. The the plot thickens and now I must say that this is one of the best that Hitchcock made.It's not really a thriller, as much as it is a psychological study. From the first moment we see Ingrid Bergman's face on screen, we know that she is not a saint. Her father has met a cruel fate and here she is moments after partying. This is definitely not Ilse from Casablanca.We soon learn that she has been monitored by a secret agent, played by Cary Grant, in a very uncharacteristic performance. He is definitely devoid of any charm, which always permeated his characters in nearly every other film he did. He is more like Humphrey Bogart here.The romance between Grant and Bergman is the most unusual for a Hitchcock film. There isn't really that much instant attraction from the beginning as so many other Hitchcock endeavors. It is actually more out of necessity that they finally get together.Then the good parts: Claude Rains plays a Nazi who was a friend of Bergman's father, also a Nazi. He lives under amnesty in Brazil with other Nazis and they are secretly hatching a plot. What that plot is, was at that time really sensational and would soon be real life. Somehow Hitchcock stumbled on a secret government project, although he didn't know it. This has to be the MacGuffin of all times. I won't spoil it by naming it, but it's funny how reality follows fiction sometimes.The way the plot unfolds is remarkable and quite ingenious, but since this is Hitchcock, the MacGuffin is really not that important. What is, is how the characters are influenced by it and the small character arcs which become bigger are really played out well.It's a shame that Claude Rains didn't win an Oscar for this part, or any other part for that matter, because he is sensational here. He is a coward, a mama's boy and completely humourless. What a difference from his part, also from Casablanca, of Renault, who may have been sleazy, but never a bonafide villain.Where can I find more of these gems? Oh, yes. In nearly the entire filmography of Alfred Hitchcock. Such genius, we never will see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>U.S. spies infiltrate a haven of German ex-patriots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's most stunning visual displays, this movie also showcases the chemistry of the two of the leading actors of the 1940's - Ingrid Bergman as Alicia Haberman and Cary Grant as TR Devlin in one of Hitchcock's most impressive movies.Bergman is recruited to infiltrate a Nazi group in Rio de Janeiro, whose base is in the residence of her ex-lover, played by Claude Rains. She is chosen by the Americans because of her links with German agents through her father, who was a convicted spy. However, she has no sympathy for the Nazis and this is known only to the authorities, who feel she is the perfect agent. Bergman plays the role of a woman with a "past". She is a socialite and a party animal. As she points out early on, what she wants are good times and laughs. Cary Grant clandestinely worms himself into her home posing as a party crasher and joins her on the mission, which she eventually agrees to. He also manages to see her true character as a strong woman who will risk her life for the cause or perhaps for him. The use of champagne is an amusing vignette. We see Grant leaving a bottle at a meeting with his boss; at another point, the supply of party champagne runs out; and Hitchcock's cameo shows him drinking champagne at the bar. The black and while photography is beautiful from the aerial shots as the plane arrives in Rio de Janeiro, the street patios and the racecourses. In one particular zoom, the shot travels from the upper balcony and hones in on a key held by Alicia. We see the long takes, the frame-to-frame detailed compositions and full screen closeups as the men in Rains's house are introduced to Bergman. In one instance of great camera work, Bergman drops a key from her clenched fist and pushes it under a chair with her foot to evade Rains' suspicion. The back projection used on some of the sets is obvious and detracts somewhat from the beautiful on location shots.The photography, stylish sets and the acting of the full cast is superb. Leopoldine Konstantine is the domineering and scheming mother of Claude Rains and plays her role as Alicia's adversary, not only for her son's affections but because of her strong suspicions regarding Alicia's reliability. Louis Calhern is Devlin's distinguished looking boss. The Nazi sympathizers at the Sebastian residence fit Hitchcock's view of a certain class of spies he seems to loathe -- rich, cultured, and possessing all the social graces.The movie has more than its share of sexual allusions that have become boring and dated. Hitchcock's movies aimed at titillating a 1940's movie audience and these are not the strengths of his cinematic art; however, for the most part the dialogue of writer Ben Hecht has stood up well. Certainly, the style and the acting of this movie more than make up for this shortcoming. As for the style, both Bergman and Grant are impressively dressed. Cary Grant's well tailored suits and Ingrid Bergman's wardrobes are a credit to Edith Head's talent for costume design.Recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious reminds me a lot of older movies because I feel that most have the same type of plot line. For characters you have the beautiful woman Alicia, her love interest Devlin, and of course the other man who she pretends to be in love with Alex. This movie has a very simplistic plot line; it was based in the time of Nazi spies and deception. A theme that was very prominent was trust; many characters throughout the film were very quick to trust others around them. I would have expected people in this time period to be a little more wary of who they allowed in their life, especially if they were involved with the Germans. The movie flowed very well all together; each scene was very well led into another. I was very impressed with the lighting throughout the film I especially liked the lighting when Devlin went into Alicia's room. The lighting started off almost eerie and then became brighter almost as though the fog of deception was being lifted from their relationship. This movie is definitely one of Hitchcock best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that happens under guises, by people playing roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always been strange to me how slow a Hitchcock film can be to get moving. Like his previous film Spellbound, Notorious starts slow not in the manner that we're thrown in the middle of an experience and it takes us time to orient, more in the manner that a part of the film must be specifically set apart so the two leading actors can fall in love. I dislike how 'falling in love' in a Hitchcock film is something that must happen in its own time, before the movie can begin. This one does something amazing with the struggle of the two lovers to fall out of it, or verify to themselves that they're not, that they're still acting parts in a game. The doubletalk between Grant and Bergman is some of the best of the decade, I love how they're talking trivialities like what to eat for dinner with manners of passion.The best part of Notorious happens under guises, by people playing roles, hiding deceit or love under social etiquette, and I only have the times to blame that so much of the film's plot doesn't recognize its own redundancy in all this. The ballroom sequence, Grant and Bergman conspiring to snoop down the basement to break into the mysterious wine cellar, rings bells in my head that say "social interaction is the best adult game", except the stakes are real. But then, as usual for him, Hitchcock hinges so much of his film's effectiveness on things making sense a certain recognizable way, so that Bergman's idea of snooping into the wine cellar using a stolen key the day of the ballroom threatens to send the movie off under that annoying "she wouldn't do it that way" spotlight.I remember reading a review on North by Northwest that said everything for Hitchcock takes place in a selfcontained 'movie world'. As far as his pulp fiction is concerned I agree, it's paperback style yet done without the selfaware distance of later directors like Melville. But the relationship between Grant and Bergman or the struggle for one given the circumstances is very interesting to me. It speaks not about the things that can happen in a movie but the things that do happen in life. Not saying you love someone because words are trivial, the other knowing that but wanting to hear the words anyway. Playing jealous to make light of a situation then becoming it, the other sensing the jealousy but not being able to fight it back. The final scene, how again it hinges on etiquette, behaviour judged as normal or not by thirds, is amazing, except for the fact that Grant has to run his mouth saying things we all understand as do the characters. I'd love to see that scene, those dynamics, play out in chilling silence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is a very good film in my opinion. I liked all of the settings and the characters, and the film was written and acted really well. The film demonstrates Hitchcock's idea of a MacGuffin fabulously. The thing that everyone in the movie was worried about didn't really matter to the audience at all; what matters to us is the relationship between the main characters and what's happening with Alicia while she is undercover. After listening to Hitchcock's explanation of a MacGuffin, it was really interesting to look for it in one of his films. Notorious is a super suspenseful film. I thought it was really great how the movie was able to be so exciting and suspenseful while not having very much action at all. Everything that happens in the film happens very subtly without a lot of commotion, but the movie is still just as gripping as any high-action film. Notorious is quite fun to watch and is really easy to get into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite Hitchcock films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is my favourite director, and I love a vast majority of his films particularly Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, North By Northwest, Dial M For Murder and 39 Steps. Notorious for many reasons is one of my favourite films from the Master of Suspense. The cinematography, locations and costumes are ravishing, I loved that stunning crane shot swooping towards the key in Bergman's hand, while the score is beautiful, romantic and melodious. The script itself is like poetry, Hitchcock's direction is superb with some very nice deft touches and the story is engaging with the suspense unfolding in a more subtle way than with North By Northwest or Vertigo. And the acting is wonderful. Cary Grant is charming and urbane not to mention ice-cold in character, while Ingrid Bergman is alluring and vulnerable and their chemistry is note-perfect. They are almost out-shadowed by the outstanding supporting performance of Claude Rains, who was one of the best supporting actors of his time with one of the most memorable voices; he plays a truly treacherous character yet also gives him a sense of humanity. Parts of Notorious may be slow, but to me it is never boring. It is not thematically complex, but it is dark and romantic and is truly polished entertainment too. In conclusion, another favourite Hitchcock of mine, and I personally think it is a must-watch for any fans of the director. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great review. I've just seen it for the first time. They just don't make them like that any more. Great shadow, great tension, OTT but so stylish. Call it film noir if you like or whatever you like. But it grips, because of the irony, the suspense of the relationships and above all the atmosphere it probably captures of its time, full of paranoia, suspicion, danger, fear and nationalism. A Great, great movie. How could it have taken me so long to catch up with it. Ingrid Bergman melting, Cary Grant, so ironic - nobody today can touch him for that. Brilliant camera-work. Expressionist. Claude Rains smoothly weird and dangerous. And the mother! You just couldn't get away with that now, her movement when her son asks for help and she reaches for her cigar, or cigarette from her bed. Slow, slow, and full of portent. Why don't young film makers look at this and realise that pacing is what it's all about. Zooming about with camera lenses, jumping and losing tempo doesn't do it. Pacing, slow, languorous shots. You'll grip your audiences every time, no matter what age. Fabulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can love trump duty? Will a "fatheaded guy, full of pain" allow a woman who adores him to be thrown to the lions? Can we root against an otherwise sympathetic and too-trusting victim of a confidence scam just because he happens to be a Nazi plotting to construct the Fourth Reich?Alfred Hitchcock movies work on multiple levels, but "Notorious" is one film where the actual crime and its investigation become almost ancillary concerns. Watching Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) stick her head in a lion's mouth for the sake of heartless puppeteer "Dev" Devlin (Cary Grant) is hard enough. Worse yet, the lion, a Nazi exile living in Brazil named Alex Sebastian (Claude Rains), sincerely cares for the woman. This must be ignored to foil a dastardly plot.Bergman is the center of attention, and properly generates much of this film's positive buzz. She looks a fright for much of the film, "the ragged end of nowhere" she's called, despite being at her all-time gorgeous peak. When we first see her, she's a frowsy, jaded wreck, drinking herself into oblivion following her father's disgraceful arrest as a Nazi traitor. Even the old letch trying to get her on his yacht won't tell her he loves her. He just wants to use her. That's fine by her."There's nothing like a love song to give you a good laugh," she says, and your heart aches with hers.Enter Dev, who knows Alicia has a heart, only he wants to exploit it. Grant is a good actor, and a great movie star, and so he's able largely to engage our sympathies despite a script that works against him at nearly every turn. He's not only mean to Alicia, he's a lunk-headed klutz whose irrational jealousy endangers her. Once he gets her situated with Alex, he can't stop telling her what a slut she is, which only make her more fragile and vulnerable to exposure. Others say he's part of the reason the film's so great; my patience with him was sorely tested many times over and lessened my enjoyment of an otherwise ripping yarn.Maybe I'm down on Grant because I think Rains is so terrific. Hitchcock and writer Ben Hecht pass up every opportunity to make Alex a dislikeable character. He loves Alicia honestly and even protectively to a point, the polar opposite of callous Dev. And he wears his heart on his sleeve. "You'll let me help your loneliness?" he pleads with her. Rains downplays his metrosexual smoothness for a rare, aching sincerity which is cruelly misused by everyone around him, including his domineering mother (Leopoldine Konstantin). He's not really evil, just too soft and prone to let crueler people have their way with him.Hecht and Hitchcock also conspire to squeeze every drop of suspense from "Notorious"; whether it's a case of champagne on ice or a key in a hand. The patterned tiles of a foyer become a chessboard of move and countermove. Even Hitchcock's cameo comes at a critical juncture! Daniel R. Baker said in his 1999 review that this is "the best I can recommend for those who have already learned to love Hitchcock's work", and next to "Vertigo" I'd agree. It's a tougher film, centered around not-so-nice characters, and worth every painstaking minute of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie, albeit alone is a great example of film at his finest, which can be said about many of Hitchcock's works, is an even better example of a true mcguffin. the use of the element uranium to almost hide the true story occurring was very impressive. what was incredibly fascinating was that one could watch the movie and be entertained by either, or both, of the occurring plots going on within the movie. this dual plot is seldom found in modern movies that are played in theaters. i personally always find these small details in movies interesting. seeing someone choose to make a movie about a plot that isn't even truly the movie's main total plot is always a great use of the human ability to tell stories and express ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>notorious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, Notorious was released in 1946. Starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, was a spy thriller, mixed with romance and betrayal. Bergmann plays the character Alicia Huberman, daughter of a German spy who commits suicide. Trying to clear his name, she meets up with Grant, T.R. Devlin who convinces her to become an undercover agent to clear her father's name. I found it unusual that a woman had this type of role during the 40's. The cinematography was extremely well done. Scenes between Bergman and Grant, such as when they were at the horserace, showed a cool, aloof, but powerful performance. In a short time span, she is faced by both Devlin, whom she loves, and her husband who questions her about her interaction with Devlin. The party scene at the Sebastian mansion was classic. We see the sprawling mansion shot, and then the focus on to the key in Alicia's hand, which she carefully hands off to Devlin who is investigating items in Sebastian's home. Camera focus zooms on pieces to the story. Both Grant and Bergmann give wonderful performances, as well as Claude Rains as Bergmann's husband. As Grant and Bergmann uncover Rain's secrets, his mother begins her plot to be rid of her daughter-in-law who knows too much. Claude Rains, plays Alexander Sebastian, a controlling man who keeps a strict eye on his wife. Hitchcock's Notorious, is a great suspenseful thriller. As the relationship develops between Huberman and Devlin, so does the suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of Hitchcock films including Vertigo, Psycho and Read Window and I thought all of those were better than this one. This movie was good but I expected it to be a little better. The story is great for the time the movie was made because German Nazis had just escaped Germany after the war and people were looking for the people who committed the crimes against humanity. The relationship between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman is amazing in this film. There relationship is somewhat strange and hard to get but it is so entertaining to watch them together. Grants character chooses to go with the job of having her seduce the German man to get into their group. The film is filled with much suspense and is a must watch for any fan of Hitchcock films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is a wonderful post WWII drama starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. After the break up of the third Reich, U.S. intelligence was experiencing paranoia, not knowing who to trust. This film is a great depiction American espionage that constantly leaves the viewer questioning the protagonist. This was my first Alfred Hitchcock film and I was very impressed with his command of the lens. The shooting and editing was very creative and technical. Hitchcock's use of special effects to portray Bergman's intoxication was amazing. Grant and Bergman's on screen romance was very believable (They couldn't keep their hands off each other). The makers of this film used great exaggerated sound to make the suspense almost unbearable. Overall, very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, many people remember Psycho or The Birds. But this gem gets shuffled under the rug too often when it comes to Hitchcock classics, and any fan of suspense should give this film a try.Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is sent to investigate a Nazi holdout in South America, and she's forced to marry her former hubby Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains) while she really is attracted to her operative partner, TR Devlin (Cary Grant). Grant and Rains make wonderful foils of one another, as Sebastian is constantly the one showing her affection, even though he's supposed to be the one investigated. On the flip side, Devlin is constantly pushing her away, although in the end in a classic Hitchcock move our perceptions of good and evil are turned on their head.You begin to see Hitchcock's genius in this movie from the very start. The way he uses soft focus to convey a sense of a hangover (not to mention the disorienting upside-down camera), or the perfect foils as the light liquid from her hangover in the beginning saved he state of mind but the dark liquid towards the end is what ended up killing her. It's inconsequential what the liquid actually is - the use of light and color in a black and white film gets the point across just as well, and it's that kind of detail that makes this movie shine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1946 Director Alfred Hitchcock released the film Notorious. The film has outstanding actosr and actresses. Cary Grant acts as Devil. Grant does it again playing the role so well. He is easily one of my favorite actors he is incredible. Also the film stars Ingrid Bergman, who plays Alice, the alcoholic daughter of a traitor. Devin meets Ingrid and up springs a love story. The two are falling in love but Ingrid has agrees to spy on an old friend of her traitor father. So she may regain some type of honor that was destroyed by her father's betrayal. She must pretend to love him in order to spy on him. She will have to stay with him and sleep in his house. This puts a strain on the relationship between Devil and Ingrid. I must say the best element of the movie for me was the acting. I mean the light, cinematography and editing was all excellent but what stood out to me was the outstand job Grant and Bergman do. The chemistry between the two seems so natural. They really have you believing there a spark between them. If you like suspenseful love dramas all rap in one with great action this is the film for you.</fullReview>

Every time I would think that everything was going to work out she stirred it back up. I was so into this movie that when Delvin and Alicia were in the basement snooping around in the wine cellar I began to sweat, and when he dropped the bottle I yelled "Oh No!". The whole time I wanted them to be together for good. So the ending made me very happy. And the part about the uranium was like a whole other sub-plot.</fullReview>

Since the beginning of the film you can see the passionate love they have for one another. Other smaller actors that took place in this film did a great job as well, into making this film full of realism between the characters.The thing that really caught my attention since the beginning was the camera angles and stunning and daring shots that Hitchcock used. With the first person camera shot in certain parts of the film, gave you (the watcher) what Alicia Huberman saw and felt during a couple of semi-important parts.This is one movie that I would most definitely tell everyone should watch.

		<shortDescription>Early Hitchcock... With Nazis!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingrid Bergman stars as an American spy, working with Cary Grant, out to dig up information on Claude Rains, a former Nazi who has moved to Brazil and still has Nazi connections. Things get complicated when Rains and Grant both fall for Bergman.I want to be really brief on this: Bergman is not as hot as she's made out to be, despite being a decent actress. I've seen more than enough of Cary Grant, and wish other actors had some starring roles in the 1940s. Rains is a pleasure to see... especially after not seeing him in "The Invisible Man".Early Hitchcock is an interesting thing. His stories are still sharp, but this venture into espionage and Nazis is foreign to me. I guess he regularly does espionage stories, but I was much more familiar with his crime, horror and suspense work ("Rope", "Vertigo", "Rear Window", "Psycho", "Birds", etc.) The fact this story takes place in my least favorite country on Earth, Brazil, is just icing on the cake (though there's really nothing in the story that makes Brazil important to the plot -- it could have been anywhere.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's perfect direction keeps "Notorious" on his list of timeless thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of World War II, Alfred Hitchcock brought audiences "Notorious," a romantic thriller with political undertones. To audiences of the era, I'm sure it was slightly scandalous. Not only in its dealing with Germans living in Brazil post-WWII and handling uranium, but also with its co-stars Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman kissing on and off for an extremely long take. It's safe to say that was particularly sensual for film in 1946, but for modern viewers, their love affair seems almost childish and unfounded. The one aspect of this film that has not withered over the last 60-some years, however, is the immaculate direction of Sir Alfred Hitchcock.Hitchcock is not only a master of suspense in "Notorious," but also of grace and creativity. His every directorial choice is inspired and brilliant, creating every emotion and audience reaction he could've possibly intended. From his elegant zoom-ins on a memorable key to his object-focused transitions such as bottles of wine, Hitchcock is what makes this film truly great. Writer Ben Hecht has certainly crafted a screenplay of carefully placed tension and brilliant turns of events, but it's Hitchcock telling this story through the details that makes it a classic. Grant and Bergman star as two people with a mission who fall for each other. He's a government agent in charge of persuading her, the daughter of a German-born traitor who's just been imprisoned, to go undercover in Rio. She must use her womanly wiles to gain access to the house of one of her father's old acquaintances who has always had feelings for her. Tension between the two lovers rises when she marries him for the sake of the operation.The romantic aspect of the film is definitely weak by modern standards. It's got a juicy old- world feel that when things get tough for them, acts like it's a whole lot more intense than it is. Grant and Bergman, however, do their part to charm the audience into going with it. Once you get over the hump that they've starting taking themselves way to seriously too soon, it becomes an intriguing part of the film.As a thriller, after the first 45 minutes the film starts to pick up. Hecht and Hitchcock hold the film's only secret over your head for as long as they can to keep your attention and it pays off. There's something just classically suspenseful about our heroes trying to gain access to the restricted cellar at a party, but if the party runs out of champagne, they'll get caught. Hitchcock keeps showing the number of bottles in the cooler diminishing and the tension builds. Classic technique and there's nothing stale about it.The political edge has also kind of worn down on this film. I can imagine that would feel like a bigger deal right after WWII, but today the undertones are too subtle to come across the viewer completely. Hecht's storytelling, however, premise aside, is superb. Ultimately, even if the romance is a bit out there and the magnitude of the situation diminished over the years Hitchcock and "Notorious" have you hooked, as always, on what will happen next.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

Woman meets agent, woman falls in love with agent, agent asks woman to marry other man for reason of cracking case. Sounds simple enough but there are many turns and curves along the way. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergnman are at their best in this film. Claude Rains is the man with whom Ingrid Bergman is asked to infiltrate and he is absolutely great in his role. My favorite scene occurs when Cary Grant meets Ingrid Bergman on the sly at a horse race where she shares recent developments with him. I love the back and forth that takes place between them. Another great film from Hollywood's Golden Age. GimmeClassics</fullReview>

I found it interesting how deep the character went for the job she was fulfilling. She has to infiltrate some Germans by going undercover, or should I say under covers. The romance part of the film did not do anything for me, and so I put up with it knowing the best is yet to come...the suspense just builds.But the best came at the end...when the German she personally infiltrated loses, he is forced to turn and face the other villains, and that is when I burst out loud in awe....One hell of an ending....wonder what they did to him??</fullReview>

Ms. Bergman's mission is to romance Claude Rains (as Alex Sebastian), a Nazi associate of her father, and uncover the clandestine Party's nuclear power secrets. Bergman is so successful that Mr. Rains proposes marriage, but she is falling in love with Mr. Grant...Classic Hitchcock, with only the relationship between Bergman and Grant coming across as less than spectacular, in the opening act.The sparks really start to fly when Rains enters the picture; and, the most interesting relationship is the one Rains has with mother Leopoldine Konstantin (as Anna Sebastian). As the real villain of the film, Ms. Konstantin portrays one of director Hitchcock's typically domineering mothers. "Academy Awards" and/or "Film Daily" considered Hitchcock ("Best Director"), Bergman ("Best Actress"), Rains ("Supporting Actor"), and Ben Hecht ("Best Writing") for awards. Konstantin's creepy Madame should have been included. Watch it.********* Notorious (8/15/46) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, Claude Rains, Leopoldine Konstantin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sparks fly when you have the dashing Cary Grant as the egoistical lover and the vivacious but spoilt, Ingrid Bergman who in order to prove that she has mended her ways takes on a dangerous assignment of being undercover in Brazil for Cary's employer - the US Feds.Ingrid Bergman as Ms Huberman with her tantalizing beauty is even more appealing than Ilsa in Casablanca and that, trust me is saying something! Cary, on the other hand, is restrained and intense as the jealous lover with all his passionate feelings bottled up. It is perhaps, Cary's best role and as far as suavity in a character is concerned, it comes next only to Humphrey Bogart's role in Casablanca. The dialogs are the crispiest and wittiest ever written and the exchange of flirtations between Cary and Ingrid at the lunch table and a later scene at Ingrid's hotel room where they have a tiff is a testimony to that.And while I make repeated references to Casablanca, Notorious is not just a passionate romantic story. True thats the crux of it, but it is a great suspense thriller directed by the wizard, the one and only, Sir Alfred Hitchcock. There is a haunting eeriness in the second half of the movie which reminds one of 'Mandarlay' in Hitchcock's Rebecca. Perfectly executed, at the end of it you have only one word in your mind, the clichéd - MASTERPIECE!! This one's got to be watched all cuddled up with that special someone on a sparkling romantic night!</fullReview>

This movie ranks up there with Hitches best work. It is the best film Hitchcock did with RKO.

Claude Rains is as good here as in any film as the traitor who is being spied on to the point where Berman marries him in order to spy on him. The story is creepy, especially the attempted poisoning of Bergman in the late stages of the film. This film is must viewing for any fan of these folks. It is one of several films that Rains &amp; Bergman did together. The stair case theme in this movie as in many of Hitchcocks films plays a main stage for much of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Notorious" is Alfred Hitchcock's film about a woman, whose father was involved with the Nazis, who meets a government agent at a party. She is asked to infiltrate a group of Nazis in South American on behalf of the United States.This film is primarily notable for excellent performances from three great talents. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman fill the lead roles as government agent and recruited spy with their usual charm and create a shining romance. Claude Rains is skilled as usual as a Nazi leader, which he makes dangerous yet refined and even warm for the most part, creating an interesting character.This film's story is methodically paced, and overall not as engaging as other Hitchcock efforts, but for the most part is well-written. As far as a spy plot, ultimate secrets obtained and intrigue seem unimportant relative to the tension associated with infiltration, which wasn't a great detriment to the film. The tension is well-developed after the story is introduced. There are a number of excellent scenes, and in particular I liked the intriguing wine cellar sequence and the sharp ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping thriller thoughtfully made and acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a real sense of moral investigation in this stylish Hitchcock post-war thriller. Consciously post-war, not least because Claude Rains' former Nazi Sebastian is already a figure of dubious morality, but also as he's living in South America, to North America what Europe is to Britain, an exotic but morally confusing place.Crucially of course, the moral confusion is in and surrounds Sebastian's former wife Alicia Hubermann, played with a exotic, sexy but militant primal force by Ingrid Bergman. She drinks. Her first outfit is of European origin to affirm the symbolic allusion. She fights, in a peculiarly, almost painfully extended, sexless scene with Cary Grant, as he tries to persuade her to help him against her former husband. The sex, such as it gets represented in 50s films (i.e. by formal allusion) is arrived at after painful soul searching. And the obligatory romantic seduction that leads to it, overlooking the city, is cut as short as the earlier car struggle is long, since this time Grant wins with a conventional ease - I'm not as interested in this, says Hitchcock. Not in this movie.But many of the usual Hitchcockisms are everpresent - the cameo, the foreshot of a vital symbol (the champagne bottle), and virtuosic, almost new wave cutting to crank up the tension. The less effective moments occur when the actors have to subordinate their performances to the end idea of the Hitchcock set piece.Otherwise this is a fine matinee-style idol-as-character movie that confirmed Hitchcock's sure touch. 7/10.</fullReview>

Devlin, and Ingrid Bergman as the notorious yet patriotic Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted Nazi.Devlin recruits Huberman as a spy to infiltrate the Rio operations of renegade Nazi Alexander Sebastian, played by Claude Rains.The movie is full of famous visual Hitchcockian scenes; most between the two lead characters, but the utmost haunting scene is the subtle one at the end where we envision the fate of Sebastian.Hitch's last big success of the Nineteen-Forties, and Oscar nominated for best writing-original screenplay (Ben Hecht) and best supporting actor (Claude Rains), `Notorious' is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mysterious Acts Of Love By Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Notorious by Alfred Hitchcock, many aspects of the movie caught my attention. The move started off slow building the foundation of the plot, but after Alicia and Devlin go to Rio de Janeiro, the events begin to unfold. Throughout the movie, role characterization and camera techniques were very unique and well portrayed as they work together. In the beginning of the movie, Alicia has guests over at her house showing them drinking and having a great time. She begins to talk to a man whose back is toward the audience and his face is never shown. Alicia continues to talk, but the man stays silent and unresponsive. The shot fades out and when the next scene fades in, the audience still perceives this particular man with his back towards the camera. This particular camera technique reveals underlining themes about this character. Not showing emotions and stiff behavior describes how Devlin reacts throughout the movie. After Alicia is knocked out by Devlin in the car, she waked up the next morning in a daze. When she hears a voice, Alicia looks up and we again see a man whose face is not visible. When he begins to walk towards the bed, his face becomes visible and the camera follows his body from the view of Alicia. As the camera follows Devlin, the audience realizes how Alicia's eyes stick on Devlin's face the whole time. During the party Alicia and Alex throw, the camera is used in a distinct way to show jealousy between Alex and Devlin. When Devlin arrives, the camera follows Alicia to greet Devlin. While they are talking, the shots go back and forth showing Alex's jealousy seeing out they interact. When Alicia goes back to Alex, the camera switches back and forth from Devlin to Alicia and Alex showing Devlin's jealousy as well. Finally, after Alicia realizes she has been poisoned by Alex and his mother, the camera uses their shadows to make their personas dark and wicked. Alicia begins to become dizzy and can only see the shadows outline Alex and his mother. As Alicia walks towards the door, the shadows of Alex and his mother combine showing how both personas equal one person. Overall, Notorious kept me on the edge of my seat and never let me down. The role characterization and camera techniques were connected throughout the whole movie which made this particular movie complete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of hitchcocks greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie screened was Notorious, by Alfred Hitchcock. The movie is unique because of its use of different camera techniques to make the viewer seem like you are really in the movie. The first example of this is at the very beginning of the movie when the camera is shown looking though a door crack as the trial is ending. Alfred Hitchcock could of chose to show the faces and the courtroom setting but didn't. The reason he did this is to make the camera more like what you would be seeing. This makes the movie believable and draws the viewer in right away. One other way in making the audience feel like they are in the movie is shot reverse shot. This is used throughout the movie but you first see it at the end of the party when the two main characters are talking. The shot reverse shot makes you feel like the main characters are addressing you. The close ups on their faces is the way you would be seeing the actor/actress if you were sitting across from them. When the two main characters are driving down the road you also see a camera shot that we have not seen so far. The camera is showing the road ahead. This is done not only to show that the lady is drunk but to give the viewer the sense that he is in the car too. Three other times when the camera is used to emulate the audience actually being in the movie is when you see through the woman's eyes when she is driving and gets hair in her eyes, when she is suffering from a hangover and her vision of the male main character rotates, and when she is drugged and her vision starts to go black before she passes out. All of these instances make you feel like you are experiencing what she is. Besides the use of camera shots to make the audience more involved with the movie. A great use of objects and camera shots were used to relay messages. The most dramatic of these is when the male main character leaves the bottle of wine behind after he gets done hearing what the assignment is for the female main character. Having the wine bottle left shows the change in the frame of mine. The male main character was filled with thoughts of the two main characters having a wonderful night together. After hearing the news every thought that he might have had is no more. Much like the wine is no longer an issue or a concern. The only thought now is them being split apart before they even come together, and the dread of what he has to tell her. One other use of this was the scene when the key reapers on the key chain. No words are said but you know what is being thought as you see the close ups of the husbands face as a close up of the key on the key ring. This close up used to build up tension is also used in the basement when the husband is looking at the bottles. A close up is used to show the importance of the shot and a sense of suspense as the camera slowly goes from one bottle to another until the date is different. Then the finding of the broken bottle and without a word the audience knows that the husband is aware his wife is a spy. The use of the close ups also is used to tell things that the actors never reveal themselves for example, it is never said the poison will be put in the coffee but you know with the first close up of the cup that is where the poison is. The use of close ups also helps to instill the false stereotype of the Germans in this movie. The Germans are depicted as cold heartless killers and this is supported by the close ups of their stone cool faces lacking any emotion. The best example of this in the movie is the end. There are quick cuts to the Nazi's faces as the two main characters are walking down the stairs. Depicting them as heartless and ruthless killers even the mother was shown to be evil. If someone had to base all of their German knowledge from this movie the person would most likely be scared to death if they had to meet one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it on Laserdisc!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is a great movie overall, but there are editing differences between the DVD version and the laserdisc version. On the laserdisc, a film historian is narrating some scenes on the analog audio track... one that stands out is a scene in which Cary Grant's character drops a champagne/wine bottle, and the historian notes that a bottle would take less than a second to hit the floor. The laserdisc contains the bottle falling, a cut to Grant's facial expression, a cut to Ingrid Bergman's facial expression, and then a cut back to Grant's expression, then the bottle hits the floor (about 4 seconds give or take). Basically, Hitchcock extended the scene for a bit more suspense.This scene on the DVD only shows Grant's first expression and the bottle hits the floor (about the normal 1 second or so for it to fall).When it comes to Hitchcock, I'm sure he himself would have wanted the audience to see his movies exactly how he wanted them edited, and not re-edited for any reason (could you imagine re-editing of the Shower Scene in Psycho?). If the DVD is to contain different edited scenes, there should be an extra supplement stating this, not put directly into the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Notorious" is one of those movies that snares you into its web of deceit and trickery no matter how many times you've seen it. It ranks up there with "Psycho," "Rear Window" and "North by Northwest" in its ability to withstand repeated viewing.In college I took a Hitchcock Film class. Unfortunately "Notorious" wasn't on the list of films we were watching. But many of us took it upon ourselves to view and write about this beautiful film, regardless of the professor's syllabus.Ingrid Bergman's character is an alcoholic daughter of a war criminal who's recruited by the US to help spy on the Nazis in South America. Cary Grant plays the agent who recruits her. The two actors had enormous careers, but they've never looked more glamorous and overpowering than in "Notorious."I'm not going to talk the movie to death or go into all the details about the sheer magic Hitchcock created. I will say that one of the most powerful themes that Hitchcock slipped in throughout the film (and most people don't notice) is the relation between alcohol and poison. It's definitely something to watch. All the major dramatic points in the story circle around champagne, wine cellars and poison. Not to say that Hitchcock though alcohol was evil, because I don't think he did. It's just another example of how Hitchcock is able to take simple, everyday things or activities and give them a sinister spin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid spy drama with lots of interest for Hitchcock devotee's, 'Notorious' is one of the multitude of films which maintain his reputation without particularly enhancing it.Film combines love story and espionage aspects, as US agent Devlin enlists Alicia Huberman to infiltrate a group of Nazi's based in South America. Grant and Bergman fill these roles well and build up a convincing frosty working relationship, which clearly masks the simmering desire they have for each other. Neither of them move out of 2nd gear though and the film as a whole, isn't that ambitious in it's scope. Claude Rains is the pivotal player on which 'Notorious' could lift itself up a notch, but I found him disappointing in a role he isn't really suitable for. As the sophisticated Nazi agent who falls for Bergman's charms he comes across as too weak and gullible. The storyline puts his character in a difficult position, as it seems ridiculous that he would fall for her and marry so quickly. Apart from being too old for the part ( Bergman was 26 years younger than Rains ), he doesn't have enough menace about him to make the audience feel that Alicia is in any real danger.I don't mean to be harsh on 'Notorious' - the film has some great moments and is solid in all departments. There is a tendency to assume that all Hitchcock film's are works of genius. This is wrong as Hitchcock's reputation rests on the quantity of his work and the high standard maintained over a long period of time. He has a select group of classics, which are then given a rock-solid foundation by a multitude of quality efforts. 'Notorious' is one of these quality efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isn't it delicious?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What else can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie? This movie has so many quintessential Hitchcock shots, such as the hair in front of the camera, the intermittent kiss scene, and (spoiler) the frighteningly distorted first-person point of view shots when Ingrid Bergman is poisoned.I've only seen five or six movies with Bergman (Spellbound, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Anastasia, Casablanca, etc.), but I'd have to say this is one of her best, least melodramatic performances. No glistening eyes like in Casablanca, no throwing herself at or down in front of her lover or her grandmama.Grant was a bit dry, but that probably is more due to the character. He is more believable than he is in North by Northwest, but I liked his character better in that movie (probably because in Notorious he's part of the government machine that is making the girl "spy" do naughty things instead of being an everyman).Spoiler: The ending was extremely subtle, which was great, except that I at first thought it wasn't ending. Nothing was overtly resolved about the uranium sand, which seemed strange to me (Truffaut's book on Hitchcock described the whole thing as one of Hitch's famous McGuffins). While I wasn't particularly interested in whether the German underground got fuel for their atomic weapons, it does leave one end of the bow undone. Of course, in 1946, there was no neat bow to put on ex-Nazis yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a Fascinating Piece of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to catch this work on AMC's "Murder by Hitchcock." Thank God for AMC on Sunday nights! The story revolves around Alicia Huberman (Portrayed wonderfully by the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman.) who's been recruited by Devlin (Cary Grant.) to infiltrate a clandestine spy ring. You see, her father was a Nazi traitor and it seems the rest of his comrades are still in South America. They're up to something, but I won't tell you what. It doesn't matter much, it's another one of Hitchcock's McGuffins. There are only four real characters worth mentioning. The other two are Sebastian (a magnificient performance by Claude Reins.) and his mother. His mother was played by a Polish stage actress in her only film role. The actress does a wonderful job. The other characters aren't developed enough to leave any impression, but's all for the best. Developing the rest of Sebastian's cohorts and Devlin's allies would have been distracting. Sebastian's cohorts work better as simple "elemental presences", or non-characters who exist only to service plot functions. The three main characters are actually representative of Hitchcock's psyche. Cary Grant was the man Hitchcock wanted to be. Ingrid Bergman was Hitchcock's ideal woman. And Claude Reins stood for Hitchcok's insecurities. The directing in Notorious is top of the line. Catch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is usually considered by experts to be one of Hitchcock's 10 best movies ever. It features fine performances from Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. Bergman is nothing like her character in Spellbound. She actually starts out as sort of an unlikeable character, but she grows on you as the movie progresses. Grant is terrific which leads me to ask, why did he never win an Oscar? Although the movie drags at times, Hitch does a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat. Although I can see how some people feel this movie is overrated, it's still a classic and a must-see for Hitch fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>among the best of hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is perhaps my favourite hitchcock film. the edgy chemistry between cary grant and ingrid bergman is not only palpable but also very believable. bergman plays the fast and loose party-girl alicia huberman, the estranged daughter of a german spy. even in her portrayal of a woman with a trashy reputation, bergman is characteristically dignified and elegant, while sometimes showing us the insecure and pathetic aspects of alicia, especially in her relationship with grant's character. and what a bitch grant is in this one! his dark and sexy portrayal of the cynical, emotionally aloof devlin is superb and terribly convincing. claude rains, always a treat to watch, plays alexander sebastian, the nazi friend of alicia's father. alicia is asked by the u.s. government to infiltrate sebastian's home and spy on him and other nazis. meanwhile, a somewhat dark romance develops between alicia and devlin, one in which devlin's often emotionally cruel treatment of alicia (and the fact that she seems to go for it) gives the film an added psychological depth. the film is a masterful integration of romance and espionage thriller. from these two sources hitchcock generates tensions of the highest order since the integrity of neither story is sacrificed for the sake of the other. just as we are held in terrific suspense as to whether alicia will be found out, so we are just as anxious to see how the shaky romance finally pans out. let's just say that hitchcock, again quite masterfully, resolves things on both a heady and a chilling note. splendid flick, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious is one of Hitch's most underrated films. Ingrid Bergman's performance as Alicia is outstanding. She plays the daughter of a Nazi war criminal who agrees to infiltrate the Nazi regime in Rio de Janeiro. She quickly falls in love, however, with her CIA contact, Devlin, played brilliantly be Carey Grant. Hitch baffles the audience as usual, as the spy story becomes one of love and passion. She is so successful at her spying that she is asked to marry Sebastian, played by Claude Rains. The suspense builds as Sebastian discovers that Alicia is in with the CIA and tries to poison her. Devlin in the mean time is going to Spain because he can't stand seeing Alicia married to Sebastian. As in all Hitchcock movies, many themes and ideas are present, such as the role Sebastian's mother plays in influencing his plans. This is a must see Hitchcock classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . NOTORIOUS! explores the trauma men face when they have to prostitute out chicks on whom they have crushes for America's Greater Good. Just as a rich man never knows for sure whether he's being married just for his dough, a spy master such as T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) here finds it pretty hard to tell if a girl he's sweet on is willing to sleep with the enemy for love of country or merely love of sexual variety. If such a female can fake coming and going with the bad guy, who's to say that she's not doing the same with any other man, as well? Many experts consider Devlin and his operative Alicia's extended balcony kiss in Rio as the all-time most romantic screen smooch. Yet Hitchcock later said this shot was "inspired" by his observation (from his seat on a train) of a French girl holding onto a guy throughout his outdoors payment of his water bill against a red brick wall in the early 1920s (apparently out-lasting Tom Hank's "record" in front of all those lady ball players in their locker room in A LEAGUE OF OUR OWN). With NOTORIOUS!, Hitch is warning us that females may offer a helping hand one minute, while needing to be smacked unconscious the next (as Devlin does to Alicia during their first car ride together). NOTORIOUS! ends with the now radioactive Alicia representing a ticking time bomb in Devlin's own auto. Hitchcock seems to be preaching, "Guys, don't be taken for a one-way ride!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film but not Hitchcock's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious is hailed by many as Alfred Hitchcock's best-ever film. And that's quite a stretch. Notorious is a good film. It has a lot of things going for it. But it has some things notably working against it too. There are enough of those elements which don't quite work perfectly to knock this down from the top rung of Hitchcock films. There's much here to enjoy. But there are also things which disappoint.Not your typical Hitchcock suspense thriller Notorious is really more of a romance than anything else. Oh sure there's some mystery and moments of great tension and drama. But at its heart it is really about three people who find themselves entangled in a romantic web. Ingrid Bergman plays Alicia. She's a patriotic American whose father is, rather inconveniently for her, a convicted Nazi spy. She's good at heart but she has a notorious reputation. Known to be a heavy drinker and to sleep around. Toss into the mix her father's crimes and the U.S. government sees an opportunity to use Alicia for their own purposes. This will bring two important men into her life. The first is Devlin, played by Cary Grant. He's the government agent sent to recruit Alicia for her spy mission. And there's Sebastian, the target of the operation. Played by Claude Rains, Sebastian is one of a ring of Nazis who after the war relocated to Brazil. He and his cronies are up to something. The U.S. needs to find out what. Conveniently Sebastian once knew, and was smitten with, Alicia. She's the perfect woman to infiltrate his organization. Sebastian will fall for her instantly. But has Devlin fallen for her too? And who does Alicia really love?Alicia has no trouble winning Sebastian's affection. In fact Sebastian very quickly proposes marriage. By this point it's become pretty clear that Alicia truly loves Devlin. But Devlin won't admit he loves her. He won't admit it to her, he may not even be willing to admit it to himself. Stung by his rejection Alicia goes ahead and marries Sebastian and continues to investigate what exactly is the nefarious activity going on in that house. What the Nazi plot is proves unimportant, a typical Hitchcock MacGuffin. This is a story about three people and their interactions. Sebastian, the supposed villain, is actually a sympathetic character. He truly loves Alicia. She loves another man and if that isn't enough is actually working to destroy Sebastian's life. The tension comes from finding out who will make the crucial discovery first. Will Alicia find Sebastian's secret. Or will Sebastian discover who Alicia really is. If our heroine is found out the consequences for her will obviously be quite dire.It's an interesting setup and a compelling story but it doesn't crackle with the energy of some of Hitchcock's better thrillers. The pacing is very laborious. It's a film in which action is at times hard to come by. The actors do a fine job with it. Bergman is terrific. Rains does an excellent job of making you sympathize with this supposedly villainous man. You feel for Sebastian as the betrayal of the woman he truly loves breaks his heart. Grant comes off as somewhat cold and clipped but that's who his character is. A real standout is Leopoldine Konstantin, who plays Sebastian's mother. Now there's a real villain, this woman is scary. Hitchcock and mothers, you know? These excellent performances elevate the film but not enough to make it truly great. The story, compelling though it may be, ultimately holds the movie back somewhat. It's not consistently entertaining enough, the moments of great drama don't come soon enough or frequently enough. There is a lot to recommend the film. The fine actors, Hitchcock's excellent visual style, and a few really good moments here and there. But the whole package falls just a touch short of being worthy of all the plaudits the film has received. A good film and for Hitchcock an interesting diversion, a romantic thriller that's more about the romance than the thrills. But a film which doesn't quite live up to its reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good,...but how did this film rank so high on IMDb?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good Alfred Hitchcock film, though it is not one of his more famous productions. Because of this, I was very surprised to see it ranked so high in the IMDb Top 250! Now I am not saying this is a bad film and there are certainly worse films among the exalted few on the list. However, I am pointing out that I feel it is a tad overrated just so viewers don't have expectations that are a bit too high for the film. Of course, it is also possible the film IS that great and I just didn't appreciate it.The film starts with the conviction of a Nazi spy in an American court. His daughter is Ingrid Bergman and in response to all the notoriety from the case, she is leading a life that is sure to kill her sooner or later. What many do NOT realize is that her home has been bugged and our government knows she is not pro-Nazi. So, because her reputation has been ruined by good old dad, she is an excellent candidate to infiltrate a group in Brazil that MIGHT be a group of Nazis hoping to create a new Reich.Unfortunately, the American agent who recruits her is the ever so studly Cary Grant and they naturally fall in love. But, because she needs to infiltrate and even marry someone within this secret group, Grant later responds to Ingrid Bergman with cold indifference--even though it was obvious to everyone they had fallen in love. It's a great example of duty and patriotism superseding everything else.During the infiltration of the Neo-Nazi group, there is a lot of suspense but it is all done in a very restrained way. You know that she is in danger but it is subtle and difficult to detect. Because of these qualities, the film does an excellent job of building tension and involving the viewer.As far as negatives go, the only one (and boy is it minor) is that once again they cast Cary as an American even though he has a lovely English accent. Considering how often this occurred in other films and what a fine actor he was, I was certainly willing to forget this and focus on the excellent movie. The writer (Ben Hecht) and director (Alfred Hitchcock) are both among the more famous in their field and this film is ample evidence of their abilities.By the way, a later effort to re-team of Grant and Bergman and re-kindle the romance on screen was far less successful in INDISCREET--a passable but not especially memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Add Sebastien's name to my list of playmates"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grant and Bergman were both arguably at the height of their success when they made this taut spy thriller for Hitchcock, and both were cast against type as, respectively, a taciturn government agent and a semi-alcoholic tramp. While Grant pulls off his role with skill, Bergman struggles against the enormity of the miscasting of her part even while delivering a first-rate performance. Whoever pictured Bergman for the role of a good-time girl who sleeps around and seems bent on self-destruction clearly wasn't thinking straight. This was the kind of role for which an actress in the mould of Lana Turner might have been the obvious choice, even though she probably wouldn't have brought as much sympathy and sensuousness to the role as Bergman does. Nevertheless, its only when Alicia Sebastien's past is set aside so that the film can concentrate on her tortured relationship with Devlin (Grant) and duplicitous marriage to German ex-pat Alex Sebastien (Claude Rains) that Bergman truly convinces.The Hays Code had some kind of rule about the permitted length of a screen kiss back in the thirties and forties, so Hitchcock got around their puritanical restraints by having Bergman and Grant in a lengthy clinch as they talk to each other on the balcony of her apartment in Rio. Their mouths hardly ever more than millimetres apart, they breath their lines to each other between kisses in an erotically-charged sequence that provides evidence of the ingenuity and inventiveness the Code's restrictions inspired in film-makers of Hitchcock's calibre. Would that scene have existed if the code hadn't existed? Probably not: at least, not in the form that it does, anyway ? and the film would have been weaker for it. It's one of the few intimate scenes the stars share and it's a highlight. After this, their relationship is torn by Alicia's assignment for the government, which is to cosy up to Sebastien and find out what he and his fellow ex-Nazis are up to. The balcony on which they shared their clinch is also the scene of a bitter exchange between the lovers. On the surface they're talking about her mission, but their conversation is really about Alicia sleeping with another man, and this theme of true thoughts and feelings left unspoken runs through the film. When the truth is spoken it is often to devastating effect: "Add Sebastien's name to my list of playmates" Alicia instructs Devlin at the racetrack after she has begun an affair with the Nazi, and the look on Devlin's face says everything you need to know about his true feelings. Grant's character in this film is probably one of the coldest and most reserved that he has played, which leaves the burden of audience identification with Bergman's emotionally damaged Alicia. She shoulders the burden well, despite the miscasting.As with many of Hitchcock's films, the audience is manipulated into identification and sympathy for the villain. We can't help but sympathise with the ultimately pathetic Sebastien (another great performance from Claude Rains, reunited with his Casablanca co-star) as Devlin locks him out of the car in the film's suspenseful finale, in much the same way as we root for Norman Bates in Psycho when the car he tries to submerge in a swamp momentarily stops sinking. No other director I can think of could play with the audience's sympathies in this way. Like Bates, Sebastien is also subjected to the sometimes withering criticism of a demanding mother (Leopoldine Konstantin), and his character's isolation, while not as initially evident as Bates', is every bit as real.There are perhaps fewer of Hitchcock's trademark flourishes in this film, even though it bears all the unmistakable hallmarks of one of his pieces of work. Standout, though, is the slow tracking shot from the top of the stairs to the wine cellar key Bergman grasps in her hand at the party thrown for her by Sebastien. The film begins weakly, and the unconvincing start to Grant and Bergman's love affair is particularly badly handled, but once their relationship is derailed by Alicia's assignment and the internal conflicts come in to play, the film takes off and ratchets up the suspense right to the final shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Notorious" is far from my favorite Hitchcock film, even though it stars one of my two favorite actors (Cary Grant) and Ingrid Bergman, and supported by one of my favorite character actors -- Claude Rains. However, that is not to say that it is not a good film. It is. It just doesn't appeal to me to the degree several other Hitchcock films do.I am basing this review on the fairly new Blu Ray edition of the film. So the first question is -- how good is this print and is it worth upgrading to Blu Ray. One of the things I remember well about this film is how dark and indistinct the earlier DVDs were of this film. Unfortunately, the Blu Ray is inconsistent. Sometimes a bit grainy and not crisp, other times better; and this version didn't seem as dark as the older DVDs. Perhaps its just because it was an RKO release, and many of those films did not get the storage care that some of the bigger studios did.You get a bonus in this film -- Cary Grant punching Ingrid Bergman in the face and knocking her cold! As they say -- that alone is worth the price of admission.In the open scenes we learn that Cary Grant is a federal agent, while Ingrid Bergman is the sometimes American patriotic daughter of a convicted Nazi spy...and a heavy drinker and somewhat loose woman. She is convinced to romance a German in Rio whom she used to love (Claude Rains), and she marries him as part of the scheme. But Grant and Bergman are also in love, and there's a lot of sexual tension here.My complaint about this film is not the acting. Grant is great. Bergman is great. Rains is great...even with his bad teeth. I enjoyed seeing Louis Calhern in a supporting role.No, my complaint is that unlike most Hitchcock thrillers, this one isn't thrilling. It plods along. I keep looking at the Blu Ray player to see how much more time until the end. The pace is a very negative factor. And the ending is so abrupt...almost as if they ran out of film stock.If it weren't Grant and Bergman together, this film -- at least for me -- would be a wash. I give it a weak "&amp;".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notorious (1946): Dir: Alfred Hitchcock / Cast: Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Leopoldine Konstantin, Louis Calhern: Compelling and suspenseful thriller by Alfred Hitchcock who knows how to turn up the tension. It stars Cary Grant as an undercover agent who recruits Ingrid Bergman who plays the daughter of a Nazi. Their target is Alex Sebastian who was friends with her father and had a past relationship with. Central plot regards her tight position of having to marry Sebastian in order to expose him. During the investigation it is discovered that the bottles in the wine cellar carry more than alcohol. Suspense abound in this thrilling film that pits Bergman in a nasty predicament especially when her newly vile husband catches on to her true nature. Grant showcases more blunt determination than charm here especially when he and Bergman fall in love. He attempts to pull the mission but when it remains, he is soon positioned with the task of saving her from certain death. Rains as the Nazi villain conceals much but not his jealousy of Bergman. He becomes suspicious and threatened when he enters the wine cellar. Supporting roles are the conventional types including Leopoldine Konstantin as Sebastian's ruthless mother. Louis Calhern plays a secret service agent who pops in for third party perspective. Enticing thriller about taking risks with the lives of others. Score: 9 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alicia is ask to spy for her country on the Nazies in South America, along with her she is accompanied by agent Devlin that although he is a trained professional cannot get as close to them as Alicia. The two travel to Rio where they begin to work closer together as the movie progress not only do their jobs become more intimate but so does their love for each other. Hitchcock is indeed the master of suspense however I wouldn't compare this to a film like North by Northwest or Psycho. The suspense we see in a film such as this is more so focused on the emotions given off by each character rather than a man getting gunned down by a plane or Normand killing for his mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's love triangle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You could have stopped me with one word, but no, you wouldn't. You threw me at him!"Alfred Hitchcock's 1946 classic romantic spy thriller has tried to be imitated many times by lesser films over the decades, but nearly 70 years later its style and fabulous camera-work continues to leave its mark on audiences everywhere. The master of suspense lived up to his name once again with a slightly different film focusing more on the characters than on the thrills. Set in 1946, with the Second World War recently over, Ben Hecht's screenplay captured the spirit of the era where the fear of a nuclear war breaking out was eminent. American spies were focused on hunting down the remaining German Nazis that had spread throughout the world. The story begins in court where Alicia Guberman's (Ingrid Bergman) father is convicted of being a German spy. Alicia has a reputation of being a heavy drinker and dating many men, and she is ashamed of her father's activities. During one of the parties she hosts at her home she meets Devlin (Cary Grant), an American spy who falls for her beauty and charm, but isn't willing to admit it. He convinces her to travel with him to Rio de Janeiro using her father's connections to spy on his friends. She's asked to approach Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains), an old family friend who they suspect is also involved with other Nazis in the area. Alicia wins his affection easily, but at the same time it distances her from Devlin who she has feelings for. Once she's in Alexander's home she begins uncovering their secrets, but risking her life at the same time. Notorious relies heavily on the romantic chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, two of the most talented actors of their era. Honestly, I found the romance between the two of them was rushed, and I didn't buy into it very easily. One has to consider the restrictions however (the Hayes Code for example which restricted kisses to less than three seconds on screen) so there wasn't much more they could do. But that was what made the on and off kiss between the two actors all the more passionate for audiences at the time. Today, however it doesn't have the same effect. I had a difficult time buying into the romance and that affected my enjoyment of the film during the first half. But once the plot settles in Rio de Janeiro, the film has a couple of thrilling scenes. The wine cellar scene was one of the most gripping moments of Notorious and Hitchcock masterfully combined different camera shot and edits to build the suspense accompanying it with Webb's suspenseful score. The final ten minutes also had me at the edge of my seat so the second half of the film made up for the tedious first half. Notorious isn't among my favorite Hitchcock films because he's mastered the suspense in other better movies like Psycho, Vertigo, or Rear Window, while I found his work in Rebecca a more compelling character driven film. Notorious does bank from the strong lead performances from Grant and Bergman, who despite not being able to sell the romantic element at first, they still give engaging performances. Devlin's stubbornness and unwillingness to share his feeling for her, and Alicia's attitude towards his indifference becomes the soul of the film. Claude Rains plays Alexander extremely well, and he gives the strongest performance in the film. He falls in love with Alicia very quickly and that prevents him from seeing what his mother has suspected all along. The influence of Alexander's mother over him is a trademark from Hitchcock and in this film Leopoldina Konstantin plays the mother better than most. It's a fascinating story that slowly builds up to a memorable finale. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is another masterpiece as you would expect from the always great Alfred Hitchcock. A beautiful love story of trust and jealousy. This film is the first Hitchcock movie we see him use this theme of expressing his mother issues, a theme that he makes very popular especially in his most famous work psycho (1960). Hitchcock is never afraid to make a statement and he surely showed that with the love scene in this film. Possibly the most memorable and most revered scene by critics is the kissing scene in this film. This scene was purposely extended cleverly just to make a point. The cinematography in this film is remarkable and is held as one of Hitchcock's most beautifully shot films. This movie is full of vibrant fabulous set and brilliant acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful surprise from Alfred Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One wouldn't expect such a film from Alfred Hitchcock. I can agree with the biographer who said he could have only made this film at the age he made it at. Unlike his other films, Notorious has a different feel to it. It's still a very Hitchcock film, however, make no mistake of that. The loop hole Hitchcock exploits to get by the Hayes code only makes for a steamier, more intimate romance between Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant. The accurate depictions of drunk driving in the beginning floors me because it is not over done but you can tell Ingrid is plastered. The ending scene where Sebastian is left to deal with his own choices is phenomenal. I am pleased with the style of this film and recommend it to anyone, fan of Hitchcock or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first film that I have ever seen by Hitchcock, and I realize that to some that is perhaps considered blasphemy, but there it is. I was not sure what to expect from such a well-known director but I was incredibly surprised at how much I truly enjoyed the film. The acting was superb and the chemistry between Bergman and Grant made sparks fly. They did very well together, especially in their little love scene in Rio and then also in their later scenes when they have to steal precious moments together because of her jealous Nazi husband. The story itself is about a young woman who is recruited because of her father's connections as a Nazi spy. They tell her that a man who she once knew is the head of a Nazi group in Rio, Brazil and that she needs to get close to him and learn their plans. While they get to Rio she falls madly in love with her 'handler' agent and he with her. A story of early espionage and suspense ensues and enraptures the audience as Bergman gets deeper and deeper into this life. Although this is one of Hitchcock's earlier films it still has his splendor hidden all throughout. The camera shots during the large party, and the coffee that later becomes quite significant, even the stolen glances of Bergman and Grant are well done. All in all a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genre, Structure, and soft sexual tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious! which was nearly the most expensive of Alfred Hitchcock's films to produce, includes within it's linear narrative, and it's subtle patriotism, a visual style that lends itself to age-old philosophies, where vulnerability and espionage are juxtaposed, while a running theme of love intertwines itself within the suspense. The matters of gender struggle, or more specifically, patriarchal limitations on the female protagonist, are elucidated within the films structure. One facet of the visual style within the formal structure throughout the film is it's literary manufacturing that includes a mechanistic version of Shakespeare's play within a play, only in this sense, as a cinematic story within a story. Some scholars refer to this "side story" as Hitchcock's famous Mcguffin. The motif of secret meeting's centering on Alicia and Devlin, carry with them elements of realism (subtext), full of Hitchcock's dissonant lyricism. To begin with, in 1946 the threat of Nazism was still quite prevalent especially in Alfred Hitchcock's Hollywood where Devlin, played by Cary Grant, is assigned to watch over Alicia Huberman, played by Ingrid Bergman, an independent, previously promiscuous woman, whose father has been convicted to 20 years of custody by the United State's Martial, for spying to assist the Nazis. In the opening scene, where her father is sentenced at the court house, the judge asks the attorneys if there is any reason why this sentence should not take place. Her father interrupts and states, "Yes, I have something to say, You can put me away, but you can't put away what's going to happen to you and to this whole country." This dramatic statement set the tone for the back story that adds to the running theme of anticipated danger. It also gave Alicia's father a tangible character to refer to throughout her plight in the film; she is in all respects, a daughter conflicted by this relationship, which she would otherwise not have as a circumstance for the narrative to play out justifiably. After this dramatic courtroom scene, where men with cameras filled the screen, we transitioned to a party at Alicia's house. Devlin arrived at her party which began with an over-the-shoulder shot of Alicia, exposing only the back of Devlin's head in the frame. This cinematic formula occurs throughout the film, where Devlins back is to the viewer (us) which grants favoritism to Devlin, as the one with our point of view, thus becoming the character we can trust, an element of power, in the visual play as drunken Alicia flirts. The party scene changes into the morning light, where a charming shot through an empty glass bottle opens the scene, textually adding to the visual elements of substances throughout the film. Substances in this film are nearly iconographic. Devlin and Alicia continue their engagement in discussions, drunken struggles, a car sequence, where they are driving and ultimately they are pulled over by a policeman. In the scene in which the two are on the plane, Devlin informs Alicia that her father killed himself in his cell the night before. Alicia seems to be willing to pretend to fall in love with the character Alexander Sebastian following the news, and when suspicious Sebastian has a party, Alicia manages to get the key to the cellar from Sebastian, as Devlin requested which carried us into an important aspect of the cinematic structure of this 1940's thriller. Devlin and Alicia slip off to the wine cellar, where they accidentally drop a bottle, which breaks and black, solidified uranium spills out. Notorious is famous for it's deep crane shot into the cellar in this particular scene. A suspenseful close-up of Alicia's hand with the key to the cellar, (classic Film Noir), as well as a long kiss, one of the longest in film history, and the rotating point of view shot that Alicia see's Devlin in as she suffers a hangover earlier in the film, are all stylistically important to the films incredibly rich appeal to genres. Yet the film's formal aspects of cinematography that relate to the plight of the protagonist are most exquisitely depicted in such a complete sequence within scene 7, the lovely scene with both Devlin and Alicia at the cafe, at the beginning of their time in Rio de Janeiro. The significance of this particular scene, lies in it's transitional element within the film's structure; this scene begins an entirely new chapter in the story of the film. The scene is also very significant because it challenges the dynamics and power struggle between Devlin and Alicia in prior scenes, an otherwise subtle conflict throughout the narrative that serves the questionable nature of woman and the reasonableness of man, ingredients for a true Film Noir. The wonderful dissolves in the cinematography begin while they are on the plane overlooking Rio de Janeiro, yet continuity editing and over-the-shoulder shots tend to Serve the character of Devlin. At moments when Alicia challenges Devlin in the dialogue, she simultaneously reverts back to her love for him, which she crumbles under, extending her role from femme-fatale, to vulnerable. The iconographic images of tilted hats, secret meetings, large groups of men, law enforcement, the motif of substances, the Nazi affiliation of Alexander Sebastian, secret agents and spies, as well as the poison Alicia suffers from, add to the aspects of the film that are conventions for a mystery-thriller sub-genre, and yet the film really does fit within a patchwork genres unlike any of its time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes?yes?notorious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directs Notorious with his usual impeccable eye for detail and flair for storytelling, but it is the brilliant pairing of Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant that really qualifies this film as unmissable viewing, the stars sharing such a smouldering on-screen chemistry that the film's romantic scenes prove to be just as compelling as Hitchcock's trademark moments of suspense (a good job, since the tension isn't ramped up until much later on).A romantic post-war thriller, the film stars Bergman as Alicia Huberman, the wayward party-girl daughter of a Nazi war criminal. With a hatred of her late father's politics, and a love of America, Alicia makes the perfect undercover agent to infiltrate a nest of Nazi scientists up to no good in South America. Accompanying her on her mission: stoic FBI agent Devlin (Grant), who develops more than a professional interest in the lovely lady.As the job becomes more and more dangerous for Alicia, even requiring her to marry old admirer Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains)?part of the Nazi group?in order to avoid suspicion, Devlin tries his best to ignore his true feelings, but races to the rescue when Sebastian rumbles his new wife and tries to poison her.All of the scenes featuring the beautiful Bergman are guaranteed pleasers as far as I am concerned, but my favourite bit has to be the whole 'key theft/champagne party' segment, which is as good as anything that Hitchcock directed?saying that it is nerve-jangling doesn't do it justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1946 Alfred Hitchcock had gained quite a reputation for himself with Rebecca, which won the Best Picture Oscar in 1940, Spellbound, Saboteur and other successful films. His next film was meant to be produced by David O. Selznick, but because of other projects by him and the budget of Notorious, he sold the whole package to RKO which gave the artistic freedom back to Hitchcock. Notorious is a spy-film set in its own post war time. It's a picture of the time just after the WWII and before the Cold War which is quite an interesting period. The film suffered from censorship due to its references to the nuclear bombs of the United States but eventually found its way to the screens.A Nazi's daughter Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is being followed by the media and the police because of her father got just an imprisonment. In a party, after the trial, Alicia becomes acquainted with Devlin (Cary Grant) who soon turns out to be a cop. Devlin persuades Alicia to help the Government to get information of his father's Nazi companions who have escaped to Brazil. The leader of the Nazis is Sebastian (Claude Rains) who once was in love with Alicia. The task starts getting unpleasant features when Sebastian falls in love with Alicia again and Alicia falls in love with Devlin, who seems to be neglecting her.Notorious is a very intriguing film. Francois Truffaut called it Hitchcock's greatest love film and the best black-and-white film ever made. And Patricia Hitchcock, daughter of Alfred, has named the film as her personal favorite of her father's films. Notorious has clearly established its place as a Hitchcock-classic. One of the most famous scenes of it is the long kissing scene where Cary and Ingrid kiss each other while talking at the same. This brilliantly built scene full of erotic tension was actually quite sly by Hitchcock. People weren't allowed to kiss longer than 3 seconds in films during the 1940's so Hitchcock decided to give some dialog to the characters in the middle of the kisses and this is actually much more excitatory that just showing a long dull kiss.Many might call Notorious a film-noir whose main hallmarks are the use of shadow and light, moral complexity, the aesthetics of big cities and after WWII; the postwar disillusions. Hitchcock only did a few film-noirs but they were all amazing: Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, Suspicion, The Wrong Man and Strangers on a Train. But the strongest portrayal of post-war disillusions is in Notorious -- probably because it was made in the time. The criticism for the politics of the United States is very subtle but today one can see it in the small things; The Government of the United States 'sacrifices' a woman just for its own benefit and the captain Paul Prescott is without a doubt the most obnoxious character of Notorious.The references Hitchcock made about the nuclear bomb made the Government to suspect him and he was actually added to FBI's list of possible foreign agents which Hitchcock himself only found hilarious. Notorious is a brilliant picture of its time but it also works as an entertaining spy-film. No one has been able to build such great excitement as Hitchcock. The narrative and the visual clarity of Notorious are just spellbinding. Notorious is also a clever film about the difficulty of expressing yourself and your emotions. Cary Grant plays this laconic character who clearly is in love with Bergman's character, but somehow can't show it. He becomes jealous of her because of something he forced her to do -- the irony is lovely! Some say that the film is very dark because Hitchcock had just been editing The Memories of the Camps, a documentary about the concentration camps, but I personally think it's just part of the film-noir cinematography which he handled very well. Of course the postwar disillusions made the film what it is but I don't think it would have been any more 'joyful' without The Memories of the Camps. Alfred Hitchcock is the only director who has been able to film directly and without explaining emotions such as suspicion, jealousy, envy and yearning. In Notorious we see a romantic tale in the shadows of espionage and postwar disillusions.</fullReview>

The hero saved the girl, and the "bad guy"(Claude Rains) got what he had coming. There was not much lead up to the ending and it played out very predictably. The camera work had some elements that I really enjoyed. I found it interesting how the camera would periodically show things from Alicia's (Ingrid Bergman) various altered perspectives. Both Grant and Bergman were great. Begrman does a wonderful job as Alicia even though it's not her usual character type. The sexual tension between Grant and Bergman is done very well. "Notorious" is a good movie, it's worth watching if are a Hitchcock fan, but it lacks the tension that his other films have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock continued his winning streak through the 1940s with this captivating and truly masterful work that binds together romance and espionage post-World War II. Not only did he have a terrific script by Ben Hecht to work with, he also had two of the greatest stars in Hollywood history at the peak of their powers, Cary Grant as the suave and debonair agent Devlin and Ingrid Bergman as the troubled daughter of a Nazi spy who is asked to infiltrate a group of German engineers in Rio de Janeiro.As it happens, Bergman is trying to forget her troubles of her father being arrested when US agents come calling and ask her to use her background in order to help break a German scientist ring that is cooking up something big in Brazil. She decides to help the agents mostly because she is falling for the contact man, Devlin. Her job, however, calls for her to get involved with the head Nazi, Alex Sebastian, played by the very talented Claude Rains.Something to keep in mind when watching this unfold is that there are essentially two different stories going on at the same time here: the ups and downs of Grant and Bergman's tumultuous relationship and the agents' attempt to break up the German's secret organization. What is also important to note is the fact that when she is assigned to this job, she has fallen for Devlin but now has to mask her feelings for Sebastian. Devlin, in turn, as her contact also has fallen for her but must not show it in order to blow her cover. How Hitchcock balances all these feelings and emotions is incredible and he covers it with an array of shadows, long shots and unbroken takes, including the famous 'longest kiss in movie history' scene.For anyone interested in classic films, this is a must-see. It boasts a great cast, some terrifically twisted moments and one of the best romantic pairings in the cinema. It is also right in the middle of Hitchcock's greatest period in America, when he was becoming comfortable with the system and daring enough to go out on a limb and create stories that were both tantalizing and beautiful.</fullReview>

By the end, the uranium is less important, and Grant and Bergman's love for each other is.

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's black and white espionage film, Notorious is a masterful work of beautiful close ups of two people in love. Ingrid Bergman deserved an Oscar for the title role but was overlooked. She is very sexy and alluring. Hitchcock captures this appeal in the most beautiful close ups using exquisite lighting and shadow.The plot of the film is about a notorious alcoholic daughter of a captured and soon to be deceased Nazi spy. Her conflict is being a strong American Patriot who would die for her country and being the daughter of such unappealing politics. Cary Grant, an American spy turns her on to seducing a Nazi Agent,( The very talented Claude Rains) in Rio in order to spy for the allies. Rio: "Such a dull town" says a poisoned Bergman. She agrees to, only to discover that the Nazi spy is Max, a former suitor. Circumstances grow more complicated when Max asks for her hand in marriage. Encouraged by the American spy team she accepts. Yet Cary Grant has already fallen in love as Bergman has with him. Suspense and intrigue follow as Grant and Bergman ignite the screen with one of the longest screen kisses in film history. It's a beautiful and flawless scene as the lovers take the kiss from the balcony to the kitchen.Hitchcock was careful to balance the love affair and the suspense. It works splendidly. Max's mother upstages everyone with her ominous figure. Snow White and The Wicked Witch. Love will prevail. No one says "You love me" like Ingrid Bergman.One of my favorite films.Victor Nunnally 37, MFA Film Theory and Productiom, BFA in Dramatic Theory and History, AA Performing Experience</fullReview>

Hard to imagine by today's standards, but it's true. And their love, compelling as it is, made me emotionally involved in the thriller. It's full of great shots, great scenes, but two stand out: The scene at the party and the final scene. Perfection.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

I was born in theseventies and this is the best example of nostalgia for something Inever knew that I can think of . And then there's Grant andBergman, possibly the most gorgeous couple in the history of film,could you imagine what theyre kids what have looked like?,despite some of Grant's character's subtle misogyny, no doubtHitch and Hecht were responsible for that. How gorgeous isBergman? A shot of Bergman speaking, while a lock of haircontinues to get stuck in her mouth as she tries to speak, wouldhave been annoying and distracting had it been any other actress,but with Bergman it becomes incredibly erotic and fetishistic. Man,this film makes one wish they lived in the 40's , wore cool suits,lived in amazing set-like apartments, smoked packs of cigarettes,drank too much, and looked like Grant and Bergman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pinnacle for the master of suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For its time, for its place in history, there are precious few films as brazen as Notorious, one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underrated masterpieces. Released in 1946, the film follows a woman of admittedly loose morals, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), whose father has just been convicted of treason in aiding Nazi interests during the war. Alicia has developed a reputation, as she's floated from companion to companion, and this latest stigma of a traitorous father combines with her alcoholism to shape a portrait of a truly troubled woman - the kind of which you just did not often see on screen at that time.Into her world comes a man called Devlin, with a subdued portrayal by Cary Grant. Devlin is an American agent who wants Alicia to go to Rio de Janeiro to involve herself with Alex Sebastian (Claude Rains), a war profiteer who is still involved with Nazis who had fled to South America. Alicia, wishing to show that she's changed from her reputation, wants only for Devlin to admit his love for her - a thing he seems unwilling to do. So she forges ahead on her espionage mission, playing at a very dangerous game.All through the brilliant script by Ben Hecht, we see right away the obvious attraction Devlin and Alicia have for each other, but due to their histories and the situation they've involved themselves in, they continually distance themselves from the budding love they could have, and fall into patterns of sharp dialogue and cool emotions that lead them inexorably down a darker path.Alicia's target, Alex, is smitten by this beautiful woman out of his past, even to the chagrin of his domineering mother and his own suspicions towards Devlin. But he himself is a tragic figure, as he's caught in his own webs due to his associates, who brook no deceptions into their plans.All around as the story swirls and complicates, Hitchcock's direction makes thrilling drama out of the simplest things, like the fate of a key at a house party, or involves menace out of a simple cup of coffee. By understating the major players in the film and not over-romanticizing (at least until the end), Hitchcock build suspense without his usual tricks. There's not much deception here - we know what everyone wants; the game is, do they get it? Can they get it? Can these impossible twists turn themselves out right in the end?It's a terrific script, and sharp dialogue by two of cinema's icons can carry a film very far, but the genius of Hitchcock behind the camera transforms it into one of his proudest achievements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film brought the end to the era in which Ingrid Bergman was the greatest. Bergman can be described only as luminous. She is SO talented and is just simply wonderful. Grant, debonair as ever, is perfect opposite Bergman. Their famous love scene is CLASSIC!!! For Hitchcock, this was his last hit for a while and it wasn't until Stranger's On A Train that he rebounded (Bergman returned with Anastasia).It was typical of the Academy to ignore the works of Hitchcock, Grant and Bergman (why, Hitchcock and Grant never even won the Oscar!!!) in this masterpiece. Certainly, Bergman is better here than in her Oscar winning Gaslight. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who fell in love with Bergman in Casablanca will experience a further descent into the depths of adoration and worship. She plays the daughter of a traitor, trying to carry the responsibility that this entails on her shoulders. She desperately wants to be given a chance, to be shown some trust and some faith. Though she is never shown any of this. Cary Grant plays the role of the confused agent very well indeed. One urges him to hold Bergman by the waist and kiss her at the balcony. Another masterful work of Hitchcock, without doubt one of his best. The dialogue is marvellous with excellent one-liners being spoken looking toward the Copacobana. Bergman is unbelievably beautiful and vulnerable at the same time. Lovers of Casablanca will be pleased to see Claude Rains once more starring beside Bergman. The story is fast moving with wonderful twists and turns. It reflects the age in a perfect manner. This film will leave an indelible mark on your memory; you may well utter, not "Ilsa" , but "Alicia" in your sleep!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that the serious side of Grant was established by Alfred Hitchcock in 'Suspicion', Hitchcock went a stage further to cast him in 'Notorious' alongside Ingrid Bergman to make up for the attempts made to portray him as a serious person in 'Mr. Lucky' and 'None But the Lonely Heart'. Grant was only an serious actor when he was directed by Hitchcock, and he would have to wait until Stanley Donen came along in 1963 to direct him in 'Charade'. 'Notorious' made up for any serious film that Grant appeared in between 'Suspicion' and 'Notorious', and any other film outside of his romantic-comedies would looked upon suspiciously if it was not directed by Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>love and espionage equals.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 'Notorious', the intriguing combination of a love triangle and espionage creates absolutely great suspense. The combination of Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman is fantastic. Bergman's performance is excellent, and you can tell how she feels and what she's thinking all the time, and can't help but feel sorry for her. Claude Rains fills in the role of the nazi in love with Bergman very well. The acting and the directing are all top notch. The story starts out a bit slow, and the romance at the beginning seems a little bit hokey. As the movie progresses, however, it is evident that the romance at the beginning is an integral part of setting the whole movie up. So stick through that. The last forty minutes or so are pure suspense, and great suspense at that. Hitchcock treats his audience with respect, and we get rewarded greatly with that. The last scene is absolutely brilliant. I won't say what, but its the only time I've seen a tender scene in a movie that made me tense. It was a slippery slope to walk trying to combine spies and love, but everyone associated with the film walked it with ease. I'm surprised this movie isn't higher on the list, because it is one of Hitchcock's best. 10 out of 10 for creativity, and for the absolutely stellar ending and suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's best love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During his interview of the master, François Truffaut pointed out that Hitchcock was used to shooting murder scenes like love scenes. Notorious stands aside from this usual Hitch's touch. I think this is one of the best love story ever filmed. The characters are caught up in their duties. The entrapment is all the more tight as each one depends on the other. That part of the story can lead to think that opportunist Hitchcock understood the lessons of film noir. 1946 was also the year The Postman always rings twice was adapted.Devlin has to complete his mission because of what is at stake for his country - and for the world, even if he has definitely nothing to do with Bruce Willis. His boss insists on that point and perhaps he chose him to seduce Alicia. Alicia doesn't care much about her father or about national and worldwide interests. She only cares about Devlin. Sebastian doesn't see much more than the love he bears for Alicia. What with his unforgiving mates and his tyrannical mother, his only way to cope with an unfriendly entourage is to love Alicia.Claude Rains himself was entrapted in playing the part of villains entrapted themselves in their nasty jobs (Mr Smith goes to Washington, Casablanca). Sebastian is a real noir hero since he never seems to have the upper hand and loses everything from his villain's authority to love and ...life. Evil is embodied by his disembodied mother who matches Rebecca's Mrs Danvers or later Mrs Bates. Cary Grant never looked less self-confident. His parts in The Awful Truth, Bringing Up Baby and Suspicion ranked him among the ham Hollywood actors that flooded in with the talkies. Here he appears to be more than that. Ingrid Bergman embodies the typical hitchcockian actress, lovely and capable of many things. Joan Fontaine looked too young and innocent for it and Spellbound was not unforgettable - I mean there is more to remember about Dali than about Gregory Peck.I doubt a director will try to remake Notorious today. The interest of the film stands with the joint performance of Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, and no technical breakthrough can add anything to that. A Perfect Murder is dull for Michael Douglas was given so poor a script he couldn't bring much to his character. And Gwineth Paltrow will never match Grace Kelly's acting and beauty. I was struck to see how far Dial M for Murder (and The Rope) inspired the creators and writers of the famous TV serial Colombo. Most of the time they reach a better result than the remake. Gus Van Sant's Psycho? Sounds weird. It doesn't deserve further words.</fullReview>

Claude Rains at his best (way better then his slightly camp performance in Casablanca). These great actors under Hitchcock's direction when he was in his prime (I Believe Hitchcock's greatest period was between 1943-1954 in this period he made his four greatest films 1) Under Capricorn 2) Notorious 3) Rear Window 4) I Confess). The film progresses without a wasted or overlong scene something that can't be said of latter Hitchcock films. Bergman, Grant and Rains all put in perfect performances in a film which should have won Oscar's for all 3 off them and Hitchcock. There is not a gunshot or chase in the entire film, but the film contains more tension then any other Hitchcock film, with the end descent down the stairs being the greatest scene in the whole of Hitchcocks great career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romantic thriller, of all things.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I think Hitchcock made better movies (39 Steps, Lady Vanishes, Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window), this is easily my favorite. And I believe this entirely because I can't think of another movie where the director conveyed his (unrequited) love for an actress so well (cf. the Donald Spoto biography for Hitchcock's personal feelings about Ingrid Bergman). Not that she wasn't astonishingly lovely in every movie she appeared in, but in this one Ingrid is at once sensual, innocent, manipulative, manipulated, heroic, and tragic. That the story itself and the Cary Grant and Claude Rains characters are as good as they are is probably a tribute to Ben Hecht and to Hitchcock's basic filmmaking ability, but really the movie seems like a Maguffin that permits a man to study a woman he knows will never love him.</fullReview>

This is probably, Ingrid's first US comedy, and proves she's a very versatile actress. She's so sweet, and charming in this movie. Not to mention, funny. Unlike some actresses, who are in comedies, but still acts like, they're in drama. I just can't get enough of Cary &amp; Ingrid, they were superb in ''Notorious'', but because of the plot, their relationship seemed bittersweet. ''Indiscreet'', makes up for that, the characters are warm, funny and romantic. Most importantly, Cary &amp; Ingrid looks gorgeous in Technicolor!!!</fullReview>

My favorite part is when Devlin and Alicia leave the wine cellar, but Alex has already seen them. Devlin decides to make it look like they weren't in the wine cellar, so he kisses Alicia to distract Alex. Of course, Alicia is really in love with Dev, so she enjoys the kiss. But Devlin, who claims that he doesn't love Alicia, seems to enjoy it a little too much also!! I think that's so sweet...you can't tell me he's not in love with her at that part!!Cary Grant is great as T.R. Devlin, and Ingrid Bergman is wonderful as Alicia Huberman. Although they're just "partners", you can tell that they're really in love! Claude Rains plays the bad guy for once, in his role as Alexander Sebastian, Alicia's husband."Notorious" is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.

		<shortDescription>Flimsy Espionage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the awesome personages devoted to this production, one can't overlook the incredible elements of the espionage that it depicts. A spy takes a wine cellar key off her husband's key ring on the night of a party, knowing its immediate value to him, but waits till the next day to slip it back on the ring. She's suspecting he's using the cellar for an enemy military purpose. This same key is his only way to access the wine cellar that he might decide he needs to visit this night. She shouldn't touch this key tonight. If she takes that risk: (a) she's got to be able to return it to his key ring before he goes for more wine; (b) she's also got to be able to return it before he notices for any reason that his keys feel light; (c) if he notices this cellar key missing after seeing her kiss another man right in front of the cellar door, she must realize that he's going to infer that she's discovered his secret; (d) she must be thinking in the following days about how he would respond if he did realize that she's a spy. Since all of this reasoning is basic, this film as it is asks for too much suspension of disbelief: spies would not behave like this. Beyond reasoning, the failure is also in behavior at public meetings of the Bergman and Grant characters. From the first scene, at the racetrack, they try to look like they are not talking to one another, which fails to hide the fact while publicizing the secret nature of their conversation. The Claude Raines character already knew him. He knows he and his wife are friends. Their attempts to stand alongside one another without turning their heads so much while talking makes it obvious that they're talking about something private. This is like a parody of a spy movie, with inept agents fumbling their work. . . . However, the background music is the best.Ingrid Bergman's acting is fine, except for the early, drunk scenes. She seems to be trying to imagine what it feels like to be a little drunk, varying her degrees of drunkenness throughout. For instance, after she realizes her companion is a federal agent, all of her sobriety returns in an instant, her focus, and her anger is fully on the alert. She's an amateur at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>game theory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I figure to be among the lower raters of this film, but I really rather enjoyed it. On the whole, it has to be considered a success, but broken down into its major components -- a suspense thriller on the one hand, a romantic drama on the other -- a sizable distinction is revealed. As a thriller, it's right up there with Hitchcock's best films; as a romance it's one step up from mediocre (well, maybe a step and a half, but only because we're talking about Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant here). Also, the romance and thriller elements basically just run in parallel throughout the film, whereas I'd have preferred to see them woven together. My impression was that this never quite happened, though it comes close in a scene or two. (Compare Notorious in these respects to North by Northwest, which I found was superb from both the thriller and romance angles and involved more influence of each on the other.) The film's greatest achievement lies in its presentation of the precarious balance created as characters begin uncovering each other's secrets. The espionage makes for a wonderfully complicated bit of game theory. There are certain facts known to all of the characters, others that are secrets held only by one or two characters, others that were secrets but have since been discovered by another character (unbeknownst to those who formerly held the secrets), and still other former secrets whose discovery has been discovered by those who originally held them (unbeknownst to the discoverer who now overestimates his or her advantage). If it seems a bit overdone, it's only because I couldn't think of a better way of concisely explaining it. The film is in fact remarkably elegant in fitting these pieces together.Had the project been handed to a lesser director, I'm sure it all would have come across as stilted and forced; either that or a lot of the material would have just been cut to make the story more manageable. It's the sort of story one might read in a novel and think, "This would make such a great movie, but they really couldn't do it justice in under four hours. Oh well." This one weighs in at around 100 minutes I think. It's quite an accomplishment in that respect, and if the love story falls short of Casablanca, well I can forgive it for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scene at the end - the one involving the staircase - is terrific, and I don't know Hitchcock did it. This isn't a technical remark. What I mean is it seems as if there's nothing to it, as if nothing is even happening, and yet it's remarkably tense; in fact, one of the great moments in cinema. If you watch it and succumb easily to short-term amnesia you might well endorse the common verdict (given by François Truffaut, among others) that `Notorious' is Hitchcock's masterpiece.The trouble is that the story is for the most part remarkably uninvolving. Ingrid Bergman plays the role of a Fallen Woman - a character type that never fails to irritate, and which I would have thought was hopelessly out of date in 1946 - although, given the shameful way Bergman herself was hounded out of America few years later, it seems that people still believed in Fallen Women. Well: surely we don't believe in them NOW. As a result it's hard to take the bulk of the story seriously. Why, exactly, is Cary Grant so hard on Bergman for so long? No reason that I can see. The love story is merely exasperating. The MacGuffin is actually more interesting than the MacGuffee.`Spellbound', `Lifeboat', `Rope', and several other of Hitchcock's films of the 1940s, may seem more dated to some, but that's to take a superficial view. The passage of time has revealed that there was nothing wrong with their basic stories. Not so `Notorious'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder if I have seen the same movie as the people on IMDb who gave it 8,2/10. Notorious is not a classic or masterpiece by any stretch of the/my imagination. The story about some Nazi's in Rio who do some naughty unspecified stuff with powder is rather thin and underdeveloped. OK, so in it's heart it's a romantic movie again with some sort of chemistry between Grant and Bergman but it seems all very cliché. Well actually it IS the cliché from which all other copies originated but does it matter? Compared to modern day masterpieces the cinematography is so dry and simple: about 95% of the shots is locked-off, dolly, tracking or crane shots are almost non existent. Lighting wise it's all just plain vanilla (no dark brooding mood, nothing). The music seems to be the same music of all the other movies from the same era. The is not a film that will linger in my mind as one of the greatest films I've ever saw. It's more likely I won't even remember I saw it in a couple of months. It's not that I have an aversion for older films (I've seen plenty) but a lot of these films are for me highly overrated. Films are art and maybe we are all more likely to love the art of our own time. Maybe there might come a time The Matrix will become old nostalgic nonsense too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devlin...devil?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Notorious" isn't my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, but he certainly did a good job. When Alicia Huberman Sebastian (Ingrid Bergman) has to travel to Rio de Janeiro to spy on some Nazis, she meets T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) and finds herself drawn into a world of intrigue unlike anything that she's ever known. Certainly Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains) isn't quite what he seems.Like many of Hitch's movies, this one truly makes the most of cinematography. And what about Devlin's name: could it mean "devil"? The final scene is set on a staircase, a common theme in AH's movies. I guess that the only problem is that in some way, much of the movie seems to feature people sitting around drinking and threatening to kill each other. But other than that, a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Sir Alfred Hitchcock, this is a pretty good classic romantic thriller. Basically after her father, a German spy, committed suicide while in prison, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) meets Government agent T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) who recruits her to be an undercover agent. She has fallen in love with Devlin, and she feels a debt for America, the country she loves and her father betrayed. Her assignment in Rio De Janeiro is to become an acquaintance of wealthy German businessman Alexander Sebastian (Oscar nominated Claude Rains), who is attracted to her. Soon enough, even going against the wishes of mother Anna (Leopoldine Konstantin), he asks Alicia to marry him, and she accepts, and without objections, Devlin knows this is perfect for better investigation opportunities. Alicia explores the Sebastian mansion, and the wine cellar is locked, so she steals the key, and at a party she and Devlin plan to snoop in it for incriminating evidence. Slowly the champagne bottles in the ice box (for the party) are running out, and it is quite gripping to see if a servant will go down to the cellar while Alicia and Devlin have found bottles full of some black sand (some kind of ore or something). Eventually Alexander discovers this secret search, and guided by his mother he drugs his wife when they know she knows too much. In the end it leaves at a place you know Alexander and the mother are in trouble. Also starring Louis Calhern as Captain Paul Prescott and Reinhold Schünzel as Dr. Anderson, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man at the party drinking champagne and then quickly departing (his most obvious in my opinion). It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Ingrid Bergman was number 68, and Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Bergman was also number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, Grant was number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 23 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 86 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not for a Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this was a good movie with an interesting plot, this film is not on Hitchcock's A list. There is little heartpounding moments untill maybe the last 20 minutes of the film. I view this film as a love story more than anything else. If your into watching old movies, than I would definately recommend this one, but if your into Hitchcock films, this one doesnt have the feel of a hitchcock film. In fact if I didnt know who the director was going into the film, Hitchcock would not have been my first choice. I could probably name 10 Hitchcock films that were better than this one. However, overall it was a pretty good flick, if your just looking for a 40's movie. However if you want a Hitchcock film, try N by Nw, vertigo, the birds, or, of course, Psycho before you go near this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ostensibly a thriller, but deserves to be remembered as a psychological drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with John Hubermann, an American citizen of German origin, being sentenced to imprisonment for treason after being convicted of spying for the Nazis. The main character, however, is not Hubermann himself but rather his daughter Alicia who is recruited by American Intelligence to infiltrate a spy ring of her father's former associates. Alicia travels to Rio de Janeiro, where the gang are based, accompanied by Devlin, a handsome intelligence agent. Once there she meets Alex Sebastian, a friend of her father and an old admirer of hers, who is a member of the gang. Sebastian is still very much in love with Alicia, and she agrees to marry him in order to gain access to the gang and discover their secrets.1946 was perhaps not the best year in which to set a film with an espionage theme. The Second World War was over, but relations between the West and the Soviet Union had not yet deteriorated to the extent where they could be considered a cold war. The plot might have worked better if Hitchcock, had set it a few years earlier, during the war itself, but he was obviously unwilling to do this. Perhaps he felt that a film set in the present would have more impact than one set in the past, even the very recent past. Seen as a spy thriller, in fact the film is not a very good one, certainly not when compared to, say, "The 39 Steps" or "North by North-West", and the plot is rather carelessly put together. We never find out exactly what the Nazi gang are plotting, although as uranium is involved it presumably concerns some attempt to put together a nuclear device. What makes the film interesting, however, is the high standards of acting from the three leads, Cary Grant as Devlin, Ingrid Bergman as Alicia and Claude Rains, as Sebastian, and the relationships between the characters they play.In a number of Hitchcock's films there is an element of moral ambiguity about some of the characters, both heroes and villains. In "Strangers on a Train", for example, the villain, Bruno, is in a sense the alter ego of the hero, Guy. The murder at the centre of the film, of Guy's ex-wife Miriam, is carried out by Bruno, but there is a suggestion that Guy suffers from feelings of guilt both about her death and about the failure of their marriage. Shortly before she died they had a very public quarrel in which he shouted that he could strangle her. In "Rebecca" Maxim is presented as a sympathetic character, but he bears some of the responsibility for the death of his first wife (although not as much as he did in Daphne du Maurier's original novel).There is a similar ambiguity in "Notorious". On a political level, Sebastian is a Nazi and therefore by definition one of the bad guys. Devlin and Alicia are trying to expose him in the interests of American democracy and are therefore by definition good guys. If, however, we simply view the characters on a human level without ideological preconceptions, things look very different. Sebastian is an older man deeply in love with his beautiful young wife, but is unaware that she has married him not out of love but in order to use him for her own purposes. (Sebastian is, like a number of other Hitchcock villains such as Bruno or Norman Bates in "Psycho" a Freudian case-study; the most powerful influence in his life is his dominating elderly mother. The atmosphere inside his house is one of oppressive and claustrophobic opulence, similar to the effect Hitchcock achieved with Manderley in "Rebecca".) Moreover, Alicia's partner in her deception of her husband, Devlin, is the man with whom she is really in love. Although Alicia pretends to be in love with Sebastian, she is in reality quite indifferent to him and has no qualms about abandoning him to his fate at the hands of his associates, who punish ruthlessly those they believe to have failed them. Whatever we feel about Sebastian, we cannot help feeling a chill when, in the final shot of the film, the door slams shut behind him.As with Guy, there is a suggestion that Alicia may be motivated by guilt, in her case guilt about her father's treason. Although she despised his activities and took no part in them, she nevertheless knew about them and failed to report him to the authorities. The Alicia that we see early in the film is an alcoholic (a change from Ingrid Bergman's normally pure and wholesome image) and the implication is that her drinking is the result of her guilt feelings. Images of alcohol, in fact, recur throughout the film, with numerous shots of people drinking or with bottles and glasses very prominent. The secret to the gang's activities is eventually found inside a wine bottle.As normal with Hitchcock, there are some effective moments of suspense, especially the scene where Devlin and Alicia are searching Sebastian's wine cellar, and the one at the end where Devlin has to try to rescue Alicia from Sebastian's house under the noses of the Nazi gang. Nevertheless this is a film that, although ostensibly a thriller, deserves to be remembered as a first-class psychological drama. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Suspense/Thrill as expected from a Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of Hitchcock movies and truly I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock movies. I have seen "The 39 Steps", "Strangers On a Train", "North By Northwest", "Psycho", "Vertigo", "Rope", "Dial M for Murder", "Rear Window", "The Man Who Knew Too Much", "The Birds".Notorious was the worst of all the Hitchcock movies I have seen till date. It is a plain simple romantic story with slight suspense and with lots of kisses. It was so boring that I even though to stop watching it after 30 mins(This never happened to me for any Hitchcock movie). Only because it was a Hitchcock movie I watched it full, but was very much disappointed. The ending was grossly abrupt and I never expected it was the end and I was thinking my media player was showing something wrong and there must be some 10 to 15 mins still left to solve the puzzle and get the details of what happened to mystery of the Uranium powder, etc.Cary Grant was impressive as usual, other than that there was nothing in the movie. It may be attractive for college goers who like to watch kisses on the screen, but is having no good story line with suspense.I don't know how other reviewers said it was the best Hitchcock movie. If I didn't knew that it was a Hitchcock movie I could never have realised that it was a Hitchcock Film!To me the Best Hitchcock film, which I have seen, is "North By Northwest". It keeps you glued to your seat, not like Notorious, which bumps you off your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly Hitchcock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem about this movie is that it's more of a romance movie than a horror/thriller movie, which results in it being very boring and predictable. I have no idea why it is so popular; it doesn't even come close to being as great as Hitchcock's later great movies, like Psycho &amp; Vertigo. In fact, if it wasn't for a few sparse camera angles and cinematic effects scattered throughout the movie, I wouldn't have believed it was even made by Hitchcock. The plot is ok, but it doesn't start off until half-way into the movie, which makes everything up to that point seem boring and unnecessary, which it pretty much is. The acting is good, but good acting can't save such a boring, slow-moving plot. The romance part of the movie takes up way too much room; I know that the romance parts in this wasn't cliches until years later, but I still think they're far too boring to sit through. The entire movie is mostly boring, apart from the last 20 minutes, which contain a pretty decent amount of classic Hitchcock suspense, but unfortunately it's too little, too late. As such, it can't save the movie from being boring, drawn-out and more or less pointless. I guess, considering the subject matter, it had an impact when it was made in '46, but by now, it has no power as a political drama, and we're left with a cliche-ridden romance with little to no excitement or suspense. If you like Hitchcock, go watch Psycho or Vertigo instead. They're far better than this. I'd only recommend this to people who want to see how Hitchcock started out, as there are several very typical Hitchcockian ideas in this; unfortunately, they're severely underused, and the film is left being dull and filled to the limit with romantic sap, rather than actual excitement. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to go too far wrong when you have Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman playing off each other with Hitchcock directing. Bergman is asked by a U.S. intelligence agent (Grant) to infiltrate a group of Nazis who have regrouped in Rio after the war to continue plotting nefarious deeds. Of course Bergman and her primary contact fall in love. However, it's a complicated situation since, in order to preserve her cover, Bergman is forced to marry one of the Nazis whom she had known in the past. The romance between Bergman and Grant is necessarily restrained by circumstance and Grant plays his part perhaps too well, since you hardly perceive his passion. Bergman has a difficult time playing against type as a drunken party girl in the initial scenes, but she recovers herself for the rest of the film. There is some interesting camera work and lighting. Grant's predicament raises the issue of how much of a personal life an intelligence agent is willing to give up in favor of duty to country and job. This theme is examined more sharply in movies like the more recent, "The Good Shepard," and the brilliant "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.""Notorious" is dated in a lot of ways. Heavy use of soft focus close-ups has gone out of style. I am sure Mothers Against Drunk Driving would be made apoplectic by Bergman's being totally bombed and taking off driving on country roads at high speed. Of course she fortunately did not encounter a single other car in that escapade. And smoking has ceased being cool. Some little things bothered me, like the fact that people were sleeping under heavy blankets in Rio in mid-spring. The thing that really got to me was the heavy use of obviously fake backgrounds: Rio beach scenes from a hotel balcony, backgrounds at outdoor cafés, scenes from car windows, and so forth. This distanced me from the movie by making me realize I was watching actors on a set. The tension builds as things progress. Has a handsome prince ever saved a damsel in distress in a more cleverly plotted final scene?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psycho, Vertigo, North by Northwest and the others. Who can interrogate the quality of these films because of the ability of The Master? But, if I have a chance to criticize one of them as a fan of Hitchcock, it must be a comparison with other Hitchcock films. Otherwise it is a big injustice to Hitchcock. As a summary of this paragraph, whenever I watch a Hitchcock film, I immediately criticize or praise it because of previously watched film or films.After all, In my opinion, mystery isn't in the most important place as an element. For a watcher, a breathtaking tag continues during the whole film more than mystery. Mystery is common for Alexander Sebastian who controls the German mechanizm of War in Brasil.To the story, Mr. J. Huberman is sentenced for the crime of betrayal to USA against Germany. His daughter Alicia Huberman is wanted to find the people who are related to his father in Brasil. Agent Devlin is charged for this mission by USA and in this way the story turns to a romance story between Devlin and Huberman.There aren't too much twist or turns, but there is a similarity with Psycho because of pre-final scene. The blackmail that Devlin did to Sebastian in Sebastian's house while saving poisoned Alicia is a fine light that squirts from Hitchcock's brain.Please don't misunderstand me. I don't say "I didn't admire it", I only say that it is so smooth in comparison with usual Hitchcock films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved by Rains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first set eyes on the cover of the videotape, I'm afraid my reaction was "Cary Grant? I don't remember Cary Grant's being in this!" I'd retained the memory of Claude Rains and Ingrid Bergman, in that order -- and as the film wound on, it became all too obvious why I'd apparently forgotten Grant altogether. His character is a wooden nonentity.As a romance, I found this sorely lacking; I quite literally had difficulty keeping awake during the first half. Devlin is thoroughly unlikable and Alicia is awash in noxious self-pity (not to mention stronger liquids). The chemistry between them failed to convince: I really can't read Devlin as the repressed, impassioned type lashing out through inner torment as has been claimed. This is no embittered, self-hating cynic, let alone a 'sexy' one -- just a rather unconvincing spy. I have a problem with films where the only person I actually care about is the villain, but it wasn't until Claude Rains turned up that the film became interesting to me at all -- and certainly by the end I caught myself willing him to succeed in getting rid of the unloving wife who has betrayed him so badly.As a thriller it succeeds better; that and Rains' performance are the only reason I scored it as high as I have. But the actual tense section is really confined to the big set-piece party scene (where our hero and heroine are as spectacularly incompetent at not appearing suspicious as ever). The only person I'm afraid for in the ending is, again, Rains -- the romantic reconciliation doesn't warm my heart (since I couldn't give tuppence for either of the participants by this point) and of course the patriotic message leaves me completely cold, as a US outsider.A brittle, bravura performance by Ingrid Bergman; Grant is very much in the background. Rains steals the film, and/or saves it. Either way, I'm not sure I very much *like* it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Post World War 11 Hitchcock thriller starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Her first has been jailed for treason and subsequently commits suicide.Grant recruits Bergman to spy on former Nazis now living in Brazil. He works with the head of the unit played by Louis Calhern.The complication here is that Grant and Bergman fall in love and she is sent to her former lover- Alexander Sebastian- played with sinister zeal by Claude Rains, in still another nominated supporting Oscar performance. Leopoldine Konstantin (aka Madame Konstantin) steals the show as his extremely sinister mother. While Madame is quite effective here, I am amazed that either Maria Ouspenskaya, Blanche Yurka or former Oscar winner Katina Paxinou did not land this plum role.While the picture is a good one, and the ending is superb, my major criticism of the film is that Bergman goes from bitter woman, to a true American patriot, to one being poisoned by Sebastian and mother when they discover that she is an American agent. Things move along rapidly, but don't they normally do in a Hitchcock thriller?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER!!!!!!!! REVIEW OF THE FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER************************ BE AWARE. From there the party progressed and the Alicia and Devlin drank a lot until she was drunk. They went for a drive and she was totally hammered. This is where part of the plot began to unravel, because on the ride they got pulled over. She was suppose to be arrested since it was her second charge of drunk driving but Devlin showed the cop an ID and let her go. It turns out he was a government agent and he needed her for a job. This is why he was at the party, because he needed her to go to Brazil to work undercover to catch a man named Sebastian. There were two reasons for her to be used. The first one was that her father knew Sebastian and the second was that he had a crush on Alicia. So she gets sent down there to pretend like she is interested in him. From there she begins to find out many different things about this man and his acquaintances. However, Sebastian is very suspicious of Devlin and wants Alicia to marry him to prove her love for him by marrying him, so she does. However, through the beginning of the story Devlin and Alicia both fall for each other and have a hard time with this entire scenario. It turns out they were planning something big that has to do with uranium, but they never really sad what the uranium was for. Through the course of her undercover work Sebastian and his mother found out about her working for the government, because she had to steal a key to find out what Sebastian and his comrades were up to, and Sebastian noticed the key was gone at a dinner party when he went to the cellar to get more wine (this is where the uranium was). After Sebastian and his mother found out about her they began to drug her to death. The reason that he and his mother did this was because early in the film one of the other acquaintances almost gave away the secret when he noticed a bottle of wine. Which was hidden in wine bottles. After this event the others decided that he needed to be killed to make sure no one found out. They were all very suspicious about everything, and Sebastian and his mother were worried they would be killed if the others found out. So Sebastian and his mother did not want the other guys to find out that she was a government spy. After Alicia begins to be poisoned she soon gets so poisoned she is bed ridden, and she realizes that the Sebastian and his mother know she is a spy. So they keep on poisoning her so the others won't find out. After a few days had gone by Alicia had not checked in with Devlin and he went looking for her, and found her in a bed near death. From there he takes her out of the room and finds Sebastian on his way up the stairs and says to let him take her or he will tell the others what has been going on, so Sebastian begins to play along like they are going to take her to a hospital. So they start carrying her down the stairs like they are going to take her to the hospital with Sebastian. Once Devlin and Alicia are in the car he does not let Sebastian in the car, because he knows that the others will kill him, and that is how it ends by Sebastian walking back into the house where the other guys he is working with are. The plot develops very slowly, and when you think you will find out what is going on they don't tell you. Since they never said what Sebastian and the others plot was it made me jumpy all through the film. Now, there are many obvious social and political issues in this film. The social issue is if you are a criminal do not trust a girl that hated you before, and now will marry you. It was stupid because Sebastian's mother had a feeling the whole time something was not right, and she was right. Secondly being a criminal gives people major paranoia; I mean they killed the other guy just for pointing at a bottle if wine and looking funny. People who are criminals are very paranoid so you better not become one. The political issues are obvious this film showed that the government can do a lot of things people would never expect to be possible. They were able to find this woman and get her to do some very dangerous things to catch some really bad men. The reason I think they never said what they were doing was because uranium is used in atomic weapons and at this time that was a big thing, so I guess Hitchcock expected us to understand. Also, Hitchcock is well known for making films that grab you attention just like this one did. Another big political or social issue was when they showed Alicia driving drunk. This is a big issue now a days and they showed her getting caught, because think of the ramifications if she did not get pulled over. In movies and television they need to show people who do bad things getting caught, or more people would commit crimes. Even if in the real world they get caught, stopping crimes before the start is a big issue in my mind. It is like if they didn't show her getting pulled over some people may have driven drunk and killed someone, which happens all the time. In the end they showed the Sebastian walking to his death, from the hands of his own people.</fullReview>

The reason behind this, I presume, is probably because I'm caught up in a generation of technology and big fancy blockbusters; but that's not to say I have never liked an old film or a slow-paced film, because I have. Just 40's movies in particular. Notorious is about a woman who goes into deep-cover to expose the leader of a neo- Nazi group. There is rarely an exciting moment, and even the scenes that seem exciting make little sense. Like Casablanca before it, I found myself completely drawn away and bored with Notorious, therefore victimizing it as yet another mysterious 40's movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had most of the very the best Hollywood, then or now, could offer lavished on it. The biggest stars, one of its greatest directors. And one of its great scriptwriters in Ben Hecht too. What then turned what could have been a great movie into this middling and rather brainless effort? How, given the magical nature of all the ingredients, could this have happened? Other reviewers berate the director, Hitchcock, but directors only tell the story, they don't write it. How did such a poor script get put on celluloid? It did though serve one of its stars well enough - Ingrid Bergman was scarcely ever more lovely or, as a loving, abused and endangered heroine, ever tugged so at male audiences' heart-strings (exactly as she does the Cary Grant character) other than perhaps as she had done in "Gaslight". The casting otherwise did seem less than sure-footed. Cary Grant's line of dry humour under adversity is entirely lacking and he is less convincing as the police agent torn between love and duty - the less-than-sharp and rather misogynistic script unhelpful. Claude Rains was simply too nice to be a Nazi - and too old to be the mother-dominated son of a woman played by an actress in reality just 3 years his senior.Taken as a thriller it suffers from various defects. Filmed biographies of real life figures such as "Odette" (1950) have left little creditable room for soapy variations on the theme of the woman spy facing extreme danger and death. Common sense insists that such heroines' motivations required to be of the very strongest kinds in order to undertake such dangerous and distasteful work yet here plausible motivation is entirely lacking. And the agents who set her up seem to take her extreme commitment for granted. The plot was decidedly leaky - Grant and Bergman meet publicly, sit and embrace on a park bench in the city where she lives a lie with her Nazi husband as if there was no danger of being watched. And finally, the coup de grace for a thriller - it distinctly lacked tension.Take away the top line stars and director and this would have been a pot-boiling "B" movie. Indeed take away Ingrid Bergman and not that much worth watching would have been left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but hardly outstanding Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Notorious" is certainly a well-made film, with a perfectly structured script, excellent performances and some clever camerawork. Hitchcock had already reached the level of an accomplished director by then, and his work here is confident and smooth.Nevertheless, I don't really like "Notorious". I think it's a very dislikable, barely entertaining film. Grant makes his character so cold and distant (and his excellent performance is devoid of the actor's usual charm) that the scenes where he reveals his feelings for Bergman seem contradictory with his general behavior and are often short on credibility. I know that all those elements were intentionally included by Hitchcock, but that doesn't make them any easier to swallow. A good film, but it makes you feel uncomfortable while you're watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrendous Miscasting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that Notorious is as close to a perfect movie as one can get. The performances of all participants are beyond praise, not to mention the direction. My only complaint is with the casting of Claude Rains (Sebastian), the man with the mellifluous voice. He is 26 years older than Bergman and about 6 inches shorter. He looks every day of his age (not being, as Grant turned out to be, ageless). Consequently, as Bergman's suitor and husband he is totally unbelievable and unacceptable. In fact, his embarrassing scenes with her make one think of nothing so much than a towering Viking Goddess being courted by a teensy-weensy, aged, English elf. Rains would have been appropriate in this movie only if the plot had called for someone to play her Daddy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant makes up for 'An Affair to Remember'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely one of the best big screen romances that I have ever seen. Grant and Bergman create tension and suspense during their brief, undercover meetings in the streets of Rio. While some of the other acting is precarious, it is not bad enough to dampen the quality of this movie. In typical Hitchcock fashion, I was thrust into uncomfortable suspense as the protagonists struggled to disrobe the bad guys. And who can argue with the beautiful likes of Bergman. She may be the hottest actress ever. Grant did for himself in this movie what Bogey did for himself in Casablanca-namely, make up for really bad movies like 'An Affair to Remember' and 'African Queen', respectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not typical Hitchcock - so I like it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Notorious" (1946): Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant, and Ingrid Bergman. I am NOT a fan of Hitchcock, and this is NOT like a typical Hitchcock film, so I liked it much better. It's without all the last minute twist gimmicks and typical A.H. signature devices so many people seem to appreciate. This is a straight ahead crime-suspense-drama, set in current time (1946), at the end of WWII, reflecting real concerns and events. In THIS case it means hunting down Nazis who escaped to South America. Grant is a government Agent, Bergman is a somewhat unwilling part-time Agent ? the daughter of a treasonous father. Together, they are assigned the infiltration of a group of Germans down in Rio. This is strong, steamy, tense, reality based stuff, with, as you might expect, some sort of push/pull between our two leads? and WHO could resist Bergman (or Grant)? There are very few cheezie special effects (such as in "Vertigo" ? one I especially dislike), and forget trying to spot Hitchcock hiding somewhere ? he's not there. Maybe he respected this story or his actors enough to avoid such distractions?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We get a chance to see Cary Grant punch Ingrid Bergman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Notorious (1946)' is one of Hitchcock's beloved mysteries, but watching it now, restored on Criterion Collection DVD, it seems just a bit trivial. Cary Grant is a mostly serious government agent, not his usual rascal self. Ingrid Bergman is superb as the daughter of a convicted German spy. Most of the movie takes place in Rio, where Alicia (Bergman) is to help the US government find out why a group of expatriate Germans are there and what their scheme is. Devlin (Grant) is an agent for the Brazilian government and his job is to be Alicia's contact there. The movie was actually shot in a Hollywood studio, and a 2nd unit filmed generic scenes in and around Rio which were used via rear projection to provide backgrounds for the actors. This is explained in one of the features in the DVD's 'dossier.'SPOILERS follow - Alicia is a woman of loose morals, and perfect for the assignment to get 'close' to the Germans in Rio, but Devlin falls in love with her. Duty prevents him from revealing his true feelings, instead he encourages her to accept the German's marriage proposal. Hitchcock's 'mcguffin' is the sandy material Devlin and Alicia find in a wine bottle while snooping in the cellar during a party. The sand turns out to be a source of Uranium, but that doesn't matter to this movie. When her German husband and his mum find out she knows about the cellar, they begin to slowly poison her, because if they revealed the discovery to their cronies, they would be disposed of. The climax comes when Devlin, after not hearing from Alicia in a week, visits their home, boldly goes to her bedroom, finds the truth, and walks Alicia out and down the stairs, the husband knowing he cannot reveal the truth or his time is up too. The movie ends with the large door closing with a great 'THUD' on the Germans, and we know what will happen. Meanwhile ... Alicia and Devlin start their life together.A rather simple story, well done in black and white, but comes across as quite dated in this 21st century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't quite get this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't quite get this film. When I see a Hitchcock film, I expect 3 things (suspense, humor, and great camera work). This film does have 2 out of the 3. What's missing is the humor that Hitchcock so often threw into his movies. The movie also doesn't hold up today being that its about World War 2 (although I believe Lifeboat stands up well for different reasons). Personal opinion though- a lot of people love it and it is great for a love story. There is suspense here but it is very moderate suspense. Again, I urge readers to buy the Criterion version- you will be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't stop thinking about how bad an actress Ingrid Bergman is. Everything she did looked fake, fake, fake. Her extraordinarily good-looks are her only reprieve in this film. After watching Casablanca again, it is apparent that she can get by with smaller roles, but cannot begin to cover up her deficiencies in larger starring roles such as this one. That said, I especially enjoyed this film. It's another textbook example of Hitch's perfect use of editing to build suspense (the shower scene in Psycho being the best example).8 of 10 stars (it would be 9 if Bergman weren't cast).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I am alway's quite surprised when I see how highly rated this movie is as I don't consider it to be anywhere near Alfred Hithcock' best work.I am a big fan of Hitchcock and think that many of his movies are first rate including 'Psycho','The Birds' and 'Rear Window'.However,I find that this film moves very slowly and takes an age to draw to it's conclusion.The acting is fine and the film does have it's moment's.What Hitchcock film doesn't? But the last time I watched it I found myself clock watching and feeling a bit bored and when the end came I didn't feel the need to watch the film again.Of course it goes without saying that Hitchcock was a true master of the cinema.It just happens that this wasn't one of his better films in my humble opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notoriously overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Notorious" is often hailed as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest productions, and with a cast that includes Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains, why shouldn't it be? Well, lets see if I can think of a reason. In addition to having oily fingertips, my head scratching has produced several reasons why "Notorious" does not deserve its superior reputation: first of all, it's dull. If that were not enough to sink it, and I believe it is, it's also boring. Dull and boring: the cardinal sins of filmmaking, sins that Hitchcock had previously committed with "Rebecca," and would commit again with "The Paradine Case," "Stage Fright," and "Under Capricorn." The "master of suspense" did not earn that title through those films, and there is little suspense to be found in this supposed "espionage thriller" that is, in fact, a romance.Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman smooch up a storm while resident villain Claude Rains steals the acting honors as a Nazi spy. The whole tedious affair reminds me that of the four Hitchcock films starring Grant, only 1959's "North by Northwest" qualifies as a classic. The others--"Suspicion," "To Catch a Thief," and, yes, "Notorious"--are forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another overrated Hitchcock: watch it if you can switch off your brain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't Ingrid Bergman who is notorious. Hitchcock is notorious for making overrated movies. This is another one. While not nearly as heavy on illogic as some of his other movies, it doesn't really grip you; it's merely interesting, but hardly in a spellbinding way. There are no surprise twists at all, but I guess I should be thankful because those usually spell "illogic" in his movies. The climax is hardly "amazingly suspenseful", as Maltin the Really Bad Movie Critic states in his silly little book. There is a decent ending but I failed to notice any drops of sweat sliding down my forehead. "Amazingly suspenseful"...? What was Maltin on when he saw it? Doesn't he know you're supposed to take LSD for "2001" and not for thrillers...? The illogic isn't major (for a Hitchcock movie) but it's there: 1) first there is that strange appearance by the head of the American spy agency (let's call him "ABC") while Bergman and Rains are having dinner. Rains recognizes ABC: why the hell would ABC want Rains to notice him? Why should anyone want Rains to even suspect that American spies are following his every move? Shouldn't ABC be hiding, or at least not flashing his presence in Rio? 2) the same goes for Grant; it would make more sense for Bergman to approach Rains (while horse-riding) alone, instead of accompanied by a U.S. agent, 3) how come both Bergman and Grant - two apparently intelligent people - failed to notice the flaw in their wine-cellar plan: namely, if she steals the key from Rains and he decides to go to the cellar during the party he will unavoidably notice that his key is missing, and put 2 and 2 together? 4) It isn't exactly illogical, but it is far-fetched that Rains never suspected that him bumping into Bergman - in Rio, and not some place like Kartoffelsaladstadt - was too huge a coincidence; sure, he was smitten with her, but he also new of the presence of American agents and the paranoia in him should have rang a bell of warning; this goes even more so for his Nazi colleagues who should have suspected something since they didn't have love to cloud their judgment; it would have been logical for them to get suspicious about her sudden appearance.The relationship between Bergman and Grant - i.e. the characterization - is rushed, and as a result there are some rather off-kilter verbal exchanges between them early on. Bergman has very little beauty to offer. I don't know whether she was always like this or whether she got uglier, but her bones are bigger than that of a Swedish wrestler. And check out those hands and fingers! They look like they might belong to a rugged peasant, and not a Hollywood diva. Her face only looks good from the profile; from the front it looks like Ted Kennedy's head ? i.e. a big, wide watermelon. Bergman has as many facial muscles as Grant, f'rcrissakes. I think that, standing next to a real woman like Heyward or Colbert, Bergman would look like a giant oak tree by comparison.If you're interested in reading my "biographies" of Ingrid Bergman and other Hollywood persons, contact me by e-mail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spy Who Went Into The Heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Try as I might and with the best will in the world I am completely unable to shake off a lifetime belief that Hitchcock is vastly overrated and this entry does nothing to change that opinion. Overrated should not be confused with Incompetent; Hitchcock was an excellent Journeyman director who mostly knew where to point the camera but that is only to be expected in someone who spent virtually all his working life in the industry. Of course I'm watching Nororious some sixty years after its initial release plus I myself am notoriously hard to please but I found it terribly mannered if not stilted in fact it might have been called not inaccurately The Last Of The Wine. It it's a thriller then where, pray, are the thrills; if Hitchcock is, as fans have said, the 'master' of suspense, kindly lead me to any scene that contains it. It comes across more as a comedy of manners without the comedy. Louis Calhern is totally wasted as Paul Prescott, any half competent actor could have phoned in Calhern's few scenes. The climax, or what passes for one, involves Grant removing Bergman, heavily sedated and being slowly poisoned by husband Claude Rains and his mother, from the upper storey of a large house full of ex-Nazis and if this was not a golden opportunity for thrills, suspense, ANYTHING, then I've never seen one, yet in the event Grant more or less walks out with her after implying he has a gun in his pocket. In similar vein Calhern wraps up the McGuffin element - which in this case involves uranium in wine bottles - in a brief sentence to the effect that the agency (then called OSS later to become the CIA) is on top of it. Bergman is always going to be lovely to look at and Grant was never exactly chopped liver but just as one swallow and a summer so with two stars and a movie. Nice try but no cigar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Notorious was the worst Hitchcock I've seen ever. Even my friend who is absolutely Hitchcock obsessed didn't like it. I mean, please, I couldn't tell who was who and the whole movie I said to myself, "Good or bad person?" Movies are supposed to be captivating and enthralling, launching you into the story plot, but I couldn't even enjoy it because I didn't know who was who. I fell asleep watching it and had to watch the rest the next morning. I wouldn't even compare Notorious to the other Hitchcock movies I've seen. Suggestions to people wanting to see this movie: DON'T!!!!! IF YOU DO, MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN A COMFORTABLE SPOT TO SLEEP IN!!!!! TURN BACK WHILE YOU CAN!!!!! DON'T JUDGE HITCHCOCK BY THIS MOVIE, HE REALLY IS A WONDERFUL DIRECTOR!!!!!This was my first Hitchcock and frankly afterward, I didn't want to see anymore. As I did though, I could see that, in my opinion, this was the worst that I've seen.I don't even know how I'm supposed to write 10 lines like the guidelines say because there really isn't much to say other than how awful it was.</fullReview>
