		<fullReview>Why oh why had they to spend one single cent in remaking a film that's so perfect as Hitchcock's classic? And, if they really wanted to do it, why to do it so bad? Remakes are welcome when they do something to improve the original, but when they are e.g. like Psycho'98 one can't do anything but ask himself why didn't they give the budget to a charity association instead. But there are even a worse breed of remakes: some of them are enjoyable if you don't know the original version (like Mel Brooks' "To Be or Not to Be"), but there are others that turn a wonderful story to a bore.'Notorious' belongs to the latter category.The storyline of this version is the same of the classic one, with two minor changes: it happens in the 1990s, and the bad guys are Communists instead of Nazis. The main problem begins when we are introduced the main characters: Jenny Robertson is a cute girl but Ingrid Bergman asleep and with flu acted better, and John Shea (from Lois &amp; Clark Hall of Fame) is the lead guy with less charisma than I've seen in a movie in a long time. Comparing him to Cary Grant is kinda like comparing The Spice Girls to Mozart. With those lead actors, the movie goes downhill all the time, even when the other actors are somewhat good (Jean-Pierre Cassel is not a bad actor but nobody can compare to Claude Rains; and Marisa Berenson limits to appearing there without doing too much), and the suspense is minimal: you never get into the plot like in Hitchcock's version. You really don't feel interested about it.Director Colin Bucksey isn't even talented enough to make it enjoyable, it seems that he only put the camera there and let the actors read their lines the way they wanted. I suppose that even the director knew that this was another TV-movie to see-and-forget and didn't care about its quality.I don't know if this flick deserves to be listed in the Bottom 100 page, I mean, it's not ridiculously bad as 'Castle of Fu Manchu' can be, but maybe it really deserved it for its total lack of originality and its zero charisma.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this remake and was impressed with the acting and the style. As remakes go this film works well because it stays close to the original. The previous comparison to Gus Van Sant's remake (which actually used the original script with only 3 or 4 minor variations) was not entirely accurate.As a rule, I don't care for remakes but I had been very impressed with Ms Robertson's portrayal of Patty Duke in the TV production "Call Me Anna." Because of her acting ability I watched this version of "Notorious" just to make a comparison. I watched the movie from start to finish and never saw one moment that compared badly with Hitchcock's original. There were even improvements due to changing attitudes of today's society. Since this was meant for TV and stayed so focused only added to the experience.John Shea is most convincing as the U.S. agent who remains cynical about the under-cover spy's motive. The sexual tension between the two is handled in a real and true way without being offensive to some viewers and was better than the "Hollywood" treatment which I am sure that even Mr. Hitchcock himself regretted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not your mother's Notorious, but unlike another critic I found Jenny Robertson's portrayal touching and tragic. John Shea, more believable as an agent than Grant and yet a likeable leading man with a romantic quality of times past.Ms. Robertson is a leading lady in the Michele P. level of beauty and her breathless quality of line delivery is very like the endearing flavor of Ms. Bergman. Mr. Shea and Ms. Robertson so capable of being major motion picture leads and yet Hollywood has not discovered these jewels.The movie takes the luxury of time and contains a very romantic musical montage. The movies sound track is also flavored of films past.The supporting roles are perfectly cast and very exotic. So much like those from the first movie it is astonishing.The movie's tension is no where near the original and yet it is enjoyable all the same.I do hope Hollywood discovers the talents of Ms. Robertson and Mr. Shea.Mr.Shea would be ideal as the new Phillip Marlowe and Ms. Robertson would shine in any leading role.The movie made for cable's Lifetime Channel is indeed a great movie for a girl's night. Rent the original and follow with this contemporary tribute to a classic old movie.</fullReview>
