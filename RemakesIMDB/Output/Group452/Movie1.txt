		<shortDescription>Three Fugitives is an excellent comedy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just great, its really funny &amp; original for its time. Martin Short &amp; Nick Nolte really make this movie work, I would say this is Martin Shorts best role in a movie where he's actually really hilarious throughout the movie. The casting for this movie is also good too, movie keeps traveling at a fairly consistent pace. In my own opinion this is a great family comedy movie. Its extremely funny &amp; touching all at the same time, I recommend this to all comedy movie lovers, the bank scene is just simply hilarious. This is my favourite Nick Nolte movie, i haven't seen too many of his movies but his acting was great in this movie. I give this 8.5/10 for being a very under estimated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect for a jovial mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're that "god, I'm a serious movie rater and this better impress me" kind of movie watcher then go find another. But If you are in the mood to laugh and think odd pairs are funny then go for it. It helps to know the history of Martin Short's style of comedy. Nick Nolte's a pretty big guy and Sarah Doroff is really little. So Nolte just got outa prison and is supposed to be this big bad bank robber with a reputation. Martin Short is this nervous jobless dad that robs a bank just as Nick Nolte is there and takes Martin takes 'Nick' as a hostage.Nick gets SHOT! Martin has a senile old friend that takes care of Rover(Nick). James Earl Jones does a belly-laugh. Sarah overcomes her trama to change gender. Martin Changes Gender! There's a Happy Ending Such a sweet movie- after its over put A Nightmare on Elm Street in for the contrast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No need to run away from this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not as bad or as unfunny a movie as some IMDb posters make out. The central situation of Lucas (Nick Nolte), a tough, professional heist-meister, being taken hostage by Perry (Martin Short), a bungling first-time bank robber, is pleasingly ridiculous. In particular, Perry's antics in the early bank robbery scenes are laugh-out-loud funny; as is Lucas's later violent entry into the bar where Perry is being held prisoner. The section towards the end, when Perry is disguised as a woman is also reasonably amusing. The scenes between Lucas and Perry's daughter (Sarah Rowland Doroff), are quite touching, when they could easily have been been sickly sentimental. (It helps that the little girl is supposed to have a psychological problem, so she hardly speaks.) On the downside, there are undoubtedly soggy patches in the middle of the film, including the scene where James Earl Jones and Alan Ruck, as the two policemen leading the chase for Perry and Lucas, find it hilariously funny that Lucas was treated for a gunshot wound by a crazy vet who thought he was a dog. Another defect is the whiny music, which is repetitive and irritating. All in all, this may not be a film to spend much money on, but is worth watching if it turns up on TV. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite comedy which deserves to be seen more often</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While being a great enthusiast of French cinema, I hadn't heard of Francis Veber when I saw this magnificent comedy in 1989. Unfortunately his wonderful films were never released in the UK, until 'Le Dîner des Cons'. So I came to it fresh... and WOW. Here we have Nick Nolte in a perfect role as the tough former bank robber and Martin Short as the perfect nerdish but determined sidekick. The opening bank robbery sequence, that sets up the film is magnificent and hilarious. The sub-plot involving the little girl is sweet and moving - almost worthy of Chaplin. The loopy vet is amazing and one of his scenes had me crawling on the floor with laughter. I could start analysing the structure or the mise en sc?ne, but such sophistry is irrelevant - just see it and laugh out loud like you will rarely have done so before. (Amazingly I haven't seen the original with Depardieu and Pierre Richard... why don't they release a subtitled version?????)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfairly forgotten 80s charmer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of 1980s film that Hollywood never seems to make anymore. Unassuming, low key and charming without a big budget or a labyrinthine plot, it simply tells a simple story and then finishes.Nowadays low budget films must have a hook, which generally means they are extremely art-housey or plain horror flicks, there aren't many little family-friendly flicks. Marketing and a lack of cross-promotion opportunities wouldn't allow it.This is a bit of a shame, as Three Fugitives is the kind of film that you can all sit in front of the TV and kill 100 minutes without anyone in the room whining unnecessarily. Nick Nolte plays Lucas, who is being released from prison after a 5 year sentence earned by holding up 14 banks. (It was amazing seeing how fit Nolte looks here, he's still gruff and weathered but he is actually in really good shape, something he couldn't say for anything since the early 90s.) Now Lucas claims he is going straight, something that his arresting officer (played by James Earl Jones) gravely doubts. When Darth Vader stops Lucas as he leaves prison to tell him "I've got my eye on you", Lucas asks for a lift to the local bank so that he can rob it, and this is where the fun starts? After entering the bank to open a new account, Lucas unwittingly becomes embroiled in a hold up perpetrated by the bumbling Ned, played by Martin Short, (who these days turns me to tears but who is fitting here, as his character is required by the plot to be pathetic and annoying, something he is in spades).Ned ultimately screws up big and takes Lucas hostage for some reason, even though at 6 foot plus and a good 50kg heavier than Ned he could snap him like a twig. The cops, thinking Lucas really held up the bank, tell him to give up and he yells back that he has nothing to do with it, a gun accidentally goes off, Lucas is shot in the leg and off they go on the lam. (That's cops &amp; robbers shop talk for run away.) Initially Lucas tries at the first opportunity to turn Ned in at the local cop shop to absolve himself from guilt and clear his name, he quickly realizes that Ned has no intention of giving himself up, but a lack of blood caused by the bullet in his leg removes a bit of his get up and go, so Ned takes him to a Vet for treatment.Enter the reason for Ned's robbery and desire to remain free: 6ish year old Meg.Meg is Ned's daughter, who hasn't spoken for years since the sudden death of her mother. Ned is unemployed and attempted the hold up to keep afloat so that Meg wouldn't need to go to a home or a special needs facility, and his desire to care for her is evident.Lucas initially wants nothing to do with Meg and gives Ned the address of a guy who can forge him some papers so that he can at least safely skip town.Without going into detail or the Spoiler-iffic zone, the three fugitives of the title band together through the various impediments and pitfalls that beset them in order to cross the border to Canada, with the cops on their tail the whole time.This is very light and fanciful stuff, and a great deal of the amusement comes from watching Lucas brutalise Ned in an off-handed way, as if he does it all the time (and he probably does).The second half of the film is Run. Escape. Run. Escape, with more and more unlikely near misses each time, all wrapped in a neat bow with a hokey 80s movie ending.This doesn't mean the film is not entertaining though, it is a fluff piece that never seems dated despite being in its 20s, and while never scaling great heights it remains amusing throughout.If nothing else it proves that if you try to entertaining you don't need to aim for greatness to achieve, after all for some reason it has given Robbie Williams a career.Final Rating ? 7 / 10. You won't be breathlessly describing it to mates the next day but while it is running you will enjoy yourself.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a light 80's style comedy with heavy doses of schmaltz. The plot revolves around Lucas (Nick Nolte) who's been released from jail after 5 years for armed bank robbery. On his first day of release, he gets taken hostage by Perry (Martin Short), who tries to rob a bank in order to continue to care for his ailing daughter Meg. We've seen it many times before, Perry is completely inept, knowing only that he has to care for his daughter, Lucas is the tough ex-con with the heart of gold, oh you can almost picture the buddy-buddy hilarity to come.Unfortunately, this movie completely under-utilises one of the great American comedic actors in Martin Short. These scenes that revolve around him just drag, and you end up longing for Nolte returning to the screen. The most poignant scenes revolve around the relationship formed between Lucas and Meg. Both of these two are fantastic in these scenes, and it's that which keeps you drawn to the film longing to see how it plays out.The Three Fugitives is a fun little movie that won't bore you, is worth watching if you see it on TV. I wouldn't bother going out of you way to view it though.All in all 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most fun and entertaining movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never written a review before but for this one I just had to write one. I was just changing channels when I came across this one and after watching the first bank scene I knew this one i just had to watch. The story is simple and extremely entertaining and the comic scenes are just hilarious that had me laughing out loud which doesn't happen a lot. This is one of those movies which would keep you glued to the TV screen thinking what would happen next. The comic timing in some of the scenes is pure genius. I don't think there was ever a dull moment in this movie. I usually get bored when the movie gets slow but this is fast paced and the story keeps moving forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much on the run. More like a slow crawl.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a personal bias against American remakes of foreign films. They seem to exist to be made only because an American/English audience doesn't relish the idea of having to read subtitles while watching a film. And not many of these remakes work anyway. Look at the dire likes of True Lies and Three Men and a Baby.Three Fugitives was no doubt inspired by the recent success of TMAAB. They're both American remakes of French comedies, and Touchstone have even taken the precaution of importing the director and writer of the original version, Francis Veber. I haven't seen Les Fugitifs so I can't debate how close Veber sticks to his own material, or if he makes any drastic changes, but as it is, Three Fugitives is an amiable caper, if one that never bursts out with gut busting laughs.Lucas (Nick Nolte) is an ex-con who's decided to go straight. But on the day of his parole, he walks into a bank and right into the middle of a hold-up. Ned Perry (Martin Short) is an incompetent bank robber who wears a nylon stocking for a balaclava. And when the robbery takes much longer then planned, that gives the police enough time to surround the place. In desperation, Ned takes Lucas hostage. But the police, who know of Lucas' track record for armed robberies think he's the robber. Meaning these two mismatched men must go on the run together.I admit to enjoying Three Fugitives far more then Three Men and a Baby. They are quite similar films at heart. Both Touchstone financed American remakes of French originals, and the plots both revolve around a youngster. In this case Ned's mute six-year old daughter Meg. It turns out Ned pulled the robbery because he needed money to send Meg to a special school after being laid off from his job as a sales manager. Meg hasn't spoken a word since her mother died two years ago.Three Fugitives has its funny moments. Ned's bank robbery is so hopeless it gets funnier just watching it all go wrong around him. Like when he shoots the ceiling he gets showered in plaster. His disguise splits open. And when a bank teller throws him the bag full of money, it lands in a ceiling fixture. I also liked the scene when Lucas gets accidentally shot by Ned, and Ned has to take him to a vet to get treated (like a dog!).Its the bits in between that don't really work. All the funny parts come in isolated moments. And Francis Veber's direction isn't fast and frantic enough. So the film moves in fits and starts. It seems to take too long for the film to get to anything good. The inclusion of Meg to the plot also seems a bit of a miscalculation, and suggests something of the tweeness that capsized Three Men and a Baby.It never really boils over. Even if it lacks credibility. But its not helped by Sarah Rowland Doroff's rather flat performance. Even as she begins to open up, she's just as blank in the second half as she is in the first. Nick Nolte and Martin Short have they're amusements, even if they don't exactly have cracking chemistry. They're only paired up together just to play off of each other's obvious differences. So in other words you're typical buddy movie.Three Fugitives still feels a bit shapeless. It just moves from one spot to the next. Some funny (like Lucas getting a job as a locksmith!). Some cringeworthy (like Ned dressing up as a woman to avoid border checks). And the film doesn't end. It just sort of stops without any real attempt at an ending. Sporadically funny. Forgotten the next day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light comedy is good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyable, light film about an ex-con who is taken hostage in a botched bank robbery the day he gets out of jail. Francis Veber's film is yet another remake of a successful French hit, and one that works quite well.The plot doesn't amount to much but fortunately the comedy does. Martin Short is once again very funny and teams well with the gruff Nick Nolte. Together they wreak havoc, and a fair amount of hilarity, as they flee from the police with Short's adorable young daughter."Three Fugitives" is a comedy that will surely make you laugh, and possibly smile too. Good fun.Saturday, May 1, 1993 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd Trio On The Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Veber remakes his 'Les Fugitifs' into 'Three Fugitives'. Having not seen the original French version, as a standalone, I found this one to be charming, heartwarming and entertaining. It also holds nostalgic value for me as I remember first watching it years ago with an old friend.The film never strays away from the main point and it always stays focused on the three main characters Lucas, Ned and Meg. Veber's direction is decent. He doesn't rely on cheap action thrills, such as grand explosion sequences or outrageous chases. The story is quite straightforward but Veber's prime tool of entrainment is the humour which is very effective. There are some hilarious one-liners and situational humour.With a cast that includes Martin Short, Nick Nolte, James Earl Jone and Alan Ruck, very little can go wrong. Nolte and Short are funny as an odd couple, one an ex-con and another a down-on-his luck desperate father. They work well off one another just like Earl Jones and Ruck do. The scenes between Nolte and young Sarah Doroff are endearing to watch.In the end, 'Three Fugitives' is a funny and 'sweet' movie. It's sweet in the sense that there's just the right level of sugar, not too saccharine like the usual Hollywood flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the very best! This movie defines the word genius. It is a very clever comedy. It has some many side splitting moments you'll have to buy it!It doesn't seem to work as a certificate 15 however, i think it would have been a fantastic family film. Saying that, i watched it as a young kid with my family, so it brings back the good old days. This is the type of film where it is almost 'innocent' laughter, it doesn't rely on sexual jokes to make audience laugh, it doesn't really rely on anything , it's just naturally funny!! It's the type of film that your chirpy Grandad enjoys!But it should bring out the kid in you !LOVE IT!10/10</fullReview>

Naturally it has to have the mandatory American 'happy ending' but despite that the characters are lovable and compelling. The scene with the 'doctor' is priceless and is in keeping with the whole insane reason from the start.

		<fullReview>Lucas (Nick Nolte) gets parole after 5 years in prison for armed robbery. He catches a ride from detective Duggan (James Earl Jones) and his partner Tener (Alan Ruck) to the bank to open an account. Suddenly, incompetent robber Ned Perry (Martin Short) rushes in. He takes Lucas hostage but everybody assumes that Lucas is the robber. Ned is struggling to get the money for his daughter Meg's medical treatment. He had a nervous breakdown after his wife's death and she hasn't said a word since then.The initial joke is a gruff, angry Nolte constantly beating up on Short. That may be funny for awhile but even that doesn't last. The movie tries to win over our hearts with a cute little girl. I don't have anything mean to say. The movie is trying really hard to pluck those heart strings. The odd couple gets separated for long stretches. They're not that funny even when they're together. These two with a little girl has that light 80's comedic feel but it fails to deliver much comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of Les Fugitifs, a 1986 French comedy, 'Three Fugitives' is Decent Fun! Though nothing amazing or extremely touching, this crime-comedy is engaging at parts &amp; well-acted nevertheless.'Three Fugitives' Synopsis: On his first day after being released from jail for 14 armed bank robberies, Lucas finds himself caught up in someone else's robbery. Perry has decided to hold up the local bank to raise money so that he can keep his daughter, Meg, and get her the treatment she needs. Dugan, a detective, assumes Lucas helped plan the robbery, and hence Lucas, Perry and Meg become three fugitives.'Three Fugitives' is consistently watchable, thanks to its engaging narrative. The series of events that happen with its conjoined protagonists is mostly fun. Having said that, the film doesn't work entirely. The pace drops in its second-hour &amp; hence the impact overall, is hampered.Francis Veber's Screenplay &amp; Direction are good. He's written some bits well &amp; has captured the film well. Cinematography &amp; Editing are standard.Performance-Wise: Nick Nolte is a complete scene-stealer, as always. Martin Short is in remarkable form, enacting his part with excellent timing. Sarah Doroff is cute. James Earl Jones is first-rate.On the whole, 'Three Fugitives' has some problems, but they are mostly done away by its lighthearted tone &amp; fine performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly, truly underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Three Fugitives is like traveling back in time to a bygone era, when there was no Internet, only four TV channels and John Major was prime minister. But hey, it wasn't all bad... We got films like this, where the focus is purely on the relationship between a grumpy, fresh out of jail bank thief portrayed by Nick Nolte, a mute six year old girl and her well-meaning but accident prone father, played by Martin Short.Caught up in a heist-gone-wrong with a case of mistaken identity thrown into the bargain, the trio (as the title suggests) go on the lam together. Ever cop in the district is looking for them, Short is a walking disaster area, the kid wanders off at every given opportunity and Nolte just wants to ditch the other two and go straight. Easier said then done, when Short lands them in non-stop trouble, and Nolte begins to form a connection with the little girl...It's not a laugh-a-minute split-your-sides experience, but what it IS is a perfect fusion of pathos, understated action and amusing character moments. It's easy to predict the hate-love arc of the Nolte/Short friendship, and some of the punchline are visible from miles off. But frankly, I didn't care.All the cast play their roles so well, they transform what could have a humdrum script into something quite special. Of course, it also helps to have one of the cutest screen children around as their co-star. Makes their ongoing struggle more believable when we sees what's at stake, ya see? One to watch every few years from now on, I think. I'll never get tired of it, that's for sure. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The secret of "received with mixed reviews"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I lived my childhood in the 1980s. When it comes to movies, TV, music, haircuts, and girls, it's lovely decade indeed. For all the previous reasons I loved the 1980s. And as for Three Fugitives, it's an additional reason.No doubt it's wonderful and unforgettable movie. However, the no wonderful and so forgettable is its third act. Suddenly, the hunt ? of the police and the other criminals ? is finished, and the end is abrupt; as if there was some greediness for a sequel. I don't know why the script didn't extend the storyline of the hunt, by the police and other criminals, for longer ?! Hence, lines like "Dugan is on our tails." near the end sounded strange, especially when (James Earl Jones) vanished after the end of the second act. Speaking about strange lines; (Nolte)'s line to the kid in the orphanage "I'll take care of you like you took care of me." reminds you of another point of weakness which is the relationship of those 2 characters. I have always thought that it needed more to it in the second act; so they may fall in love appropriately and more convincingly. I believe these points are what caused the awful fate of "received with mixed reviews" !So, it's 2/3 classic. The detailing is fascinating; the first 10 minutes is a very good example. The music score, by (David McHugh), is one of the best I have ever heard to say the least. The image is smooth and romantic. (Haskell Wexler), the director of photography, won 2 Oscars for (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? ? 1966) and (Bound for Glory ? 1976). His cinematography can't be bypassed in other movies like (The Thomas Crown Affair ? 1968) or (The Man Who Loved Women ? 1983). For reasons like that he's one of 6 cinematographers to have a star on the famed "Hollywood Walk of Fame".The cast did their top. See how (Nolte) walks, how (Short) moves, or how (Jones) reacts to understand that well; it's rare to find a performance like this in a comedy. And when it comes to (Sarah Rowland Doroff), then we're talking about the movie's treasure. Casting her ensured this movie the immortality. OH MY GOD, every time I saw her; my heart just melts. She's too fragile to make you cry. It's apparent that (Francis Veber) directed her so well to an extent of feeling how she lost the nomination for the Oscar unfairly that year. (Veber) enjoyed us utterly, with exquisite adorable cadres, aesthetic lighting sometimes, and striking sense of comedy. He, as a writer, only lacked some balance in the last 20 minutes, and a satisfying finer climax. This movie has a philosophical side. Review with me : you have to be a criminal to raise a child correctly these days, love makes us fugitives in this world, and it's eventually a tale of 3 fugitives who get home by belonging to each other in some kind of family; with a serious stout father (Nolte), a helpless clumsy mom (Short), and a weak child (Doroff) who messes her father and mother. They all need a getaway to run from crimes they whether didn't commit or were pushed to commit lousily. The movie showcases that family obviously at the disguise by the Canadian borders. I love the 1980s and this movie too. With little fixing, it could have been "received with great reviews". Unfortunately, the matter of mixed reviews this round was a prove of wrong; it mirrored something uneven about it. But anyway, it's hilarious, thrilling, so sentimental, and a classic in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I ever need cheering up, I watch this movie. One of my favourite comedies.The unlikely pairing of Nick Nolte and Martin Short works wonderfully, with Nolte as the hardened ex-con Lucas, unwittingly gets involved in the bumbling bank robbery carried out by Short (Ned Perry). James Earl Jones plays the cop who has been itching to nail Lucas once again and assumes that, once Lucas is taken hostage by Perry, that they are in it together.The first 15-20 minutes contain some pure slapstick which has me crying with laughter every time I see it. It is particularly heartening to see the tough guy Nolte being enchanted by Martin Short's mute 6 year old daughter.Lovely, simple and heartwarming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit funny, a bit emotional feel-good movie. A few scenes are hilarious. It's a remake of a French movie "Les Fugitifs". I've seen the original years ago, as a kid. Watching the remake almost felt like watching the same movie again. Which is not surprising considering that both of the films were directed by Francis Veber, the writer of the movies. The characters were chosen very appropriately. And congrats to both Martin Short and Nick Nolte they both played they roles exactly as they should. If you like this movie you might like others written by Francis Veber. Several of his French movies were remade in United States. I think there is another movie where Pierre Richard was replaced by Martin Short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Three Fugitives" is an action comedy about an ex-con (Nick Nolte) who - on his first day out of prison - is taken hostage by a neurotic father (Martin Short). The two are taken - along with Short's daughter (Sarah Rowland Doroff) - on a long journey full of laughs and excitement.Nick Nolte is probably not the greatest actor for comedies, but he still delivers well. Short is obviously hilarious, as he is most of the time, and Doroff is as good as she could be. James Earl Jones and Alan Ruck also make funny appearances.The only really annoying part about "Three Fugitives" is the constant use of eighties guitar music in the background. That is probably the worst sounding noise in history.Funny family movie (despite a few cuss-words), 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick Up for Martin Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After five years in prison and 14 armed robberies, wavy-haired Nick Nolte (as Daniel Lucas) is out on parole. His cell-mates are going to miss those golden locks. Dressed for success, Mr. Nolte gets a ride to the bank from former arresting officer James Earl Jones (as Dugan). Nolte hopes to open an account with his prison paycheck - he earned 25 cents an hour working in the laundry. While opening his account, Nolte is taken hostage by bumbling bank robber Martin Short (as Ned Perry). The men become unlikely partners because police think Nolte must be the mastermind...Mr. Short planned the heist to get money for his mute daughter Sarah Rowland Doroff (as Meg). She hasn't spoken since the death of her mother. The plot follows writer-director Francis Veber's original French-language version, "Les fugitifs" (1986). This is the one area where "Three Fugitives" could have been made more distinctive. The little girl is amazingly cute and adds a high level humanity to the co-stars, but that could have been handled in other ways. Imagine the little girl as a sassy young teenager revealed to have prompted papa to hold up the bank - inadvertently, of course...Another suggestion would have been to add some make-up and more womanly features to Short's disguise when he and Nolte are posing as husband and wife. This is something a teenage daughter could have helped with. Still, Martin Short is a very, very funny fellow and Mr. Veber directs everyone well. Finally, "Three Fugitives" gives supporting actor Kenneth McMillan (as Doctor Horvath) a great last role. His first appearance was on the fantastical TV serial "Dark Shadows" as a sailor frightened by the arrival of Leviathans. Always an asset, he's an old veterinarian, herein.******* Three Fugitives (1/27/89) Francis Veber ~ Martin Short, Nick Nolte, Kenneth McMillan, James Earl Jones</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out hilarious, then goes downhill, then gets funny again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a while back, and it wasnt the best I ever saw, but it was descent. Martin Short was hilarious, especially when he had to dress up as a pregnant woman, and his slapstick comedy during the stick up. The only thing that gets in the way is that little girl, who made it more of a drama than a comedy. Anyway the cast is great, James Earl Jones, Alan Ruck, Kenneth MacMillan(Cat's Eye, Armed and Dangerous), Bruce McGill(Animal House, My Cousis Vinny), and watch out for Larry Miller(Pretty Woman, Nutty Professer) in a tiny role as a police officer. All in all it's a pretty good, but eneven film. 6 out 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god. Isn't she the cutest thing you've ever seen? Meg is possible the only reason for someone to enjoy the movie - and Alan Ruck comes in second. I bet you'll grab a tissue and start crying when she says: "Don't go." I'm sure I almost did. I enjoyed it. Period. And I did laugh. My favorite scene is where the doctor has to explain what happened, you know, at the police station. It made me smile as much as Tener ( Alan Ruck ) and Dugan ( James Earl Jones ) did at that moment.And finally, does anybody understand the end? I don't. I guess this is a mystery, maybe revealing a sequel? Well, if you feel there's nothing to do than sit in your sofa and stare at the walls, pop in "Three Fugitives" and enjoy one of those few moments of laughter and crying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie filmed nearby where I live that is actually better than it seems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of Martin Short. Because of this, I did not wish to watch The Three Fugitives when it came on TV, but I was bored, and also a little curious about it. It seems that parts of this movie were filmed in TACOMA WASHINGTON, a "no-where" place that is close to where I live. I was hoping to see if I could recognize a few places.Well, it turns out I didn't recognize anything. Was this REALLY filmed in Tacoma? It's not that big of a town. What the movie lacked in er, recognizable footage, it made up for in a semi-entertaining comedic story of two men and one little girl on the run from the law.Nick Nolte plays the "worst" of the fugitives, being that he actually is on the run from prison. After Nolte runs into Short during a robbing attempt, he takes him under his wing...sort of a "Bonnie and Clyde" type story. Well, Bonnie and Clyde had another fellow (C.W. Moss) to accompany them, and it turns out that these two fugitives find assistance in Short's daughter, a distraught child who does not speak, but does take a liking to Nolte. Together the three of them embark on a series of mad-cap adventures while running from a law team of James Earl Jones and Alan Ruck.Some of the adventures that occur throughout the film are rather slap-sticky and silly, and I am not too fond of the end or of Short's work, but this actually isn't the worst of films. No, it's not a masterpiece, but it does kill the time. You can also get introduced to a not-too-fascinating Washington town, if you have really sharp eyes. What a thrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't say this is a perfect movie, but I liked it. It was funny, enjoyable and well-performed. One or two moments may drag and the sentimentality is not quite kept at bay, but overall I really liked Three Fugitives.Three Fugitives is beautiful to look at certainly, the sumptuous cinematography and beautiful scenery really gives the film a lovely look to it. The music is good too, as is the direction. The script is very funny and quotable and the story is believable with good action, while the pacing on the whole is secure enough. The acting also helps elevate, Nick Nolte and Martin Short's chemistry mayn't be an immediate classic, but it is believable and both men do really well in their roles especially Short who has plenty of slapstick laughs. And it was a delight to see James Earl Jones again, a great actor with a wonderful, dignified presence and rarely disappoints in his films and this is no exception.In conclusion, an enjoyable film and worth watching at least once. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

The scene in the warehouse where Nick Nolte passes out and Meg rests on his shoulder is particularly memorable.Martin Short and Nick Nolte make a surprisingly hilarious pairing. There are so many funny scenes and quotes from this movie. Martin Short's slapstick, falling over and being a loser will have you laughing throughout the movie.

		<fullReview>This is as 80's as it gets. One of my childhood movies that I (obviously) grew up with, and it's always been there. It's like one of those things your mom tells you when you grow up, you carry it with you constantly. This one is up there with "Tango &amp; Cash", "Adventures In Babysitting", "Back To The Future", "Willow", "Roxanne", "The Princess Bride", and all the other great flicks from the late 80's.In this remake of a French movie from 1986, Nick Nolte is released from prison, goes to a bank which Martin Short is robbing. At least he tries to rob it, everything goes down the drain and he takes Nolte hostage, and of course the cops think Nolte is the robber.As I said, this is one of movies I grew up with and you always love your childhood movies, even though they might suck. And this movie really does suck. It's not nearly as good as the French predecessor, but I love it anyway. I can't help it. Sure, it's silly. It's laughable. It's way too sentimental. It's even pathetic at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>nice date movie, romantic and a bit of action. Nolte is a confident alter-protagonist but if you are having a really good time you wont miss anything if your attention wanders elsewhere. Short should have been given more comedy bits but the movie moves along nicely - great character actors. Nolte plays the 'good buy' against all of his ex-con instincts. The scene stealer is the little girl - a daughter of Martin Short. The most fun is watching to see how the bumbler Short and the hardened ex-con, Nolte get into problems and then have to get out of their problems - usually with the police and usually with the possibility of many years in jail if they fail to 'get away.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable comedy that becomes too sentimental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucas (Nolte) is released from prison and makes his way to a bank to deposit a cheque. Once inside he finds himself drawn into an armed robbery by Perry (Short) who needs money to care for his daughter. Naturally the police doubt that Lucas is an innocent bystander and pursue both men for the crime.This is a reasonable comedy, and that's about the nicest you can say. It veers from moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity to moments that are overly sentimental and sugary that make you want to cringe. The plot is quite interesting although you know roughly what's going to happen with the mix-matched trio - the instant Short tells Nolte that his daughter hasn't spoken for 2 years you know what's going to regarding that. The detail of the story is less predictable and often brings funny moments but you never for one minute think to yourself "wow - how's this great story going to end?" You never think that this is going to end in a huge shoot out in which everyone dies - you know it's going to be happy.Nolte is good, playing his tough guy role well and his warming towards the daughter is quite believable. Short is a manic clown and it's a role is good at as he does it so often. Doroff (Meg) is quite good for a child and she is made to look bad by all her scenes being horribly sentimental and sweet or, when she isn't speaking and just stares, she is looks like the children of the corn. Smaller roles held by people like James Earl Jones, Alan Ruck and Bruce McGill are all good, and add interest by seeing well known faces.Overall the film has some very funny situations but they are vastly outnumbered by scenes of such saccharine that it's far too sickly sweet for it's own good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Really Funny Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not destined to become a cinema classic, but it does provide a lot of laughter and fun throughout. In fact, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. While the plot is somewhat predictable, the laughs keep coming (and the mushy, feel-good stuff is kept to an absolute minimum, but provides an anchor to the plotline). Nolte and Short play off of each other admirably; so well, in fact, that it is amazing the two never made a sequel, or at least co-starred in another film. As noted, if you like to laugh, and like your humor clean (a real rarity these days), this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a few days ago I watched Les Fugitivfs (1986) on TV again, after having seen it already at the cinema when it was originally released around here in the late 80s. Today I happened to view the American version for the first time, and I noticed they didn't only follow the original plot, but also made use even of the original screenplay - yet without being able to get across the charming atmosphere, romance and suspense of the French original. However, it still is a routinely played and entertaining little comedy, but if you are into that kind of movies or if you liked this one, I really recommend to watch out for the original with Gérard Depardieu and Pierre Richard!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, seems that everyone was on a HUGE Francis Veber kick after his "Three Men and a Cradle" got the Yank treatment with Ted Danson, Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg. Well, then the suits got a bright idea: why not remake EVERY LAST SINGLE ONE of Veber's movies as an American comedy?Not so bright, it seems, since "Three Fugitives" was included in the package. I am a great fan of Martin Short; he is a great comedian and has proved it time and again. Just not here; he basically plays a clumsily doting father who turns to a life of crime to help care for his daughter (Doroff). Meantime, recently released con Nolte finds himself "kidnapped" by Short during a botched bank robbery (admittedly, the film's high point). And from that moment on, it's all one long, dreary, boring, exhaustive slog of a chase movie/road movie/odd couple-buddy movie/movie-of-the-week movie and over-baked slapstick movie that has an ending that should have ended before it began.Maybe in a different movie, Nolte and Short would have had better chemistry; here, they just seem like a big, gruff bully (Nolte) forced to tag along with a small, annoying klutz (Short) and his mute, cloyingly cute daughter (Doroff). Not exactly the makings for a classic comedy.Then again, they worship Jerry Lewis over in France, too.Two stars for "Three Fugitives". One for the bank holdup scene and another for a scene near the end where Short, in drag, has to fake birthing labor with his daughter's teddy bear under his dress so that he and Nolte can avoid the cops.Would have made a GREAT short subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The three fugtiives..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one of those excellent comedy movies to come out which keeps you laughing..As the story goes, Nick Nolte is the convict just released from prison, (Alcatraz?) and he jokes that he is out to rob a bank to the cop releasing him.. When he goes to the bank to encash his jail pay cheque, he is swung into a robbery..Martin Short is the bank robber who is too short to even pass the bag across the counter. With the public trying their best to help him with the robbery, he manages to push the bag across the counter. The cashier in turn gives him a few hundred dollars all in 1 dollar notes... (It's actually a funny scene to watch right from the bank robbery to the the car crash) However by this time the cops are all around the bank, and Martin needs a hostage.. He sees Nick as the ideal hostage after shooting him. The cops think it is Nick who is the bank robber even with Martin putting the gun on Nick's head/ Martin slowly realises that the cops think that Nick is the bank robber and passes the gun along to Nick.Anyway they escape from the bank and are involved in a car crash (with the bomb intact) As Martin takes Nick to a veterinary doctor and the doctor seems to see all humans as dogs.. (Poor doggie) The doctor helps along with Martin's daughter(Sarah Rowland Doroff a sweet little thing and the third fugitive) However even though he tries to shoo away the kid left to look after Nick, he is emotionally blackmailed to help her out. The scenes where she follows Nick down the basement are very touching.. And she starts speaking because she is attached to Nick.. This means that no money is required for treating her in the first place. (The reason Martin tried to steal from the bank) Finally Nick takes the responsibility of getting them across the country to Canada.. How they get across the border and by making Martin a pregnant woman is the rest of the movie.Nick Nolte as theex convict taking up the job of a Locksmith is pretty innovative. Convenient for the story at least..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most films will stay with you for some time after you've watched them. This can, of course, be a good or a bad thing depending on the quality of the movie and your opinion of it. In many ways, making a movie that leaves the viewer completely detached and uninvolved is almost an achievement in itself and if that was writer/director Francis Veber's objective then I'm happy to say that "Three Fugitives" is a unparallelled success. Being a horrible misfit of crime thriller, action comedy and emotional tearjerker, "Three Fugitives" spends its entire duration going absolutely nowhere.Nick Nolte plays hardened career criminal Lucas who is released from jail after a five-year stretch for his fourteenth armed robbery. On his first day back in society, Lucas is caught up in a bank robbery of someone else's design, namely bumbling nerd Ned (Martin Short). When the police, led by Lucas's nemesis Dugan (James Earl Jones), turn up, they naturally assume that Lucas is responsible and the pair of them escape in the ensuing confusion. Slowly, the two build up a unique partnership that is focused on Ned's traumatised daughter, Meg (Sarah Rowland Doroff).A movie such as this hinges on the relationship between the two leads and personally, I felt that Nolte and Short were not a good combination. Nolte is too restrained for Short's wild physical humour and aside from a few smirks here and there, the comedy felt forced and not particularly funny. Doroff is good but she has nothing to do besides look cute and in my opinion, Jennifer Love Hewitt does that better than anyone else. The whole film feels stuck, endlessly chasing the initial premise around and around until you hardly remember what the point of the film was. It sags badly after the first 45 minutes or so and it never regains its opening promise. It is also badly edited - even someone like me (who rarely spots continuity errors and such) spotted a whole host of mistakes and plot holes that really should have been dealt with before being released."Three Fugitives" starts out promising but all too quickly runs out of steam and then surrenders. It never gets out of second gear and the whole thing never engages or stimulates the viewer. It is a celluloid sedative, stretching out every minute of its duration. It isn't the worst movie ever made but a lot of viewers will not enjoy a film that never makes up its mind what it wants to be and spends 90-odd minutes being nothing. A handful of people may get something from this but this is a quiet little movie, barely noticeable on the CVs of Short or Nolte (who looks remarkably young in this!) and not worth the effort. Sorry but this is one movie that I will not be pursuing in future, unless I wanted to go to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you haven't seen the original French version you still feel slightly uneasy watching this remake, aware subconsciously of the great rift between the script and the finished product. Usually in a case like this you can blame the director but the credits say written and directed by Francis Veber and it's the SAME Francis Veber who wrote and directed the original French version 'Les Fugitifs' and he's been remarkably faithful to his own script so the answer has to be what he had to work with. It's a thankless task being asked to cover Gerard Depardieu, who created the role of Lucas and is one of the greatest film actors currently working with as range as broad as himself and Nick Nolte comes about as close as Eddie Murphy. Martin Short has apparently made a score of movies all of which have eluded me and which judging from the titles seem to have been pitched at a cross between an iguana and an old tennis shoe. Far better in the role would have been Pierre Richard (who played opposite Depardieu) look-alike Gene Wilder, albeit slightly too old for the role. This is one for comparison shoppers only, luckily the original is available on dvd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has to be up there as one of the best ever made. Nick Nolte and Martin Short put in some magnificent performances to make it all the more enjoyable. Oh, and there's James Earl Jones who also brightens up the picture. Now, I must say, it starts very funny. You know, the robbery and all that, but then you kind of feel sorry for the guy. The girl and her problem and how much he cares for her. So that's the sad bit, and we sort of forget the light-hearted introduction. But who cares? It's still really enjoyable but the bad language at times is inappropriate. This should have been made to be more suitable for younger audiences. You know, the family kind of film. Nonetheless, a magnificent film executed to perfection and you know what, is a trillion zillion killion billion miles ahead of most crap that comes out in the cinema today. Other thing is that its sad people like Martin Short don't get more prominent parts in more major pictures. Let's say that he is much better and I mean much better than many of the supposedly top actors these days.</fullReview>

Short is really trying to get money for the treatment of his young daughter who has not spoken after her mother's death. Thus the three try to stay away from the authorities with sometimes hilarious results. The little pinch of drama does hurt the film though and at times the film is just a little too dark to work. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

Newly released con Nick Nolte walks into a bank being held up by Martin Short and then it`s non existent laughs all the way . The problem is director Francis Veber treats the film as high farce rather than comedy which means it all ends up being silly rather the funny , most of the cast are OTT except mainly Nick Nolte who plays the straight man but even he hams it when he`s called on to be funny The only funny bit is where Nolte gets into a fight with cops which is life imitating art rather humour</fullReview>
