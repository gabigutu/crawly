		<shortDescription>A comedy of errors and good intentions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie that breezes by while you're squirming over how good intentions can, and sometimes will, go awry. While the cast is limited, it by no means is limiting. The plot is deceivingly confusing and, while you think you're on top of it, it challenges you till the end. I recommend it in the original version with sub-titles because that's part of its charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD release : End of June 2005 (Norway)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Norwegian movie called "Hodet Over Vannet" from 1993 is one the best Norwegian movies ever made and the movie was also popular in United States that Hollywood made an own American version "Head Above Water" in 1996. The movie was the first movie to the huge Norwegian sing star Morten Abel and he made also the movie title song. The song "Hodet Over Vannet" is a real popular music hit in Norway and are still often playing on radio. The actress (Lene) who playing in this movie have also playing a huge popular role in the largest Norwegian soap TV series "Hotel C?sar" where she played from 2000 to 2004. In 2004 Morten Abel played in his second movie "Alt For Egil", a really good Norwegian movie with a lot of singing dialogs with songs, nearly something like a half musical movie. Morten Abel made most of the music and songs to that movie too. The DVD version of "Alt For Egil" released in April 2005. "Hodet Over Vannet" released on DVD from the end of June 2005.Both DVDs should have subtitles in English for the DVD market in Europe and maybe United States too. Check out the DVD net shops from Norway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, "Hodet over vannet", has later been remade in the Hollywood-version "Head Above Waters". Usually, originals tend to be better than remakes. From what I heard, that is exactly the case with this one. I wish I could confirm just that, but I can't since I haven't seen the Hollywood version. Now, back to this movie. Norwegian movies tend to stink big time, but this is an exception to that. The story is really good, and there are lots of surprises as it proceeds. The surroundings is south Norway in the summer, and it really fits to the movie and the plot. The especially interesting part about the plot, is that you never really know who's the bad guy, if there's any bad guy at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original Head Above Water, 100% pure Norwegian!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People went crazy in '96 when Head Above Water hit the movies in the us. Not so many people know, but it's actually "Hodet Over Vannet" that came before the English version. One of the best norwegian movies ever made. If you speak English, and have seen this version, and liked it, I surly recommend "De d?des tjern" as well. It's from the 60, and are definitely one of norways tresures as well:) One of the things I also like; Is that my all time fave norwegian singer Morten Abel is acting in it. He might be best known from the pop group The September When, but he also has a huge acting talent. He also sings the title song, whitch is an all time classic in norwegian music, I think:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another one robbed by Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes... what is that? More than the concept of "remake", remakes are a way to make "easy money" and, of course, a way to overshadow the originals and cover their true identity. In the end, we think the Americans are so great and original when they lack ideas and originality, remaking the others's works instead and claiming as theirs. If before knowing that the remake was a remake it seemed alright, in comparison it pales.I don't know more norwegian movies, even though Norway is a gorgeous country. But this moment of glory in norwegian cinema is one to be treasured.Hollywood, beware: this norwegian is a lesson in originality and how to make a movie as it should be. There is a lot to be appreciated. The story is unlike anything else, the norwegian cinematography is stunning, the film is intriguing, the acting by the actors is authentic and the film-making is a good school of film-making.Lene Elise Bergum is a lot more serious than the funnier Cameron Diaz, but it's the norwegian actress who is superior (and far more authentic). Although Cameron Diaz was still beautiful and hot back then, Lene is hotter because of the several nudity scenes.Svein Roger Karlsen is phenomenal as the judge. Every weird behavior of his character seems so authentic that it only means that the actor is awesome. Morten Abel and Reidar S?rensen have good performances too, but they're in a different league because their roles are much simpler.This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Norwegian masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one great movie, I can't believe they keep this pearl hidden like this. My knowledge on norwegian cinema is as empty as the Dead Sea, but this one is awesome.What makes this movie so great? A lot of things. The plot is as intriguing as it is original and unusual. The norwegian settings are beautiful. There is tension, intensity, suspense and black, morbid humor. It's a very crazy movie and its craziness is a key reason why I like it so much. I like crazy movies and this is by far one of the craziest I know. Film-making, direction and picture quality are first class. The actors are terrific. Nothing or almost nothing is over the top, even though the character Einar does some truly disturbing (even shocking) things.Lene Elise Bergum is super as Lene. She is so believable that when she is seized by panic, it looks as if she's gonna collapse. And she's one of the hottest people I've ever seen in a movie.Svein Roger Karlsen is phenomenal as Einar. He convinces to the point of, more than portraying the character, seeming as if he *becomes* him. His facial expressions are priceless. He is completely crazy, enigmatic, ironic, hilarious and creepy and sinister when he's supposed to. This guy is like a norwegian Jack Nicholson and Peter Lorre.Morten Abel makes a great Bj?rn. Reidar S?rensen is as intense in his acting as his character Gaute is (in other words, a beautiful acting).As expected, I have to say this: this movie had an American remake (itself not much better known than the original). The remake closely follows the original's plot and they are indeed very similar but obviously differ in details and the remake is more americanized. The remake seemed fine before but that was before I found out there is an original and compared them. The original triumphs beyond any doubt.In comparison, the original is "truer", darker in some ways and more "humble" in others, has more beautiful scenario, infinitely better acting from the actors and avoids the laughable faults detected in the remake. Some things in the remake are over the top (for example, the chainsaw scene - PLEASE!!!) - of which the original is void of.Lene Elise Bergum is phenomenal, easily a lot more convincing than Cameron Diaz. Lene is so much more intense. Harvey Keitel tries the best he can, but he just isn't in the same league as Svein Roger Karlsen. Craig Sheffer was enjoyable, but then again Morten Abel is better. Billy Zane is boring, which Reidar S?rensen never is.Don't know the title in Portugal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly, the American remake was better. This one's not funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the American remake ("Head Above Water") when it was released in 1996. It was a true comedy of errors - full of laughs and funny gags. Having now watched the original Norwegian film on video, I'm quite disappointed. It's not much more than a mediocre suspense/thriller film. Had I not seen the American remake, I wouldn't have believed that this could be a comedy at all.I'm not sure what made the difference. It surely wasn't the subtitles, which I much prefer over dubbing. Furthermore, I'm not used to hearing Norwegian, but it wasn't an issue either, in fact, I loved the way it sounds.What else? The plot and script. Nine years have passed by since I saw the remake, but it seems both films are very similar, so it must have something to do with acting I guess. Cameron Diaz is not much of a comedian, but she was still funnier than Lene Elise Bergum. Nevertheless, the latter did frequently display a couple of other positive traits, so I have no regrets she was in the film. The rest of the cast were also sufficient, yet ill-inspired. Svein Roger Karlsen as the husband was sub-par. He was the only one that looked like he was trying to act in a comedy, but it didn't work out too well (never brought a smile to my face). Morten Abel as the friend was rather bland and Reidar S?rensen as the ex-boyfriend was just as annoying as his character should have been (which is good).All in all, if you haven't seen either film - skip this one. The remake is definitely better.Prog.</fullReview>
