		<shortDescription>Black comedies don't get much better than this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get this plot line: married couple Keitel and Diaz are on vacation (honeymoon, maybe, can't remember), on a small island. Their only neighbor is Sheffer, a friend of Diaz. Along comes Zane, as Diaz's ex-lover. He talks Diaz into letting him stay the night. The next morning when Diaz goes to check on him, he's dead. Cause of death is, appearantly, a heart attack. At that same moment Keitel and Sheffer are arriving on shore. She tries to hide the body, but Keitel stumbles onto it (literally). Did I mention that Keitel is a judge? He believes that the only solutions would be to dispose of the body, or possibly be charged with murder. At that point the question arises about his death. Could it have been murder? If so, let's look at the suspects. Diaz obviously didn't kill him, so that leaves the other two. Is it Keitel, the possibly jealous husband, or Sheffer? This plot has "potential" written all over it.Head Above Water is a remarkable black comedy with great performances and a great script that keeps you guessing. Just when you think you've found the killer, along comes some new evidence to point you in another direction. It plays great as both a Mystery and a Comedy, although the comedy is quite subtle. Anyone with a taste for mystery and comedy is in for a real surprise. Even if you aren't into those genre's, you'll still enjoy this great film. It would be extremely hard to dislike, because it's just so much fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has got to be one of the greatest movies I ever seen. This is a true work of art. All the movies today are all big budget with their big effects and people are forgetting the most important part of a movie is the story which HEAD ABOVE WATER is very strong in. The characters are great. Keitel is awesome. Diaz is hilarious with her facial expressions. The movie keeps you guessing and laughing all the way through and only gets better as the story unfolds. It has a twist that you never see coming. The writing is great. And another thing I find interesting is how a story with only 3 people in it can hold the attention of the audience. That says something great about the writer. HEAD ABOVE WATER is a story and character driven movie that I'd recommend to anyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the performances in this film. Harvey Keitel again proves his tremendous range. Cameron Diaz is a very talented comedic actress and her makeup is very skillfully applied in this film. Billy Zane is again a third wheel (see Dead Calm and Titanic) but this time it's a comedy. The plot twists and turns are great fun to follow. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great thing about this film is that once the usual character-building stuff is out of the way, you will not move an inch and your eyes will only move if you have a widescreen television...Sterling performances from both Harvey Keitell and Cameron Diaz really make this film come alive and as incident after incident fall upon the hapless couple, you feel yourself gripping the chair more and more, your nails getting smaller and smaller, and the enjoyment increasing and increasing.All in all, Head Above Water is a great film, with good (if not at times, erratic) directing, and with superb acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and a bit confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Head Above Water" is underrated. Despite its simplicity, it is a different movie experience. Why? Well, for one thing, there are very few movies with such few number of actors and characters, being Walt Disney's "Old Yeller" one of those rarities. But that's not all. The movie is classified as a macabre comedy but contains lots of suspense and is more of a thriller. Its events almost resemble what happens in the later "What Lies Benneath".Yes, "Head Above Water" has its moments of comedy. Some are light comedy, but most of them are black humor. People should beware of this. And it's not too much to remind that this movie can be shocking at times and also deals with very serious stuff, such as fear, panic, horror, sadism, violence and death. Nevertheless, it is very far from being a movie of extremes like "A Clockwork Orange" is and is certainly way more comfortable and pleasant to watch, but it can be a disturbing film.Speaking of the moments of comedy, one of the most hilarious is when George gets in the house, closes the door and has a tantrum attack, cursing what's happening to him. But the funniest moments come, in majority, from Lance and Nathalie. I also like very much the way how Lance makes George and Nathalie have a bad time while trying to get rid of Kent's body (without Lance knowing) and the part when Nathalie throws Lance to the water, followed by Nathalie swimming. That's when one of the movie's hottest scenes happen: she gives Lance a love kiss under the water. Later, when Lance asks «What was that today? Us, under the water?», it's funny how she replies «Old times» and then he replies almost laughing «Old times? I don't remember that part».Where "Head Above Water" takes place is unknown. But I've got to tell this: that is a beautiful island which can only be reached by boat. It has a very relaxing and beautiful atmosphere, surrounded only by the infinitive sea and the island's natural beauty. Not to mention that the house of this movie is humble and nice. It really makes one wanna spend holidays in such a wonderful place.As for the characters, Lance is an interesting, humorous and friendly character. But I also admire his pacific spirit and his capacity to hide his emotions and feelings. He's secretly in love with Nathalie, but he knows that she's a married woman, so he wouldn't cross that line. Craig Sheffer portrays very well this character.Nathalie is a loving and beautiful woman. I love her funny facial expressions and her smile. But she's also an extremely depressed and frightened woman. It's impossible not to feel sorry for her. This is by far one of Cameron Diaz's finest performances. This was before she got really famous. Back then she seemed to be a better actress and used to play better movie roles. Anyway, here she is just as good as in "The Mask". And boy, she looks equally gorgeous in this film! Those blue eyes, that pretty hair, those long and sexy legs and a smile to die for... wow!George, on the other hand, seems to be a nice guy at first, but as the movie runs he slowly reveals being a psychopath. Despite being a judge, his sadism grows stronger as the movie runs. Nevertheless, Harvey Keitel is great in this film. For me, he has never been this good, before or after.As for Kent, he's a cool character, but also a very depressed one with an alcohol problem and a heart's weakness. Billy Zane's performance as Kent is good, but with a slight problem: sometimes it's difficult to understand what is he saying. Also, he seems to "chew" his words sometimes.This movie has one of the strongest plots of all time. The story is strong, thrilling, dramatic, simple yet completely unpredictable, complex and confusing. The mystery of Kent's death is present practically all over the movie. While undeniably confusing, the conclusion I get is that George knew that Kent sent the postcard, knew he was coming and put it on Lance's mailbox to frame him. He also does that to avoid Nathalie from knowing the truth and, knowing he was coming, he plans secretly (and successfully) Kent's death. Both Lance and Nathalie become innocent victims of George's macabre scheme."Head Above Water" is in general carefully made, with lots of attention to detail. While it has lots of solid arguments, its soundtrack is nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diaz Strikes Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly suprised with this movie, because I didn't expect it to be GREAT. But it was, the film is smart, sexy, funny and thrilling. You'll love Cameron Diaz and the storyline is marvellous. Black comedies don't get much better than this.Diaz plays Natalie, who is happily married to older-crinkly George (Harvey Keitel). Everything is perfect until Natalie's old boyfriend (Billy Zane) shows up while George is out on a fishing trip. As if sleeping with him isn't bad enough, Natalie finds the guy dead and naked on a table. Who knows what happened? Our Nat's doesn't have time to find out, she must hide the body and look ship-shape before George returns!Unfortunately, Keitel is miscast and should play Natalie's father, and the story sometimes gets silly, but overall, thats the fun of it!My rating : 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty decent dark comedy with the sexy Cameron Diaz that involves a triple love triangle!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Head Above Water" certainly isn't a classic film or anything, yet it's probably worth a watch even though the film is short and the humor is dark and the plot is somewhat weak. The performances from Diaz and Keitel make it worth a view. Cameron Diaz as sexy as ever stars as Nathalie a free spirited young lady who's had a rough past with substance abuse, and supposedly now that her spouse is a judge named George(Harvey Keitel)her problems have washed ashore at their summer beach place. Upon a visit from an ex flame of Nathalie's a young man Kent(Billy Zane)takes an unexpected departure and things only become more complex when nearby friend Lance(Craig Sheffer)rounds out the mix in what is found to be a triple love triangle! Overall nothing great it's just some good and sexy work from Diaz in one of her early works as the plot just unravels to show a slick and messy triple love triangle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad that in the end it all got a bit unbelievable and over the top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love comedies, especially when they are dark like "Head Above Water". I remember seeing this movie for the very first time about five years ago and it had me completely in its power. But in the meantime I've seen so many good movies, that I wondered if this would still be as good as I remembered it to be. The answer is no, not completely. Yes, it is still a very nice movie, but not as great as some other dark comedies that I've seen in the recent past.Nathalie has recently been married to George, a prominent judge who she met when she had to stand trial. They now have taken a holiday in Nathalie's idyllic summerhouse in the middle of nowhere and the only person in the neighborhood is Nathalie's old friend and neighbor Lance, who joins them. When George and Lance go on a fishing trip, Nathalie's former lover turns up. He has a couple of drinks and then falls asleep in Nathalies bed ... naked. When George and Lance suddenly come back home, Nathalie panics. She tries to wake Lance up, but he's dead and the only idea she can come up with is hiding his body under the floor board, where he will soon be discovered...Despite or perhaps thanks to the small cast, you'll see some fine acting. Harvey Keitel is a good actor and he does a nice job playing the judge who goes crazy. Cameron Diaz is also enjoyable as Nathalie, the woman with more troubles around her head than she can cope with. In fact, all actors did a good and convincing job portraying their characters, but it wasn't enough to make this movie a masterpiece. What bothered me most was the fact that it all started to go too far. All the characters had to die in such an unbelievable and over-the-top way, that it spoiled a lot of my fun. Nevertheless I must admit that I enjoyed big parts of the movie and that's why I still give it a 7/10. It's not the best example of a dark comedy, but I've seen worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrived and very average ............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting is pretty good, and seeing Harvey Keitel playing in a dark comedy was a pleasant surprise. What was not so pleasant was the plot. It starts out looking like another attempt to get rid of a dead body, like "Enid is Sleeping" or Drop Dead Sexy". What it winds up being is an overly complicated, convoluted black comedy, that is only marginally successful. Some of the plot contrivances are so unrealistic that they weaken the entire movie. Things like the postcard, a vodka bottle, and most of all a runaway chainsaw are nothing but ludicrous distractions. To top things off we get a completely unnecessary boat explosion as part of the astoundingly unbelievable conclusion. Very average at best. - MERK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too much Weekend at Bernie's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superior court judge George (Harvey Keitel) sentenced Nathalie (Cameron Diaz) to two years probation and then married her. She's happy and brings him to her family's summer island home. Her childhood friend Lance (Craig Sheffer) is the caretaker living in a cabin. Lance takes George on an overnight fishing trip. Nathalie is alone and her ex-boyfriend Kent (Billy Zane) shows up. His girlfriend left him and they spend the day drinking together. The next morning, she wakes up on the couch with the boat coming back. Kent however is dead and naked in the bed. She decides to hide the body and screwball wackiness ensues.I'm not sure why Nathalie has to hide Kent. I'm even less sure why George has to hide Kent. It may be embarrassing but they could have dressed him up and call the cops. He wasn't even there when Kent died. The broken neck is post-mortem. All the moving the dead body around is kind of pointless and is reminiscent of 'Weekend at Bernie's'. They keep making things worst and worst for no good reason. I keep thinking there has to be better ways to do this.The comedic tone doesn't make it funny. This could have been much better darker. It could be Hitchcockian with some better writing. I don't think the screwball comedy works at all. However a dark psychological thriller could work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problems of a romantic triangle on a secluded Maine island</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1996, "Head above Water" is a black/romantic dramedy about a couple living on an island off the coast of Maine (Harvey Keitel and Cameron Diaz) and their grounds keeper (Craig Sheffer). A series of serious problems arise when the girl's ex-boyfriend visits while the guys are on a fishing trip (Billy Zane).This is a generally entertaining farce highlighted by the beauty of both Diaz and the coastal locations. While the plot is simple you have to pay attention or you'll miss various twists where the viewer is led to believe one thing, which is then proved false by further information. I didn't pay attention too well the first time I viewed it and therefore discovered some enlightening elements on my second viewing.BOTTOM LINE: "Head above Water" isn't bad at all, but it's not great either, although it has an interesting subtext (see below). At any rate, it's a must for Diaz fans (as well as Keitel and Sheffer) and those who love the Maine coast.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Phippsburg, Maine.GRADE: Borderline B-/C+***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further if you haven't seen the movie)The subtext is obvious: Beautiful women equal death (think Metallica's DEATH MAGNETIC). In the movie Natalie is indirectly the cause of death of all the men, which include: the bad boy (Kent), the fatherly husband (George), her best friend from childhood who's always had a crush on her (Lance), and the policeman at the end seeking to save a damsel in distress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soft Boiled Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why this black comedy doesn't succeed. It's about a couple trying desperately to dispose of a dead body, which is pretty black. Sometimes these things work, as in "Arsenic And Old Lace," and sometimes they project not much more than mindlessness, as in "Weekend At Bernie's." While husband Keitel is off fishing, Cameron Diaz receives a visit at the beach house from an old flame. Nothing happens except that he dies naked in her bed of a heart attack. Keitel arrives home and accidentally breaks the neck of the corpse. Then they discover the boyfriend drank methanol and was poisoned. These developments ought to be funny but instead they sound desperate.Keitel neither looks nor sounds like a prominent judge whose career would be ruined by scandal, even though he envisions the tabloid headlines, "Prominent Judge Breaks Neck of Dead Naked Body." Cameron Diaz is gorgeous. Her eyes look so terribly blue, almost neon, in that sun tanned face perched on that lanky figure. But we're supposed to laugh when it's revealed that Keitel likes to keep his sausages in a cigar box in the refrigerator. The dialog morphs from stunned incredulity to agonized shouting.None of it's very amusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackest of comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Head Above Water is the very blackest of comedies, bordering on black farce. Cameron Diaz is a reformed bad girl, married to Harvey Keitel, the judge who has rescued her as a kind of social project. They are vacationing on his private island: the resident handyman (Craig Sheffer) lives in a shack across the bay. While the judge and the handyman are out fishing, Diaz is visited by Billy Zane, her ex-boyfriend, who is minded to entice her back to her old ways. Then things get complicated.This film is full of unlikely events, but the joy of it is that each unlikely development is entirely reasonable given that it is based on the event which immediately preceded it.The film is suspenseful, very funny, and has great performances from the small cast.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woman Is The Best Way To Go !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one strange movie for sure ! Not bad but so strange ! I just got confused after the first watching : what the hell was that ?! Till I discovered the whole thing in the leisurely second time.Ladies and gentlemen it's all about the woman ! This little inimical prejudicial black comedy is aiming at one point and one point only which's : WOMAN is the root of all evil ! The most wonderful effective way to die ! Or the eternal angel of death on earth who mows the souls of the men Only ! Just look at all the movie's events to catch on the wily hidden meaning : we have that dazzling young Eve (Cameron Diaz looks unbelievably breathtaking) and all of those Adams whom everyone of them is loving her and dealing with her in a different way (a fatherly husband, a lover friend, a repugnant enemy, and an outsider) while she innocently &amp; unintentionally destroys them all ! So the theory of that movie is : we, as all the men, are dying because of the woman for indirect or direct reasons ! Even the poor old policeman at the end, as the fourth and last type of men around her in the movie's fake cosmos, got killed also instead of her ! As she is death itself !! So you'll find out about why it's an island (as an epitome of the world) and how any male got involved with the only woman there would meet his end (like it's heaven again yet with Eve as the devil !). Although the ways of deaths seemed so absurd but if you scrutinize a bit you'd detect that it all happened because of her, or because of the idiocy of men in front of her ! Therefore they were absurd indeed yet as the good sarcasm of those foolish males whom their only sin was loving, caring, helping out one female ! So, (Head Above Water)'s point of view is "The female is the most operative bane for the men as she has been created for cutting their heads off perfectly" ! It had been expressed here so powerfully but when it comes to reality I've never been convinced because whenever there is a beautiful woman, at least like (Diaz), I would give my heart &amp; head gladly !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the type of movie that if you don't try to take it too seriously, you will really enjoy it. Since there is literally just four characters in this film (some around longer than others, but I won't spoil the fun), it could be very possible to tire of them, but fortunately they're played by very engaging and appealing actors. The story is basically a hide-the-body black comedy, but there are some nice surprises such as a very peculiar, but enjoyable, performance from Harvey Keitel and some very funny scenes bordering on slapstick. Cameron Diaz is luminous as always, and the wonderful Maine island setting is just as beautiful to behold. Check it out!</fullReview>

I saw Head Above Water at the local video rental place and decided to give old Cameron another shot. The plot seemed sketchy but I rented it nevertheless. The action and suspense was eased into which I thought was a very good idea, one that should be taken note of by other black comedy/murder scandal type films. The chemistry between Diaz and Keitel was awkward but understandable. The course of the movie panned out rather well. Keitel was at times slightly low-key, but Diaz remained very watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decent dark comedy that starred Cameron Diaz post-"The Mask" and pre-major-stardom. It's got some funny scenes and okay moments, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it other than if you're a huge fan of any of the actors or if it's on TV.3/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>14-carat Turkey...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turgid dialogue, feeble characterization - Harvey Keitel a judge? He plays more like an off-duty hitman - and a tension-free plot conspire to make one of the unfunniest films of all time. You feel sorry for the cast as they try to extract comedy from a dire and lifeless script. Avoid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect example of 'Author's Will'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The next time you are at a party and someone asks, "The other day I heard the expression 'Author's will'. Does anyone know what it means?" Tell them to sit through 'Head Above Water'. The only way Diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. However the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A farce in more ways than one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. Avoid, it's obviously a style of film that Americans haven't really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible remake of great Norwegian film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a massive Yawn proving that Americans haven't got the hang of farce. Even when it has already been written for them! The original film "Hodet Over Vannet" is a witty comedy of errors that I would rate 8/10. It isn't just about a linguistic translation, but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely, robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap "oops there go my trousers" style of farce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was a bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery. It fails badly at both. The only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie. The only comedy is the laugh I got when I saw how high the readers here ranked it. Could there be two movies with the same name? The movie I saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that wasn't there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harvey Keitel takes a dive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luckily for three years I'd escaped any hint of the existence of this so-called "black comedy." But my luck ran out tonight when I saw a brief description in my satellite TV magazine highlighting Harvey Keitel's starring role.That hooked me because I've never seen a Keitel performance that wasn't interesting at worst and occasionally brilliant. But here he is by turns wooden and grotesque. The whole movie turns quickly into an unmitigated disaster. Despite frenetic pacing and wild, off-the-wall plot twists, it manages to convert all this energy into total boredom. Even the gorgeous coast of Maine comes off bland.This is no who-dunnit. It's a who-the-Hell-cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irrealistic plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while. All the action is in the end, but you won't have to laugh because the movie is funny, but because the story is pathetic.The funniest part is when Harvey 'I'm not Paranoia' Keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre. Oscars for this guy!</fullReview>
