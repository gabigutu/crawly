		<fullReview>Quite simply the funniest and shiniest film-comedy of all time... it's certainly on my personal top-ten list. This one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale. Millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged 'child' who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day he and his personal butler, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman's and run into petty larcenist, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. There are hilarious set pieces aplenty. In one such scene, Arthur (drunk throughout most of the story) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human 'siren' ("My husband has a gun!!!!). Performances by everyone involved should be duly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's loving-yet-ruthless grandmother, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll-isms (He took home the Oscar for this one), and Christopher Cross provides the Main Theme song (Oscar winner "Best That You Can Do"). It's a shame the late Dudley Moore passed away last month (March 2002).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The laughs never get old.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning of this movie it seems apparent that the role of Arthur was meant to be played by a much younger actor. By the end, it's clear that nobody other than Dudley Moore could have done it so well. Looking back, one remembers the sappy Christopher Cross theme song (does anyone remember Christopher Cross?) and oh-so-80's clothing and sets with an unavoidable nostalgia. But the triumvirate of Moore as Arthur, Liza Minnelli as Linda, and Sir Johnny G as the butler Hobson, dripping with sarcasm and at the pinnacle of his considerable talent, make this more than a throw-away farce.All the best lines belong to Gielgud, and the Academy Award was hardly adequate for such a legendary performance. Moore's lovable drunk would wear thin in later years, but here it is a fresh and delightful tour de force in the most politically incorrect way. Liza is flawless, but one hates to see her in a non-musical role, for fear of squandering such an immense talent. But the chemistry, the synergy between these legends is palpable. The laughs never get old. It is, however, a tragedy that the DVD is not available in cinematic aspect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a Charmer a Quarter Century Later Especially for the Well-Missed Talents of Moore and Gielgud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Sadly, Gordon, only in his early forties, died soon after completing this, his only feature film. It's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character-driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. It plays almost like a 1930's-style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. The plot centers on Arthur Bach, a drunken, diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring Susan Johnson, an heiress handpicked by his old-money father and dotty grandmother. Of course, he doesn't love her and by chance, runs into Linda Marolla, a working-class waitress (and of course, aspiring actress) after she pilfers a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father.The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by Moore. That he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to Gielgud's feisty, acidic turn as Hobson, Arthur's devoted but reality-grounded valet. It's the type of role he could play in his sleep, but Gielgud makes Hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. In probably her most likable film role, Liza Minnelli hands the picture to her male co-stars by toning down her usual razzle-dazzle personality and making Linda quite genuine in motivation.A pre-"LA Law" Jill Eikenberry plays Susan just at the right passive-aggressive note, while Barney Martin (Jerry's dad on "Seinfeld") steals all his scenes as Linda's slovenly father Ralph. The one fly in the ointment is veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. And I have to admit that I still can't stand the very dated, overplayed Christopher Cross song that inevitably won the Oscar for that year's best song. Unfortunately, the 1997 DVD, certainly in need of remastering, has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delightful movie. Side splitting laughs at times, heart warming at others. Sir John Gielgud is wonderfully funny and poignant as Hobson, Arthur's butler. My favorite scene is where he goes to Liza Minnelli's house to talk to her, you really sympathize for him and her. Memorable song "The best that you can do", and unforgettable characters make this a feel-good memorable movie. Definitely on my Top 30 of all time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Funniest Films Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's begin with that theme song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you get caught between the moon and New York City." It's a great theme and song even after all these years, it never gets tiring. It really is a great song about New York City as well. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore CBE stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to Jill Eikenberry's character in the film. Jill would later star on LA Law. Anyway, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM who won an Academy Award for his performance in the film as Best Supporting Actor. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnelli's character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her Oscar winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza doesn't get to sing. She plays a diner waitress. Anyway I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the Bach matriarch of the family who decides the family's fortune. Anyway, she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for Best Supporting Actress. Barney Martin best known as Jerry's dad on Seinfeld plays Liza's dad. He's great too. The movie was well-written, acted, and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dudley Moore Proves he's a Comic Powerhouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood. Moore received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own boss." Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur's acid-tongued butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following the year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to put your finger on this one. Basically I suppose it's a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a (comparatively) poor girl, whom he wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family.It has funny moments, romantic moments, and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes his self-centred character endearing, Liza Minelli is a convincing foil as the the feisty opposite he attracts, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler.It's corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for nearly 3 months at our local fleapit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, many people hate the movie for they feel it glorifies alcoholism and makes light of it. The movie endures for its existential core: the tragedy of Arthur beneath some great humor. The great English actor Gielgud carries this movie on his shoulders without his talents it would have never been this good. Arthur drinks because he has been abandoned by his rich parents who are absorbed in their wealth accumulation and art collecting. Hobson serves as Arthur's surrogate father; I cannot tell you how great the dialog in this movie is, you will be quoting lines from it the rest of your days,"Usually one has to go to a bowling alley to meet a woman of your stature." It is important to see that when Arthur is loved he stops drinking. This occurs after Hobson's death and his marriage to Linda. The film's star has fallen considerably as it has been taken as showing being drunk as funny or making light of alcohol abuse. When you watch the movie again, see it as Arthur seeking the love he was denied by his absent, materialistic parents in the arms of prostitutes with Hobson serving as a paternal figure in absentia. The movie's core is the dynamic between Arthur and Hobson, how the latter gently, but firmly, guides and protects him. He conceals his imminent death from Arthur until the very end, preparing Linda, quite sternly, for the heavy lifting of loving Arthur ahead for her.This is my favorite comedy for many reasons: 1. The best writing of any comedy with non stop witty banter, 2. A great heart that shows love that quietly, without applause, cares and protects a damaged boy in a man's body. Yes, my header is spoken by Burt Johnson, Arthur's future father in law who does not have Hobson's patience for Arthur's flippancy and mockery in the funniest scene in the movie. You will love the movie if you see its linear narrative hidden deeply within the great humor. A dying caregiver full of worry about his surrogate son and what will become of him after his death. Arthur's progression to manhood, when he finds the love he has been searching for he throws off his liquid crutch that deadened the pain of abandonment. Hobson discovers this love when he mocks Linda and Arthur yells at him. Hobson's death is done so well and understated. My favorite scene is where Hobson looks away from Arthur and mumbles,"Arthur, you're a good son." They both are so embarrassed by their love for each other. It is done without full orchestras or string sections. After he dies, Arthur quietly moves a piece upon the chess board, gets up and locks the door behind him. What a moving, artistically brilliant way to delineate the pain and separation that is the death of a loved one.Yes, I consider it the funniest movie ever made. I did not do the humor justice in my review because it has been so calumniated since 1981 I thought I should dispel the misunderstandings of the movie. The great writing starts at the beginning and is solid all the way through to the ending. I have watched this movie sixty or seventy times, returning to it every couple months for thirty-four years. Gielgud never gave a better performance; the dyad between Moore and Gielgud, the understated deep love will endear this classic to you. The writing is on a level you will never see again in your lifetime. There are quotable one-liners that would be the highlight of other entire movies; this movie has hundreds of them. Be warned, this is a classic but the sequel and the remake are dreadful. You will never see protective love shown in such a quiet, moving way. I enjoyed 10, though I do not care for Blake Edward's movies, on the whole; this movie towers above it. My Favorite Comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If alcoholism is a disease then "Arthur"is mocking the afflicted....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A former Oxford Organ Scholar and arguably the stage's greatest ever "Prospero" get together in a movie about a rich drunk.That's showbiz eh?Oh,and it also has the star of one of the best latter - day movie musicals in the third big role.It's called "Arthur" and it's almost thirty years old now.Back in 1981 it was still OK to laugh at drunks,especially rich ones with a nice line dry humour. Now we are more aware of the often tragic consequences of excessive alcohol consumption,Arthur's silly little indiscretions are merely cringe - making,driving his motor car whilst p*ssed out of his mind no longer entertaining but criminal. Mr Dudley Moore,a man like Peter Sellers who actually hated what he had become,was a working - class Essex Boy with the rough edges knocked off by his time at University.He employs an American accent in the same way that Mr Michael Caine does i.e. he barely bothers.He can do the drunk thing standing on his head.Sir John Gielgud,massively disdainful,plays much in the manner of his pal Mr Noel Coward,throwing away bon mots willy - nilly.Miss Liza Minnelli seems permanently amazed and is not convincing as a street - smart resting actress. The film is not helped by an over - familiar plot and stock characters in the supporting roles. I'm sorry,I cannot agree that this is a great comedy,it wasn't great even in 1981. Mr Moore's popularity - fine musician that he was - amazed even himself but when he began to fade he went back to music,his first love,but was never the same talent again. He gives an expert performance in "Arthur"but not an endearing one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALL THE FUN MONEY CAN BUY...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by Steve Gordon. Running time: 97 minutes. Classified PG.It was the quintessential comedy of the decade. It won Sir John Gielgud the Academy Award. It was even featured in VH1's "I Love the 80's." And it looks just as good today as it did upon it's initial release. Arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire (played with enthusiasm and wit by Dudley Moore in an Oscar-nominated performance) who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he's grown accustomed to. While the basic plot is one big cliche, there's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce. Arthur Bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk, but you can't help but like him. Especially when he delivers lines such as, "Don't you wish you were me? I know I do!" He's also a delineation from the archetypical movie hero: unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen, he's not ashamed of being filthy rich. In one scene, a man asks him, "What does it feel like to have all that money?," to which he responds, "It feels great." Moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience. And Gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant, addressing his master with extreme condescension in spite of the fact that his salary depends on him. Arthur is one of those movies that doesn't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional: it just comes naturally. The screenplay -- which also earned a nod from the Academy -- is saturated with authentic laugh-out-loud dialogue. This is the kind of movie that, when together with a bunch of poker buddies, you quote endlessly to one another. It also looks at its characters with sincere empathy. There have been a number of comedies that attempt to dip into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star (including both Grumpy Old Men's), but few can carry it off because we just don't care. When this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler, it actually works, because we genuinely like these people. Why should you see Arthur? The answer is simple: because it's an all-around, non-guilty pleasure. At a period in which films are becoming more and more serious, Arthur reminds us what it feels like to go to the movies and just have a good time.**** - Classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the reckless millionaire Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore) is frequently in the headlines since he is permanently drunk. However he is a warmhearted person raised by his butler Hobson (John Gielgud). When he stumbles with Linda Marolla (Liza Minnelli) in a store, he notes that she is shoplifting a tie and he decides to follow her with Hobson. Arthur helps Linda when the security guard arrests her and they date in the night. They fall in love with each other, but Arthur's father and grandmother want him to marry the also millionaire Susan Johnson (Jill Eikenberry); otherwise they will take his fortune. What will Arthur do?"Arthur" is an overrated romantic comedy from the early 80's. The problem is that there is no worthwhile character or message in the story. Arthur is an alcoholic reckless man. He meets Linda when she is shoplifting in a store. Her father is a greedy man. Hobson is a snobbish man and when he goes to Linda's house, he feels totally uncomfortable. The nicest character is the driver Bitterman. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Arthur, o Milionário Sedutor" ("The Seductive Millionaire")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm, Hilarious Alcoholic Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you consider that Arthur is basically a character study of an eccentric alcoholic and lacks much by way of a third act plot structure, it's a wonderfully successful movie. It's fairly easy to ignore the fact that even at 97 minutes, the film is running on pure charm for more than half that time. Wonderfully performances and a uniquely droll script (in 1939, it wouldn't have seemed unique, but in the past few decades, it has very little competition in its screwball genre) make Arthur well worth returning to.Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore) is a funny alcoholic. As such, we'd hardly care about him. He wouldn't get into the finest restaurants. He wouldn't go on elaborate shopping sprees. And we wouldn't get the girls. However, Arthur is also the heir to a fortune approaching a billion dollars. He's never worked a day in his life and he has two servants, Hobson and Bitterman, who have been with him forever. But his father finally makes an ultimatum -- either Arthur marries the devoted (and rich) Susan Johnson (well pre-LA Law Jill Eikenberry), or he'll be cut off. And wouldn't you know it? This happens just as Arthur is falling in love (perhaps for the very first time) with waitress/aspiring actress Linda (Liza Minnelli). Will Arthur choose the money or the girl? You've seen this kind of movie before, so you know where it's going.Steve Gordon's script is so wonderful that you forget that as a director he's basically standing as far back as possible and letting the cast kick the great dialogue up a notch.Arthur is about Dudley Moore's laugh. It's the first thing we hear and it rings through the whole film. It's a manic uncontrollable thing and probably if your neighbor laughed like that, you'd get sick of him within an hour. For some reason, Moore makes sure that we never get sick of Arthur. We don't get sick of his life of privilege, of his demands, of his embarrassing himself and the people who love him. We don't get sick of his silly rationalizing for his drunken state. And these are remarkable facts. Moore also gets to play the piano (a brilliant skill), fall over things (one of Moore's best), and kiss a horse (no comment required). Moore also has terrific chemistry with Minnelli, who certainly hasn't been better since. Minnelli's character's major flaw is that you never really get the minute she stops liking Arthur for his money and starts loving the man. I don't blame her for that.The first two thirds of the movie, though, completely belong to John Gielgud. One of the three greatest Shakespearean actors of his generation and this is what most filmgoers remember him for. Playing a butler! And yet the amazement of his performance is that you never feel that he's slumming, even when he's sitting in bed wearing a cowboy hat. Beyond just being the moral center of the film, nobody does better service to Gordon's dialogue. Gielgud's Hobson may be quick to tell people off, but you never doubt he cares.As I said earlier, the film doesn't really make it all the way to the end. It's not a spoiler to observe that the ending feels arbitrary and unmotivated. You would also be correct in wondering if this film's depiction of alcoholics is troublingly frivolous, even for a light comedy. But honestly, see how long you're troubled for. I suspect it won't last through Arthur's first dinner date with hooker in stretch pants.This is a 7.5/10, I think. And I'll alert the media.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listen up folks..... If you didn't see this movie in 1981 when you were between the ages of 18 and 25-ish you just won't get it. This is a classic comedy film which at the time was seen multiple times by fans, where dialog lines were repeated amongst friends over and over again. And the song, albeit corny now, worked perfectly in 1981 when Chris Cross- type music was the other norm, after the hair bands of course. It's a sweet, funny fairytale with a sad element involved watching Arthur live loud &amp; inappropriately thru the over indulgence of alcohol. Sad state of affairs even today for some of the unhappy rich. I just watched it again tonight having not seen it in a dozen years or more. I laughed throughout. Dudley Moore was at his comedic best. But John Gielgud steals the show with his lines, said dryly as a proper butler would, but hysterical! He won the Academy Award for his role. This was also one of Liza Minnelli's finest moments. Sad, all but 2 of the main characters are dead today. All the more reason to see this movie for the first time or again. Add it to your library of "Films that Left an Impact on a Generation." And watch it with 1981 eyes, even if you were just a twinkle in your mom's eyes at that time! PS&gt; the 2011 version is NOTHING like the original and it's a disgrace to this film and the memory of all involved that this hack-job of a film even carried the same title.</fullReview>

If Peter Cook (who Moore was said to have based Arthur on) was really like this when he was drunk then i don't why any comedians stay sober!Now, without making unnecessary comparisons to the remake, i thought that considering that Dudley Moore was in his forties when he made this i couldn't deny his decidedly English charm oh and that laugh!

		<fullReview>Dudley Moore was an underrated English actor in his time. They all were underrated. It amazes me how lots of critics preferred the American version of "Death at a funeral" than the English version. And on the whole, the English are better when it comes to humor. Period.Nobody has ever given a genuine drunk performance than Dudley Moore as Arthur. I have just read that Russell Brand is going to star in the remake of this film. As much as we love Russell Brand, I don't think he could do as good of a job as Dudley Moore did. Moore and whoever plays his butler are delightful, and this is a classic motion picture that should not have been touched. Though Brand is perfect, not perfect enough.Moore obviously plays Arthur, a drunk playboy who finds out that his father will stop giving him money unless he marries the girl that he doesn't love. But then he meets Linda(played wonderfully by Liza Manelli) and he considers ditching the money.The acting is delightful. So is the story plot. The relationship that Arthur and Hobson(the butler) is wonderful. This is just truly a wonderful film. Flawless. If you haven't seen it, you must. Before the remake comes out. It's a delightful film on everyone's behalf.Arthur:A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Is Less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about a merry rich drunkard living a consequence-free lifestyle in the Big City may not seem promising entertainment, yet after 20 minutes "Arthur" makes you wish they just left it at that.Instead, you get a long, dreary tale in two parts, one a tragedy of a friendship cut short by death, the other a rom-com between the title character and a perky shoplifter who doesn't mind Arthur's alcoholic foibles given the nine-figure nest egg involved.It all boils down to money. "I wish I had a dime for every dime I have" is how Arthur puts it.As played by Dudley Moore, Arthur alternates between an annoyingly sad drunk and an annoying happy one. Supposedly Moore based his performance on his former comedy partner Peter Cook, a comedy genius who wound up a drunken sot and his own best audience. The first thing we hear in the movie is that braying laugh, which sounds like something which must have drove Moore crazy in a prior life. Now his pain becomes ours.Why was "Arthur" such a big hit? The theme song topped the Billboard pop chart, it took home two Oscars, and there was even a sequel and a remake. God may not love a drunk, but someone apparently did.One Oscar went to John Gielgud as Arthur's butler, Hobson, a font of bitter witticisms. "Usually one must go to a bowling alley to meet a woman of your stature," he tells the new woman in Arthur's life, Linda, played by Liza Minnelli. Yet we are asked to accept Hobson as the voice of human warmth otherwise missing in Arthur's life, mainly by virtue of his getting the big lines.We are supposed to believe Arthur will give up anything and everything to be with Linda. You would think she might be someone who might have something real to pull Arthur from his chemically-induced fog. Instead, Minnelli plays her character way too much like a celebrity cameo, all exaggerated eyeblinks and cutesy asides.Writer-director Steve Gordon seems to have had some darker subtexts he wanted to work in. For example, Arthur expresses a fondness for Soviet communism, and there's a strong sense of evil from the capitalist plutocrats who run Arthur's world. But the most Gordon gins up this way is a contrived situation where Arthur is being pressured to marry a woman whose father is set up as some kind of homicidal tycoon with a criminal reputation. Why would Arthur's ultra-wealthy, hyper-snooty family promote such a union for their fragile son?I guess it's for the same reason Hobson has that chronic cough. We need a story to go with the punchlines. I just wish the punchlines had been better. I enjoy Moore in other roles, and he's a solid-enough improvisational actor that he makes some of Arthur's lighter scenes work here, when he doesn't overplay the tipsiness as he too often does. The main takeaway I got was of him punching well below his weight, and somehow coming up short anyway.People defending "Arthur" say you had to be there. Take it from me, I was there. It wasn't any funnier then than it is today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore) is a care-free drunken millionaire playboy who has no issues in frittering his life and wealth away on prostitutes and alcohol. However, his parents threaten to cut off his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the equally wealthy Susan (Jill Eikenberry). Arthur is initially prepared to go ahead with the marriage (if only to get his inheritance), but complications ensue when he falls in love with everyday waitress Linda Marolla (Liza Minnell).I think one of the pivotal factors riding on how much you'll enjoy this film is whether you take to Dudley Moore's character and the problem for me is that for the most part I couldn't; although I'm prepared to concede that Moore was excellent whether he was playing the drunken fool or whether he was playing it straight. The problem I had is that the writers didn't give him the best material to work with; a lot of his drunken ramblings weren't funny and to be honest I found him to be annoying rather than funny when he was drunk - his constant laughing every time he told a joke felt like an obvious prompt to get the audience to laugh at material that clearly wasn't funny. As mentioned, I don't blame Moore for this and I honestly think he was absolutely superb, but his character was annoying a lot of the time.The real star of the show was John Gielgud as Arthur's butler Hobson who is a man who doesn't mince his words and isn't afraid to speak his mind. Gielgud was fantastic and delivered his dialogue in a dry and understated manner and his character was actually much funnier than the much more brash and obnoxious character that Moore portrayed (well they do say that less is more). I honestly think that this would have been close to being a disaster without Gielgud.Although the first 60 minutes is largely obnoxious and annoying, the final 30 minutes are very good - the scene where we witness Arthur looking after Hobson on his deathbed was genius and very touching. That scene for me was probably one of the best in the film. Although Arthur being sober for a month and then falling off the wagon a few hours before his wedding did feel a little forceful and a little too contrived.Despite some of the problems, this film does have a big heart and it's an interesting social commentary about loneliness and about showing that love and happiness are more important than wealth. I have to admit that even though the climax was somewhat predictable and not all of this worked for me, it did leave me with a smile on my face at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look back on the romantic comedy genre you can see that it's really gone downhill these days. Rom-coms of the 21st century have no heart, no soul, and certainly no brain. Arthur is a film that represents a more illustrious and heartfelt age of romantic comedies. Dudley Moore plays Arthur, a charming, funny, and lovable millionaire who also happens to be a compulsive drunk. He spends his days taking hot baths in a bathtub big enough for an elephant as well as driving around town living an exciting and carefree life. But his drunken antics are pulled to a halt when his father tells him that unless he marries the girl his family has arranged for him to wed his unlimited funds will be cut off. But that very same day Arthur meets the girl of his dreams and must make a life changing choice.Arthur is a film with a lot of heart. Its storyline is sincere and its characters are believable. You'll instantly fall in love with the wild and exuberant Arthur, but more so his sarcastic and witty servant Hobson, played by John Gielgud in a magnificent Oscar winning performance. Liza Minnelli plays Linda, Arthur's love interest and she does just as excellent job and delivers a heartwarmingly funny performance with the rest of the cast.Arthur also reminds us of a time when comedies didn't have to be so crude to be funny. Laughs are always about shock value these days, but Arthur manages to be clever and it's comedy comes from an intelligent script and great actors. Arthur isn't hilarious but it's sufficiently entertaining and is good for plenty of sincere laughs. Obviously the film as a whole is no masterpiece, but as far as romantic comedies go it's better than anything we might see today. It's a little sappy, very predictable, and it's characters are pretty easy to dissect on the base level. But Arthur isn't striving to be much. It's aim is to make us laugh and give us a heartwarming story. It does both of these things, so I would say it is a very successful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's very funny, with a great performances by Dudley Moore (in the title role), Sir John Gielgud (as his butler) and Liza Minelli (as his love interest). It's also a great love story. It is also extremely well-written, as well as being well acted. I have no idea why anybody could NOT like this movie, as it is both funny, romantic, and sad at the same time. It also has several great scenes (Arthur with Hobson (John Gielgud) in the hospital, for instance). Its music by Burt Bacharach, as well as its theme by Christopher Cross are also very well done. I would recommend this to anybody in the film community.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not quite reaching classic status, Arthur is a very charming and funny movie. Arthur himself may be occasionally clichéd, but Dudley Moore plays the role with great comic timing and charm, you don't mind so much. Arthur looks good even after thirty years, with crisp cinematography and charming-looking costumes and production values. When it comes to the music by Burt Bacharach, it is equally impressive, with Arthur's theme especially wonderful. Steve Gordon's direction is very solid, and his screenplay is even better, with John Gielgud's droll one-liners standing out in particular. The story while slow to start with was enough to grip me, and the performances are great. Not just from Moore and Liza Minnelli, but especially from John Gielgud. Overall, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by the Late Steve Gordon, 'Arthur' is a Funny and Charming Romantic-Comedy, that turns out to be a memorable watch. Even the performances here are super! Dudley Moore stars as 'Arthur', A drunken millionaire playboy from New York City who is on the brink of an arranged marriage to a wealthy heiress, but ends up falling for a common working-class girl from Queens, played by Liza Minnelli.Steve Gordon's Writing is solid, at most places and offers some really entertaining &amp; interesting moments. But, the pacing is a bit slow. Especially, in the first hour. Gordon's direction is as good as his writing. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fine. Music by Burt Bacharach, is lovely.Performance-Wise: Late Dudley Moore has a blast playing 'Arthur'. Liza Minnell is convincing. The Late Great, John Gielgud, is amazing, in an Oscar-Winning performance. He is the real scene stealer here! Jill Eikenberry is efficient. Others lend good support. On the whole, If your looking for some Neat and Clean Humor, pinched with some Romance, then 'Arthur' is meant for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Dudley's Best Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diminutive Dudley Moore scored his second greatest success in cinema after Blake Edwards' "10" with freshman writer &amp; director Steve Gordon's contemporary fairy tale set in bustling New York City. "Arthur" is about an amiable drunkard who has who has spent his entire life staggering from one alcoholic drink to another in bliss disdain for everything else, especially money and work. When people ask him what he does, Arthur replies flippantly, "I race cars, I play tennis, I fondle women - but I have weekends off and I am my own boss!" Mind you, in our politically correct age, such a line might not be within the bounds of good taste. Nevertheless, Gordon's lightweight movie is a reversal of sorts with the man instead of the woman trapped by wealth. Usually, the woman is confined to a tower or a lifestyle that she cannot dispense with when the man comes along to court her. Although he is clearly in his 30s, Arthur has never grown up and taken responsibility. As he points out, everybody takes care of him, but he takes care of nobody, until he spots a girl, Linda Marolla (Liza Minnelli), shoplifting a tie in Bergdorf Goodman, a fashionable upscale department store,and falls hopelessly in love with her at first sight. The complication is that Arthur's parents have decided that their wayward son must marry Susan Johnson (Jill Eikenberry) and Susan's father Burt (Stephen Elliott) wants him to come to work for him. He also threatens to do Arthur bodily harm if he doesn't make his daughter happy. Worse of all, if Arthur doesn't marry, he stands to lose $750 million. The only low point involves the death of Arthur's sarcastic valet, Hobson (John Gielgud), who kicks the bucket between the time that our eponymous protagonist is told that he must marry to earn his inheritance and the disastrous wedding. Altogether, "Arthur" qualifies as a carefree,feel-good 1980s era movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never get tired of watching this movie! Dudley Moore is at the top of his comedic game, and surprisingly at his tender dramatic game, as the inebriated-but still lovable- millionaire Arthur Bach. Kudos to the script and the director for not having Arthur drunk throughout the whole movie. He spends an equal amount of time sober and I believe that had they kept him drunk throughout the film it would have become a tired joke that would have grated on the audience. As for the rest of the cast, they too are outstanding. Liza Minnelli, gives a sweet performance as a working class girl with a heart of gold. John Gieldgood is flawless as Arthurs dry witted long suffering butler/friend/tutor Hopsen. My favorite scene is when Arthur is with Hopsen and says that he is about to take a bath and Hopsen reply's, "I shall alert the media". LOL!!!!!!!!! See this movie. It is a laugh riot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine recommended this movie to me and I didn't expect much. Arthur was a very enjoyable movie, but had its flaws. I could see his character as annoying and not very clever, but its more of the overall atmosphere of the film that makes it. More then the slapstick comedy, I frankly enjoyed seeing 1980's New York and the classic Rolls Royces in the film. Arthur didn't have an amazing story and it was hard to feel sorry for a ridiculously wealthy drunk. But after the first 15 minutes you start to warm up to the character and his lifestyle. By the end of the movie I was very happy to see him choose the love of his life over his arranged marriage. Arthur is a bizarre movie that has a very odd appeal to it. I'm not sure how to classify this film, but it is an interesting piece of cinema that gets my overall approval.Rating = B- VideoGameHollywood.com</fullReview>

The three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless, plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know the entire script, so when someone is watching it for the first time I have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it. I can't even narrow it down, although, Sir John's character probably gets the most memorable ones. The famous "I'll alert the media" when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless, but the list is truly endless. The scene's at Arthur's soon to be fiancé's father's house are a scream, particularly his interactions with the moose. Do yourself a favour and see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best warmhearted comedy -ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently I was happy to see it on DVD which is a relief from watching the old, grainy VHS versions.I hadn't seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time. It's one of those rare, perfect storms of comedy where great writing (truly funny line after truly funny line) is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time.Dudley Moore got an Oscar nomination for "Arthur" but lost (although John Gielgud won for best supporting actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" doesn't win a Best Actor Oscar -it's proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein").Steve Gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm-hearted tone of the story. Quite simply, IMHO the movie is a rare gem. It's only sad that Steve Gordon passed away just a year after "Arthur" was released.Regarding the DVD that is available as of 1/2007, it's so/so. Although the video quality is a leap over the old VHS copies, there is still no widescreen version available.The DVD has a few extras that are nice but it's just not enough. One example is commentary from the Director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit. The DVD, being the perfect format to include such material, certainly should have offered it as well.This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is one for the books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty butler shines in this romantic drunken tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite comedies ever. Not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero, but taken for what it's worth and not as trivializing alcoholism, the movie is simply a lot of fun. It tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk, irresponsible 40 something bachelor named Arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune, but only if he marries Susan, chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him. Arthur proposes, but then unwisely falls for Linda, a waitress and petty thief.Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the world's most endearing drunk, whose antics are a laugh a minute. Admittedly, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role. The ladies of the piece are also well portrayed. Liza Minnelli sparkles as Linda, and her on screen chemistry with Moore is great. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for Arthur. However, this film is literally made by Sir John Gielgud, who portrays Arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, Hobson. It's obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during Hobson's longtime employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's romance at all, but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant. It's the butler you'll remember best long after the closing credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away. If you look fast you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation. Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him.Secondly though, I actually knew a real life Arthur Bach. He was not quite as wealthy as Arthur, but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid. His parents tightly controlled his purse strings, but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just like Dudley Moore does. The wonder with Arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not. But that's the other half of the equation. My friend was a most charming person when you got to know him. In fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming. He couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor. He spent his life being a perfect party guest. The term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him.And that's what Dudley Moore is, a wastrel. Unlike my friend Moore has John Gielgud to clean up after him. That's a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur. My friend also never found a Liza Minnelli, a male Liza Minnelli in fact because he was gay. Still Moore's portrayal of Arthur Bach is deadly accurate and so real for me.Arthur, 20th century wastrel, is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in Jill Eikenberry. Since he won't work for a living, the threat of being cut off is quite real for him. He only has his butler Hobson played by John Gielgud and chauffeur Bitterman played by Ted Post to pour his troubles out to. We should all have such troubles.John Gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in Arthur on film and in fact Gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances. Yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at Oscar time. The Academy gave Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor Award essentially for the work of a lifetime. That man was amazing, still at his craft almost to the end.So to Frank Graham who worked in the film and to Jackie Weiss, a genuine real life Arthur, I dedicate this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember when Dudley Moore was REALLY funny? If not, this movie should jog your memory.In a role that he would forever be identified with, Moore makes the part of "Arthur" all his own. As a poor little rich boy who refuses to grow up and desires to spend his every waking moment drunk, Moore breathes life into what would otherwise be a caricature, making him touching, human and as frail as a child.Steve Gordon's writing and directing are both impeccable; the look is befitting a fairy tale. And the dialogue, while romantic at heart, also lets loose with some of the most quotable zingers ever written, beginning to end. And everyone gets at least one or two good ones.Minelli, Fitzgerald, Ross, Eikenberry, Martin and everyone else resist the urge to overplay, but instead just say their lines as anyone else would say them. In the process, making them all the funnier. I especially liked Moore's scene with Hamilton near the end where the prevalent line is "Oh, my GAHD!" I can explain no more, you'll just have to see it.In contrast, Gielgud's part as Hobson, the proper yet protective valet, is as showy as anything. Yet Gielgud is such a pro that it comes off as easy as a walk in the park. His lines steal the show, and he earned every award he won for his role. In the end, even Hobson finds that he needs Arthur as much as Arthur needs him.I can't say enough good about "Arthur". Really. If you want a lift in your day, watch it.Is "Arthur" that good? It doesn't suck.Ten stars. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Arthur" is one of those rare films that gets better and funnier as it gets older. Some of the sharpest and most unforgettable dialogue is shared between Moore and Gielgud. Christopher Cross's "The Best That You Can Do" song complements the film beautifully. And who can resist that New York flavor? Arthur Bach is a drunk, spoiled, and lecherous man (superbly played by Dudley Moore). He has no redeeming qualities. His public drunkenness is the stuff of legend. He frequents prostitutes openly. He holds no position in his father's company, nor does he really contribute to society in any way....This is one of the best 80's comedies ever. I think this movie speaks to all of us who are still thinking about growing up and reminds those that had to grow too quickly because of a traumatic event. Arthur lived a pampered life by most of our standards and he resisted the world he knew was coming quickly (i.e. marriage, career, and growing old.) The part I love best about the movie is his several references to Santa Claus. Which affirms in my mind that he was still very very young at heart. What I appreciate most about this movie is the very subtle and detail oriented comedy that Dudley Moore is known for. In my mind he is only second to Lucille Ball in the physical comedy department. And even though you might think Liza Minelli is not a fit, she works perfectly as Arthur's love interest. Music is great and deserved it's Oscars.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Then I began reading the reviews and many of you who wrote fantastic reviews for got to select your rating. and I think if you forget to actually select the ratings number that it counts it is sort of a 0. Then I actually saw some really low reviews and I couldn't figure it out but I think that the people are younger people and don't appreciate a smart witty clean language comedy you can watch in mixed company or family. One of the reviewers even hated the film because they thought it was horrible that Auther was a drunk. They were worried about the wrong social message being sent. Now that is a younger "politically correct" person. I wish IMDb would add age group to our profiles. There were so many great movies that would no longer be made in Hollywood in this PC generation. also Alexis got a lot of bad language, sexual innuendo, low brow humor, CGI, special effects, stunts, etc. Hollywood wouldn't Produce and the current generation will not even go see something this good because I don't have any attention span. I was a sophomore in high school when this came out and I thought it was so hilarious I can't imagine any of today's 15 to 25 loving this movie. another great thing is that a lot of this movie was shot on location something that don't do as much of today due to computer graphics. But this truly was a fantastic movie. Great storyline, acting, casting, serious issues as well as humor. everyone who has given this movie a good review please go back in and make sure that you selected the star rating. I could watch this movie once every 3 months and never get tired of it. and for the life of me I have no idea why they remade this movie I'm so tired of Hollywood remaking good movies and that's all they show on the TV is the new versions instead of the original. Viewing this movie is never a waste of time. it was a long time between this movie and the sequel that didn't come out until 1988 I believe and it got bashed but the sequel wasn't really that bad but nothing is as good as the original</fullReview>

The premise is generic romantic fantasy - a rich man desires a poor girl and must choose between luxurious wealth and true love. Dudley Moore as the rich man plays the drunk to the hilt but in too many scenes which seem today a bit dated. The photography of New York City and its wealthiest metropolitan suburbs is a gem worth treasuring. Moore;s co-stars are John Gielgud as his faithful flunky who has the best line in the film - "Wash ya winkie" and Liza Minelli as the poor girl who lights up the screen. They provide most of the performing interest and raise the level of the show. Ground breaking and inspiring a generation ago it still has merit today yet too many scenes seem dated.</fullReview>

He comes to the rescue and starts to date the lowly Linda despite his engagement to Susan.This is an adorable rom-com. Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli have never been more cute together as a couple.

		<fullReview>...of sorts. Arthur is a womanizing wealthy playboy with no real direction in life. Trailed by a seen-it-all butler, Hobson, played wonderfully and appropriately Oscar worthy by John Gielgud).When forced into a marriage to a socialite Arthur stumbles across a city rat. Dug deep into the trenches of Queens N.Y. Being enamored by her, Arthur soon discovers what it seems like to be an adult. And to make adult choices.What begins as a slapstick stage for Dudley Moore to chew up becomes something more of a touching father/son relationship. Not so much his own father, but the guardian that watches him and guides him through life's decision. Hobson, a butler and confidant, navigates a fine line between a stern figure and an enabler. But always, with loving concern hidden behind British nobility. What I loved about this movie is the lack of sentiment. When it feels too schmaltzy, it pulls back and allows you to absorb the situation as it would unfold. The thought of a rampant drunk within the big city has a lot of opportunity for stupid behavior (and milks it for what its worth). But it also has a big heart. It is a great set up to a typical early 80s comedy.Some will be turned off by the "drunken" acting by Moore. It is a bit over the top. Also, in our modern times, we realize the real fate of someone who boozes this seriously. And it's never a great outcome no matter how much money you have. If you go in knowing the era of which this is told, I think you'll be touched by the overall message this movie finally concludes. It may be an outdated message, but it's still a message.</fullReview>

Of course you missed quite a bit viewing in-flight movies back then but I've caught up with "Arthur" many times since via cable or rentals and I never fail to laugh. Just a wonderful script and direction by Steve Gordon, it's a shame he passed away shortly after this. While John Gielgud's superb performance as Hobson gained an Oscar, this film was going to either soar or crash on Dudley Moore's performance as Arthur. It's not easy to make a spoiled and perpetually sloshed playboy into a lovable character, but Dudley pulls it off. I've never been a big fan of Liza Minnelli. but she is also terrific as Linda, the waitress from Queens that Arthur falls in love with. Some other fine performances, such as Ted Ross as Bittermann, Arthur's chauffeur and Anne De Salvo, who has a hilarious bit as a hooker who Arthur entertains at a ritzy NYC restaurant.To those who dislike this because it makes alcoholism seem funny and cute...lighten up, it's only a movie. Hollywood has a tradition in making drunks seem lovable. Just as they do with prostitutes. As a PS, still married to the lovely lady 33 years later. Best that you can do is fall in love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Film about a Lovable Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are depressed drunks, there are pugnacious drunks, and there are funny drunks. Arthur falls into the last category, and boy does he know it. He is constantly cracking himself up. That could be an annoying trait, but Arthur is just so darn lovable.Arthur is played brilliantly by Dudley Moore. When I read about the other actors who were considered for the role, I nearly cringe, because Moore is the definitive Arthur. And John Gielgud is the definitive Hobson, Arthur's man's man. As the somber Hobson, Gielgud gets to deliver some of the film's best one-liners, lines that I have quoted for years. Hobson is Arthur's dresser, maid, father figure, conscience, day planner and all-around assistant. He is a reminder to Arthur that he should be more responsible. They have developed a relationship that, on the surface, seems to be no more than the scolding parent and the disobedient child. But there is something deeper there.Arthur is a likable guy and he only wants to be happy. Is he willing to trade some of his happiness for financial considerations? It is a question that Arthur must face and when he does, he learns about himself.The film also includes some great songs that were voiced by the then unknown Christopher Cross.Like the film "What About Bob", the comedy in "Arthur" revolves around a character with issues, but he is a lovable character and the film allows us to laugh with him, not just at him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthur and Martha</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Susan you're such an a**hole!" Only someone as hopelessly childlike as Arthur could glean a smile from such a comment but his fiancé seems oblivious to his insults. For this is the best he can do as he sits opposite a woman he is forced to marry or be cut off without a cent (US$750million to be exact). Susan adores everything about him (what woman wouldn't?) and come to think of it, most of the people he meets in the film adore him except his family. I certainly would fall at his feet if Arthur Bach were a real character. He has warmth, style and dare I reveal my shallowness - he has pots and pots and pots of money. So what's not to like? This film is utterly charming and hasn't lost any of its appeal even though it's now more than 30 years old. It is a really romantic film at its heart and it is very satisfying watching the helpless manchild fall in love with a charismatic and striking actress, Linda Marolla (played by a quirky Liza Minnelli). Unfortunately this all happens at the same time as he is being manipulated by his powerful family into marrying the beautiful, elegant and how can I put this - a square cardboard cut out of a woman, Susan Johnson. She is beautiful, no question but Arthur, although from old money, acts like a parvenu; he's always drunk and appears to connect with real people and so the vivacious Linda, who's always got a story at the ready to get herself out of trouble, really appeals to him.Arthur's character is a charming playboy whose life revolves around drinking and laughing, and little else. He likes to live it up, a bit like the hellraisers of the eighties but with none of their artistic bent. Arthur is no Ollie Reed or Peter O'Toole, he is a bored multimillionaire which does make him quite a tragic figure. "Some people drink because they are not poets. This is who I am." He desperately tries to explain to the gloriously vacuous Susan. But boy does he come alive when he's on the sauce! Dudley Moore who plays Arthur is very convincing as a drunk and plays it so beautifully. He is certainly the life and soul of the party and the best one liner for me is when he says to his betrothed's butler "Are you sure you want to be a nightclub comic?" when said butler displays all the personality of a walking corpse. Arthur's own butler, Hobson (Sir John Gielgud) needs no introduction and deserved the Oscar he received for his dry and biting wit. "If you and your undergarment could move two paces backwards, I could enter this dwelling." he snorts to Linda's bewildered father as he enters their humble abode. Hobson is an innate snob and even though every utterance is an insult he's such an original that you readily forgive him.As we see the dilemmas that Arthur faces throughout the film, we do see him develop and mature (just a bit). His slightly deranged and eccentric grandmother, Martha is hilarious and I thought she would be a great match for Hobson as they are both inveterate snobs but that would be a totally wild and unbelievable storyline - what was I thinking! If you are still an old romantic at heart (even though thirty years have passed since you may have seen it) watch it again. Arthur and Martha truly lit up my heart as did all the other characters. RIP Dudley Moore and Sir John Gielgud, unforgettable performances, unforgettable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take the Peter Allen/Carole Bayer Sager Oscar-Winning song and place it in your head and walk around this magical city at night thinking of it as you view the great skyscrapers and beautiful parks. Put yourselves in the shoes of the wealthy wastrel Arthur and his down-trodden waitress girlfriend Linda, and you have the stuff that classic romantic comedy of a screwball comedy could be made of. Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli are a bit of an odd couple, but like William Powell and Carole Lombard in "My Man Godfrey", they are likably quirky. "You have all the qualities of somebody that one might meet in a bowling alley", Arthur's butler Hobson (John Gielgud) tells her, after Arthur saves her from being arrested for shoplifting. He sends her home in a chauffeured town car, and driver Bitterman steps up to give Minnelli the ride of her life, playing along with her desire to shock the neighbors in her lower middle class neighborhood. The 30's are back, and screwball comedy is finally alive and well again! "Arthur, he does as he pleases", Christopher Cross sings in the opening song. He's always drunk, but when he does momentarily sober up, you realize who he really is, especially when he tells the snooty Hobson off. Obviously, this bon viand loves being rich, but hates the responsibility of it, and when his matriarchal grandmother (the wonderful Geraldine Fitzgerald) threatens to disown him if he doesn't marry another rich socialite rather than the down-to-earth Linda, it's a showdown between the rich slob and the rich snobs who hold the purse strings which keep Arthur afloat in bubble baths, chauffeurs and booze.Dudley Moore was already known as a talented funny man, and after brief forays into film in the 1960's, had practically disappeared until he got the showy cameo in "Foul Play". "10" was his major come-back (more like a bounce back, he had never really been away), and "Arthur" was the frosting on the cake of his finally rising film career. Minnelli, after smashing success in the early 1970's, had bad luck with three flops in a row, yet continued success on live stage, wisely took a slight back seat to Moore, yet her presence is felt, even if future film appearances would be rare and sometimes even worse than the ones she had done between "Cabaret" and "Arthur". They play very well off of each other, yet Minnelli humbly gives the chemistry between Moore and Gielgud more focus. "Chicago's" original "Mr. Cellophane" (Barney Martin) is very amusing in a reconciliation with Minnelli (playing Linda's blue-collar dad) who briefly appeared in that show early in its run.Prior to the explosion of the blockbuster genre of the 1980's, popcorn films like this were major box-office fireworks. You didn't go to the movies to expect to down a bottle of aspirin later on; you went to be entertained, hug the date you were with, and leave smiling rather than hold your head in agony. "Arthur" has retained its reputation as a major hit of 1981 with everybody coming out smelling like a rose. Unfortunately, it wasn't the stepping stone for its director, Steve Gordon, who would die the following year. Had he lived, he could have gone on to be as legendary as the other hot directors of the year and kept the more gentle ideals of movie making afloat rather than many of the harsher ideals which have come along since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Would you like me to wash your dic*****k too you little sh***t?" Arthur is very charming. A wonderful cast helps out as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Plot) Arthur is a drunken playboy who's never had to work for any money in his life. His best friend is his butler Hobson (John Gieglund) and he can't stay away from precarious incidents when drunk. His life immediately changes when he's told by his father he has to marry a woman named Susan Johnson, or he's cut off from his inheritance. The real problem is that he doesn't love Susan, and falls in love with another girl (Liza Minnelli) As much as I enjoyed the remake (and I did quite a bit) the original is still the best version. Arthur is a simple and uncomplicated story that is just a treat to watch from beginning to end. The character of Arthur himself is endlessly childish, but an undeniably good hearted guy who just needs to grow up. The film's main strength comes from the terrific cast. Dudley Moore is mostly excellent as Arthur. I did feel he overdid it with the drunken laughter, which got on my nerves, but he has undeniable charisma. It's hard to feel empathy for a guy who has money, and hasn't worked for it, but Dudley managed to do it with his charisma. Liza Minnelli is absolutely adorable in her role as the love interest of Arthur's. She was cute as a button, and I enjoyed her immensely. My only complaint about the chemistry between Dudley Moore &amp; Liza is not the actors themselves, but the way they are written. The attraction came a bit too fast for my liking, but that's a minor carp. John Gieglund gave my favorite performance in the film. His cynical, yet good hearted character stole the show for me on many occasions. He also had some classic lines that are unforgettable. The finale is filled with laughs and smiles. It's very wildFinal Thoughts: The remake is surprisingly quite good, but this is still the best. It's an extremely charming film that is impossible to dislike. Cave into it's charm, and thank me later for it. Very much recommended7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dudley Moore is, as usual, extremely likable as a millionaire drunkard who has to choose between marrying rich heiress Jill Eikenberry and keeping all his money or staying with his true love, poor waitress Liza Minnelli, and losing the lot. This is a warm film with an excellent performance from Moore that could easily have been overly sentimental or off-putting but avoids those traps; John Gielgud as Hobson the butler is cracking too and gets most of the best lines. It suffers from the occasional flat patch but by and large this is funny stuff. 'Arthur 2: On The Rocks' followed, and while it's inferior to the original it's certainly not as bad as its reputation would suggest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largely unknown classic. This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. It is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood (the "psycho"-like music at the wedding fight), but the acting overcomes it. The character Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But he develops well into a more mature, well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will. The end is fairly corny, though. I wont give it away, but it could be improved. Worth seeing many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Does It Feel Having All That Money? "It Doesn't Suck!"........Dudley Moore (as ARTHUR)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WE SEE THAT there is now a remake of ARTHUR out. This was probably an inevitable truth; a forgone conclusion, a sure thing. This all refers to someone's making a new version; and not for any sure fired success.OKAY, WE'RE JUST a trifle biased. We well remember viewing Mr, Dudley Moore, Miss Kiza Minelli, Sir John Gielgud and the rest of the cast going through some of the least complex, yet most pleasingly funny set of routines, all very skillfully woven into a story which we still followed as closely as was possible; while we were at the same time mesmerized by the on screen comedic antics of a character (Arthur) who can truly draw comparison to the great Silent Clowns of yesteryear; namely: Messers Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd and Langdon.ALTHOUGH THERE WERE doubtless many a moviegoer who found this funny little fellow to be "new" to the American Film scene; we in our family were fortunate to be familiar with the comic genius of Dudley Moore. We had heard many of his recordings over Radio Station WFMT, 98.7 in Chicago. It was during this time that Dudley was teamed up with Peter Cook. They had done a good deal of work on the British Broadcasting Company; both on the "wireless" (Radio) and the "telly" (Television).ADDED TO THIS extensive resume was added a Review from the Music Hall in the U.K., called BEYOND THE FRINGE and BEYOND THE FRINGE '65, both of which were produced on the London Stage as well as on Broadway and included fellow Brits: Peter Cook (Dudley's Comic Partner),Jonathon Miller, Alan Bennett and Paxton Whitehead.* FILMS ALSO WERE part of the eclectic-comic diet with such titles as THE BED SITTING ROOM, FOUL PLAY,a comic version of THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES and the very off-beat, now cult classic BEDAZZLED.WITH THE COMING of the '70's, the team found itself back on this side of the "Pond" long enough to do a two man version of the old BEYOND THE FRINGE review as GOOD EVENING, with just Cook and Moore.Then the two amicably went on their own solo route in the desire to enliven their careers and improve their own stock in Tinsletown.SEVERAL FILMS FOLLOWED such as WHOLLY MOSES, DEREK AND CLIVE GET THE HORN and A Lot of Television work both in both the U.K. as well as the U.S.Another gave some very favourable exposure for Dud. Then came the masterpiece of cinematic titillation in Blake Edwards 10, co-starring a most charming little lady in Bo Derek (Woo, woo, woo, woo)! SUDDENLY, THE VERY introspective and introverted screen persona of Dudley Moore was a really hot item around Hollywood. The roles came easier in bigger pictures with much more show biz mega $$$$! After 20+ years on stage, the Radio, TV and Film, Mr. Dudley Moore was an overnight success! ALL OF WHICH (at last), brings us down to today's honoree, ARTHUR.EVERY ONCE IN a while, all of the elements that make for a unique and successful production; singularly unique and so memorable as to defy comparison and classification. To our way of thinking, ARTHUR fits the bill very well in every respect.CONSIDER IF YOU will the components that make up any movie, ARTHUR'S all rate at the top or very close. The story is a somewhat unconventional love story and a tale about loneliness, a sort of "poor little rich kid" fable. Each of the characters does their best to shine within the given part; without detracting from the others. Our personal favourites are Barney Martin (Her Father), The Chaueffer Bitterman (Ted Ross), Greraldine Fitzgerald (the Millionaire Matriarch of the Bach Family) and, of course Sir John Gielgud (Hobson the Butler and Surogate Father to Arthur).THE FILM IS different and singularly excellent in script/dialog, the musical score and vocals by Christopher Cross and the complexity of the non-complex story line all add up to something that is very different.NOW WHY DID they want to go and do a remake? We mean leave well enough alone! If it ain't broken, don't fix it! You can't guild a Lilly, improve on perfection or get blood from a turnip! ALL THAT'S LEFT to say is, Go figure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable. I particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose.I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence but it's funny every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you pretty much laugh the whole time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. They were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it.The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled Arthur were all equally hilarious. It's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little ____. I laugh every time I listen to the "I'm going to have a bath" and the lines that follow.</fullReview>

It was a very "different" movie, enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life. We often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite.

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best "romantic-comedy" of all time ? . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again, it seems totally illogical, to me at least, that "Arthur" merits a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally "unlikely" if not quite "impossible" melding of wildly disparate elements. That he managed to make alcoholism laugh-friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is, in itself, wonderful. That he gave Dudley Moore his finest role, and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact, including the score, seems to me patent and egregious. I challenge ANYone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud. But, apparently, nearly a third of its audience has so managed. Well, I, for one, found and find Gordon's effort both laughable AND lovable, and the iikes of Geraldine Fitzgerald's great-aunt and Stephen Elliott's murderous would-be father-in-law absolute gems of background characters. Even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization, and the late, sniffish Sir John Gielgud was right about accepting his fee, but wrong about undertaking his role. "Arthur" makes no effort to "Underztand," much less rationalize, the scourge of "alcoholism" (hey, iFit ain't booze, it's other drugs of choice, including meth, and addictions are merely symptoms, not targets), it simply observes in its own quizzical manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An innocent comedy with a likable drunk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting how this film treats drunks and drunkenness, as an amusing pass time, the aftermath of hangover which can easily be treat with a household aspirin. Drunkeness, which is at present a relevant subject matter in the UK, where the Government is advocating 24 hour drinking laws for England and Wales, can be a real and serious problem, with plenty of repercussions for friends and family, as well as serious health ones. However, as we don't really see the serious implications of drunkenness in this film, then perhaps it is because the wealth of a billionaire helps him or her cope with it that much better. From this we can deduce that social problems are not a cause or effect of over-consumption of alcohol, but more to do with social circumstance.Of course there appears to be no placement advertisements of manufactures of alcohol in this film. This one can assume is because manufacturers of alcohol don't want to be seen to be associated with 'drunkenness'. And some would say; quite right too'. This is because it is not the alcohol which is dangerous, but the person drinking it which is!As a drunk the late Dudley Moore plays Arthur superbly. While the film 10 might have turned Moore into an unlikely sex-symbol, subsequently serving to tarnish him with the label of; 'womanizer'. In fact Moore was a man of many talents. Not only was he an adept actor, and funny comic, but a no less than brilliant pianist, having been classically trained in this field. We actually see how at ease Moore is with the piano, as his character; Arthur plays it to the guests of his party.As for the late Sir John Gielgud, his role as the butler is made less by the lines he has to say, but more to do with the way he delivers them, with a deadpan expression, albeit with a glint in his eyes. I think Sir John is here made all the more funny because his comedic butler role is out of context with his serious Shakespearan actor reputation.Meanwhile, there appears to be a bit of laziness on behalf of the director here, who in my opinion could have done more to bring out the supporting cast. This is particularly so with the woman who, along with her spouse is woken up by Arther during the early hours looking for Linda. Here one can see the woman is mouthing the lines of Moore until it's her cue to speak her own. This also occurs with Liza Manelli, when she is in the store.What really carries this film is the acting of Moore and Sir John, and the excellent writing. These are what make this film worthy of prestigious film awards, and critical acclaim.</fullReview>

Drinking his sorrows away, he shares the bar with a fellow drunk who begins to listen to his troubles. We don't know about Hobson's death until Arthur mentions it to the drunk. Even though Dudley is laugh out loud funny throughout the entire film, what makes his performance memorable is the bar scene where he shows his true emotions and his love for Hobson.

Moore is Arthur, a man belonging to a multimillionaire family, who was near to get 750 million dollars provided that he marries to a lady (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but he finally refused when he met nice and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan only few minutes before their wedding. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur although the latter knew that his life will change in the coming future. This comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone.

		<fullReview>The hilarious Dudley Moore's best remembered film has him portraying the title character, an alcoholic millionaire who often acts like a child or a woman chaser in public. His parents strongly disapprove of his wacky behavior and so they decide to get back at him by giving him the choice of letting him be forced into an arranged marriage in order to keep his share of the family fortune or letting him lose everything. Naturally, Arthur does not take a liking to the rather snobby woman who his parents had picked for the arranged marriage. He ponders what to do with the situation and attempts to get help from his trusted butler/valet, Hobson (John Gielgud). Eventually, Arthur falls for a kooky waitress (Liza Minnelli) who's almost as wild in public as he is. Will Arthur let true love stand before his money? That's the question that poses this gem of a romantic comedy that contains many great performances including an Best Supporting Actor Academy Award winning one by Gielgud. The scenes between Moore and Gielgud are mostly the especially funny ones.</fullReview>

He is also wistful and real..one of the film's best lines is his poignant "Not Everyone who drinks is a poet...some of us drink because we're not poets." The great Sir John Gielgud won a much deserved Oscar for his splendid performance as Hobson,Arthur's valet and caretaker.Although He considered it a "take the money and run role",He brings to the character all the talent ,experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian. The supporting cast is also out of thisworld,from Geraldine Fitzgerald's sassy Grandma Bach to Stephen Elliott's bombastic Mafioso. The score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly.The only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Steve Gordon made his one and only film with 'Arthur'. He died from heart failure a year after completing this film at the age of 44. Nominated for an Oscar for the film's screenplay, Gordon did a great job of combining high voltage comedy one liners with a decent human story showing the relationship between a spoiled millionaire playboy (Dudley Moore) and his butler (John Gielgud). Gielgud died earlier this year and Moore is suffering from a degenerative brain disorder. 'Arthur' made fun of alcoholism. Not an easy thing to do and its love story involving Arthur's relationship with a waitress (Liza Minnelli) is sweet and very well told. John Gielgud won a well deserved Oscar playing a character you would not expect him to and Moore was nominated for best actor.</fullReview>

Dudley and Liza light up the screen and make you laugh over and over again. I have grown up with this movie, seen it over 100 times (no kidding) and I still laugh. Sir John Gielgud is the best dry comedy you will ever find. Rent it-no, better yet buy it, and you will not be disappointed.

		<fullReview>The chances are that I will never watch the latest (2011) version of this film, mainly because I totally despise Russell Brand. So I decided I'd take another look at the original version. It's a lot better than I remember it, mainly because of the presence of John Gielgud. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please get Arthur another Scotch while I write the next paragraph).Arthur Bach is a very rich man; he's also a drunk and a womaniser. He has always had everything he wants, but on the downside, he has never grown up either. He relies on his servants, Hobson, his best friend and butler, and Bitterman, his chauffeur for all of his needs. His family want him to marry one Susan Johnson, but Arthur doesn't love her and doesn't want to marry her. It's only when he's threatened with being cut off that he considers it. But then he meets Linda Marolla, a girl from Queens and the hit it off straight away. This leaves Arthur with a dilemma, does he marry Susan and stay rich, or does he follow his heart and become poor? One person is helping with this tough decision, someone whose time is limited. I won't say any more as I don't want them Spoiler Police after me again.Dudley Moore was perfect as Arthur, he plays the drunk so well and he can turn on the serious acting when required too. Liza Minnelli did a great job as Linda Marolla, there as a great rapport between the pair of them on screen. The star of the show (for me) was John Gielgud as Hobson, he has some truly great lines, delivered with such dry wit, and I loved his performance in this one. Honourable mentions go to; Geraldine Fitzgerald as Martha Bach, Jill Eikenberry as Susan Johnson, Stephen Elliott as Burt Johnson and Ted Ross as Bitterman.Although it's no masterpiece, I quite enjoyed this film. As romantic comedies go, I found this to be one of the better ones I've seen. Some of it seems slightly dated, but I thought it's travelled through time a lot better than some of it's contemporary's from the early 80's. Over all, it's a pretty enjoyable romantic comedy with a couple of decent performances. I'll probably never see the updated version and so no comparisons her, but this one's recommended.My Score: 6.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur Bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multi-millionaire and is attracted to people 'below him' in social standing - he pays for a hooker in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a shoplifter.He drinks quite a lot too, and sometimes he is driving while drinking, too, which of course is not funny, ever. The movie is great but behind the comedy is some reality, too. John Gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on screen and created a character for the ages. Talk about deserving an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but its Gielgud as "Hobson" you'll remember the most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"BILLIONAIRE CHILDISH DRUNKARD WHO HAS NEVER DONE AN HONEST DAY'S WORK IN HIS LIFE" is hardly the sort of character an audience is supposed to care about, and to tell the truth, despite the innate charm of Dudley Moore, the film never escapes from this premise. We're obviously meant to be rooting for Arthur but what are we meant to be rooting for? Are we meant to be happy for him when he retains his near-billion dollar inheritance at the end? I'm guessing most people would think getting a job would do Arthur good, especially when the only moment in the film when he accepts adult responsibility- taking care of his sickly butler- is when he manages to sober up. Are we meant to think he will give up drinking? Hardly likely considering he has just be rewarded for his drunkenness. Or perhaps we should think "Let him keep on drinking, as long as he's happy." What's certain, though, is that we are meant to feel happy for Arthur that he has followed his heart. Yet the way in which he rejects his fiancée, by turning up blind drunk on their wedding day and telling her he doesn't love her, is despicable. She's an innocent in this and genuinely cares for Arthur, but her rejection is cruel, but we are supposed to side with him. This odd mixture of tone is evident through out. Arthur's drunk shtick is funny for five minutes, but for the whole film? Likewise, his snooty butler's withering comments are truly hilarious at first but wear a bit thin. The writers cannot think of anything better to do with him than kill him off. Yet he remains the reason why so many fondly remember this film. The butler's importance to the film is evident by how bad the ending is without his presence. It is here where the poor writing becomes most obvious. As stated, Arthur, who has previously sobered up, arrives blind drunk at his wedding. Are we meant to laugh at this or feel sorry for him? Should we think his return to alcohol is a regression or an advance? Having Arthur turn up sober and in a dignified way informing the family that he could not go through with it would have shown his character maturing. But my guess is that to the writers drunk=funny and drunk on his wedding day=double funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic? Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed the beginning of the movie, but what I saw of it was quite enough. The supporting cast, especially Shakespearean actor John Gielgud as Arthur's sarcastic butler, did a good job, but the main characters unfortunately brought the movie down.Arthur, the star, is a rich happy drunk with no ambition, and his family arranges him to marry a rich woman whom he does not love, but he must go through with it or lose his chance of inheriting the family fortune. Along the way he meets a waitress/struggling actress whom he does fall in love with. What to do? The movie's major problem is that we're supposed to find a man with a drinking problem humorous. Trouble is, drunkards are not happy people-see "Leaving Las Vegas" to show how having a drinking problem is really like. Not fun at all. Arthur's butler shows real concern for him, and Arthur redeems himself by his showing concern for him as he dies-but the redemption is temporary. In the end he shows up drunk at his wedding and publicly humiliates his bride. Ha, ha. Of course he will get his fortune anyway in the end.The other problem is Liza Minelli as the girlfriend. Her career only existed because her father, director Vincent Minelli, pushed her into her acting career, as she looks ugly and is a weak actress. Seeing her is as appealing as eating an average worm sandwich. (Though admittedly the movie would have been a turkey no matter who played the girlfriend.)</fullReview>

I never laughed once, and I became bored less than halfway through the movie. Perhaps my biggest problem with this film involved the characters. I mean, the ones that we're SUPPOSED to like included a raging alcoholic, a shoplifter, and a snobby butler. Still, the movie could have been a success if they had been involved in humorous situations, or even if they had the occasional funny line. Unfortunately, this film is nowhere near as funny as the title character thinks he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Arthur on TV numerous times I laughed so hard Dudley Moore's role as Arthur a happy go luck drunken millionaire was hysterical but John Gielgud as his servant/ father figure Hobson was equally charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the passage of nearly 27 years it's still as enjoyable as it ever was Liza Minnelli's role as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic.Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like the national debt he has no desire to grow up and enjoys acting like a child. His activities are supervised by his dry English butler Hobson (Gielgud) it appears that nobody really cares about Arthur except for him, Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he doesn't marry the dreadful blonde socialite Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) in four weeks he'll cut off his son's inheritance of 750 million dollars.However Arthur meets and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli)a young working class waitress and tie thief,now he faces a difficult decision marry for love or money. When Hobson dies Arthur finally grows up and breaks it off with Susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep both the money and his true love.Arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for for everyone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically under-utilised asset the late Dudley Moore was. There should be a dozen movies like this in our archive.He was already top-notch talent before he went to Hollywood, both as a comedian and a musician. But mostly he is remembered for his pairing with Peter Cook, on television and in one or two indifferent British movies. Perhaps the best of these was 'Bedazzled'. He always tended to be eclipsed by Cook, who's jealousy and meanness rifted their partnership and enabled Moore to realise his true potential in America. 'Arthur' is the result. This is a truly splendid movie. Moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. The script is perfectly suited to his manner with lot's of hilarious, almost surreal conversational digressions. There is something so British about him that I'm actually surprised he found such an appeal to American tastes. Tommy Cooper, an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank. It is Moore's almost childish vulnerability that is so endearing.Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play straight roles against him, but still have some excellent one-liners. John Guilgud in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and acerbic authority that is a treasure to watch. He invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his Oscar. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he has never played any other comic role.There is a follow-up movie called 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. It never attains the same sublime levels of fun that this one reaches, but it is still rather good even so. Guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost. It is darker. And there is some interesting soul-searching. It will disappoint if you watch 'Arthur' first.Hollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly Dudley after these two outings. He eventually returned to Britain, dejected and apparently dying.But 'Arthur' is a sample of what might have been. We can only imagine the other great movies he should have made.Your're sadly missed, Dudley.</fullReview>

Arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird).This is a damn funny film. I watched this film because a very famous Indian film 'Sharabee' is based on the character of Arthur. Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur' I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. Its very corny at times. There are so many fantastic one liners in the film. Its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiancé's father and he keeps talking about the 'moose'. Duddley Moore sure has some comic timing. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a 'small' country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud got an Oscar for this film. I don't know that actor. I don't think he did a great job but may be if I watched more of his work I may agree in future.

Geraldine Fitzgerald gave a superior performance as always and dear Liza Minnelli once again showed the world her wonderful talents. If only the sequel could have matched this film...it didn't, so I will always treasure this original as something truly special. Sadly Ms. Fitzgerald, Sir John and Mr. Moore have all passed away so I feel a great loss once again in the movie industry. Thankfully Liza Minnelli still delights us with an occasional appearance. She is seriously missed as I feel that once again given the right vehicle she could've wowed the world with another "Cabaret" type film. For anyone who didn't see Cabaret, it is definitely a must-see. If you like good solid comedy you'll just love "Arthur".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arthur is a millionaire. He likes to drink and pick up hookers. His disapproving father wants him to get married and settle down with a girl who truly does love him, but Arthur doesn't love her. His grandmother threatens to cut him off financially if Arthur doesn't marry the girl. It's just that Arthur has met a girl he actually likes, but granny wouldn't approve of her.This is a truly well written little comedy gem that doesn't seem to be as highly regarded as it should be. The real reason the film works so well is because of the performers. Dudley Moore is simply perfect as Arthur. He makes a genuinely tiresome character seem fresh and funny at all times, and his drunken state is expertly well acted. Moore was never better than here. Liza Minelli is a hoot as Arthur's love interest. Sporting some great one-liners to go along with her charm, it's not hard to see why Arthur would fall in love with her, she's utterly charming. But the scene stealer here is John Gielgud, playing Arthur's butler and only real friend. He's so well written and Gielgud plays him to perfection, witty and feisty, a real gem of a character.The film is both very funny and a little sad, all aspects well handled by the director.

Dudley Moore sadly died in 2002 but we can remember him through watching his many memorable performances, such as "Arthur" and "Arthur 2." This film brings back memories of the heyday of comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a review ... just a statement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a review because so many others have already given the perfect review for this movie. I love this movie (give it a 9). The reason I am writing this is just to make sure that someone mentions that one of the funniest scenes in movie history is mentioned : It's the scene where Arthur goes to get engaged, while being drunk. He speaks with his future father-in-law's butler, and then even more funny, his future father-in-law. (it's the scene in the den with the moose head). Dudley Moore is SOOOO funny in this scene (and the whole movie).I still laugh out loud after seeing that scene about fifty times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't even say how many times I have watched it but I always laugh myself to tears every time I see this movie! It is also such a cute love story. Dudley Moore, Liza Minelli and John Gielgood are all so funny! Arthur 2 is almost as funny too. I wish I know more couples like the hysterical couple Dudley &amp; Liza play in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, good fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This extremely funny movie has great performances from three very talented actors that really account for the bulk of the movie's worth. Dudley Moore, Liza Minnelli, and Sir John Gielgud all turn in quality performances; especially Mr. Moore, who spends the majority of the movie drunk. I'm not sure I've ever seen a funnier drunk in a movie than in this one. The sound of Mr. Moore's voice alone made me laugh, as well as his witty jokes directed at the characters around him. Every facial expression, every joke, every glance really delivers in this movie to give an honest and very genuine comedy that can appeal to almost anyone. Mr. Gielgud adds a very classy touch to the movie, which makes us feel as if we're watching something very highbrow and not just a slapstick comedy. This is not to say that Mr. Moore is not high class, he is in fact; but Gielgud gives us a sense that we are watching a movie featuring a Shakespearean actor who is giving us the privilege of watching him act, rather than us giving him the privilege of watching him. Ms. Minnelli adds some sense of realism to the movie, which spends much of its time living in the world-perhaps the fantasy world for most of us-of a billionaire (okay not quite billionaire, but what's the difference when you get that high?). Arthur Bach, Mr. Moore's character in the film, has many similarities with the modern day personality that we know as Richie Rich. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the idea of Richie Rich came from this movie. Anyway, if you're looking for a witty, well-acted comedy, this will no doubt satisfy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dudley Moore should have had an Oscar for this. He was nominated for one, and John Gielgud deservedly got one. Here, the Shakespearean actor fills Peter Cook's role as Arthur's loyal man servant, Hobson, getting the loveable drunkard off the wonky and wide, and onto the straight and narrow. He almost out shines Dudley, but not quite. This touching, funny film "solidified his standing as one of the most gifted comedians ever." He's very under rated. Judy Garland's daughter is also brilliant here.</fullReview>

Good one, but one of many."Space Invaders!" A good film to see if you need to laugh."I'll cover for you." "Don't you wish you were me? I know I do." "You must have hated this moose."

		<shortDescription>Great Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dudley Moore, or "The Knighted Late great Dudley Moore" had to have been one of the greatest actors of my time. I am only 22 and I'm an actor in theater for now and I know good actors when I see them and he's just one of the best. This film is wonderful. Its the kind of movie that can cheer you up when your down and depressed. But Moore himself could always cheer me up from Arthur to Blame it on the Bellboy. This film is comedic genius and It was made in a time where great actors were appreciated. Liza Minnelli is also wonderful and shows her true charm and beauty in this film. it's sad for me now when I see a Moore film because It was such a waste of great talent when he developed his illness and it was one more of the greatst actors to be gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simply superb piece of comedic screen writing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the finest written...then acted...comedies ever done. The script/resulting film, written by the late Steve Gordon, is so well conceived/executed that it takes several screening to "catch" the myriad of superb comedy. So much so, that many of the film's "one-liners" (e.g., "I'll alert the media," "I mean a SMALL country...Rhode Island could kick the (stuff) out of them," "Isn't fun the best thing to have?!," Where is the rest of this moose," "bet ya never run out of ice your whole life," "Hooker?!?; and I thought I was doing so well..." et cetera) have become part of today's jargon. One of the few flicks that made us laugh out loud...and continues to do so now. What a sad sad shame that writer/director Gordon passed away at such a young age. ("Self fulfilling prophesy" of the driven author; given an overwhelming family history of early death from cardiology problems.) As was the same sad fate of George Gershwin...we'll never know how many more screenplays Mr. Gordon could have provided us to view...and laugh out loud...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovably funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dudley Moore pulls off an absolutely delightful performance as a lovably funny and often drunk rich boy, Arthur Bach, who swoons over pauper lady Linda Marolla, smoothly played by Liza Minnelli.John Gielgud almost steals the show with his impeccable delivery as Hobson, Arthur's valet."Arthur" is on my short personal list of longtime favorite movies because of its ability to make you forget the outside world for a little bit and peek into these people's lives as you watch the film's story unfold.I took a real liking to the film when it first came out (I'd just graduated from high school). My taste for it increased partly because a girl I liked at the time was also fond of it (the girl eventually left Southern California for Baylor U., and we lost touch with one another).Fast forward many, many, many moons later to just a couple of days ago, when I jumped at the chance to watch "Arthur" on cable TV during a trip to see some friends. My friend was channel surfing and found "Arthur." I found myself still liking "Arthur" for its fun, but also for the nice little twists its creators gave to some well-established plot lines."Arthur" is not complex or heady stuff. It's just fun. You can find several redeeming qualities in the characters as you see them evolve. Your funny bone will get a nice workout, too. Sometimes that kind of film is really worth laying down a plug nickel at theater or chilling out for a spell in front of a TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The funniest and the best movie I've ever seen with a brilliant performance put up by Dudley Moore. I sure think he deserves more credit for this film. Its filled with humorous and witty dialogues and the English accent definitely adds to the hilarity. I would highly recommend this movie...and really wish it were re-released on DVD.Throughout the movie, Arthur entertains the audience by finding amusement amidst daily chores and in daily conversation. I think the funniest scene was the proposal to Susan where he actually leaves the ring on the table instead of putting it on her finger and arrival at Linda's house in wee hours of the morning. Hobson unquestionably contributes his humor to the movie especially during the scene in the bathtub where they talk about fish bathing together. Even funnier is when Linda pathologically lies to suit her convienence and get out of trouble !!A sure must see movie to lighten up your day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made me laugh from beginning to end with silly humour coming from the mouth of a Brit, there is no better combination. Dudley Moore's performance is charming and brilliant, but the real painful stomach laughs come from Hobson, a snooty butler. His delivery and timing are flawless and genius. This movie has what I would call realistic characters with smart dialogue and a beautiful soundtrack. This movie is in the same league as Monty python and the holy grail as well as well as fawlty towers and black adder. If you are not a fan of such cinema, than I strongly suggest you avoid this movie at all costs, on the other hand, if you're like me and liked the other things I listed, do yourself a devour and pick this movie up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Fun Two Dollars can Rent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur is one of those movies that after seeing once you can quote forever. Its one of those movies where you can't help but love all the characters. Its one of those movies that can cheer you up when you are upset.Arthur is the richest Drunk in the world. He is next in line for 750 billion dollars. The catch? His family wants to see him grow up a bit. So they are forcing him to marry who he thinks is the most boring person in the world, Susan. I can't tell you her last name, that would be indiscreet *Johnson*.While he and his butler, the every witty Hobson, are out shopping they spy a young woman stealing a tie (Its a perfect crime women don't wear ties!) and they assist her in her getaway. Its one of those love at first sight moments. You see where this is going. He wants to marry Linda, but he's being forced to marry Susan. Half the time he's drunk.Though he is only unreasonable drunk in the times is when he is not with Linda. This is a subtlety of the movie, he is happy with her. Without her, he feels he needs to drink.Throughout the movie we get clues of Hobson's failing health. Hobson is one of the classic film characters, parodied quite often yet people don't realize it. Unfortunately, that is because Arthur is what is known as a 'forgotten classic.' It belongs there with the Comedy greats, like Some Like it Hot, or A Night At the Opera.This is the ideal heartwarming Comedy for everyone. And also, my favorite film of all time.Four Stars, very easily earned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trapped...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As drunken millionaire playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood. As it turned out, the role fit Moore so perfectly, it trapped him as an actor as well. Many disappointments soon followed (including this film's pale sequel), yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture, which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunk scenes are forced, parts of the film are wobbly, but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives Oscar-winner John Gielgud a sly, dryly amusing role as Arthur's valet, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport. Liza Minnelli (as a blue-collar love-interest) is sassy in a low-key and Moore is brash, but deft and lively; he never shook off the shadow of Arthur, but at least we have this document of a career high-point to cherish. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dudley's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. It is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood (the "psycho"-like music at the wedding fight), but the acting overcomes it. The character Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But he develops well into a more mature, well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will. The end is fairly corny, though. I wont give it away, but it could be improved. Worth seeing many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was too young to remmeber when I first saw this movie. But I saw it for like the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to see it. Now my whole family has it memorized. We quote it at least once a day. I absolutly love this movie.I still laugh after all this time. Sure, it's about a really, really drunk millionare that is irresponsible. The whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie. And that he is willing to give it all up for love. I highly recomend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. A lot of laughs. Its hallarious, sweet, and if your a movie buff, it will truely change your idea of "Funny". Watch it with a group of your friends or your family and I promise, you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some Authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh for years to come.It is really hard, in my family, to find a movie that everyone likes. But this movie, I feel, made us closer. And I know it will do the same for you!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought Arthur. I don't know why but I did. I hadn't even seen it. I saw the sequel and remember that being funny so I figured that it couldn't be too bad. 3 tapes for 10 bucks come on it was a deal. I have to stop buying films I haven't seen. Anyway, Arthur wasn't the charming laugh a minute movie I was expecting. It wasn't bad, but it didn't deserve a place on my shelf. The beginning is the funniest part, with Arthur picking up a hooker and taking her to a nice restuarant. This aside, the movie is only entertaining in brief little moments. Liza is just plain scary. She's almost like the female Michael Jackson. Overall the movie drags out and asks you to really like these characters. I couldn't wait to turn them off. John Gielgud makes the parts with him worthwhile but unfortunatly there aren't enough of those parts. Bottom Line: Arthur doesn't suck. Suck is too strong a word. Arthur disappoints. That's better. Nice soft language for a disappointing comedy.</fullReview>

Not just of the 90 movies on the list I've seen, but of any movie I've ever seen. Drunks are funny sometimes, Dudley isn't. Liza almost made it worthwhile, but alas... just go watch Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny? I would highly recommend almost ANY other movie on the AFI's top 100 comedies for more laughs than this. If you want to see a funnier "drunk", try The Thin Man. Funnier movie in general, any Marx Brothers movie will kill (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is the film funny? Yes and no. I did chuckle a few times. The script does have some funny bits and you can't help but be amused at how much of a smart-ass Arthur is. He actually does have intelligence, he just chooses to be snarky. ($999,000 dollars? I thought a million would be vulgar). The third act kind of jumps around a bit once Arthur tries to become a better person but it just leaves the audience in a state of confusion --- is he doing this or is he doing this? Is he picking the money or is he picking the woman? It's a very poor showing of resolution and worse yet, it's still extremely predictable.The thing I like the most about Arthur is Dudley Moore. He gives a top-notch performance, as always and I love that they cast him instead of someone else. I applauded the filmmakers for making this change because it made the film seem a little fresh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arthur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember trying a few minutes of this film, I'm very surprised I didn't watch all of it, from director Steve Gordon, his only film directed before dying of heart failure. Basically Arthur Bach (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Dudley Moore) is the happy drunk millionaire with everything he could want, a mansion, a butler Hobson (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Sir John Gielgud), and plenty of booze. He is to inherit $750,000,000 if he marries the daughter of fellow millionaire Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliott), they woman he and the family have chosen, Susan (Jill Eikenberry). But instead, Arthur finds himself falling for Queens waitress Linda Marolla (Golden Globe nominated Liza Minnelli), which of course is threatening the inheritance, and 3/4 of his family's fortune from father Stanford (Thomas Barbour) and Aunt Martha (Geraldine Fitzgerald). After the death of Hobson, Arthur, on the day of the wedding, disobeys the family's wishes, but Aunt Martha still gives Arthur the inheritance to live happily ever after with true love Linda. Also starring Ted Ross as Bitterman, Barney Martin as Ralph Marolla, Anne De Salvo as Gloria - Hooker, Maurice Copeland as Uncle Peter Bach, Justine Johnston as Aunt Pearl Bach, Florence Tarlow as Mrs. Nesbitt, Marcella Lowery as Harriet - Martha's Maid, John Bentley as Perry and Peter Evans as Preston Langley - Party Guest. Moore is wonderfully funny and a little cringing as the almost always drunk millionaire, Minnelli is likable as the woman he loves, and Gielgud of course makes a great Oscar winning impression as Moore's humorous humble sarcastic servant, a terrific screwball comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Song for "Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)" (it also won the Golden Globe) (it was number 79 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), and it was nominated Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Burt Bacharach, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Sir John Gielgud was number 35 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 53 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a review of the film per se, but...What made this film so special to me (and still does) is that, after the "relevance" movement of the '60's, and the indifferent cynicism of the '70's, the arrival of "ARTHUR" signaled, I had hoped, a return to films of charm, and pure entertainment. Charm... think of that word, and you will be hard pressed to find anything in popular "entertainment" to which it would be appropriately applied. Alas, it was not to be, and "Arthur" virtually stands alone, as a brief island of hope, in a sea of the vulgar, pretentious, vapid, and peurile."Arthur" should be seen by all, preferably at a young age, with the hope that it would engender an interest in entertainment of an earlier time, of romance and fancy, charming, and at once, simple and profound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.K. Lets just get it out in the open, Arthur is a fantastic movie. It is one of the funniest, most warmest movies ever made. All credit must go to Dudley Moore, his performance as deminuitive Arthur is a towering one. He cackles and laughs and falls out of Chauffer driven cars and falls over hedges throughout the movie. Moores performance is one in a lifetime. He had fun making the film and we have fun watching him have fun. His performance is definitely Oscar worthy. Favourite line "I race Cars, I get Drunk i fondle Women. BUT iam my own boss and i have the weekends off". Steve Gordon also handles the direction spiritedly and funnily. It is a shame he died so soon after Arthur was amde because he showed enormous potential and other Arthur movies would have benefited from his input.As the movie develops we meet Arthurs best friend in the world Hobson, played by the imaculate Sir John Gielguid. Unlike Moore he did win an Oscar for his performance in the movie. Just like Moore he deserved it. Hobson is deliciously funny throughout the film. Just as effective is Liza Minelli as the Kookie Love interest Linda. As she says to Arthur "Who are you? Santas Little Helper?". Arthur wont marry his fiancee because of his devotion for Linda, and is threatened with loosing his billions if he refuses. As the movie develops we learn that Arthur is not in fact in love with Linda, it is Hobson he loves. This is not to say that he is Homos-sexual in anyway, but Hobson allows Arthur to be who he wants to be.The movie whisks along and is funny and dramatic and is met with one of Burt Bacarachs finest ever scores and one of the greatest musical numbers ever written for the screen : The Best that you Can Do [Arthurs Theme] performed by Christopher cross.Thankyou Dudley Moore</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you saw this movie, you probably said to yourself "Does this person act just like Arthur? All overgrown, insensitive, and sordid?" Eventually the answer to your own question was YES! WAY before these disreputable celebrities that were familiar came around; their was Arthur Bach. A fictitious Enligsh character who everyone in his family wish would grow up and quit making a odious disgrace of himself. Namely is valet who has been his best friend since he was a child. (More fatherly to him than even his real father.) The late Dudley Moore portrays Arthur nicely and makes him even show his serious side nearing the end.Liza Maneilli plays a believable aspiring actress who is a bit of a trouble maker herself. But still has class, intelligence, and dignity. John Gielgud who portrays Hobson the valet is wonderfully brilliant and funny at times... and touching. The rest of the cast is good as well.Overall this movie isn't that bad and is great for watching when you have nothing much else to do during your spare time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rich drunk must pick a wife. This comedy is a laugh riot. Unfortunately, the one doing the laughing is the title character, who is overcome by fits of laughter at his own jokes, which are consistently lame. In fact, the film is lame in every respect. Moore is supposed to be lovable, but comes across as an immature jerk. Minnelli doesn't fare any better as the woman Arthur inexplicably falls flat for. The only one worth watching here is Gielgud in his Oscar-winning performance as Arthur's wise-cracking butler. On a sad note, this was the only film directed by Gordon, also the writer, who died a year later at age 43.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Retarded Dudley Moore Is NOT Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a massive fan of Dudly Moore fan cinema. Having watched over 1,400 Dudly Moore films and having heard of Arthur and reading the IMDb reviews, I was expecting an enjoyable film. In addition, I was excited to see Dudly Moore and Guilgood play off of each other.After the opening sequence the viewer will recognize that this film explores wildly unrealistic outcomes for the benefit of entertainment value ? and it works for about 20 minutes. At that point this viewer was thoroughly hooked.Afterwards, my enjoyment was severely crippled when Moore's character loses his memory and starts acting like a fruity brainless halfwit. Seriously, he acts like a mentally retarded 5-year-old who likes chocolate. Now don't misunderstand me ? I love chocolate too, but to see Moore munching on cocoa bars while acting the imbecile does not qualify as cinematic entertainment. Five minutes after this plot development was introduced, I was praying that Moore would snap out of it very quickly.I apparently should have known better. This stupid plot line drags on for 75 friggin' minutes and single-handedly destroys the entire film. It should not be surprising that the screenplay was written by Steve Gordon, who gave us the utterly overrated piece of crap-infested garbage known as The One and Only (1975) and other subpar efforts like "Chico and the Man" , "Good Time Harry" , as well as other superlative pieces of trash like "Barney Miller". His only good script was Arthur 2: On the Rocks (1989), but then again, even a broken clock is right twice a day.The fact is simply that Steve Gordon couldn't come up with good material, so he made Dudly Moore a certifiable lunatic who does lots of stupid things that have no comedic value whatsoever. It's much easier than coming up with a clever screenplay.I'm truly perplexed at the raving reviews of Arthur here. Does everyone really enjoy seeing Dudley Moore act like an annoying retard for 75 minutes? It's simply unbearable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drunks are never charming, and rarely funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A huge hit at the time of its release. Opinions since have been split. Put me on the side that hates it. I just can't find drunk people charming or hilarious. To me, they pretty much instantly cross into the realm of obnoxious. I almost immediately want to sock any drunk person who gets in my face. Dudley Moore's Arthur is such an unlikeable character that I could never get past him to enjoy any other aspect of the film. Sure, John Gielgud can be kind of funny, but I don't think I laughed at him (or anything else in the film) even once. Liza Minnelli is charmingly quirky, but has nothing to do, as Arthur's love interest. In short, it kind of sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gunshot movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out, and I quite enjoyed it, but there was something about it that bothered me. I watched it again on TV recently, and I still quite enjoyed it, but there was still something about it that bothered me. I have only just figured out what it is. Everyone in the film looks as though they are working at gunpoint. Except Dudley Moore, who looks genuinely drunk throughout, but that idea falls down, because drunks are boring, and Dud is fun. No, there is a certain sense of 'let's just be professional, and do our best, and maybe they'll let our families go.' I'm sure that is not what happened, but something seems to hang over the production, and it there's some discomfort along with the entertainment.Once we're over the mild novelty of Sir John Geilgud reciting cuss-words, his performance isn't entirely convincing, and his appearance in this movie seems a little desperate.The dodgiest performance comes from Geraldine Fitzgerald, who, as Arthur's eccentric aged relative, seems like someone quite young, under some bad ageing make-up...but no, I see she was near seventy at the time this movie was made, so I don't know what happened there.Liza Minelli seems a little too vibrant for this strangely-paced film, and although she has scenes with Geilgud's character, they seem to belong in separate universes, or as though they were cartoons rendered by artists with completely differing styles.Most of the other comments on this movie have been very complimentary, and I feel I am being a misery here, but there you go.Oh, and why would Arthur and Linda have to starve if his family cut him off without a cent? Arthur (like Dud) is a brilliant pianist, and he could make a fortune tickling the ivories! Anyway, the movie made enough money to generate a sequel - now that was a miserable experience!</fullReview>
