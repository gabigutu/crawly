		<fullReview>The central relationship of the adoring street-wise kid (Cooper) and his devoted, boozing, gambling ex-champ Dad (Beery) is astonishing. We are observing behavior here, not acting. Cooper gives the best child performance I've ever seen and Beery is utterly human, flawed and unforgettable.This film is full of terrific moments - comedy and heartbreak. The friendship between Cooper and his black pal is beautifully color-blind. When Cooper states, "He's colored," it's with a child's open, untainted honesty. I find King Vidor's films to always resonate with humanity and compassion. He was one of our greatest filmmakers as Frances Marion was one of our greatest screenwriters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film with a ton of heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former heavyweight champ Andy Purcell goes down to Tijuana in hopes of getting a fight. Andy's son, Dink, watches his father train, but Andy gives into his vices of gin and gambling, which constantly gets him in trouble. Andy wins Dink a race horse, which is entered in a race, where Andy meets his ex-wife Linda (with her current husband Tony) at the track and wants to be reunited with her son (Dink) and give him a better life outside of the one Andy gives him. Andy gets arrested and thrown in jail, where he decides that Dink would be best living with his mother, which devastates Dink (who idolizes his father). Andy is released from jail (thanks to Tony &amp; Linda)and gets a bout with the Mexican heavyweight champ, where Dink runs back to his father to watch him hopefully win the fight, even though he is out of shape and not at the level of his opponent. The film is a toughing piece of cinematic brilliance, despite the static camera-work (very uncharacteristic of King Vidor). Beery and Cooper work so well together and their performances are what makes this film a classic. The script does not lose anything in the 70 plus years since its release. If the ending doesn't make you shed tears, you have to be a robot. Rating, 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blueprint Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Champ' seems to have been a blueprint film for all the others of the tough-tender school that followed it, and - owing entirely to Jackie Cooper's playing perfectly off of Wallace Beery's has-been, alcoholic pug - it's perfectly charming.Yes, the fight scene is rather hokey: had they tried to use Wallace Beery's telegraphed-the-day-before roundhouse punches, even the toe-to-toe sluggers of 'The Champ's bygone day wouldn't have survived one round in the ring. But the film isn't about the fight scene, it's about the love of father for son and son for father - and to this day 'The Champ's' story artfully delivers its soft knock-out blow with tender sucker punches and love-taps to the heart.Compared with today's fare 'The Champ's' pacing is slow but the time taken works nicely, especially in the one-on-one scenes captivatingly played by Cooper and Beery.There's plenty of archetypal King Vidor composition-in-frame that's still imitated today, and in many instances the lighting is exemplary of the gorgeous black &amp; white textural artistry of Hollywood's Golden Age. Lovers of classic B&amp;W work might want to grab more than a few frames from the DVD.Beery's work is quite good here, but Jackie Cooper's remarkable, potent chops steal the show - and your heart; though 'The Champ' has a good many fine, classical attributes there's none better in it than Cooper's unforgettable performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen the 1979 remake starring Jon Voigt and Faye Dunaway (the female part was much more important ) and I was not that impressed.Jon Voigt was too good-looking and too handsome to portray the champ successfully.The original really blew my mind:the Wallace Beery /Jackie Cooper team was a winning one and it's one of the best pairings man/boy in the history of cinema ,with echoes of Charlie Chaplin's "the kid" .Although the movie takes place in the prizefighters milieu,the plot is pure melodrama ,mainly aimed at the female audience .The reactionary side of the melodrama -the posh lady horrified at the people around her boy, a "normal" wealthy family is the safe way to happiness,etc- is present but emotion survives the tear-jerker side .And I dare you not to shed a tear when the boy screams "I want the champ!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wallace Beery Should Have Shared The Oscar With Jackie Cooper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the greatest disconnect among film personalities in history is that of Wallace Beery. On the screen he played these lovable oaf types, even when he was a bad guy. Off the screen he was a violent man, given to fits of temper and I can't recall anyone having a good word to say about him. Possibly for that reason Beery could lay claim to the fact he was the greatest actor in films. The crowning achievement of his career was his Oscar winning performance in The Champ.Of course Beery could not have done it without little Jackie Cooper as well. It's their scenes together that make the film as memorable as it is. Instead of splitting the Academy Award with Fredric March who was also awarded The Best Actor for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, possibly Beery should have given half of his half to Cooper.Beery is actually a former champ in this film. He's an over the hill, alcoholic pug who lives a hand to mouth existence with his young son Cooper. He split from his wife Irene Rich years ago, taking Cooper and she'd like to get him back. She's pretty well fixed now with a new and rich husband and a daughter by that marriage. The fly in the ointment is that Cooper is really attached to his father and blind to the faults he has. And Beery really does love his son, the only really happy part about his life. He's probably way too old to be seriously in the fight game, but he needs the dough for his kid.The Champ is guaranteed four handkerchief film even now almost eighty years after its debut. A remake was done in 1979 with Jon Voight and Rick Schroder in the main two roles, but it wasn't a patch on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good film - still looks good today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!Hard to believe it's as old as 1931, in a lot of ways. As far as production, it's about what you'd see, today, except it's in black and white. And it could be a movie, today - save that it would highlight the bums that get thrown up against title holders - unlike Stallone's Rocky, who was in pretty good fighting shape and had a few moves. Beery seems out of his element as a fighter - looking at best like a beery (no pun intended) brawler, though his character plays the ex-heavyweight champ. But then, the athleticism of the era wasn't what it is today. On the other hand, there were some great fighters in the 20s and 30s, and Beery's shape and skill is out of their class, entirely. Anyhow - small gripe, perhaps. One might excuse Beery, in the championship fight, just as the bum thrown in to boost the Mexican champ's rating - as is done, today. I don't see it necessarily played up that way in the film. But I might have missed something.Some things also bring home the era of this film. For ex., the effort, it seems, to mimic the newsreel footage from the theaters of the day, by slowing down the film rate, thus artificially speeding up the action. We see this sort of 'newsreel' effect at both the horse race and the concluding championship fight. There's also an interesting 2 or 3 second montage during the fight which strikes me as 60s style film-making, or later. But it's just 2 or 3 seconds. Generally - it's a good looking film. It plays well, even today.The subplot with the black boy, who hangs about with the young Purcell, and the other kids - an inspiration (perhaps?) for the 'our gang' crew that followed first in theatrical shorts a few years later? - is clearly intended to encourage racial tolerance, and repel a bigotry which was openly and boldly part of the fabric of world culture in the 1930s and before. The little black boy doesn't roll his eyes, or do goofy things, or talk in a slow drawl, or any of the rest. He just acts normally. When 'Dinkus' Purcell (the Jackie Cooper character) unknowingly runs into his divorced Mom, whom his Dad never much mentioned and never identified for the kid, she asks - who's your friend? 'Dink' replies, and then comments - "He's colored." And Mom/strange lady replies - "And what a pretty color." Again, just clearly something important to the story, and very out of touch, and actively opposed to the ethic of the time.As for the rest of the story, it's basically a child custody story, about the love and affection of the child in question, with the death of one of the disputants the resolution and which enables the emotional concluding scene where 'Dink', who had kept an arm's length from Mom (once she told him who she was) in favor of his Dad (whom he knew and loved), breaks down at the sudden loss of his father, lying dead on the training table, and for the first time tearfully cries out, "Mother," and then rushes to her. She carries him out through a gauntlet of reporters and onlookers - bringing down the curtain. The End.There's not much to quarrel with in the story. It is a coincidence that the ex and her new husband run into The Champ, Andy, at the south of the border race track. But coincidence can happen, and does. It is somewhat difficult to believe that an out of shape, fairly weak, and uncoordinated brawler, as Beery is in the ring, could land the lucky punch against a fighter in trim shape, enough to take him out for the full count. But, that's the story, that's Hollywood, that's Rocky, and - what the hey.It might have been interesting to see brother and sister interact a little more. Cooper's oddly adult inflections and mannerisms seem to play well against the spoiled but good natured little girl - just happy to have a 'new' brother. It might have been interesting to see the game in which Andy wins so much, and the horse he eventually fights to get back. Might have been interesting to see Andy and Dink out and about, a little more, rather than just 'in training' or in the flat. And so on, so forth.It's clear why Beery got the nod for the award. He seems to have had a sort of Long John Silver, sort of patronizing, slow-talking 'rap'. in various films. Here, save for a few instances, he plays it pretty low key. He seems just like a regular guy in the Mexican prison, thinking over his part in the custody dispute, and thinking he's just not the father for Dink. And when Dink comes to the cell, and Andy tells him to 'shove off', basically, it's believable, with just the right tone, delay, cliched delivery, and choked back tears. When he takes the money from Linda's rich hubby, he comments on being down on his luck, and almost lapses into Long John - but just not quite. And surely he spoke for a fair number in the audience in the early first years of The Great Depression.It's a good film. The emotional manipulation is right up on the surface, and may be a bit too trite and obvious; particularly as the extraneous 'background' scenes I might like to see, as suggested above, just weren't there. The film was 'tight' and 'stayed on message' in that way. And it feels right, almost. It has its flaws, but remains a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beery &amp; Cooper An Interesting Pair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie it was my first look at either Wallace Beery or Jackie Cooper. I found both of them very interesting to watch. I also found out why Bob Hope and Jack Benny used to make a lot of sarcastic lines about "being about as pretty as Wallace Beery." He definitely had an ugly "mug." However, he was a lovable loser, at least in this film.Cooper played "Dink," a cocky little kid who just loved "The Champ" (Beery). On the VHS tape, Cooper's squeaky little voice did not come across well and often was annoying to hear.The boxing scenes were hokey but I liked the ending because at least Beery won the fight, although he collapses afterward. I believe he lost in the re-make of this with Jon Voight and Ricky Shroder in the 1979 film, but I'm not sure.The kid's devotion to the champ, even under the toughest of situations, was touching. With clearer sound and picture, I would have kept the tape. I should check out the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the worst years of the depression, the most popular stars were not the most glamorous or attractive. As revealed in the highly respected Quigley poll (which surveyed movie theatre owners on who their audiences were most likely to come and see), the biggest draws in the early 30s were friendly, earthy types whom audiences could relate to at a time of poverty and desperation. These included genial comic Will Rogers, middle-aged frump Marie Dressler, and burly pug-face Wallace Beery, who played his greatest role in 1931 feature The Champ.Beery's physique meant he was often cast as villainous thugs, but he had demonstrated enough acting prowess to get a decent number of "gentle giant" lead roles. In The Champ he gets to combine the two, one minute the swaggering pugilist, the next a devoted father. He gives a performance full of tiny gestures, expertly dancing from one expression to another. When he gets to show his character's emotional vulnerability, the scene is doubly poignant coming after the macho confidence he normally displays. The knowledge that off the set Beery was reputedly a wife-beating brute who bullied everyone around him perhaps spoils the effect slightly, but even with this in mind his performance is captivating, believable and utterly flawless.Supporting Beery behind the camera is a director who was both a poet and a craftsman of the cinema ? King Vidor. Vidor excelled at coaxing naturalism from his players at a time when theatrical hamming was the par. His camera focuses on Beery for long takes, allowing the actor to potter about doing his little bits of business and developing the character. Vidor also gives the picture bite with some neat tracking shots. These are usually in the field of depth, so in other words we are either backing away from the actors or following them. The former kind, with the players advancing on the camera as in the shot that opens the picture, gives the characters presence and show them as a force to be reckoned with. The latter kind, where the camera follows the character, physically pulls us into their world. Vidor used these kinds of shot a lot, and they are a neat way of making the audience feel involved without drawing too much attention to the artificiality of the form.It may come as a surprise that this story of male bonding was written by a woman, Frances Marion. But like Beery, Marion defied expectations simply by being very good at what she did. Her plot for The Champ earned her the second of her two Oscars. It does not perhaps describe the most realistic of situations, but the emotional content is very sincere, and its depiction of determination and human feeling during hard times must have struck a chord with audiences of the day. The dialogue, which is credited to three separate people, is appropriately punchy with lines that sound believable yet are memorable and evocative.Aside from Beery, the rest of the cast are a good bunch. Of all the lead players, Irene Rich is the only one who doesn't stand out, and she seems simply there to fill the wealthy, motherly type. But having said that she is not at all bad and her presence doesn't harm the picture. The Champ also sees Roscoe Ates in one of his largest roles, and for once getting to appear as a normal person rather than the stuttering fool he was usually required to play. Finally there is Jackie Cooper, one of the greatest child stars of his or indeed any era. While it seems clear that fame has gone to the youngster's head (he's not quite as good as he thinks he is), he is certainly up to the task of carrying his end of the picture. He plays a genuine child when with Beery, but when he is around others he deepens his voice and adopts mannerisms as if trying to be an adult. It's a touching and appropriate performance and very suited to the tone of the picture. And this was perhaps also the only time in which a child actor like Cooper could become a personality in his own right. As the popularity of Beery, Dressler et al proves, this was the age of the unconventional superstar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A three hanky movie that will also make you laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This almost eighty-year old film will bring both a tear and a smile. It is the story of washed-up and somewhat alcoholic boxer Andy Purcell (Wallace Beery), just known as "Champ" to everyone, including his adoring little son, "Dink", played by Jackie Cooper. It's as though life has really ceased to have meaning for the Champ ever since he lost his championship status. The only thing that continues to give his life meaning is his son. The Champ isn't exactly providing a wholesome environment for Dink. Dink hangs out in pool halls with his Dad, isn't enrolled in school, and sits up nights alone in their dingy room waiting for the Champ to come home when he is out on a drinking binge. Champ's ex-wife, socialite Linda, sees Andy and Dink at the racetrack one day and tries to convince Andy that Dink would be better off with her. At first the Champ is unpersuaded. However, when he gets a hold of a good sum of money and gambles it away and winds up in the drunk tank overnight he decides that maybe it is for the best if Dink goes with Linda.Wallace Beery had some lean times after motion pictures transitioned to sound, however he got a new lease on his career at MGM, and it turned out that his coarse voice attracted fans rather than repelled them. He won a well-deserved Best Actor award for his role, but if there had been a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1931 it would have gone to nine-year old Jackie Cooper. He is comic as the street-wise kid meeting his half-sister for the first time - "The dame is goofy" he remarks. He is heart-rending when the Champ tells him he doesn't want him around any more, that he's tired of feeding him, just so he'll go with his mother.A minor point that made this film so refreshing for me is that nobody tries to "lawyer up" or turn Dink's fate into a courtroom battle. Everyone deals with everyone else in this film on decent human terms. In the end the Champ tries to regain the championship so he can provide a good life for his son and so that his son can respect him, not so that he can win a custody fight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit dated but it still packs an emotional wallop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Champ" is an old-time melodrama--the sort of picture they don't make any more but also the sort of thing folks loved back in the day. Compared to most films today, it's a bit heavy on the schmaltz and heavy-handed. However, despite its being a tad dated, the film STILL packs a nice emotional wallop and is well worth your time--even with its defects.Wallace Beery plays 'Champ'--an aging, overweight and somewhat good-for-nothing guy. He drinks, he gambles and he breaks his promises. Yet, despite this, he has something good in his life--his young son, Dink (Jackie Cooper). Dink looks up to him adoringly and looks past his dad's many faults. However, the boy does deserve better--more stability, a better environment and a real home. Later in the film, the boy's mother (who left the boy and remarried when he was too young to remember) returns and wants to raise him herself. Despite her wealth, however, the boy is miserable and longs to be back with Champ. Champ's thinks his only hope is to change his ways, return to the ring and redeem himself in his son's eyes. But the battle sure will be uphill--and his opponent is the Mexican champion. What's to happen? See the film and find out for yourself.It's funny that Wallace Beery won the Oscar for Best Actor. He was horribly out of shape and old--even for this part. They claimed he weighed 210 but looked to be at least 280. Plus, I really think he was repeatedly upstaged by Cooper! Still, I challenge you to watch the film's finale and not feel misty-eyed. Sure, it's saccharine--but very, very good saccharine! Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Box Office Champ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along the California-Mexico border, boxer Wallace Beery (as Andy "Champ" Purcell) is alcoholic, out-of-shape, and unable to fight professionally. Consequently, he and cute son Jackie Cooper (as Dink) are poverty-stricken. Another problem is Mr. Beery's gambling. But, after winning some money, Beery gets young Cooper a racehorse they call "Little Champ" (formerly "Butterfly"). At the track, Cooper meets his mother, Irene Rich (as Linda). Small world. Now married to wealthy Hale Hamilton (as Tony), Ms. Rich decides she wants her son back. Beery refuses to give up Cooper, but his addictions make things difficult...Directed by King Vidor, this won Beery his "Best Actor" Oscar. During the "Academy Award" presentations, Fredric March won for "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1931). Near the end, there was some discord about the award, so they announced Beery had also won by declaring contests finishing within three votes would be considered a tie. March won by a vote and was arguably a more accomplished actor, but Beery's performance here is better. Later, the Academy stopped revealing vote totals, making the new rule moot. He and Cooper, a nominee for the recent "Skippy" (1931), have great chemistry. The ending is classic.******* The Champ (11/0/31) King Vidor ~ Wallace Beery, Jackie Cooper, Irene Rich, Roscoe Ates</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Gee, the Champ's the greatest guy in the whole world!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm kind of surprised actually that there are only twenty five other reviews for the film here as I write this, considering it was Oscar nominated for Best Picture and it earned Wallace Beery a co-Best Actor Award shared with Fredric March for "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", the only time that's ever happened. I'd been waiting for this one to come around again on Turner Classics, so last night I got my chance.In the commentary before the picture, it was noted by hosts Robert Osborne and Drew Barrymore that actor Beery didn't really like kids, much less like working with one. He carried the sentiment over to co-star Jackie Cooper, so it's kind of amazing to watch their on screen chemistry as father and son. They really do seem to adore each other, and in an almost role reversal sort of way, Cooper's character Dink seems more like a parent than his old man. That becomes particularly evident when we see Dink undress his Dad for bed after one of his drunken jags. Beery's portrayal of former Champ Andy Purcell makes it difficult for the viewer to warm up to his character, he's a broken down bum and all around heel with no redeeming social qualities and constantly screws things up in the father-son relationship with Dink.Regarding Beery's casting as The Champ, I found it hard to imagine why he was considered for the role. Though it works for the story, I'd be hard pressed to believe they couldn't find someone who might have fit the role better in terms of physical condition and athletic ability. There's no question the man was severely out of shape, and even though he was written as an over the hill boxer in his Forties, he looked like he might have been in his Sixties (Beery was actually forty six at the time).On the flip side, young Jackie Cooper manages to do it all here, and he'll tug at your heart strings every time he takes it on the chin from his derelict father. There's an interesting scene prior to learning about his mother (Irene Rich) where he's clambering around on a tiled roof and any minute you expect the scene to end in disaster. Cooper blithely plays the scene like your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man before stepping off the roof onto a rail and finally down to the landing. I had to wonder how he made it look so easy.You know, I also have to comment on Dink's friendship with the black youngster Jonah (Jesse Scott). You really have to place yourself back in the Thirties, well before the Civil Rights era to understand how rare this kind of relationship would have been in real life. As director, King Vidor pushed the envelope with this kind of portrayal, similar to the way producer Hal Roach approached the subject with his 'Our Gang' crew. These pioneers were really operating in brand new territory, much to their credit as film makers.As for the ending, well if you're prone to sentimentality you better have a box of hankies handy. In context, it's not really surprising that the Champ would succumb to the stress of his final match, but seeing it play out with Dink breaking down over his loss is a pretty tough experience. It's the kind of ending that delivers a knockout punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good on-screen chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andy Purcell (Wallace Beery) is the former world heavyweight champion past his prime. He's an alcoholic gambler. His son Dink (Jackie Cooper) refuses to give up on him despite his often drunken stupor, his gambling habit, their squalid apartment, and poor decision making. When Andy wins a race horse gamble, he is given a horse which Dink names "Little Champ". He befriends fellow race horse owner Linda Carleton (Irene Rich). Linda turns out to be Andy's former wife and Dink's mother. She's now married to rich Tony and soon realizes their connection. Tony pays Andy for Dink to visit Linda. However he refuses to let Dink stay with the Carletons. After losing the horse in a bad gambling run and eventually sent to jail, Andy finally relents and sends Dink to live with Linda. Dink runs away back to Andy who tries to clean up for a fight.This has some broad comedy that doesn't work for me. The melodrama is a bit too fake and too broad. Beery and Cooper have a nice on screen chemistry. Jackie Cooper has a big presence for such a little size. Beery has his hulking size and that low low voice. Their chemistry is probably the only noteworthy aspect of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Years after watching the 1979 remake, I finally got to see the original 1931 version of The Champ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally watched the original version of The Champ some nearly 35 years after seeing the remake that starred Jon Voight and Ricky Schroder. So I knew the ending wasn't gonna be a happy one. Wallace Beery is the title character who's fallen on hard times and Jackie Cooper is the son he got custody of after splitting from his wife who's now married to a well-off man named Tony. He drinks and gambles and that causes him trouble but Dink (Cooper's character) loves him no matter what. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a touching movie, not unlike that remake I mentioned before though I haven't seen that again for a long time. That fact that Beery was only one vote shy of fellow Oscar winner Frederic March (that's what a tie was considered then) isn't surprising since he's both a little funny and touching, same for Cooper. So on that note, I recommend this version of The Champ. P.S. One time Our Ganger Cooper appears with Marcia Mae Jones here. She was in a couple of the series' shorts after Cooper left. Also, immediately after watching this on DVD, I then listened to the "Lux Radio Theater" version on the same disc that aired on 11/13/1939 with Beery reprising his role though Dink was by then played by Bobby Larson who also appeared in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington that year. Larson's near-age friend of color, Jonah, was played on the show by Matthew "Stymie" Beard, a fellow Our Ganger of Jackie's who first performed with him in the short, Teacher's Pet. Oh, and Tony there was played by Wallace's brother, Noah, father of his same-named son who's best known as James Rockford's father, Rocky, in "The Rockford Files".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper are true champions of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frances Marion wrote scripts for three movies of Wallace Beery and this was her best script for which she won an Academy award. The story is about a down and out boxer who is at the bottom end of the society makes come back for the sake of his idolizing son brilliantly played by Jackie Cooper. This nine year old star of "Our gang" got bigger praise than Beery from the critics, and loud sobbing from the audience. The friendship between Dink (Jackie Cooper) and his black friend Jonah (Jesse Scott) is color blind and another touching part of the movie. This true tear jerker was directed by King Vidor and excellent supporting roles played by Irene Rich, Jesse Scott and Roscoe Ates. The story has an interesting end when Dink finds his real mother who only happens to be wealthy and too willing to care for him. This movie was done with such professionalism in all departments that it was the biggest box office hit in 1931 for MGM studios; much needed revenue for the studio to stay alive at the height of great depression.Another movie inspired by Cooper's "You can do it, dad," phrase of this movie was the "O'Shaughnessy's boy." The script for was pretty much the Jackie Cooper ? Wallace Beery formula but their "Champ" box office hit was not repeated. In 1978, 47 years after this movie, Champ was remade starring Jon Voight and Faye Dunaway, which also did not repeat the success of the original Champ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"a wonderful kid"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackie Cooper was the top child actor at MGM in the early 30s when it was the top studio. He started off as part of "Our Gang" but just a year later was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in "Skippy" (he just lost out to Lionel Barrymore in "A Free Soul"). L. B. Mayer called him "a wonderful kid" and teamed him and Wallace Beery in the emotional and heart wrenching film "The Champ". It has the most tear drenching finale of any film I have ever seen and Jackie Cooper gives an outstanding performance as Dink, the little boy who has an unswerving faith in his hopelessly alcoholic father. The sets have a very gritty and real look - not at all what you would expect from MGM "the dream factory".Little Dink lives with his dad, a washed up fighter who can't stay off the booze. His managers try to talk him up to some promoters, promising that he is the same fighter he always was - Dink's job is to sober him up but unfortunately it doesn't work. Andy "The Champ" has always promised Dink a race horse and when his luck changes, he buys "Lil' Champ" - an old and beat up horse that they train up for a race. The day of the race Dink meets his mother (he or she doesn't realise it), Linda, who has the horse "Blue Boy" next to "Lil' Champ" in the stables. Dink introduces her to his little mate - "he's coloured" he says, "yes, but he's kind of a pretty colour" she replies. (It was interesting that you didn't see her shake hands with the little boy, their hands were out of the camera range).When "Lil' Champ" loses the race, Linda (Irene Rich)realises who Dink is and wants to give him everything that he has missed out on. (Even though Linda seems lovely - her character is portrayed as once having been a gold-digger who only married Andy when he was rich and famous and left him for a more prosperous gentleman when he was down on his luck).Andy is then paid $100 to let Dink visit his mother - while there he sings a few bars of a popular song (Ruth Ettings' "Don't Tell Him What Happened to Me"), meets his step-sister Mary Lou (adorable Marcia Mae Jones) a little cutie who talks to Dink about the reality of fairy tales. After his visit Linda is determined to take Dink away from the unwholesome life he is leading with his dad. Dink and Andy have a magical relationship but after a heartfelt scene Andy convinces Dink to live with his mother, but with Dink away, he loses the will to go on.The ending is the most emotional ever and Jackie Cooper was a genuine star. There will not be a dry eye by the film's end. In an interview, I heard Jackie Cooper say he did not get on with Wallace Beery. They made a few pictures together and were considered a team, adored by the public. Cooper said whenever people stopped him in the street to ask what Beery was really like, he had to lie and say what a wonderful guy he was - he couldn't tell them the truth and spoil their illusion. The previous reviewer was right - Beery was not well liked.Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perhaps the best on screen father/son relationship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(mild spoilers)I had heard that this was a "tearjerker," but i was completely taken in by the simple story and the incredible relationship between Dink and The Champ.I spent the last half of the movie with tears rolling down my cheeks, and i was really struck by a lot of the little details that made the film play much better than a lot of movies nowadays. (And i am not saying that all movies today are bad, hey, i liked the Matrix and Lord of the Rings like everybody else.) But there are little moments, such as the way they hold hands walking out of the gambling joint, or the way Beery takes off his son's shoes and gets him ready for bed, then sits up and looks out the window in despair over having lost everything at the craps table. Just blew me away. The scene in the jail DESTROYED me, as did the final scene. Just such amazing characters, and you couldn't help but feel for them. Beery is such a terrific on screen presence , and Cooper was just a joy to watch. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beery not bad, Cooper excellent, Irene Rich terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just finished watching this film, which I've been wanting to see for years and I was impressed without being overwhelmed. Wallace Beery's not bad (though a bit stilted) in the leading role; he's better than Irene Rich, playing his ex-wife, who throws herself around the screen, swooning from sofa to sofa in a totally over-acted performance. However, it's Jackie Cooper who steals the show with a portrayal which manages to be both heart-rending and realistic. I know the concept of "real sound" is a disputable one, as sounding real on screen may just entail being a good actor, rather than a realistic one, but nonetheless he does seem far more genuine than the rest of the cast. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't imagine what kind an inhuman monster devoid of feelings one would have to be in order to not be moved by this film. Jackie Cooper as Dink and Wallace Beery as his father simply referred to as 'The Champ' is one of the most heartfelt and compelling on screen relationships I've ever seen. A father who is a loser, yet his son worships him despite the father not keeping his promises to stop drinking and gambling, regardless, the father truly loves his son back. Despite his questionable character, as a viewer I still feel a sympathetic liking for the character. With these two I feel I'm observing real human behavior, not acting. The film's naturalistic and unmanufactured feel just doesn't extend to the performances, partially thanks to the widespread use of real world locations. Champ and Dink's bedroom also appears run down and unpolished; it doesn't look like your typical shinny Hollywood interior set; is it even a set at all? The Champ also disproves the misconception of movies from the 1930's being static, right from the opening scene as the camera pans in several unbroken shots, or the sequence in which Champ arises from bed in the morning with the camera following and zooming in on his movements are the room.I initially reacted of dismal when Dink's mother and her husband tries to separate him from The Champ, screaming to myself in my head "how dare you destroy this beautiful relationship!". Thankfully I was glad they just didn't just descend into becoming cliché villains. Child actors typically get on my nerves, not because of the children themselves but because of the way they are portrayed in movies, often as dim witted and overly cutesy (it seems Dink is smart enough that he even drives a full of adults in one scene, even if the steering wheel movements don't match that of the car's). Not here though. Every time Jackie Cooper utters the name of The Champ ("Come on Champ", "I want The Champ!"), I have myself a laugh of joy. Watch and let the waterworks roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little schmatlzy, and the acting is a little overdone (we are talking about Wallace Beery, after all), but I really liked it. When it wanted me to cry, I cried, and didn't feel guilty about it. Beery plays a single father, a former boxer and current bum, living in Tijuana, drinking himself stupid and gambling any dime he gets his hands on away. His five year old son (Jackie Cooper) idolizes him, referring to him as Champ. His mother apparently left when he was a baby, but now she's back, cleaned up and married to a rich man (I like how the past is not overexplained). Thankfully, she's not played as a villain, but she is afraid her son isn't getting the best in life. Cooper is a little annoying, but like an actual five year-old would be annoying. For child actors at the time, he's damned good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #057: The Champ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>057: The Champ (1931) - released 11/9/1931; viewed 5/21/06.The Chinese Soviet Republic is declared by Mao Tse Tung.BIRTHS: Ike Turner.DOUG: King Vidor directs big bad Wallace Beery (Best Actor winner) and little Jackie Cooper in Frances Marion's moving screenplay The Champ. I've read that Wallace Beery was actually a rotten lunkhead offscreen and not really the lovable loser that he always played on screen. I guess little Cooper really was a good actor to make us believe the latter while enduring the former. This is a rare film made during the Depression that actually talks about it; most people preferred films that let them escape from the Depression entirely. Beery's Champ does everything he can to properly raise his son Dink, but he's not very smart, and he's not exactly a great father; he suffers from gambling and alcoholism, and it's often the kid who has to look after the dad. In the end, we forgive the Champ because he really tries, and he really does love that kid. Although he makes a lot of false promises ("I'll never drink again! No more gambling!"), we're behind him all the same because of Beery. At one point, he tries to send Dink to his mother's in a heartwrenching scene; when Dink tearfully refuses to go, Champ slaps him through the bars of his cell. Dink runs away crying, and Champ starts slapping his fist against the concrete wall in shame; he just hit his son! The final fight is quite effective, as he's fighting for a $20,000 purse that will put his son through school. I thought his heart problem could have used more setup. I didn't cry at the end, but dammit, I was close. I'd also like to point out Dink's friend Jonah, a black kid whose character is handled rather tastefully: "That's Jonah. He's colored." "Really? Pretty color." Awwww...KEVIN: Yes, I wept. I really loved The Champ. I was in no danger of dozing off during this film, as I was captivated in every scene. The role of Andy "Champ" Purcell is truly the role of a lifetime for Wallace Beery; I firmly believe that no other actor in history could ever nail this performance so perfectly, so this time the Academy was right for a change. One might say that this story kind of turns the anti-hero sentiment on its side. Rather than a sadistic thug hiding under a dapper exterior, Beery's "Champ" is a washed-out tough guy with a heart of gold. One of the less effective things about the film was the character of Linda, and Irene Rich's performance of her. It's much harder to sympathize with her struggle, even at the end. Fortunately, we don't see too much of her, and Beery and little Jackie Cooper dominate every scene. We see again and again not just that Andy is a loving father, but that he and Dink really take care for each other in ways that no one could understand. That's why it's so heartbreaking at the end when that union is broken forever and both Dink and we in the audience must come to terms with it and look forward to the future.Last film: The Platinum Blonde (1931). Next film: Frankenstein (1931).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film about parents and children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Champ" is a heartwarming experience,with a great performance by Jackie Cooper who steals the whole show.Wallace Beery won an Oscar for his portrayal of the brawling ex-fighter who loves his son deeply. The chemistry between Beery and Cooper is the movie's core. It's nice to see that both the mother and stepfather are portrayed as sympathetic people.Beery's portrayal manages also to convey the flaws in the character of The Champ,which is why we understand how his wife could leave him.But as an ex-boxing champ he's not very believable. The final bout is laughingly choreographed and looks silly. But it is a film I would want to see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What else can be said about this film? It's now getting close to 80 years old, and yet it's still watchable. That's something I guess. It is showing it age, though. While the storyline is incredibly simple, and overall tone is way beyond corny, one thing does stand out, Jackie Cooper's performance. Such a lot of talent in such a little boy. He really did steal the entire show. Beery (and the whole rest of the cast as well, really) pretty much just play hokey, one-dimensional, "cardboard cutout" characters with no real development or growth. They do the numbers, do what's required, and follow the token script as far as it'll go (which isn't very far at all). And then the credits roll up. But, hey, as I mentioned, it IS getting close to 80! Anyway, worth watching if your expectations aren't too high...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film with a Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Champ, The (1931) *** (out of 4) Classic tear-jerker won two Academy Awards including Wallace Beery the Best Actor Oscar as well as a Best Screenplay for Frances Marion. The story centers on a former boxing champ (Beery) and his son (Jackie Cooper) who find themselves on the skids but the father plans on making a comeback so that his son can live a better life. THE CHAMP has been imitated so many times over the past eighty-years that it's easy to forget that this was one of the first of its type. The film has lost some of its impact over those years but you'd have to be dead or a complete robot for its ending not to really get to you. I won't ruin what happens but its impact is incredibly strong and touching. The film isn't the greatest ever made and I was a little surprised that the screenplay won as Oscar as I felt it left a few too many questioned unanswered. At the start of the film we see the father-son relationship and this here is tested when the child's mother (Irene Rich) tries to enter back in his life. I thought the screenplay really bumbled some of the scenes between the mother and the son and I found her attempt to get him back a little silly to say the least. I also thought some of the boxing stuff had a few too many clichés. The boxing drama was rich throughout the silent era and this here really doesn't offer up anything new. With all of that said, the main reason to watch this film are for the performances and there's no question that Beery and Cooper were terrific together. Beery would end up splitting the Best Actor award with Fredric March in DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE but he probably should have split it with Cooper. Both give terrific performances but what makes the film so special isn't their individual performances but instead it's the work they do together. There have been thousands of examples of a father-son relationship but I really can't recall too many that seemed as real as the one here. Beery was perfect for this type of slouch as he can pull off being a slob and make us care for him and his rather dimwitted ways. I don't think it's an insult saying this but Cooper has to be one of the greatest crying kids out there. The way he just breaks down in tears would get under anyones skin as he's so believable in these scenes that you can't help but really feel for the guy. Rich is good in her brief scenes as is Roscoe Ates as one of the champ's assistants. A lot of what happens throughout the film really won't come as a shock as the movie is rather predictable but at the same time the thing is just so entertaining that you don't mind it. Again, the ending is somewhat of a legendary thing among classic movies but it still manages to hit you where it counts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally saw this last night on TCM, and I really can't believe the raves by the other posters! First, if Andy and Linda had actually hooked up, their kid would have looked like a gargoyle! Second, I didn't understand why Andy got Dink. Linda was probably a gold-digger who bailed the second Andy lost the belt, but fathers were very rarely awarded custody back then unless the mother was as an unfit a parent as Andy is!Which leads me to the fight. Beery flayed around like a crazed fish in search of water! Why no one told him that you punch straight ahead is beyond me! When Cooper started bawling for this loser, I wanted to deck him! He was so damn annoying throughout, but never more so than then!And what happened to Jonah? Didn't anyone care because, as Dink puts it, he's "colored"? That must be it.</fullReview>
