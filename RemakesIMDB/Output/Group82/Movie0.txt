		<shortDescription>A true tearjerker, I have never cried so much in a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably Jon Voight's finest acting performance with the possible exception of The Odessa File.Jon Voight plays Billy Flynn an ex boxing champion with Ricky Shroder playing his eight year old son, T.J Flynn. Billy Flynn is now a horse trainer bringing up his son after a divorce some seven years ago when T.J. was just a baby. Billy loves a drink and is addicted to gambling and bringing up his son does have problems.The problems intensify when his ex-wife, now remarried, appears on the scene to see her son after seven long years. T.J. knows her only as Annie and is played by Faye Dunaway. Annie starts to come between Billy and T.J even though T.J has undying love for his father. As Billy gets further into trouble, his only way of securing a life for his son is to make one last come-back into the boxing ring.The film is very poignant, emotional and has so many sad sequences. Poor T.J. is constantly in tears and whenever his tears flowed, so did mine. The Champ is a superb movie, a must see, and although over 20 years old, still has a place today. The problems that existed then, still exist today. Booze, gambling, single parentage, divorce and reconciliation. Only the clothing fashions are different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most heart-rending films in the history of films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this film in 1980 as a five year old with my gran and we managed to distort the credits through our tears and sobbing. I received the video about four years ago, and as a twenty-two year old it had the same effect. Last night, I watched the Champ with my girlfriend and I am happy to say that the years haven't mellowed me and we were both in floods of tears before I switched the film off. I defy anybody who has an emotional bone in their body not to be touched by the story of Billy Flynn, and more importantly TJ. I won't give any of the storyline away as it will make it all the better for watching if you haven't seen it. As for me, I can't wait until the Champ get's it DVD release as I will be first in the queue."I want the Champ !"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie again (it's been over 20 years), I can't think of enough positive things to say about it. The honesty of the script tends to overcome any sense of melodrama, and it turns out to be a 10-hanky tearjerker. The acting is great all around as well. I didn't know what I'd think since it's been so long, and was a bit surprised to find this film has lost nothing in the intervening years -- if anything, it views even better than it did when it was released. I'm also a bit surprised to see it so far down on the IMDB ratings chart. Almost too painful to watch at times (maybe that's why).9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...with the rating of this masterpiece. A 5.8/10? -_- I am upset about this.What you have here is an epic movie that deserves a 9/10. It's the story of the love between a boy and his father, and the boy trying to make it on his own when his mother and father can't.The movie starts out very big on horse-racing, showing how Jon Voight, "The Champ", is and gives brief glimpses into his past life. After awhile though, his whole past comes back to him when his son unknowingly meets his mother and develops a bond with her. Conflict between him and his wife rises and we see even deeper into what was a merely a shell of his life in the beginning of the film; he is complicated and emotionally bruised man, snapping sometimes at his son that he loves with all his heart.The film has the most believable performances I have ever seen on screen, and is a tearjerker. But it doesn't try to make you cry once; the entire second half of the film is full of these scenes. Some work while others don't. Either way, it shows the true power and delicacy of unconditional love, and the way it ends leaves you gasping for breath because of the emotional impact it leaves. Not perfect, but it deserves a solid 9.0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike many of the critics who saw this movie and hated it, obviously these so called "film critics" must be jaded wanna be filmmakers who never made it, and have not truly found the meaning of film-making to date. Sorry for them. This motion picture is what makes cinema so great. It is the extremely emotional content and story, not the mere technicalities or flaws that makes this movie great. I saw this film 25 years ago and I remember a theaters completely in tears. I saw this movie again just recently on HBO and as hard as you tried, it was impossible to hold back tears, specially at the end. I don't know who these movie critics are nor where they come from, but they certainly have much to learn from this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe the rating this movie is only a 5.8. Have they seen the same movie as I have? I have watched "The Champ" several times and every time I cry even when I know what is going to happen. It is a story of a retired boxer and his son and the love the boy has for his father would be any father's dream. Even though the father has his faults (like we all do) he loves his son and tries to give his son a better life. I was just shocked at the rating and was compelled to vote. Usually the IMDb community gets it right but in this case they are dead wrong. 10 all they way!!! Great! Super! and very emotional. My whole family cried including my dog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Champ is the most beautiful Father &amp; Son story I have ever seen. The films emotional ending will go down in history as the saddest scene ever on film. Rick Schroder is amazing. A must see!!! Jon Voight is extremely convincing as a retired prize fighter. He also looks like Rick Schroders Father. Faye Dunaway come s off well. The director Zeffereli is a amazing story teller. You may have scene his Mac Beth with Mel Gibson. Rent this when you want to really feel some strong emotion. Rick Schroder was cast to stardom from it. It might just make you call your father and say I love you. More films need to made like this. It seems Hollywood is interested in special effects movies and they have forgotten the heart. On a separate note, Rick Schroder just made his own boxing film called "Black Cloud"it is also amazing and has tons of heart, The boxing scenes in Schroders film are the best I have ever seen. The same boxing coach from the champ worked on Schroders BLACK CLOUD. DVD comes out June 7th for Black Cloud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the whelm of movies that typify that perfect father-son relationship, this is one of the best. The emotions were incredibly well played out, and I can feel the anger and frustration of being the father in T.J.'s situation. Ricky Schroder's performance is convincing beyond many other young talents, and the drama is a stunning contrast of conflict, but not necessarily any resolution. The Champ is truly the quintessential example of the love between father and son, one which I can only hope to be able to show with my children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most EMOTIONAL movie ever made, A 10-hanky MUST-SEE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, when I was 10 years old, my father took me from playing with my friends to see this movie called "The Champ." And now, I can't wait to share it with MY children. Truly, the most EMOTIONAL movie I've ever seen. Jon Voight plays the role of ex-Boxing champion Billy Flynn who attempts a comeback to help his son. Ricky Schroder is the object of affection from his down-on-his-luck father, AND his rich mother (Faye Dunaway)who deserted him many years ago. The conflict between the parents is so painfully realistic, but it's Ricky's acting performance as T.J. that steals the show and your heart. Have SEVERAL boxes of tissue handy when viewing this film, because there are MANY scenes that will draw tears from the hardest of hearts. NO ONE can sit through this film and not be affected by the emotional impact, unless they are just a cold-hearted, unloving, uncareing person. I rate this one a 10-hanky MUST-SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Champ is a Great film and SO much more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies touch us in ways that are beyond description. The Champ is such a film. As far as a genre I guess its a sports movie. But really a story about life, human emotions and the bond between father and son. Billy Flynn (Jon Voight) is a former boxing champion who is down but no out. He now works as a horse walker/trainer. When this film was made, you didn't hear of many men being single fathers. Billy is just that. To his dismay he was divorced from his wife Annie (Faye Dunaway) after she left them to pursue a career. He told his son TJ (Ricky Schroder) that she had been killed in an accident and was a now a beautiful angel. Billy is a good man, but like many men he has his faults. He drinks and he gambles. But he is doing his best to raise TJ. One evening he has a $3400 lucky streak and buys TJ a horse, She's A Lady. Now 8 year old TJ owns a race horse. As he was preparing for the filly's first race, unknowingly TJ and Annie meet. She's a Lady is running well and battles for the lead only to fall down the stretch. Annie watches as TJ runs to aid his horse and discovers Billy is close behind. She then figures out TJ is her son Timmy. Annie confronts Billy after the race wanting to know more about her son. But Billy is still bitter and does not feel the need to grant this request. Life goes on with Billy's demons on his back. Old habits are hard to break, during an unlucky streak he loses all his money and owes $2000 more. He has 48 hours to pay or he loses TJs horse. Annie is now wealthy and bails Billy out. However instead of taking the money, the bookie decides he "likes the idea of being a horse owner." This infuriates Billy so much he commits an assault that lands him in the clink. In an intense jail scene, he tells TJ that he is "a pain in the butt, always nagging him, telling him not to drink and gamble." Billy wants TJ to live with Annie but he wants no part of it. Calling his dad a liar gets TJ slapped and sent on his way. But Billy has yet to tell him the real truth about his new friend. America has bestowed one great gift to the world, Hollywood. Many great films have been made. In my opinion The Champ is one of the best and deserves a MUCH higher IMDb rating than 6.3. If there has ever been a movie to deserve a perfect 10, this is it. Now that I have set the story up for you, take 2 hours of your life and watch. But let me caution everyone, unless you have a heart of stone, this film will not only pull your heart strings. It will tear them out. Young Ricky Schroder gives the performance of a lifetime and is backed up by the stellar work of Jon Voight and beautiful Faye Dunaway.Its a great at home date movie to watch with a new lady friend. So get a bucket of popcorn, a box of tissues and get ready for a film you will NEVER forget. This is a great story that leaves us sobbing at the end! A 100% definite 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Sport, Fathers and Death' the holy trinity for tears ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember the name of the journalist who spoke this statement, but I want to say a big amen to that, as my saddest movie involves all these three factors, I know they might sound a little too male-oriented but I'm pretty sure it at least touched upon two branches of this trinity for female audiences, can't women also respond to the sight of a little grief-stricken boy inconsolably crying over the loss of his father, and making grown-up men weep as well? I want to open this review by saying that "The Champ" holds a very special place in my heart, if only because it might be the first live-action movie I remember seeing as a (6-year old) kid, and for some strange reason, of all the scenes from the film, I was more impacted by the sight of blood, a disturbing novelty for my kiddies' eyes (the sparring partner, the horse's injury and the scary sight of Billy's opponent shouting at him). 4 years later, I saw it and every one was bawling in the TV room, everyone but me, mostly amused by these reactions. The Youtube clips many years later finally had their effect, but even then I knew I had to experience the whole film to measure up the extent of its emotionality.So I did and I can't believe someone who despises the overuse of superlatives like me would indulge himself to such a clichéd statement but this is indeed the saddest movie ever, with the climactic locker-room scene as the most defining moment. Adapted from a 1931 movie directed by King Vidor, "The Champ", is about a father-and-son relationship, an extraordinary sacred link between Billy Flynn (Jon Voight), an ex-Heavyweight Boxing Champion who reconverted in horse-training, and his 8-year old blond-haired angel-faced son: T.J. (Ricky Shroeder). To say that T.J. loves his father would be a huge understatement; he literally worships him to the point of calling him 'Champ' instead of 'Dad'. I can recall considering my father a true model when I was a kid, I can easily respond to the sight of a kid who admires his father the way T.J. does, especially since this adoration is the build-up that cements the final scene's emotionality.A few words about Ricky Schroeder's performance: it's absolutely refreshing to see a child acting like a real one, not too mature or annoying, Ricky Shroeder delivers in "The Champ" one of the finest pieces of child acting ever, on the same vein than Jackie Coogan in "The Kid", any kids' performance pale in comparison to little Ricky that year and I can't believe his performance was overlooked by the Academy Awards (while he was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Male Newcomer). The irony is that the same year, an even younger kid was nominated for a similar role; it was Justin Henry as Billy in "Kramer vs. Kramer". I guess Henry was favored in regard of the film's commercial success and the fact that his character was more 'complex', but let's face it, even Justin Henry wouldn't claim to have made millions of people all over the world cry like Ricky did.The parallel with "Kramer vs. Kramer" can be extended to the father and boy's situation. The mother Annie (Faye Dunaway) left, Billy had the custody and every thing went fine, despite some financial and gambling problems, until Annie showed up again and expressed her desire to take part again in her son's life, her son who thinks his mother died. The film takes then the emotional start with the most simple plot premise and it only avoid cliché's annoyances thanks to the beautiful performance of Ricky Schroeder. Indeed, every single moment work and it almost seems like the adult actors did their best to match Ricky's incredible acting, and I believe that Jon Voight deserved more accolades for his performance.The film contains some of the most emotional moments you'll ever see, reaching a first pinnacle with three powerful scenes in a row: a heart-breaking father-and-son conversation in jail, T.J. learning that Annie is not a "little angel in the sky" and his outburst of enraged cries when she can't even say that she loves 'Champ', and then the reunion with Billy, hell even the happier moments are unbelievably sad, with little T.J. and his father swimming on the beach (mirroring a previous scene with Annie). It's so effective that I dare even the most skeptical movie viewers to label this film as manipulative. Franco Ziffereli's directing is relatively sober and the music not too over-emotional, so if anything is manipulative, then it has to be a little 8-year old actor's performance, would you believe he'd have this intention? To conclude, I sincerely don't think any film would have as a powerful emotional impact as "The Champ"'s final scene. Sticking with my own conviction, I even googled the title of the film and the words 'saddest ever' and to my pleasant surprise, I discovered that some scientists after many studies found out that the film could be considered as the saddest ever from the way people were immediately responding to its most emotional scenes (notably the final one). Many readers mentioned titles such as "Bambi", "Brian's Song", "Schindler's List", "Terms of Endearment" or "Grave of the Fireflies" but I think they missed the point of the study which was less about giving a title than determining the most likely film to induce one particular reaction among the majority, in that case: crying.I remember my father told me that after watching the film in the theater, everyone was weeping and sneezing, he recommended the film to his toughest friends challenging them not to cry, but at the end, they were all bawling like little girls. Like it or not, it deserves the title of 'emotional masterpiece' and I don't think any rational critic will convince me to give it a 'reasonable' rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a bloke and you don't like the idea of anybody seeing you cry, watch this film on your own. Yes it is that sad.Really well made and brilliant performances all round, the kid TJ is one of the sweetest kids I've ever seen on screen, absolutely adorable with bags of talent. John Voight was brilliant as well as a down on his luck ex boxer who's just trying to make a good life for himself and his son. The story is one that I'm sure many can relate with, whether you're a single parent, have a great relationship with your father or can simply appreciate a film with strong acting. If you have a son that loves you as much as TJ loved 'the champ' your very lucky and should treat each day as your last. The only other film that had me welling up like this was the Imitation of Life also well worth a look , but have tissues to hand! This review is coming from a cynical bloke too! CBR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the saddest films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Champ is by far the saddest film I have ever seen. If you want to cry your eyes out, this is the film for you. It follows the story of Billy Flynn (Jon Voight) , an ex-boxer who is struggling to make a life for himself and his young son (Ricky Schroder) . Billy is very well played by Voight; he has just the right mix of tough guy and loving father.Faye Dunaway and Jack Warden both do a good job in their roles as well, but Ricky Schroder steals the show, in one of the finest performances from a child actor ever. The last 10 minutes of the film are guaranteed to make even the most hardened people weep. The director of the film, Franco Zeffirelli, is known for his film adaptations of Shakespeare plays, and indeed this film feels like it would make a good play. With a charming score by Dave Grusin, and some beautiful cinematography, it's a wonder how more people haven't seen this film. I recommend it to anyone willing to bring a set of Kleenex along!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have much to say. This film is simply excellent in all its parts. The story, the recitations, the mood, the photos and all other parts are simply excellent. A must see film from the gold 70ies era, overshadowed by the film "kramer vs. kramer" which is produced the same time and maybe for some reasons (economic and social) was published much more the film kramer than the champ. I believe that the main reason is that the champ is going against the rich world of famous (like Annie the T.J. mother) and promote the poor but rich heart of t.j. father : the champ gives his entire life to win and give all the money for a home and education to his children who grew from the fist days of life.

		<fullReview>Just watched this film again after many, many, years and it still packs an emotional wallop! Maybe more so, now that I am older and view it in a different light. I always felt that Rick Schroeder did a great job in this film however the true acting chops were offered by Jon Voight. What an incredibly believable job. Not for a second was I taken out of the film. The rest of the cast are a who's who of character actors that have appeared in many other films. I found this to be better than the original, especially with the two leads. I don't remember what the film was up against in regard to the academy Awards, however I am surprised that Jon and Rick were not nominated. If you have not seen this film, do yourself a favour and watch it. You will be entertained and, most likely, emotionally drained. But you are definitely in for a treat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember reading mostly negative reviews for this film, and reading that it was regarded as the saddest movie ever. I just had to watch! Now, is it a bad movie? No. As a matter of fact, I actually love this movie. I normally don't do drama films, especially of this sort, but I love this film mostly because it's charming, heart wrenching, but the film is the saddest at the ending. I remember watching the ending and I immediately reached for the tissue box and was sobbing and sniffling like a poor guy. I enjoyed the movie, but I was in total sadness at the end. I normally can never cry, but this was an exception. I have watched the ending and not cried before, but either way, it's still a very sad, if not the saddest, finale to a movie.It seems however that the ending is the only scene that everyone remembers from this movie. It's iconic, yes, but what about the rest of the film? The rest of the film is all really good. It is very similar to the original 1931 film, which I have seen and did not find as upsetting (though it still is), however, we go deeper into certain story elements that we didn't get into the first time around. For one thing, we get to see more of Champ's life with his son T.J. (renamed from "Dink"). Also, T.J. doesn't have any friends or half-siblings like Dink did in the original, but it only adds to the sadness factor in this movie. At least in the original film, when Dink saw his father die, he still had his friend, half-sibling, and mother. Here, he had no one but his mother. It was as if his father was his only friend, and he's gone...Rick Schroeder puts on a superb performance in this movie. I've said before how much I hate kids, but at least Schroeder's character isn't too bratty. For the most part, he's pretty happy, and only cries when necessary. Even when he gets upset, I actually feel sorry for him (in other films with annoying kids, they seem to cry about stupid things, but that's another story), and I'm also impressed. One of the things that got Schroeder popular was the fact that he could cry convincingly, or just show any emotion convincingly. As said before, I can barely cry myself! John Voight is also great. He is quirky, fun, and just a very lovable character who does make mistakes, but at least he learns from them.Overall, The Champ (1979) really isn't as bad as most people say it is. I couldn't really find anything bad about it myself, but I'd give this movie a watch and see how far into it you can go without crying. I remember at the end of this movie, I rushed downstairs where my dad was, and I just hugged him, telling him "I'm so thankful that I still have you, Dad." (He was confused as to what was going on). But enough of that, go see The Champ today! It does not disappoint!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Ending But Needed More Leading Up to It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Champ (1979)** (out of 4)Remake of the 1931 film that got star Wallace Beery his Oscar. This time it's Jon Voight playing the washed up boxer taking care of his young son (Ricky Schroder) who decides to try and make a comeback so that he can do something good for the kid. Along the way he gets involved with his ex-wife (Faye Dunaway) who left him and the kid years earlier and he also can't escape his destructive nature. The original version of this story was quite good and of course it contained the now famous ending, which is pretty much kept here. Look, there's no question that the final five-minutes here are incredibly powerful but they still can't make up for the previous 116-minutes that are pretty manipulative and flat. There are all sorts of problems with THE CHAMP and while it's certainly not a bad movie it just doesn't have what it takes to overcome all the flaws. One major flaw is the screenplay. You can give the producers credit for not delivering a scene-for-scene remake but the new stuff they added simply doesn't work. This includes all the time spent with the horses as well as the relationship between Voight and Dunaway that constantly builds up. I really didn't care for their early conflicts and I certainly didn't care for the directions their relationship goes through towards the end. It's almost as if the filmmakers threw in a bit of KRAMER VS. KRAMER (which was released the same year) to try and sell a romance side. Another thing that doesn't work is some of the casting. Voight is one of my favorite actors and he delivers a good performance here but I think he was miscast. I think he's simply too smart and this comes across so the destructive nature of this character just doesn't suit him. I also thought Dunaway was good in her part but it probably should have gone to someone else. Schroder, on the other hand, clearly steals the film with his touching performance and he's certainly a knockout at the end. We get some terrific character actors in supporting roles including Jack Warden, Strother Martin, Arthur Hiller and Elisha Cook. Joan Blondell, in one of her final films, has a small part as well. Again, the ending is what this movie is known for and it's a great one. It's just too bad the rest of the film didn't live up to it and the countless manipulation scenes early on just don't work and they certainly miss the emotional connection that they try for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Flynn, an ex box champion, is now horse trainer in Hialeah. He makes just enough money to raise his little boy T.J. over which he got custody after his wife Annie left him seven years ago. T.J. worships The Champ who is now working on his come-back in order to give his boy a better future. But suddenly Annie shows up again ... When I finished watching this moving with amazement, I looked at the info in IMDb and it made me feel disappointed. I mean I thought this movie would have won (or at least be nominated) Oscar best picture prize. And I'm even more surprised when this movie is only rated 6.3. The first thing came up on my mind was "WHAT THE F***", do you people understand what great movie is? Do you people see that this movie is 100 times better than "Dark Knight" or "Pulp Fiction" and those which are in top 250? Ricky Schroder acting is amazing and he's one of my favorite actor, I thought that a young talented like that should be starred in big Hollywood blockbuster movies but then again i'm surprised. Those people who rate this 8 to 10 are the really one who can understand what real movies are, not just violence, action and nudityThe setting is simple but it's amazing, you can see the beautiful in the opening scene along with beautiful music that will make you feel relax and sad at the same time. But the best part is in the end, with splendid acting of Ricky will put you into an illusion and you just cannot leave the scene.Trust me, this is one of the best movie I've ever seen, forget about the stupid rating and the stupid Academy award. You have to see this while you still liveRATING: 9/10</fullReview>

Not a traditional one, mind you - but a story of incredible love between a father and son. The acting is, across the board - PHENOMENAL. I would even argue that Ricky Schroders performance (especially considering his age), is among the very best in the ENTIRE history of cinema. I don't believe that to be even a mild exaggeration. To watch the incredible and genuine love between father and son is remarkable. I've always been and shall remain blown away by this film. Easily one of my favorite movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young Rick Schroder makes his cute-as-all-get-out film debut in this 1979 tearjerker from director Franco Zeffirelli. Jon Voight plays Billy Flynn, a former champion boxer now given to drinking, gambling, and raising his son T.J. (Schroder, billed here as Ricky) as best he can. The ups and downs of the devoted codependent pair might be enough movie on their own, but soon enough Annie (Faye Dunaway) shows up and displays a strangely protective interest in T.J. Though the plot jumps around too much to quite hold together, The Champ is certainly affecting, and all three leads take the film so earnestly that somehow it works. Voight is believable both as a boxer and as a well-intentioned screwup of a dad, and Schroder is a fine young actor (and irresistibly adorable). Special DVD features include audio commentary from Jon Voight and Rick Schroder and the documentary Behind the Scenes with the Champ.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a real gem. "The Champ" is like the modern-day version of "Paper Moon". Only closer to the heart. Jon Voight plays a boxer who meets his son for the first time, and boy does he have a mouth. Voight plays Billy Flynn, a boxer who gets to meet his son T.J.(Rick Schroder, "Silver Spoons") this kid owned a fine horse, and he made sure that horse is taken care of. It was shocking to see a 9-year-old say "bullsh--" good and loud. I wondered who made him say that. Then there's the beach scene which is memorable. They were going for a swim in the ocean, and he tells his son, "Pull up your trunks, we ain't getting arrested for nude bathing!" Father and son should have family time every time and Billy has did his best being a good father the best he can. Though champion will fall down at times, that doesn't mean he's a total loser. He was born a champion, and will die a champion. He did just that. T.J. denied his death, he may just do that, but he knows he's alive in one place that can never die, His heart. This movie means a lot in every way, and it can be used educationally. Trust me it's worth it! 4.5 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

I am not ashamed to say that I cried for days and still do, whenever I put on my video of this mini-masterpiece.Jon Voigt, always worth double the price of admission is wonderful, but Ricky Schroder steals every scene in which he appears. The score, by Dave Grushin is haunting and beautiful. I read that Zefferelli was in U.K. to make another film, when he saw the original "Champ" on TV. He was so impressed, that he started the ball rolling to make the 1979 version. A milestone. When I get depressed, I watch it. It makes me value life and people. Joan Blondell died soon after completing the movie and Strother Martin died the next year. One of my all-time favourites and always will be.

Jon Voight plays an ex-boxing champion raising his young boy (played by a stellar Ricky Schroder). I think Jon Voight is very good in this film (and I'm not a huge Jon Voight fan), and I think the young Schroder (who was seven, I believe, when he made this film) is fantastic. I find Faye Dunaway (who plays the boy's estranged mother) slightly annoying, but I forgive her because I love the film itself so much. I think Franco Zefferelli's direction is superb, and I enjoy much of the cinematography. I think the relationship between Voight and Schroder is particularly touching, and there are several scenes between them that bring me to tears. I really do give this movie a ten.</fullReview>

The Champ is a good film that it makes you cry (I guess everybody knows that by now) but really, the inconsolable T.J. (Ricky Schroder) makes the room really dusty all of a sudden. But what's important in this movie is the relationship between a boy and his father, packed with 'cryable' scenes.The story revolves around the relationship of a boy named T.J. with his father - T.J. loved him so much that he will do everything for his father (aww such a great kid) and his father couldn't be more bad ass but responsible. Pain in the ass. It stretches him between his bad habit and his responsibility as a father which later led him back into boxing to improve their life.I won't say much because you have to watch it in spite of the poor rating of this amazing film.</fullReview>

The part of the mother was fleshed out ,because it was Oscar-winner Faye Dunaway who reprised Irene Rich's role.Franco Zephirelli was more talented when he filmed "Romeo and Juliet and his Jesus remains the best of the genre.Not as "swell" as the 1931 movie,but children fond of melodrama will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics (and some viewers) have been lobbing grenades at this four-hankie tear-jerker since the day it was released, accusing it of extreme sentimentality and mawkishness. Nonetheless, for a great many others, it remains a beautiful, touching and memorable version of the 1931 original. Voight is the title character, a former light heavyweight champ who, thanks to taking a few too many hits in his last bout, has retired from the ring and now works as a horse walker at Hialeah. His young son Schroeder idolizes him, despite the fact that Voight has a tendency to drink too much and gambles away any little nest egg that they have been able to tuck away. One day, Voight hits it big and is able to buy Schroeder his own race horse. Schroeder takes on a wealthy fellow owner (Blondell) and attracts the attention of her friend Dunaway. When Dunaway befriends Schroeder and bets on his horse, it sets off a chain reaction of events that lead to a lot of emotional upheaval and tragedy for all involved. Eventually, Voight messes up to the extent that his only way out of his financial rut is to re-enter the ring and fight again. Schroeder is ecstatic that his father is back to being "The Champ" until he sees the damage that boxing can do to a man who is already injured and past his prime. Voight, who had only two weeks to prep for his role, does an admirable job throughout, with only a few overstated moments that verge on the hammy side. He develops a wondrous camaraderie with newcomer Schroeder and they make an excellent team on screen. Schroeder provides one of the most remarkable child actor debuts ever here. He more than holds his own with his Oscar-winning co-stars and forges an unforgettable performance that is filled to the brim with emotion and charm. Dunaway doesn't fare as well. Burdened with some truly ugly Theoni V. Aldredge (her preferred costume designer of the time) clothing and headgear, she is swallowed up by her preposterous get-ups when she isn't overindicating the conflicted feelings of her character. She is also lit many times in such a way that it almost becomes comical. Her line delivery leans toward the heavily affected and she often seems beamed in from another film altogether as she wafts around in her own rarefied atmosphere and carefully constructed aura. What should have been a stirring, climactic scene between Voight and her in the stable instead loses steam because the camera lingers on her nearly immobile visage and it looks like a period piece because of her ridiculous scarf. Some very talented character actors pop up in (often underutilized) roles including Catlett, Cook, Warden, Hill (as Dunaway's caring husband) and the aforementioned Blondell. Director Zefferelli was an opera aficionado and it sometimes shows in the overstated emotions on display. Even so, the lush cinematography, the beautiful music and the committed acting of Voight and Schroeder manage to pull the viewer in and tug at the heartstrings. They have several heart-breaking scenes together that place this film on the lists of many filmgoers favorite weepies. Schroeder, who claims to have always had a deep emotional well within himself, drew upon the recent death of his grandmother in his scenes, but even today on the DVD commentary, he breaks into tears several times! He also recounts how Voight sort of mishandled him one day in a swimming pool and this led to an extra layer of emotional upset for him during filming. Either due to a long filming schedule or reshoots, Catlett's hair during the finale has about 3/4 inch of gray ingrowth which isn't there in her earlier scenes! It's a film that will greatly appeal to a certain faction of viewers and which will equally annoy the faction who cannot go along on the tear-filled ride.</fullReview>

OK--it's well acted (all three leads are great) and well-done but man is it SYRUPY! The movie is just so cloying and sweet that I started to get annoyed watching it. Also the story is old and has been done many times before. You know how it's going to end. And yeah--I cried at the end but how could you not? This movie went out of its way to wring tears from the audience. I don't mind tearjerkers but this one is so openly trying to make you cry that it gets ridiculous. When a movie starts forcing reactions from its audience that's not good. This gets a 3 only for the actors and a well-done production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>¨We did some silly things. Who knows why people do what they do? Nobody knows that, but she's... she's a good person.¨ The Champ has divided audiences over the world; there are those who consider this to be a masterpiece and others who believe it's just a terrible movie that tries too hard to be a tearjerker. I wouldn't agree with either statement, the movie isn't a masterpiece, but it isn't terrible either. It has it's touching moments with a good performance from Jon Voight as the lead actor. I did have some issues with the child actor, Rick Schroder, but it had more to do with the material he had to work with than anything else. The producers tried too hard in making him look so cute that his character lost credibility. This 1979 film, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, is actually a remake of a 1931 movie of the same name directed by King Vidor and written by Frances Marion. So remakes have been a part of Hollywood for years now, it's not something new like many people might think. The screenplay for this film was adapted by Walter Newman and in my opinion it is the weakest part of the movie. The script doesn't feel real, it is overly dramatic and I just couldn't make sense of several scenes. For example, there is one scene where Voight's character abandons his son in a boxing gym to grab some drinks in a bar. The kid ends up alone trying to figure out where his father went and deduces he is probably at a nearby bar. I know there might be some parents that would do this, but I doubt they could have raised their child as well as Schroder's character seems to have been raised. His love and passion for his father, the champ, is hard to believe because he seems so selfish and cruel at times.The story takes place in Hialeah where Billy Flynn (Jon Voight), a former boxing champ now in his late thirty's, is working as a race horse trainer. He lives with his seven year old son, T.J. (Rick Schroder), who absolutely worships his father and calls him the champ. Billy raises his son on his own since his mother abandoned them when T.J. was born, although he has told his son that she passed away. T.J. seems to be more mature then his father and is always cleaning after his mess. Billy dreams of making a comeback in boxing, but he suffered a head injury that made him abandon the sport. He also is a compulsive gambler and alcoholic. One day he even steals money from his son's allowance in order to gamble. This time however, Billy wins a lot of money and decides to buy his son a race horse after feeling guilty for what he did. T.J. names his horse "She's A Lady" and takes her to the race tracks where he meets a lovely woman named Annie (Faye Dunaway). When Annie runs into Billy she realizes that T.J. is the son she has abandoned and now wants to make up for what she has done. Annie is a successful designer who is married to a wealthy doctor. At first Billy doesn't want anything to do with her and insists in not letting his son know she's alive, but due to his gambling problems he will be forced to. The only solution Billy can think of in order to give his son a better future is returning to what he does best: boxing.The Champ relies too heavily on the dramatic effect and that is what ends up hurting the movie because many scenes seem to fit the screenplay for the convenience of the movie and it just doesn't feel real. There are some strong scenes, which I agree were well acted like the prison scene or the final scene, but there were others that felt phony and overacted, like the scene where T.J. screams at Annie in the boat. My biggest disappointment was that I felt T.J. to be a one dimensional character. He was there to make the movie look cute and make the audience sympathize with him. Billy, on the other hand, was a character we sometimes despised and at others loved and identified with. Audiences that enjoy heartfelt films and tearjerkers will probably love this movie, but audiences who are searching for more character depth will probably be disappointed with it. I had a hard time with the beginning of the film, and found the last half of the movie more entertaining, but it is far from being the masterpiece some people claim it to be.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of the 1931 chestnut involving an ex-boxer, who now trains horses, coaxed back into the ring and cheered from the sidelines by his adoring pre-teen son and loving ex-wife. Boxing was big business in the late 1970s thanks to "Rocky", but that was no excuse to dust off this sentimental relic. Jon Voight, just off his Best Actor win for "Coming Home", ditches all the nuances he had achieved up to this point; letting his face go slack with confusion and desperation, he doesn't reveal anything hidden within this character, it's all surface falseness--and Voight is too intrinsically smart to be convincing as a self-destructive bum. Voight's dead-end, melodramatic scenes with Faye Dunaway (also miscast) fail to come off, with Dunaway behaving more like a big sister than a former flame. Shameless from beginning to end, the movie shows no subtlety in detailing Billy Flynn's dilemmas or loyalties, and director Franco Zeffirelli mounts each new sequence with the grace of a bricklayer. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Champ" is a completely over the top over-dramatized production that might be emotional for some but horrible for others, especially for movie critics.The movie starts off very slow and to be honest quite boring. After the first half hour the movie gets a bit better and more interesting to watch but after that the movie becomes extremely over the top dramatized and just when the movie starts to be interesting and the drama more believable, the movie suddenly focuses on Billy Flynn's boxing match instead of the drama. I liked the boxing match, I liked it a lot but it simply didn't fitted in the context of the movie.The relationship between the three main characters is done really well thanks to the good script. Jon Voight and Faye Dunaway are good actors however they seem to have been miss casted and both don't seem to be happy in their role and Rick Schroder who is now better know for his role in "NYPD Blue" gives a good lesson in overacting.All in all, a drama not worth seeing.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>
