		<shortDescription>One of the best Hindi movies that I have seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Lage Raho Munnabhai last night and it's still in my head today. I always go to watch sequels with a bit of trepidation but Mr. Hirani soon eased my fears with a wonderfully thought out comedy that is funny and has a message which he puts across without being preachy. Most of the same cast back again with only Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi reprising their roles and playing the same characters again. This movie cannot be considered as a sequel as it is more of an episode in Munnabhai's life not unlike James Bond films or Charlie Chaplin's tramp.Sanjay Dutt is just perfect as Munnabhai... i cannot imagine anyone else playing this role. It was said that Munnabhai was first offered to Shahrukh Khan, while i do like the King Khan i feel he would have gone overboard with this role. Sanju baba plays with a lot of conviction and i believe his true character and honesty shine throughout the film. He handles the comedic and emotional scenes with ease.... so naturally. Good rapport with the Bapu character.Arshad Warsi a.k.a Sarkeshwar a.k.a Circuit was also brilliant ...excellent chemistry with sanju and had some nice sequences. I liked him since the time he appeared in Tere Mere Sapne... and is coming into his own as a Bollywood star in his own right.Vidya Balan was bright and chirpy... great teeth! Only disappointment was that Boman Irani did not have the same impact as he did with Dr. Astana but still a great performance. He makes the audience like and empathise with him even though he could be considered the villain of the piece.Direction was excellent, song sequences were handled beautifully with most of the songs being situational all well shot especially 'Samjho ho hi gaya' &amp; 'Pal Pal Har pal'. This movie just proves that Bollywood movies can be just as good and entertaining as Hollywood while still giving us all the masala.We should all follow "Gandhigiri" but first let's support this great movie by praising it and WATCH IT IN THE CINEMA!!!!!!!!!!!!10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies in recent times!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one the excellent movie that refreshed me to the core. A classic Vinod Chopra production, this movie does not only fulfill high expectations of the audience, being a sequel of Munnabhai MBBS, but exceeds it.A decent and hilarious comedy throughout, you can watch this movie with family and realize that superb comedy can be created even without vulgarity.On acting front, it is difficult to rank the actors as everyone has made his role alive. Sanjay Datt (Munnabhai), Circuit (Arshad Varsi) &amp; Bomman Irani (Lucky Singh) have given their best performances.Cinematography is excellent and songs are appropriate to the situations.SO what is the best thing about this movie? Unlike most big-budget-glamorous Bollywood flicks, this movie entertains you, and still makes you think.It carries a message for today's generation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible movie! The comedy was expected, and having developed his characters so well, Rajkumar Hirani couldn't possibly not make people laugh in this movie, but the most inspiring aspect was the message which was conveyed in such a beautiful, unpreachy way, something the audience would connect to. Definitely, no documentaries or books about Mahatma Gandhi could have had such an impact on the audience, and after watching this movie, I respect him much much more. The screenplay and direction was flawless. There was not a single moment when you wanted to take your eyes away from the screen, and the dialogues were as good as the first part, in fact better. Sanjay Dutt and Munnabhai are made for each other, and he couldn't have played the role better. But yeah, without Arshad Warsi, the movie wouldn't be half as good, and like the previous one, he's delivered. Vidya Balan really adds life to the movie, and if you really want to compare, I'd say she's done much better than Gracy Singh in the previous one. Incredibly beautiful, and she's got grace, I can only but praise her in this movie. Boman Irani, Diya Mirza and others have done there bit, and Hirani has very nicely used all these characters around the main ones. And last but not the least, Mahatma Gandhi, played by Dilip Prabhavalkar is something you will not forget. Throughout the movie, he wears this enlightened smile you fall in love with!The movie does have technical glitches, for instance, if vidya balan works at worldspace, how did her show air on FM radio and things like that, but you don't really care much about these things when you've just been through 2 and half hrs of sheer entertainment, where you laughed, cried, and every possible emotion you can go through with a movie. The movie has an incredible feel-good factor to it.So all said and done, the movie is a must watch, watch it asap! I doubt I'd find a single person around me who wouldn't like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Munnabhai - the magic recreated!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably, this is the best movie sequel ever produced in the Hindi cinema and surely would be one of the top ten comedy Hindi movies of all times. I can't remember if any comedy movie (hindi or other) ever been able to deliver such a strong message in such a subtle and non-preachy manner. Coming out of the cinema hall, you can't help from having that huge delightful smile on your face.. This movie isn't a sequel in its true sense; apart from the characters of Munnabhai and Circuit, there is nothing in common with its predecessor (unarguably, the movie would not have been possible without these two characters as in their original form). Few reasons which turn it to a must watch movie:1) awesome movie, with astounding screenplay, story, characterization and many other things. Its a 100% clean movie with no risqué dialogues, no item number, no vulgar dresses and no vulgar scenes, which is an achievement in today's times. 2) Performance of Munnabhai and Circuit duo - Sanjay dutt is undoubtedly the most lovable bollywood bhai, he is bit old now but still going very strong and Circuit has come up with his magic yet again, this guy's timing of dialogues is perfect... In all, the duo rocks!!!!!!! 3) Strong, strong and very strong message delivered... I won't delve much onto this or else risk disclosing the story and henceforth the fun... Everybody is going to respect Mahatma even more after watching this movie - bet you are going to love that enigmatic smile 4) Jhanavi (Vidya Balan)... such a graceful beauty, her face is like bright morning light; gosh, the lady literally smiles with her eyes, you are bound to fall in love with this gurl, just like Munnabhai.. apart from that she acts very well and gives a strong performance... There are many more things that make this movie memorable and a treat to watch.... surely, something to watch before you die :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why not more people make moves like thisthis is AWWWWEEESOMME MAAMOO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lage Raho Munnabhai" , the second film in the Munnabhai series and perhaps the most eagerly awaited movie of the year at least for the people who like meaningful cinema.This one was supposed to be a sequel but it has a story of its own and its refreshingly original and no connection with the first movie except the Munnabhai and circuit and their gang. I saw the movie and was completely spellbound by it.I was glued to the screen for the entire duration and enjoyed every bit of bit.To call this movie a comedy would be wrong this one is a mix bag you've got comedy, romance , emotions (and yes lots of them) and a beautiful script to tag along.The entire cast is simply lovable and all have acted their part to the book. Sanjay Dutt excels in the role of Munna hes is well complemented by ever smiling Arshad Warsi as circuit who surprisingly shows his softer side in some well acted emotional scenes. Vidya Balan looks fresh and acts her part well. Boman Irani as The Punjabi builder is first rate,people get to see the various shades of his character.The supporting cast of elderly persons is also good. Dia Mirza provides glamor to the film in a brief but sweet role. Jimmy Shergill is likable in the scenes where he gets footage.But the real star of the movie is "RajKumar Hirani" , yes the director of the movie. he has told the story in a very unique manner which appeals to the masses.I wont go into the details as it will spoil the fun but this man is a class apart, he has handled each and every scene with perfection be it comedy , emotional or drama brilliantly.Music is perhaps the only weak point of this film. Though the songs blend well with the story but no songs stands out to be a chart buster. The picturisation of the songs is beautiful and visually appealing.On the whole "lage raho munnabhai" is an excellent movie not to be missed. The movie will tickle your funny bone as well as bring tears to your eyes in some situations. Its unique way of story telling will find praises not only from the masses but from the critics as well. the movie has a surprise package in the character of "mahatma Gandhi" and the actor who's played the part suits the role wellI can't wait for another outing with Munna&amp;Circuit but good things come at a price. The price here is Another Wait Till Then patience rakho "MAAMOO".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Munna Meets Mahatma Gandhi!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second innings of Munna Bhai and Ciruit in 'Lage Raho Munna Bhai' is one cracker of an innings! It's better than the first one, extracts more laughs and punches and the characters have a more humane temperament that explores the other side of 'bhaigiri'. The plot is truly the winning card of the movie, not to discount the effective casting, dialogues that are a mix of funny and introspective, a rib-tickling screenplay, enjoyable situational songs and a first rate direction. Sanjay Dutt as Munna Bhai and Arshad Warsi as Circuit wear their characters as their second skins, more comfortably, more snuggly and are more lovable than their avatars in the earlier Munna Bhai MBBS. Ditto for Boman Irani who dons the role of Lucky Singh, a sardarji builder; a meanie with a heart. Vidya Balan also puts her best foot forward as a radio jockey who makes Dutt's heart goes hmmm... Dia Mirza and Jimmy Shergill justify their cameo appearances. A surprise element during the climax is a thoughtful addition and cheers the audience, specially the female audience threefold. Though the film is not a sequel to Munna Bhai MBBS, Lage Raho Munna Bhai retains the characters of Munna and Circuit in the lead roles and their nontoxic, almost childlike idiosyncrasies. This idea also gives an unlimited scope for possibilities the hit pair of Munna and Circuit can indulge into in future. Lage Raho Munna Bhai is a story about Murli Prasad Sharma aka Munna who meets Mahatma Gandhi and undergoes a heart transformation. For Munna, breaking bones and abducting people at the snap of his fingers was easier than the courage it required to walk on the path of non-violence and truth. Hesitatingly and unwittingly he takes the road less traveled, which is thorny and full of obstacles in return for self revelation and a guilt-free conscience that fears nothing and no-one. The 'Gandhivad' is turned into 'Gandhigiri' by self proclaimed Professor Murli Prasad Sharma for its practical implementation in the present day, without sounding preachy or heavy-duty. There is a similar 'offering the other cheek' when someone slaps you, confessions of truth and also the 'satyagrah' for a bunch of old people who lose their house called 'Second Innings' to the manipulative and greedy Lucky Singh. Sad but true that our nation won freedom but lost its people, Murli tries to revive faith, courage, truth and justice in people from different walks of life. With his new found ideology or the chemical 'locha' in his brain, he triumphs over the cynics or the lost souls and also wins the love of his life. An interesting observation can be made between Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra's 'Rang De Basanti' and Rajkumar Hirani's 'Lage Raho Munna Bhai', the fact that though the theme of both films is more or less the same, the approach to resolving the conflict is in complete contrast with each other, like two ends of the same thread. Yet both films succeed in their own unique ways and deliberate the depths of human emotions and reflections in an identical manner. In the end, hats off to Vidhu Vinod Chopra for producing a film that is a wholesome entertainer and succeeds in giving a heartfelt message in the times where films are made merely to fulfill the whims and fancies of egoistic filmmakers.-Nidhi Kathuria</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What does one say about this movie? Coming on the heels of Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabai could prove to be another movie that stirs the conscience of the Indian masses, and dare I say, foreigners as well. Never before has Gandhiji's life and message been conveyed so simply, so beautifully and in such a rolling-in-the-aisle humorous manner. Everybody in the movie has played her or his role tremendously. Arshad Warsi and Sunjay Dutt make an explosive combination and Boman Irani is a riot. Don't be surprised if the thickest-skinned amongst you sheds a tear or two while laughing your guts out. You will walk out of the theater with a spring in your step, light in spirit, thankful that such a man as Gandhi walked the soil of our nation and inspired to become a little bit more like him. Even if a few of us are motivated to emulate Munnabhai's 'Gandhigiri', we could make a world of difference!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Munna Bhai back!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start of with i didn't had much of expectation on this movie since I assumed that a second series to Munna Bhai might not be good as the original based on my previous experiences. But this movie 'ROCKS' with a different story line all together, still keeping the characters of MunnaBhai(Sanjay Dutt)in place. The crew is pretty much the same from the original except for the heroine Vidya Balan and she does her part in style with others. The chemistry between Munna Bhai and Circuit, whether its comedy or sentiments was handled with beauty by Sanjay Dutt and especially Arshad Warsi. Boman Irani again proves that he can the best for the character given to him. Go watch this movie with less expectations and you will enjoy this weekend comedy treat.. This movie is sure shot a box office hit and movie for every Indian to watch!! Don't miss it because I bet u will come out with the satisfaction of watching an excellent movie with flawless script!! - Mobs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that i have visited the NEARBY single screen twice for LRM , it's about time to write a detailed review(quite a big achievement as it's 10 km away from my residence ,all thanks to the VVC-Multiplexes stand off).Half an hour into the film &amp; i was thinking , WTH is happening ova here? I mean there wasn't any definitive motive behind munna's shenanigans but as we reach towards the intermission point , i was squeezed into a compromise.&amp; the second half...well it delivers, delivers big time as munnabhai's "Gandhigiri"does create a "chemical locha" in our hearts &amp; how ! Hats off to Hirani, &amp; abhijat Joshi for creating such memorable screenplay which makes u rethink about bapu's relevance today, it's just stuffed up with great scenes whether it's about a man trying to get rid of unwanted stains on his door courtesy his pan chewing irreverent neighbour or an old retired teacher trying to get even with a corrupt officer in pure Gandhigiri style , they all create such a huge impact on one's psyche.Arshad once again does a great job , on first viewing i founded him a bit OTT at times but the second session convinced me that his was a performance driven by astounding comic timing , well done circuit(though his screen time was a let down).Boman as Lucky was great too , sometimes his Punjabi lingo faltered but overall this definitely is his first notable outing post MMBBS.Vidya is good but her Guuuuuuudmorning mumbai does irritate u at times , still she was better than gracy .&amp; then there is sanjay dutt without whom munnabhai can never be what it is today , such a heartfelt performance that it makes u weep &amp; smile at the same time ,one of the rarest of rare feet i must say.It's amazing to see that how he swings from Zinda's maniac urgency to munnabhai's goofy charm ,all in all Yet another awesome outing for him .Easily the best film of the year , waiting for munnabhai's next innings and until then , Lage Raho Munnabhai.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie rocks and how !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the first day first show of this sequel to Munnabhai MBBS and I must say that the team has come up with an excellent sequel !! The original title was supposedly Munnabhai meets Mahatma Gandhi but due to reverence or whatever reason, the new title has come up...the original title fits the movie like a glove... Munnabhai actually turns nonviolent and starts speaking only truth and also suggests several hapless humans of this new millennium to follow Mahatma's experiments with truth... The story with all its references to current changing scenario of the society is actually not interfering with the comedy that thrives in situations that our Munnabhai creates thanks to the affairs of the heart and the first half goes in a jiff without one realizing how time passed so fast !! actually, at interval time, I was feeling so fortunate to be watching such a great movie- first day first show !!!! the movie continued in the same vein in 2nd half too but the last twenty minutes robbed one star from the movie...it wasn't all that entertaining coming after such a rollicking 2 hrs that preceded it.. Nevertheless, highly recommended for people of all ages !! Sanjay Dutt lives the role and Arshad is not far behind either...Vidya looks good in modern dresses and is quite charming too...Boman, Jimmy, Dia all do justice to their roles as expected...music is good too...As a bonus, you get to see trailers of Don and Ekalaiva - both seem to be very interesting to say the least !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A goon promoting the principles of Mahatma Gandhi - Sounds unusual and ironic, doesn't it? No big challenge for Raju Hirani who transports the viewer into the colorful world of Munna and Circuit. LRMB leaves you with a huge smile refusing to fade away alongside a number of beautiful lessons in a very enlightening manner. Munna and Circuit are small time goons who work for Lucky Singh. Munna is in love with Janvi and pretends to be a history professor and tells her he is a big follower of Gandhi to impress her. A turn of events leads Janvi to know Murli's truth. What happens next? Watch LRMB and find out.LRMB is one of those rare films that never lose steam. There's a perfect mix of comedy and emotions. Best of all, it has tremendous repeat value. Scenes to look out for? Too many but here's a few.- The very first scene - Munna answering questions on radio - Munna's first meeting with Janvi - Scenes between Munna and Gandhi and especially the ones featuring Circuit. - Munna spreading Gandhigiri all over. - Munna's revelation on why he sees Gandhi. - ClimaxThose are just some of the moments not to miss. Actually, you really cannot afford to miss any. Music is okay but sounds much better in the movie. Situational like the last Munnabhai. The writing is nearly flawless and dialogue is applaud worthy. Just brilliant. They tear you up, either in laughter or emotions. Vidiya Balan is fantastic. Suits the role to the T. Boman Irani is first rate. Gives a fine act. Diya Mirza, Khulbushan Karbhanda is as always. Jimmy Shergill is good. Ditto for Surab Shukla.Special mention for Dilip Pravakar as Gandhi. He's terrific. Of Course the 2 goons steal the show on screen as Munna and Circuit. The acting, the chemistry, the delivery - just astounding. Brilliant act by both. Sanjay Dutt is born for this role and he does full justice. He's lovable. Arshad Warsi is at his best when he plays Circuit. He brings the house down with some of the best lines.The hero off screen is director Raj Kumar Hirani. Great execution and story telling by this gem of a director.Overall, a brilliant feel good entertainer worth watching unlimited times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you have to understand folks that this is not an artistic film nor does it pretend to be an artistic film. it's really intended to be pure entertainment with a message. And that is why this movie accomplished these goals in mind. entertainment - entertainment - entertainment!i really admire the gandhi pacifist theme to this film. the acting was great throughout. great to see a movie with sanjay dutt as the top billed actor. sometimes you just want to see a common looking person and not an overtly handsome male lead like SRK or Salman or Saif Ali.Sanjay can really carry this movie with his acting. I loved his crying scene with gandhi - he was so believable. boman irani and vidya balan are just as great as he is. boman's body language in his character role was amazing. vidya balan is such a natural performer, she's better than meryl streep because her acting skills are more nuanced and less technical than meryl's. if you love movies then you'll love the spiritual quality of this movie with the ghost of gandhi popping in and out. the musical numbers are also fun but add more to the story by showing you how the characters truly feel about what is happening to them.KUDOS to Cinematography C. K. Muraleedharan and Director Rajkumar Hirani and Producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Screenplay by Abhijat Joshi is just brilliant. When Gandhi sits on the couch and says "Why don't you just shoot Lucky?" - I died laughing. These folks are the future of film and Adam Sandler/Will Ferrell/Jim Carrey need to take lessons from a movie like this in my humble opinion. I say Bollywood all the way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possibly, one of the top five Hindi movies of all time. Manages to provide a thoughtful perspective on fixing interpersonal problems with rip roaring comedy and great music. Comments on growing old with dignity, treating people with compassion, the pitfalls of astrological nonsense and ridiculous superstition, the hideous Indian bureaucracy, and any number of important social issues all interspersed with side splitting comedy sequences. While the acting is passable the credit goes the original story line and the empathetic, sensitive directorial skills of the wonderful Rajkumar Hirani. An absolute must see.

I read that the movie has increased youth awareness of Ghandi and his beliefs which must be a big plus, I wonder if the producers will issue an English language version? It would be valuable if some of our Western Youth were able to learn a little of the thoughts of this great man.

		<fullReview>I did not dislike Munnabhai MBBS, neither did I love it? in my opinion it was OK, plenty of laughter and light moments, in fact a realization how much effect a jaadu ka jhappi can make to one's close people. The rare departure of a vasooli gangster to a kind hearted bhai is really adorable to watch, therefore I watched Lage Raho Munnabhai with no expectation at all, just keeping in mind the huge success and revolution it has made in India.I really respect the makers of LRMB for not trying to recreate any magic or moments of the MBBS prequel, neither did they bank on any aspect from the previous movie. In fact this was a fresh start for the characters and the whole storyline itself. With the success of this installation, I will not be surprised if Munnabhai turns out to be a famous franchise of Bollywood film industry, the first of its kind.The combination of Munnabhai and Circuit manage to churn out plenty of laughter, at the same time bring realization among the youngsters who seem to have forgotten their roots and history of India. This movie is not just applicable to Indian community, but also throughout the world where all of us have forgotten to appreciate small things in life and forget to do good to others. The whole execution of the storyline is admirable, as there is no bit of rona-dhona, overly emotional or drama involved, yet it manages to reach the heart of the viewers.The ending, is simply superb, one moment you might be feeling a drop of tear in your eyes, and the next moments its so funny, you just feel happy and fall in love with life. Watch it, otherwise its your loss.</fullReview>

Its Arshad (man in black T-shirt- Moorli's side kick) who makes the movie a real success. His timing and expressions keeps audience wishing there are more scenes with him. I had tears when Gandhi appeared giving this movie a very serious message, about loving people and standing up and being counted even when its so obvious you are fighting a losing battle and about truth. Very thought provoking movie and movie that will spark discussion. Its about time that a movie like this was made.Something for everyone.Gandhi- long may you live in spirit!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen something so vibrant and refreshing and don't get me wrong, I'm only 14 but, I know a lot about Hindi Movies and this is one to brag about. I was laughing so hard I would hiccup and even during parts that you would think are only to be tense, Munnabhai and Circuit do the unbelievable and turn it into something that will make you tear...The other thing is that, although it may not impact anyone because it is a hard message to go by, the whole idea of the teachings of Mohindra Karamchod Ghandi being incorporated was a twist unlike any other. I'm going again this weekend and watching it again, the great thing is... I have hardly any remembrance of the movie because I was laughing so hard.Of course there are also things that weren't incorporated, like why Ghandi died... Of course it was a serious matter that couldn't be very much enlightened by the duo. Some say that his student was crazy and did it out of spite and jealousy. Others say that Ghandi deserved it because he agreed to help the British in their workings in order to get them to leave but, this is only because it was the peaceful way out...Now here are some points about this movie: - It is a hilarious spectacle that could rob you of all of your oxygen as you thrust out all the air in your body in reaction to the laughter.- It has a lesson that you may want to ignore or may want to use, in American society it's useless because there are much different problems now then there are in India...- I can't say much more than that it's the Kingda Ka of all roller-coaster rides that will be sending you twisting and turning as you work through this storyline.Thanks for reading, have a nice time watching it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent !! Send it to Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really great movie I have seen in a very long time. Very well written and well made. I had never thought Bollywood would have some people who can think and produce such outcome.The movie is all about Gandhi's principles and those executed by a gangster called Munnabhai. The finest performances by Sanjay Dutt, Vidya balan and Arshad Warsi take this movie to the next level. The film is very funny and you can not stop laughing for 3 hrs. The movie also has a very good message which most of the bollywood movies lack.Arshad Warsi truly deserves a National Award for his performance. The real hero of this movie is Rajkumar Hirani the director of the film. I really feel that movie should go to Oscars as official entry from India.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, there comes a movie which makes you feel good about yourself: suddenly, the possibility that we can all be better human beings becomes all so real, if only for the next two days. And then, when the feeling seems to be getting stale- movies after all are make-believe- you go again and watch that film. Over and over again.Frank Capra did it with Mr Smith Goes To Washington and The Lost Horizon. Spielberg worked that magic by reviving the child in all of us with ET. More recently, there was As Good As It Gets. But that's Hollywood. In European cinema, Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy stands out. Such films are rarer still in India, more so Bollywood. Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anand was definitely one such film. Now, after a gap of over three decades comes Lage Raho Munnabhai.I will not discuss the film here. But if you do not leave whatever it is you're doing and rush to the nearest cinema-hall near you, then you are really missing out on one helluva an experience.Remember: don't walk. RUN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible movie, an eye opener and a ready reckon. Don't know when do I have seen such a wonderful movie, which directly affects the ill practices of the society. If you ask my I would give 9 out of 10. One may ask why not ten, this is because Sanju 'baba' doesn't seem to be 'baba' now at this age. Come on boss he is grown up now. His growing age is visible all through the movie in spite of the heavy make-up he has put on. No doubt he is a wonderful actor, but his characters at this stage of his career shall be commensurate with his age, say elder brother, uncle etc. I liked his movie 'Mission Kashmir'. It was an outstanding movie with his excellent acting.However there is a big question ahead should we, taking lessons from the movie act in the same way and make people asking for bribe ashamed in front of the society or should we not do anything at all and just accept it as normal practices as it is now. The bigger question is even if we adopt the lessons from the movie how much will the stubborn, corrupt bureaucracy who are neck-dipped with all kind of ill practices will be ready to take the challenge and change for the better. Overall a good movie to be seen at least twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its not fictional and its not real but a very good movie with lots of humor and fun. When i say its not real, i mean to say that the way Muna solve everyones problem is a correct way to do but it doesn't happen in real life and the scene when he sees Ghandhiji. But the movie doesn't deal with this, it deals with comedy which has been portrayed in a wonderful way. I must say its not like other comedy movie. This movie is the best movie so far to me and i am preety sure it should be for others to coz it is. Krish has been the biggest grocer of the year so does Fanna. If the movie like Fanna can create huge box office, Definitely Lage Raho Munabhai should. The movie that i liked so far in 2006 are RDB, Phir Hera Pheri and Kank. I must say lage Raho Muna bhai is far better than this all.Good work by Sanju and Warsad</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death of Hrishhikesh Mukherjee marked end of an era in Bollywood, but with Lage Raho Munnabhai, it seems there is someone who wants to keep the tradition alive. Mr Hirani, with this movie, is all set to prove that viewers still love movies without "Item Numbers" and "Skin Show". This movie comes at time when everyone is going ga ga over "Rang De Basanti" and Mr Hirani dares (rather, makes a sincere effort) to convey exactly opposite message of what was conveyed in RDB. I bet, everyone will agree that he is successful. Confidence and excellence of this director is proved by fact that it was not an easy job to put "Gandhian" morals in mainstream commercial bollywood cinema. For viewers, this movie has in store a very fresh script, complimented by excellent direction, music and most importantly editing. Though the story is very much predictable, but it is overcome by powerful direction. This movie makes you go emotional and smile at the same time?. Munna saying sorry to circuit is one such powerful scene. All the scenes of so called "gandhigiri" by Sanjay Dutt are very well shot. Though the director has used few jokes and scenes from Munnabhai MBBS, but he knows his limits and makes sure that the repetition is not irritating the viewers. Viewers still enjoy same old jokes. In today's world, when even Gandhiji would have given second thought to his ideology (no offense meant) here is a director that conveys them out loud and in a manner that everyone enjoys the same. All said and done, the movie has its flaws, Boman Irani and Vidya Balan's characters provided little scope to showcase the acting talents. Overall a wholesome entertainer. Though the director may not change the world, but at least when you are watching movie, he succeeds in making you believe that "Gandhian" ideology works in modern world too.</fullReview>

I dunno whether Bollywood produced such a good sequel before... but this one is really as good as part one if not better... Movie starts with the same type of scene as it started in first part... just to remind u of offbeat tactics and offbeat character of Munnabhai!! First half makes u roll on your seats with laughter... u just cant help... Murli Prasad Sharma and Cirkeshwar in their old form... though sometimes u notice Cirkeshwar is more sophisticated than the previous movie.. but as movie progresses u stop noticing differences and just enjoy whatever u watch... Second half starts with slow scenes and u start wondering whether all the hard work in first half is gonna perish as in all the Bollywood movies... but then movie catches up after some time... and u are given small doses of laughter in every scene whether sentimental or serious... I find songs good, fit to the occasion and choreography really innovative specially Samjho Ho Hi Gaya... where song is shot in a single Gulli!!! wonder why Yashraj Needs those costly foreign locations... Creativity beats everything... Gandhi.. a difficult subject to handle for anyone... but director shows his maturity and u never have overdose of HIM!!! all in all a good watch... have fun ride people... and wish Best of Luck to Munna and circuit for their all future adventures...wish Circuit would have got more lines... but then doesn't matter because we always expect more than what we get...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alwaysly we have expected lots of laughing from this movie.Munnabhai MBBS and Lage Raho Munnabhai are 2 Different Films. Characters are same but it's whole new movie, new story.Munnabhai MBBS had lots of comedy and drama. This one has it too. I can say this one is actually better in terms of keeping you looking at screen without blink. Reason, You can tell that more than half of part in first movie was comedy and little after that was sensitive drama. This Movie has Both of it, but you can say which part wasn't funny or which part didn't have sensitive feelings. It is one perfect mixture of Comedy, Drama that deliverers a Moral for today's society.Sanjay Dutt needs no introduction. Arshad Warsi is at his Best. Munna &amp; Circuit was hit and is super hit with this movie. Vidya Balan looks beautiful and has done her part best, so have other characters.Story is perfect, screenplay is perfect, direction, music...... everything is perfect. I am giving 9 from 10. Being Greedy for 1 Point as I wanted to see just little more of Munna &amp; Circuit doing their Dadagiri Before Gandhigiri.This is must watch film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice movie For the movie that teaches patience, it surely doesn't test ours right away, cuz thankfully it wasn't long like other so called big movies of the year. They kept it short and sweet. The movie was full of moments ... be it the laughters or the triumph of truth, both pleased the audience like a charm. The plot was intelligent to say the least as it carries a lesson in its comic theme. I don't know if any documentary on Gandhi could ever have an impact on such a mass audience; this one filled in a lot of trivia on Gandhi for me and it was truly inspirational. You can see some parallels to Rang De Basanti and quite ironically, these two seem to be the no.1 and no. 2 movies of the year.While it doesn't exceed the original Munna Bhai MBBS, it doesn't fall behind either. It does have its glitches and some weak script moments, but it can all be forgiven for its sheer brilliance and lively performances. You can't help but fall in love with Munna and Circuit; they just happen to create magic on the screen together. Vidya Balan plays her role well; she was very charming and outright adorable. Her 'Good Morning Mumbai' expression was cool. Boman Irani didn't have as meaningful role as the first one, but he did complete justice with it. He came out safe even playing the antagonist of the movie. The cameo trio of Jimmy Shergill, Dia Mirza and Abhishek were justified as well... well may be not Abhishek's role, but Dia Mirza added the glamor and Jimmy did his bit with one of the most sentimental scenes of the movie. The guy who played Gandhi deserves major props. The songs weren't forced and the cinematography is excellent ... the "samjho ho higaya" had excellent blends.Wow... didn't even realize i wrote that much... i guess i was bit impressed :)This movie is beyond the traditional comedies like Hera Pheri, Chup Chup K and Malamaal Weekly, it has bigger than life moments. Abhi tak parh rae la hai, watch it already "Mamu... boley tou Abhi-ich make a plan to watch it", you won't be disappointed. The government should applaud this movie and name some towns MunnaNagar and Circuitabad to honor it. Afterall, which other movie teaches such lessons and gives tributes to the nation's founding fathers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a sequel to earlier movie "munnabhai MBBS" .As the earlier one was a complete entertainer and was framed on very emotional ground ,the new one is also based on certain values, emotion and feeling of life . This movie is not any tapori type but give insight to normal thinking of common people and also their problem. Director knows that if u want to teach the audience you have to have solid base and vidhu has made his ground with nation's father Mahatma Gandhi. one the one hand the storyline has been steady and binding through out on the other hand dialog delivery of each character has been kept near perfection. if i talk about anyone in the movie i must say sanjubaba is fantastic in his role as and in munna bhai. His presence in the movie is strengthened by his chelaram circuit . they seem to have good chemistry on screen and the same has worked in the movie. this movie is a complete family entertainer and anybody can go with the family to watch the movie. The concept of Mahatma meeting with munna bhai is good and giving other thought to the movie. you know i liked one more thing very much that is the way Vidya Balan pronounce gooood morningggggggggggggggggggggg mumbaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii this movie is summation of drama emotions feeling self respect and over above healthy entertainer must see movie for everyone</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Munnanagar and Circuitabad are back on the screen and they are ready to remind us about history, but in Gandhigiri style. Without being overly preachy, and employing the unique style of Munnabhai and his ever dependable circuit, the movie manages to teach us some Gandhian way of life. The movie is not a continuation of the previous movie, it just places the characters in a new setting. While performing his usual duties of evicting tenants and kidnapping, Munnabhai falls for a radio jockey, Jhanvi. To impress Jhanvi, he assumes the role of a professor who follows Gandhian principles and must give a lecture on Mahatma Gandhi. Only this time, it Mahatma Gandhi himself who comes to Munnabhai's rescue. It turns out he is the only one who can see Mahatma Gandhi. However, the situation gets complicated when a builder Lucky (Boman Irani) wants to evict Jhanvi.Sanjay Dutt literally walks through the role of Munnabhai. Arshad Warsi continues to impress in the role as Circuit. It would be worth checking out Taleban Express. He has very good facial expressions. Vidya Balan was refreshing, but I just wished that see would not keep saying "Good Morning Mumbai". It was enjoyable to watch Boman Irani, but you do miss the smiling ma-mu.Then there is more of Munnabhai Circuit Banter. Munnabhai: Circuit, if we go back to the village, how will you work, u do know to plough? Circuit: If I start ploughing, what will the bull do? I wish there was more of that. That is the main reason why we should be watching this movie.A welcome relief from KANK. Lago Raho Munnabhai</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to watch Lage raho Munnabhai without much expectations as sequels rarely live up to the original. But, to my surprise, I felt this movie was even better than the first. The first one being so popular, they could have easily extended that story for the sequel but instead they came up with this BRILLIANT idea of imagining Munna Bhai - Mumbai Don - being influenced by Gandhian thoughts. Not only was the Idea brilliant and novel, implementation was excellent too. The first half of the movie is a laugh riot with hilarious sequences of endearing Bhai-Circuit duo and extremely funny one-liners. Arshad Warsi again does a great job as loyal, lovable Circuit. In the second half, whenever movie seemed to drift a little, it came right back on track with Warsi's one-liners. While fully entertaining the audience with good comedy, the movie also puts across a good message - showing us how Gandhian thoughts can possibly be an answer to our everyday problems. Like the first one, this movie also wins the hearts of the audience, who are not only satisfied with brilliant comedy but also linger upon a heart-warming message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art of Humor at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. A nation that proclaimed one of the most remarkable humanist of the last century as 'the father of the nation' at the euphoria of most unique mass-movement to gain independence from British colonial rulers -- erected Gandhi's statue everywhere, named every main street as Mahatma Gandhi Road, decorated every Government office with his portrait ... and in a feat of amnesia forgot all about the unique message of this 'half-naked fakir'. The director, Mr.Rajkumar Hirani had accomplished the masterly act of reviving Gandhi's timeless message in a humorous wrapper through underworld don Munnabhai (Sanjay Dutta) and his loyal lieutenant Circuit (Arsad Warsi) in contemporary Bombay bursting with cellphones, satellite radios with such acumen that will make you burst out laughing. But in the footsteps of great master Charlie Chaplin, Mr.Hirani is well aware of the art of humor -- as Munnabhai encounters every problematic situations -- be it eviction of senior citizens from '2nd Innings Home' by a greedy builder (Bommani Irani), or a young man who lost his father's savings in the quicksand of stock market or the bride-to-be with an unfavorable horoscope -- Gandhi advises him on strategies that are diametrically opposite of typical 'underworld strategies' rooted in violence. Gandhi tells Munnabhai that it requires more bravery to apologize than to commit violence or love is more powerful than hate. These moral messages come through in hilarious circumstances and never in a preachy manner -- again to establish the maturity of the director to assume a matured audience. The wave of progress is sweeping India -- and some quarters of the society worries the impact of such rampant changes on this old civilization -- but the artist like Mr.Hirani brings out the true power of Indian culture -- that always assimilated the foreign influence with a moral, non-violent, humanist message embodied in Mahatma Gandhi .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2006 was a year of sequels,starting with PHP,KRISSH both blockbusters LRMB was a sequel to Munnabhai Mbbs and a surprise blockbuster. In a way it's like a series not continued from part 1 except Munna and Circuit characters. The film which was earlier titled Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi is superb, it mixes comedy,emotions,drama all superbly. The Munna-Circuit scenes are throughly too good, Munna-Jhanvi(Vidya) romance too is good while Boman Irani's track too is well handled, At times things do get melodramatic,Also the Satyagraha track does seem a bit overdone but yet things are superbly handled, the scenes of Jimmy-Parikshit Sahni and the entire astrology part is superb. The end too is simply hilarious.Direction is superb by Rajkumar Hirani Music is decent, yet the songs Aane Chaarane,Title song,Pal Pal all are goodSanjay Dutt is yet again brilliant though looking out of shape, he is the only actor who can play such roles with ease. Arshad Warsi too is born to play Circuit, he is simply brilliant and in fact he is better then his previous act in Munnabhai, in fact he stands tall throughout. Vidya Balan is good, Dilip Prabavhalkar is good as Gandhi Boman Irani is superb though his role comes too close to Khosla Ka Ghosla, Khulbushan Kharbanda,Saurabh Shukla are good Jimmy Shergill is superb,Parikshit Sahni is good too Dia Mirza is superb, rest are all good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is what I thought when watching this film. I have never watched a Bollywood film before but judging on the shorts snippets I have seen of such films, in TV-programs etc, this must be a far way from the ordinary Bollywood film. Actually I am convinced that a similar plot could easy become a successful Hollywood film. All the elements are there. There is the unhappy crook who falls in love, and to get his girl he has to pretend he is something he is not. There is the crook's comical and not to bright side-kick who supports him through thick and thin. There is the pretty and intelligent girl. And there is the ancient wisdom, here manifested in the holy Mahatma.And then there is the typical life-changing plot. The crook tries to become a better man and at the same time succeeds in making the world a better place.Yes I really liked it. There were a couple of musical numbers that I thought were well made and made sense. And the acting, writing and directing were all professional. Several times I laughed out loud at the comical points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone familiar with Bollywood can be forgiven for reading the title of this review and not being particularly impressed - Bollywood has produced some profoundly horrible films in awe-inspiring quantities in the past.But Lage Raho Munnabhai sets aside all of the usual complaints one has about Bollywood. Its plot is in no way ripped off of something from Hollywood - indeed, it would be hard to come up with something more uniquely Indian. The songs, while ridiculous in a way that only Bollywood can achieve, are not so far gone as to be irredeemable and are actually well integrated into the plot. Finally, while the central motivating force for the plot is a typical Bollywood impossible love, the actual theme of the film is far deeper. True, the movie carries about it a certain absurd quality in everything from dialog to editing, such does nothing to detract from the power of the message.The plot, in short: Mumbai mobster Munna falls in love with a radio jockey, but to impress her pretends to be a professor who specializes in Mahatma Gandhi. In the process, he is forced to learn Gandhi's philosophy, causing a "chemical imbalance" in the form of Mahatma Gandhi's ghost who compels him to solve his problems with peace and truth.Though the main factor of this movie is comedy, at which it succeeds quite well (Circuit is far better characterized and thus far more lovable than in Munnabhai, M.B.B.S.), what I took away was a shaking awe of this man we call Mahatma. Though its exposition of his philosophy is a bit more modern/ridiculous than what the Mahatma practiced, it nonetheless accurately conveys the sheer courage of satyagraha. A mobster, someone accustomed to killing and being killed, is forced to acknowledge that real courage comes in taking a blow rather than fighting back. The movie's implication is that our modern society believes only the insane would follow in the path of Gandhi, yet watching it makes one wish more of our leaders today had "chemical imbalances."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that now that Sanju Baba has been convicted I need to prod myself to write a comment on this film. I hated Munna Bhai MBBS so I was resisting this one for the longest time. But the actual viewing turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I actually liked the film. It was repetitive and not very funny but it had its moments and it did achieve some of what it set out to do - bring front and center the fact that we live by completely different rules these days and wouldn't it be nice to change that. Sanju Baba was quite good as Munna Bhai, Boman Irani was awesome as his boss, Vidya Balan was adequate as the DJ, the entire assemblage at second innings house was great, but the show-stopper no doubt was Arshad Warsi as Circuit. The man is awesomely talented and made Munna Bhai a decent and watchable film.If you believe in Gandhian philosophy you might get upset at this new version called Gandhigiri. If the message is to twist Gandhian ideals into a new more menacing avatar then that is a scary thought. But if the film is really just poking fun and not trying to be very serious then you can chill and watch it without too much trouble. The thing is, I am not sure what the film is trying to do. However, it does bring back into notice the Mahatma and his life - so it does achieve some useful purpose. Afterall - Bande me thaa Dumm, Bande Mataram.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily the most loved "dynamic duo" in today's cinema world, Munna Bhai and his sidekick, Circuit are back! And this time, they come together in the sequel of the fame hit to Munna Bhai MBBS is Lage Raho Munna Bhai.It's a normal day for this happy go lucky duo. The love interest this time is Vidya Balan as a Radio Jockey. The radio jockey idea seems obvious with the hit of Priety Zinta as the RJ in Salaam Namaste, and also keeping in touch with the recent trend of radio coming into vogue again, this time with a bang.The basic idea behind Munna Bhai is the same, mistaken identity and doing crazy things to keep the girl interested in him? this time, however, Munna does not go to college as a student (thank god). Jahnvi (Vidya Balan) mistakes Munna for a history professor! The Movie carries on where it left, lots of fun, extremely witty and not to forget ? humor with a message - with Jahnvi testing Munna's "historical interests".This is not just another movie in the park - I don't want to spoil the surprise, but, here is a spoiler: Gandhi playing a "role" in the movie, there are some interesting moments.With a twist in the run of events, the movie proves how contemporary the Gandhian values are.The Songs are not what you might call chart busters, with Kabhi Alvida na Kehna topping every music channel in sight, but songs are a luxury anyway in this wonderful movie.Investing money in watching this movie will pay you rich dividends ? laughter, fun and extreme satisfaction! There are apprehensions over the prices of cinema tickets, but this movie makes you sigh and gives you value for money From student to teacher, Munna has most definitely graduated and come of age! Arshard Warsi is too good once again? They say sequels are not so successful as the first movie, but this movie shall be the path breaking movie breaking that theory! Lage Raho indeed! Aptly named!</fullReview>

Any age group it's a must watch.It's also got a great message, which has faded in time. It makes you think yet does not stress you. Depicts some important aspects in life in a jovial way. Sunjay Dutt and Arshad Warasi have done a great job again proving the 2nd squeal can be better than the first one. The humor is great and it appears natural on screen unlike other comedy movies where in comedy is drilled in.Thanks to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Rajkumar Hirani for making a film that is more than just a rip-roaring comedy. It makes you laugh, makes you cry and make you think .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first Bollywood film I have seen, and I enjoyed it very much. The story was funny, romantic, and even contained a strong moral lesson. The actors all seemed to do a good job -- it is harder to judge with a subtitled film. The songs were generally well done and not too intrusive. The cinematography, costumes, and set design enhanced the film -- and made me want to visit India some day. About the only suggestion for improvement would be to shorten it a bit -- this was at least 30 minutes too long for a comedy/musical, in my opinion. One technical gripe about the DVD: the commercials at the beginning were too long and unable to skip.</fullReview>

I admired how the many different threads of this movie i.e. music, comedy, and history were brought together so well. Being American and having to read the sub-titles didn't take anything away from this movie for me. I was very moved by this movie, and would recommend it for every one to see.

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the most inspiring films made in the Indian Film Industry in the last decade. The other films I can think of are 'MunnaBhai MBBS', 'Hydrabad Blues' and 'Nayak'. Though HB was an independent effort. The script of LRMB is too good. When Boman Irani says "Get Well Soon Munna" it struck me so hard. The whole plot is in loops. Taxi driver and running bride already have a connection from the previous scenes. The script may not be air-tight but its definitely very well edited and has imaginative loops. Although the backdrop of the film is love story it actually is a social drama. Beautiful!!! The concept that Gandhiji only answers questions Munna already knew was just too much. That shows how tight and well thought out the plot actually is which looks like a regular comedy.Boman Irani is very good. Sanjay Dutt is convincing. Vidya Balan is just cute smiles. She was much better in 'Hum Panch'. Kulbhushan Kharbanda is great as usual. Arshad Warsi walked away with the glory this time. No doubt. He got the best lines and every time he got the home run. Dilip Prabhavalkar was also very convincing considering the kind of job he had to do. Theatre and films are two different medium. I will definitely see him on stage now. Diya Mirza has improved. Jimmy Shergil was also very impressive. It was nice to see Parikshat Sahni after so long. Although casting says three names in the writing department but we know for a fact that the brain behind this fantastic film is Rajkumar Hirani. Great Job. Must have been a journey for a sound editor in 'Hero Hiralal' to direct a film after 15 years and that too 'Munnabhai MBBS'. There are so many fantastic scenes in this film but my favorite is when lawyers beat up Gujju lawyer Dhansukh Bhai Patel. It's a very positive effort with many social messages. The most important things about the film are that it is very modern, talks about real issues with humor and is not preachy. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To deliver such a movie in present times with such a powerful message is truly commendable. The movies starts of on a slightly trite note but later flowers into a movie with high impact. The best part about the movie is that it is presented in a way that most common people can relate to it.. It is this quality that has propelled the movie to such acclaim. This is the sort of movie that showcases the true spirit of India and its father, Mahatma Gandhi.In times when its considered sissy to not have an "eye for an eye" this movie breaks all trends and goes back to good old days.its hard to describe the sort of reactions its produced in India for real. May it suffice for me to say that a lot of incidents or rather the methods used to achieve the goal in a larger sense, have actually started bearing fruit.Kudos to the director for making such a movie in present times. Though the movie has done exceeding well, it also ran the serious risk of bombing at the box office. By opening himself to possible criticism and still sticking to his guts, the director has done justice to the movie as well as its message. God bless.</fullReview>

But if you don't want to see the movie, don't. No one is forcing you. My favorite part was the Munna/Circuit apology. It was so deep and emotional. I can't tell you how much I loved this movie because I will keep repeating myself and that is kind of what I am doing so I can take up these minimum of 10 lines that i need.

		<shortDescription>Best Hindi comedy in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really good Hindi comedies are few and far between. Lage Raho Munna Bhai is by far one of the best in recent times. You will laugh till your sides ache, and you will be forced to think about truth and non-violence on your way back to reality. The movie starts with a music that will tell you it is a sequel to Munna Bhai MBBS, but goes off as an independent story, with only the main characters (Munna Bhai, Circuit and the other "dhobis") coming back. Boman Irani is in this "sequal", but in a totally different role, to which he does justice AND MORE.The story is woven well, the music is hummable and meaningful (something which Hindi films lack a lot), the choreography is pleasing, the directing is wonderful and the acting is superb. Boman Irani (Lucky Singh) and Arshad Varsi (Circuit) steal the show, and Sanjay Dutt (Munna) and Vidya Balan (Janvi) are not far behind.Even when the plot gets a little "serious", the film holds the audience (this is what Hindi films mostly mess up).After you have watched it once and laughed a lot, watch it again: there will be bits and pieces of comedy and thought-provoking dialogue and actions to notice the second time, which will make sense.This is a movie to treasure. I hope more movies like this hit the screens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laugh your way through this film and for sure it starts a chemical locha in ur dimag. This could well be the dawn of a new age bollywood film making, the script is crisp so is the direction. A must watch for its realistic approach to the modern day issues but with a Gandhian Flavour aka Gandhigiri. If bollywood has to get recognition at the global level, it should try churning out movies of this calibre, which not only showcases Indian Values of truth and ahimsa, but also the need of the modern age to embrace them. Hats off to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Rajkumar Hirani, for giving back Bapu to India. Excellence is stamped all over the film as it smoothly sails from one frame to another. It leaves us with a thought to reconsider and rediscover the ideals of Father Of India, Mahatma Gandhi. The Ideals are as relevant today as then.</fullReview>

But the biggest difference is that it carries a powerful message. The best part is that I was not bored for a single moment in this movie. The songs are pretty good and the director has done a great job of editing the movie.Actingwise, Sanjay Dutt and Boman Irani are good, but the best part is played by Arshad Warsi. His dialogue delivery and facial expressions are a treat to watch. Even a stupid joke appears funny when Arshad Warsi delivers it. All in all, kudos to the movie team.

		<fullReview>After watching Munna Bhai MBBS I was impressed , Sanjay Dutt could after all do much better than beating up gangsters . Arshad Warsi , now there was a guy who always acted well and I always felt bad when his movies didn't do well . After watching his performance as Munnabhai's faithful sidekick Circuit , I was more than impressed .In this movie , all goes well till our Munnabhai falls in love with this radio jockey girl. Now he has to give a lecture on Mahatma Gandhi to win her love. He studies hard , really hard and guess who he sees right there , all set to help him . Its none other than Mahatma Gandhi himself.Munnabhai , being a small time mob owner , goes about his own ways with his life trying to solve his problems his own way. But its Gandhi ji who shows him the correct path . The path which might not always be the easiest , might not always be the quickest ,might not always be the obvious one but would always be the right one and if that path is followed , then victory is inevitably yours.This movie shows the poor state of mind that our generation might be in , the people for whom Gandhi is another statue in the park or another framed picture on the walls of government offices in which the corrupt officers demand bribe or refuse to do what they are paid salaries for .Different people have different opinion about Gandhi. Even during his time there many who didn't find his ways useful and have shown equally good results like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose who believed in Tit for Tat . Inspite of the difference in opinions they both had lots of respect for each other. It just depends on what a person believes in.The director has used a method , never before used , to show that ways shown by Gandhi are still as much valid now as they were 50 years ago. What Gandhi taught was no rocket science. It was what our conscience would tell us to do if we actually have the time to ask it . It shows that there is a Gandhi in all of us , the Gandhi who keeps us honest , the Gandhi who would show us the right path , the Gandhi who makes us sacrifising and helpful , the Gandhi who gives us the power to stand up for what is right .I am not a very sentimental kind of a person but I got to admit , this movie made me laugh as much as it made me cry . It is no doubtedly one of the best movies I have watched.I think that this movie was even better than the first Munna bhai movie and I hope there are many more of these intelligent movies to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster &amp; Gandhi prove it. Truth alone triumphs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Circa 2003: Munnabhai (Sanjay Dutt), a gangster, could not become a certified doctor, but he finally did make his father (Sunit Dutt) proud by giving ailing patients hope and happiness through his "magical hugs" at the hospital. Circuit (Arshad Warsi), Munna's right hand goon ensured that whatever munna wants - is done.Circa 2006: Munnabhai (Sanjay Dutt) does it again. But this time it is our own "Father of the Nation" Gandhi (Dilip Prabhavalkar)who inspires the gangster to break the jinx of Hiding the Truth, which our society truly suffers with. Even as Munna-Circuit combo send the viewers into laugh riot with their pranks, Gandhi makes sure they do it per his principles. Absolutely refreshing.Charming screen presence of Munna's love interest RJ Jhanvi (Vidya Balan), party spoiling by a cunning builder Lucky Singh (Boman Irani) make viewing this movie a pleasure. Music by Shantanu Moitra (of Parineeta Fame) is good. And finally well written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani. Munna and Circuit are arguably bollywood's best screen character duo ever. No surprises, India's second hot favorite for Oscar Nomination this year after Rang De Basanti.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequels are foreign to Indian movies but this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...is a trend setter. I wont review the storyline since many have done a better job.Making a comedy, yet a contemporary message oriented, movie has not only been a challenge to Indian movie makers but also been a disaster. Such movies were always the strongholds of trained movie makers or new art film directors from Film Institue in Pune.The movie is strictly not a sequel in the sense that the storyline is completely new. However, the Munna-Circuit duo is kept very much intact and the punchy dialogues distributed evenly among all characters. This time Munna meets Mahatma Gandhi and makes a disastrous yet a hilarious attempt to reform himself (and an others!). What starts of as an innocent visit to Gandhi library to impress his heartthrob ( a radio show host) spirals into a Gandhian struggle to reclaim the land of a small old age home. How Munna manages to come through this is the whole story.Of course, Munna is incomplete without Circuit who combines the devotion of Lakshman (to Ram) and naiveté of Sancho Panza (of Don Quixote). Their pair is likely to be exploited commercially in the time to come. At times the movie risks the glorification of 'Goondagiri' but manages to steer clear of it with the help of Gandhigiri. The satire that drips through every line of the story nails home the point of Gandhi's relevance in modern times. However his main strength of 'Satyagraha' is never emphasized as much as the spirit of forgiveness (which is amply demonstrated).This is a MUST-WATCH movie even for the movie audiences in the United States and the Hollywood Industry. In fact the sequel is worth a remake in Hollywood than its prequel that has 'patches' of "Patch Adams".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be very honest I was not very sure if they could match the class of Munnabhai MBBS again. Even though I watched the film a good three weeks after the release, by that time the rave reviews and ripple on the box office were sign enough to make anyone believe that they have done it again. But not me. I was of the opinion that this one would have a big hangover of MBBS and people are liking what they liked in earlier version, and there would not be anything new to offer.BUT.... how wrong perceptions can be.This is a revelation of sorts. Its not even a single notch below the its predecessor. Its right up there.... on the top, among the finest films of the year...or if I may dare to say EVER. Just when we were actually forgetting Mahatma Gandhi, and he starting to become nothing more than a photo on currency notes, comes Lage Raho Munnabhai... rejuvenating Mahatma from nowhere. Franckly speaking, I was not a fan of Mahatma Gandhi, I am not very impressed with his doings... but this film surely changed the perception a lot if not completely.Revealing or commenting anything on the story or performance or any other technical aspect of the film would be stupidity, as its seen to be believed.You'll realize the beauty of the film when you won't realize when your eyes were filled with tears while laughing your hearts out.Lage Raho Munnabhai, Raju Harani (Director), VV Chopra (Producer) and the entire team.Don't MISS THIS ONE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't watch too many Indian movies these days because i am putout by the rubbish they come out with.But lage raho munnabhai was a welcome change. I had seen the first movie (munnabhai MBBS) and i had liked it. Although the first movie had borrowed its theme from patch Adams,nonetheless the director did a good job. The second movie was totally original(to my knowledge).It shows how a small time goon by chance is forced to learn about Gandhi by chance,and he starts realizing his mistakes.He tries to go out and tells the world the forgotten message of Gandhi. In short he tries to prove wrong the prophesy of Albert Einsteins "Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood". This movie passes along many social messages without being too corny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Munnabhai says Hellllllllooooooooo Gandhigiri!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Riding high on expectations due to its well-accepted predecessor (Munnabhai MBBS), this movie satiated every 'tapori' who cared to invest his time to watch this classy 'lafra'. Munnabhai, the goon with a golden heart, returns to the silver screen with his second-in-command Circuit. This time, he takes on something he is not accustomed to: non-violence. In order to win over his love, lovely Jhanvi, Munna introduces himself to the ideologies of Mahatma Gandhi. How he endures, flourishes and spreads 'Gandhigiri' is what this movie is all about. Almost everything appears well-manicured in this movie. Well thought independent events to sprinkle Gandhism makes every moment of this movie likable. Except Jhanvi, every other character is well sketched and the movie tickles you hard with its hilarious 'tapori' lines and hard-nut Gandhism. Never preachy, Gandhism attains new heights and diffuses into the viewer quite efficiently. And finally, there is Sanjay Dutt, who after his portrayal of several hardcore gangster characters, blasts the screen with his rustic charms as Munnabhai. A must see if you want a nice laugh with some thought provoking leftovers to ponder upon as you scroll down the credit titles at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I sat down in the theater and the Vidhu Vinod Chopra banner was flashed, I was darn sure that something amazing is coming to hit me. Evidently, a better movie taste has engulfed Mr. Hirani as he tells us the hair-raising tale of a rude, violent gangster Munna and his dangerously funny henchman Sarkeshwar (better known as Circuit).The movie doesn't have the Jhappi and other things that we could relate to while seeing a Munnabhai MBBS sequel. In fact, it isn't a sequel in any way. The film is fresh, new, genuine and has an important message for the nation.It slaps politely the faces of those who try to politicize Gandhiji. Gandhi won't mind if all his statues and all his portraits were took down. He bleeds from the heart when a nation cries.Although in the movie, he is just a figment of imagination in the mind of Munna who "did some research" on Gandhiji to cover his feigned persona as a History Professor but, as he moved out of the Granthalaya, something accompanied him, something hit him hard in the head and he saw the truth.This movie just like Munnabhai MBBS is a classic and shall be remembered to be a landmark in Hindi cinema. Every true Indian would get goosebumps when the song "Vande Matram- Bande mein tha dum" is played. Specially, watch out for the poetic description of Gandhi's stature in the melodious voice of Sonu Nigam.Gandhi never died. Look what he just did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most loved movies of our time, Munnabhai MBBS has the kind of repeat viewing value that few other movies can boast of. It's not surprising then, that when Rajkumar Hirani wanted to make a sequel and took a survey all over the country for an apt title, a majority said 'Lage Raho Munnabhai'! So he dropped his title 'Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi' and settled for the public vote instead. This movie had expectations rocketing to the moon, but one is highly surprised to see that this movie is as good as the first one-it's not really a sequel, it just has Munna and his adorable sidekick Circuit and a host of other characters, some seen in the original like Boman Irani and Jimmy Shergill, playing completely different roles, and some new and brilliant finds. The safest thing for Hirani is that there can be no comparison with MBBS, as it has got nothing to do with it, but is fresh, new, hilarious, thought-provoking and has two of the most memorable characters in Indian film history-Munnabhai, Circuit, and their inimitable slang.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen so many comedy movies , where comedy is forced and the Actors have to make all kinds of funny faces and tricks. But this movie just takes you through the real streets of Mumbai its almost like an Art Film . Especially Ghandigiri portrayed is something where the script writer doesn't want to preach yet he delivers the message in a very straight forward manner . All the things happening around us i know in real life for us to ensure total Ghandigiri is impossible in the present world but not to forget, thats the way we got our freedom from the British. This is the best performance by Mr. Sanjay Dutt , an ignorant strong man and then there goes ( I will call him a phenomenon ) Arshad Warsi , a friend who is more than a friend , his acting is something which makes you forget all your troubles. I was even laughing while i was walking out of the cinema. This is definitely a hilarious movie ever made in the history of Indian Cinema , where all age groups could watch together. Hats off to the entire crew</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gandhi isn't gone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally we have a sequel better than it's original. Truly, I was driven into deep thought as I watched Lage Raho Munnabhai. What makes the movie so touchy is Mahatma Gandhi, and it's the reason why today's youngsters must watch this film. This is a film about truth, honesty and selflessness and behind a light-hearted comic screenplay lays deep thoughts and realities of today's society. Munnabhai meets Gandhi, and his world changes, but more than that it compels us to think what if we meet Gandhi and feel embarrassed upon ourselves for not being able to take what he wanted us to.I am not an Indian, but Gandhi being an Indian has laid down a path of truth and honesty for people all around the world. To say the least, Gandhi is the God of modern times and people like him aren't born often. The producers of this film have attempted to unravel the reality of our times where people have become so mean and selfish, that in fact if today Gandhi was to come back, would sadly return embarrassed and humiliated seeing how badly we all have failed to give him respect and cared less to what he said and did.And if films like these continue to come up, we may one day say that Gandhi isn't gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very few Hindi movies can claim what this movie can and should. Clean, "above the belt" comedy and a subtle yet powerful message, that's what makes this movie so unique and worth watching. It was heartwarming to see that someone could weave a fine story using elements like tapori (goon) lingo, simple romance, day-day problems of the common-man and Gandhiji's ideology. And yet, no compromise at all. Kudos!!! Sanjay Dutt is at his best again, and Arshad Warsi is impressive with his flawless, spontaneous comedy. Almost everyone from the previous movie has a big or small ( yet significant) role here. While Vidya Balan does good justice to Jhanvi's role, Gracy Singh's absence was felt; just for the reason that she did such a great job in the Munnabhai MBBS. After "Rang De Basanti", this is another movie which portrays the restlessness in today's youth to change the rotten system prevalent in India. If only we could have more such movies in these times. Again kudos to the entire team for making this masterpiece!</fullReview>

I am happy to report that Lage Raho Munnabhai will turn people like me into believers again. This is an indigenous, intelligent effort driven by some great out of the box creative thinking by the film-makers. Congratulations to the film-makers and we should certainly hope that we'll get to see more of such intelligent, original, world-class cinema from the world's largest film industry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rip-Roaring Munnabhai!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Munnabhai is back for this years hilarious sequel to Munnabhai MBBS, and it does a better job in terms of screen-story and directing. Sanjay Dutt, Arshad Warsi, and Boman Irani reunite in a new form to Munnabhai, this time with Munna taking on the theme of Gandhi and his mysterious ways.Munna who has fallen in love with a Radio Jockey named Jhanvi, played enthusiastically by female lead Vidya Bhalan, tries to win her heart by winning a contest on her radio show and going on to be the love of her life. But things get complicated as Munna tells a little white lie and goes on to teach "Gandhigiri" and all his lessons on how people should follow what is right. Things go from bad to worse as a confused and love-struck Munna takes away Jhanvi on a trip to Goa. When on that trip, the house that Jhanvi holds for her father and her uncle is taken over by a selfish proprietor named Lucky, played wonderfully by Boman Irani. So the conflict continues on with magical performances and superb long comical scenes that add up to the film's extravagant humor.Sanjay Dutt returns is his stylish Munna form and does his part for the whole film in an outstanding manner. His sidekick, Circuit played in an intense humorous act by Arshad Warsi, serves up for the chemistry in the whole film, be it whether they are drunk or having their scenes put together with an imaginary Gandhiji is just the piece of cinema you must watch. Rajkumar Hirani comes up again with another mild manner simple story for our lead characters. They are explored so well that you get immersed into them right from the start of the film. His script for this movie feels it has matured well, and the dialogues that get put up in the film is really worth the movie time.You would really laugh your heart out to this one, its better treated in terms of comedic one-liners, laugh-out-loud sequences, suspense, and truthful emotions for the whole public to discover. The Editing, done by Mr. Hirani himself, is truly well done. It was nicely paced, with great Montage sequences along with the Soundtrack.The Gandhi Theme could be a controversial topic for this movie, but it helps in terms of the story and gives a little movement to the scenes. Some flaws are set here and there throughout the movie, but who the hell cares as long as the movie moves on well to deliver its message of unity and equality, together with lots of over the top comic sequences and moments that will have you laughing till you reach home. Well directed with a fresh new look on comedy, this is certainly the comedy movie you should go for. Its Simply Fantastic.9 out of 10 for the return of Munnabhai. Lets hope we get a third movie very soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Munna Bhai .... Excellent movie!! Lage Raho.. Even Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last week (Sunday). I wanted to see it at Priya Cineplex which is the best movie theater in Delhi (arguably), but realized that the movie was not at any PVR multiplexes (due to some settlement issues). Nevertheless, I had to see the movie as I was very sure that the movie would be a total failure as the first part (MBBS) was very good. I just wanted to see how bad ... so much so that I got a Rs. 70 ($1.25) ticket at Rs. 150 ($3.0) at one of those Other Cinema halls. In retrospect now, I have found the movie to be definitely worth the last penny that I spent. Lage Raho is BETTER than MBBS (IMDB rating are already specking the story!!!). Although, I am not one of those techy movie goers, but I know for sure that the Critics would have a VERY difficult time critique'ing this one. The best part of the movie is that the director did not go the conventional route of connecting the threads with the prequel and then loosing the focus from the story. I have seen many Bollywood (sequel) movies not doing well because the directors were not ready to experiment ? Kriss is a classic example of a sequel movie gone WRONG!!On specifics: Sanjay Dutt is looking old ?.but who cares!! He is still going strong. Arshad Warsi ?.. who knows him by his original name now? :-) At least my parents don't ?. He is "Circuit" for them. Vidya Balan ?. She is not there just for her chocolaty presence?. She delivers!!! Boman Irani ?. One talented SOB!! 2nd Innings Team ?.. perfect. (especially the "Kissing Car")Rest of the team is equally good.And Finally: The Mahatma ?.. Needless to say, the director has treaded an extremely difficult path of featuring a popular political/human figure in the most subtle of manner. Normally, movies of such type end up raising many eyebrows (if not only from the censor board). Not this one!Bravo to the whole crew!! ?. This movie will go into Bollywood folklore as being one of those better known classic movies.Today, I got to know that PVR is also featuring this movie and I will not miss the opportunity of watching the movie again at my favorite Cineplex ? Priya!!!Please watch it once!!PS: This is my first review on any movie till date. I just couldn't resist the temptation to comment on this PERFECT movie. 10/10 :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is mindblowingly entertaining!! (no spoilers) The expectations from Lage Raho Munnabhai were huge. So does the movie live up to expectations? Well in terms of quality the movie is a winner from the very first scene to the very last! In short LRM is mindblowingly entertaining and it retains the feel-good element that was seen in the Munnabhai M.B.B.S. I don't think I've had this much fun watching a Bollywood film in a Long time!! The biggest plus point of the movie is its original and interesting script by VVC and Raju Hirani. It shows in the movie how hard they have work and how time they have spent in writing the script! Hats off to Raju Hirani (especially) and VVC..The story of the movie is simple but honest treatment by Raju Hirani makes the movie work. The screenplay is simply brilliant and the movie moves forward at a breakneck pace keep the viewer engrossed in the story with plenty of non-stop laughs as well as few tears right through thats how entertaining the film is. It never drags!! Therefore IMO the real hero of the film is Rajkumar Hirani! The songs are average (though i liked them from the very first listen) but they have been picturized mindblowingly (esp. Samjho Ho hi gaya) and not for once do they hold the narrative except Pal Pal..which is nice song but wasn't required.The Performances are yet again of high caliber! Vidya Balan is natural and looks gorgeous throughout the film.Boman Irani as Lucky Singh is terrific yet again though his role is not as good as Dr. Asthana of Munnabhai M.B.B.S but he slips easily into his Punjabi character and is a treat to watch! The two pillars of Munnabhai series are Munna and Circuit and will always remain so! Arshad Warsi has acted so fabulously that he quite outdoes his turn in Munnabhai M.B.B.S. He was good in the original but here he is unmatchable! He is simply mind-blowing. One cannot imagine Munnabhai without Circuit! Which brings us to our Munnabhai bole to apna Sanju Baba. One might say that he looks too old in the film, that Jhanvi looks young enough to be his daughter, that he has put on weight. IMO one would be right about all of these things, and yet none of it seems to matter, so lovable is Dutt in this film. He is so endearing that we smile without a reason the moment we see him. It is difficult to even imagine another actor playing Munna, as Munna fits Dutt to the T (I'll say same for Circuit). What a charming performance!On the finishing note i would like to say that the Chemistry between Sanjay and Arshad is electrifying. It makes my heart melt (spoiler: witness the apology scene)!! They have officially become one of my most favorite(if not the most) bollywood jodis.I am still undecided as to which part is better..i guess i'll leave it upon my second viewing to decide! As for this year my first viewing is enough for me to say that LRM is the best movie of the year (followed closely by Zinda, RDB &amp; Omkara) and most certainly my most favorite movie of the year! 9/10 Bring on the 3rd in the series!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lage Raho Munnabhai gives you what you expect from the movie - It does what it says on the can. Its more of the same, just another serving. So if you enjoyed the first one and want a similar experience, go watch it - You wont be disappointed. The script goes a bit awry towards the end but the screenplay is good. As can be expected, the chemistry between Sanju and Arshad is tremendous and keeps the audience smiling,laughing all 3 hrs,almost. If the movie becomes a super-hit, which I can see happening, expect this pair to go down in Bollywood history books. Full marks to whoever wrote the dialogues, jokes, one-liners for Arshad and to Arshad himself for the class comic act. I have been warned not to watch "Anthony Kaun Hain" but after this performance, Golmaal and Salaam Namaste, its hard to resist going for a cheap rental DVD.For the entire review, go to : http://sharadslife.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think you can actually make movies that can be rated 10 on 10. But Lage Raho is just one of those. Its just flawless. It is a real laugh, with some strong messages in it.Based on its prequel, MBBS, Lage Raho, features the two primary characters, Munna and his henchman Circuit. True that MBBS, focused on the primary characters a bit more, whereas here, the focus is a little less, since the director had to accommodate too many characters here. The entire cast seems to have remained the same, but unlike MBBS, where the comedy was in short spurts, Lage Raho is a constant laugh. The only negative aspect that this movie seem to have is the lack of proper songs. MBBS had far more superior songs compared to these lame tracks, but what the hell, I am here for the movie review right ??Vidya Balan looks amazing in this movie, looks wise and acting wise. Sanjay Dutt is the same Munna, with his swears and typical 'Tapori' language. Circuit has a much larger role to play here than the previous movie. But still he is a killer. Boman Irani, yet again puts on some heavy make up, but that doesn't mask his amazing acting abilities. He is fast catching up to Paresh Rawal and Johnny Lever with regards to comedy. Diya Mirza and Abhishek Bachchab gives more of guest performances than a proper role to comment on. Jimmy Shergill's character is shorter than the previous outing, but still he has a credential in this one.All in all, in MBBS, where the message of the movie was very strong, here, the message is kept subtle throughout the movie, until the very end when a five minute sequence projects strongly the theme of the movie. I wont go on harping on the plot because almost everyone knows about it. The direction is superb, acting superb, camera work, whatever was needed was superb. All in all, 10/10 !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming of the new age sequel!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kitne aadmi the", "Mogambo Khush Hua"; these epoch - making dialogues were from different directors. But once in a lifetime, it happens that "Jaadu ki Jhappi" and "Gandhigiri" coined by the same man get popularized and that too back to back. Bravo Mr. Hirani!!! If the faith healer worked in Munnabhai, "Gandhi" worked for Lage Raho Munnabhai. Keeping the basics i.e. comedy intact, Hirani changed everything. I think this is the beginning of the new age sequel pioneered by Hirani. It is so similar yet so different. Witty dialogues, well written screenplay, good comic timing, and well thought about characterization. Everything is so common. The only uncommon element is the plot and the backdrop. It's the screenplay, all the scenes just flow and are well knitted. Nothing is enforced. Our Munnabhai falls for Jhanvi, Vidya Balan who is a radio jockey. Vidya has a good screen presence and amazing dialogue delivery. The quiz contest on Gandhi, Murli Prasad aka Munnabhai winning the contest and his eventual entrance to the Mahatma Gandhi Library, are all very situational.Sanjay Dutt reading n number of books on Gandhiji is a bit indigestible, probably that's the reason Gandhiji comes out of the pages and that too without spectacles!!! I was kidding?ever saw Gandhiji without Spectacles? It's same as Sanjay Dutt with Books!!! Jhanvi arranges a lecture on Gandhiji for her grandfather and his friends at their place fondly called as the second innings home. Munnabhai being the professor and Gandhiji, one man rescuer.It was at the second innings home that their feelings get mutual. Here is the entry of the cunning Sardar Lucky Singh!!! Boss what characterization!He looks very convincing as the greedy builder. It's him that moves the story ahead as he sends them to Goa and takes possession of the second innings home through Munnabhai's right hand Circuit. I must say that Circuit just steals the show. He has developed himself as an actor with great coming timing. In spite of repetition of the same character, he has managed to make people roll out of their seats. It's the powerful performance of the character that makes you feel the need of a Circuit in your life!! Jimmy Shergill and Diya Mirza do justice to their respective roles. The phone-in programme on the principles of Gandhiji is a brilliant idea, very original. "Gandhigiri is in full swing".Gandhiji tried to be preachy but the presence of people like Circuit and Lucky Singh diluted the effect making it a film with a vision. The show leaves you with nothing but a smile on your face and the theater buzzes with Pal, Pal, Pal?Pal Har Pal?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an AWESOME movie!!! This movie makes a rare and updated review of what made Mahatma Gandhi the perfect freedom fighter with his simple skills of honesty and non-violence. It is a very enjoyable movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. A movie on Gandhi obviously doesn't have a lot of violence or bad language!Sure, this is one of the funniest movies ever. If for nothing else, watch it as an excellent comedy. This is an Indian movie that can enjoyed by everyone around the world. If you can watch it with a Hindi speaking friend, that much the better.Something interesting about this movie is that is uses characters from another movie (Munnabhai MBBS) but is not really a sequel. So don't worry about trying to watch the first Munnabhai movie before this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure there are many stalwarts out there who can slice-and-dice a movie. Hence I shall KISS - Keep It Short and Simple. (PJ!! PJ!! PJ!!).Mr. Hirani you are in form man - the tapori's are just extremely lovable. Munna and Circuit bonding is given due importance here. Father-son conversation (Parikshit Sahni and Jimmy Shergill) is touching. Love thy neighbour is explained in true Indian terms. I wish Satyagraha was bit more elaborate. The method to curb bribe was innovative. And so was the myth about astrology. Did I miss the Gandhian fast-unto-death concept?The first half was amazing while the latter was logic tolerant. The radio counselling concept was novel - found improper only at the climax. Performances - thumbs up for everyone. Dutt Saab, we miss you in this one. Even when Circuit twitched, I laughed hard. Vidya Balan has amazing screen presence. I couldn't take my eyes off her even when she howled "Good Morning Mumbai". Only a slight hitch - she appears dwarf next to Lambu Munna. Dilip Prabhavalkar once again displays his histrionics as Mahatma Gandhi. Comparions to hosts of other actors including Ben Kingsley are bound to arise - but hey, this Mahatma Gandhi can be, what Munnabhai wants to. And Munnabhai's Gandhi is fantastic."Bande Mein Tha Dum" awakens the patriotism in you while "Pal Pal" is foot tapping. The movie has lot of moments which you will carry once you walk out of cinema hall. Subliminally you will carry Gandhian values.PS: Skipped KANK and watched LRM - thanks to my friend, it saved my ?6.</fullReview>

But minor sins these in an otherwise honest to goodness farce that makes you laugh and cry all the way! Sanjay Datt as Munnabhai and Arshad Warsi grown far bigger than a regular sidekick as Circuit, carry on spiritedly from where they left in Munnabhai MBBS, and enliven the bigger canvas of love, life and yes conscience (abstracted as a 'chemical locha (trouble)' of the brain!! Selling Gandhi to my young generation is like selling spinach to my young daughter....you haven't got a chance, unless prob'ly Popeye eats the spinach and well, Munnabhai practices Gandhigiri!

		<fullReview>The fact that the Mahatma and his ideologies have been paid little more than lip - service in recent years is common knowledge to most Indians. As is shown in the movie, currency notes, roads n one - sided history lessons have become the only way to remember Bapu, that too momentarily. This is where this 'Lage raho..' scores heavily. Like 'Rang de basanti' earlier, it draws parallels to our freedom struggle by invoking Gandhiji. Mixing 'Gandhigiri' with a contemporary phenomenon like Munnabhai is a master stroke. The movie has its fair share of laughs(maybe a li'l less than the 1st one), but the overall feel is better and the innocence has been retained. All the leads are in great form, right from Sanjay Dutt to Jimmy Shergill. Vidya Balan looks very pretty n innocent, as suited to the role. The performance, tho, I really liked was Boman Irani - damn good. He's repulsive n likable in equal measure. And finally, the actor playing Gandhiji, is so astutely tongue-in-cheek, u cannot but love him. There are a few stretched sequences-a couple of the drunk scenes, the songs, but not too many. Patriotic comedy, I read somewhere. Gandhian humor is what I'd call it.</fullReview>

Of course we have two lead characters with "Tapori" background , but their perception of social problems and solutions to the same, makes this comedy different. Incidentally this is second movie in the recent times when the character studies real personality from History, which in turn changes his/her approach to life. Yes I am referring to Rang De Basanti , where the group of youth emulates the revolutionary freedom fighters. and Here we have the protagonist, who starts a lie to win over his love &amp; ends up becoming supporter of "Truth and Non-Violence" and how he implements those two principles in modern times creates all those comic situation , which teach lesson or two for the viewers .. Sanjay Dutt &amp; Arshad Warsi are made for each other pair, they have really got mastery on the Munna-Circuit Combo , and I wont mind another 10 sequels made to the movie , with unique story-lines of course...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Munnabhai MBBS was a Fabulous movie that was very entertaining. Looking at the trailer and storyline i assumed the Second Munnabhai will not bee as good. I was wrong, I absolutely Loved the second one much more then the first. There is plenty of humour with mature comedy, with lots of heart warming scenes mixed with serious issues providing High Class Entertainment. Sanjay Dutt is Superb yet again portraying the lovable Good hearted Goon. Arshad Warsi is fantastic as the loyal sidekick, He is brilliant in almost every scene. My Favourite Scene has to be when Munnabhai and Circuit hug and make up, a very heart warming scene. Vidya Balan is alright i guess although her voice is a little annoying when she repeatedly says Good morning Mumbai! Boman Irani is great just like the first. Jimmy is hardly there and could of been deleted out. Diya Mirza looks Sexy and was perfect. This is a FANTASTIC MOVIE and deserves to win awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun bollywood movie but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it a 6.5/10 because the movie is one of the best bollywood movies to come out for a long time - why? - Because it has some great acting, nice clean comedy &amp; it teaches some good values to people, something that is sorely lacking in today's world.Having said that, I see that the rating of this movie is 8.8 and I'm pretty sure the bollywood faithful are responsible for it. If you think about the movie from an international perspective, it lacks imagination - it is yet another of the typical bollywood movies - silly singing &amp; dancing &amp; no novelty (except that the central character sees Gandhi, which had a good twist). The central characters are happy to be uneducated goons, the people who are powerful are also uneducated &amp; corrupt and this reality is what is depressing about the country and I find it hard to enjoy. When is bollywood going to make a Sci-fi like Jurassic Park or a drama like Crash or Brokeback mountain or a modern Martial arts classic like Ong-Bak so that it can truly challenge the international movie arena. I don't see that happening anytime in the next century.In the meantime its going to be churning out millions of similar movies like Lage Raho ... every year only for stagnant people to rate it 8.8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not just a movie, it's an experience and no offense but you ARE a fool if you haven't seen this movie, and you are definitely not a human being if you haven't liked this movie. The three hours journey leaves you totally stunned as it makes you cry, laugh, and connect to the characters. Somewhere, in the movie, it makes you realize your wrong doings in life. You don't cry for the characters in the movie, but for yourself. I have seen this movie for like at least more than fifty times now, and still every time i see it, I learn a lot from it. Emotional is an understatement for this movie, it is much more than that. This kind of cinema has never been done and I am definitely sure can never be repeated again, not just in bollywood but anywhere in the world. The movie simply teaches you a way of life, a way for you to realize that you are not just a highly developed class of animals fighting for surviving on this planet but much more than that. Believe me, you will thank me after watching this movie if you are watching it after reading my comment, moreover you will thank yourself for watching it, you will feel deep in your heart a sense of relief and satisfaction as if you have done something great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet, Innocent Bollywood entertainer which gets a little too sacharine .... It is able to deliver the Mahatma's message in a more easily digestible form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Movie starts off with that (in)famous song - "Subah ho gayi Mamu!" and a gag that will leave you laughing your arses off. As usual, Arshad Warsi as Circuit steals the show with his wisecracks that range from the silly to the absurd, but never fails to tickle the funny bone. It then proceeds to slowly unravel both the characters and the plot and switches from one gag to another, from one subplot to another with great ease.The casting is just spot-on. Boman Irani as the evil-Builder/doting father delivers another great performance. Dia Mirza and Jimmy Shergill have their bits and essay it with conviction. The oldies group also does its bit with some fine ensemble acting. Sanjay Dutt as Munnabhai is just sublime - his interactions with "Gandhi" are very nicely done. The actor who essays the role of "Gandhi" has delivered a rock-solid performance. But, the one man who steals the show completely is Warsi as Circuit. I hope Mr. Hirani writes many more scripts centering around this great caricature of a gangster's goofy chamcha!Vidya Balan is of course just a whiff of fresh air, amidst the tanned/exposed and hyped up set of actresses - she blends perfectly into the role and besides, its a great visual treat to see her on screen. However, the one thing that she does wrong is the "Good Mooooorrrrrning Mumbai!" - The phrase is repeated so often and with such an annoying intonation, that you wish to personally quieten her down!While the 1st half delivers most of the rib-ticklers, the 2nd half has its share of funny moments, although they are far and few. There are many high-points in the movie, so many so that its difficult to pin-point any one. The 2nd half of the movie admittedly becomes too saccharine and sentimental - at times, the situation is dramatized to such an extent, that it becomes a superficial and forced attempt to elicit teary responses from the audience. In that sense, the movie could have done away with less melodrama and a more mature view of the situation.Another small point that must be made with regards to the melodrama is the annoying practice of showing flashes of either smiling/weeping faces, which accompanies each of Munna's accomplishments. In the 1st movie, they had wide-eyed, smiling nurses and weeping sweepers/ward-boys in the background - thats okay (by okay I mean tolerable). But here, Mr. Hirani employs the services of Barbers and customers at the Barber's, Police Inspectors and regular people - and strangely all the faces were masculine. Mr. Hirani, a feminine face is far more astute at portraying emotions - its not Rocket Science to get that. At least the nurses were decent and visually pleasing. Whats with the Masculine attraction, Mr. Hirani?Where the movie delivers, however, is the perfect blend of Gandhian values, Patriotism and a modern-day India which thrives on individualism. It doesn't overload viewers with a barrage of statistical information or documentary style detached narration or "preachy" dialogues. What it uses is : kick-ass street-smartness + wisecracks by Circuit and Munna + Gandhi's Teachings + PatriotismAnd this results in both 'paisa-vasool' entertainment and also ensures that you leave the theatre with a renewed sense of hope and vigour to your bit for your country. True, that this brand of pop-partiotism and wisecracking-Gandhism is hardly a concrete solution to India's problems, but what the heck! You certainly wanna believe badly that the solution could be a gun-toting Munnabhai and his knife-toting sidekick Circuit.Bottom-Line: This is NOT as humorous as the 1st movie - it doesn't pretend to be either. What it is though is pure family entertainment at its best. After a long long long time, Bollywood has produced a movie without Raakhi Saawant and item numbers, without crunching explosions and 3rd rate special effects, without borrowed Hollywood/Japanese/Korean scripts. This movie is sweet, innocent and pure, yet street-smart and total dhamaal. Go and watch it with your friends and/or family - this is one movie that everyone can enjoy! Kudos to Mr. Hirani and his team! They have stopped making movies like these!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bollywood has a history of copycats.Leave sequels, you watch a good Hindi movie and later find out that it was copied from some English flick.Lage Raho Munnabhai defies history by not only providing a pristine script but also provides healthy comedy in a sequel meeting all expectations. Vidhu Vinod Chopra has yet again blended emotional drama with characters and has come out clean giving a message to the society.Dil chahta hai ,Rang de Basanti ,Munnabhai,Krrish have been movies which clearly depict the progressive and maturing behavior of bollywood in the past few years.Lage Raho Munnabhai not only makes you laugh but reiterates that how a common man can play a powerful role to change the society.How following the right path is important in life.Vidya Balan again proves how talent is not only with the big stars and plays a bubbly RJ of mumbai city. Circuit is as fresh as ever with his commitment to Munna but the whole storyline is new.A must Watch</fullReview>

Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi continue to play two lovable rogues and Warsi is simply hilarious at times. The film's propagation of non-violent Gandhian techniques is refreshingly different. Boman Irani has a negative role and is very effective. Jimmy Shergill and Vidya Balan chip in with brief appearances. Some of Munna's 'Mahatma-inspired' solutions are definitely a bit odd but remain enjoyable to watch. The climax is surprisingly effective and is a real crowd-pleaser.Overall 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most over-hyped and overrated movies! The concept of 'gandhigiri' is interesting but the way it's used in this melodramatic, boring, inconsistent and lackluster film is childish. The performances are unimpressive and the toning and cutting down of Circuit is a crime. He was the best thing in the first movie and here he is wasted. Sanjay Dutt reprises his role and brings nothing new. Pretty much the same cast of the first film is repeated with the exception of Gracy Singh who has been replaced by the two beauties of 'Parineeta' (both of whom fail to deliver and Balan's 'Goooood Moooooorrrrning' is mind-numbing). Boman Irani is annoying, again. The soundtrack is forgettable and cinematography is drab. Hirani's direction lacks flow and skill. It's almost as if a hack like David Dhawan made the film. Someone needs to tell the director that merely having a good message is not enough to make a good film. Given that, this movie had potential to be great but alas! Even Gandhi is portrayed as a pathetic caricature. Moreover some heavy editing was required because of the dragging pace. The Sanjay Dutt- Vidya Balan romantic track is unconvincing. This is one of the most boring films of 2006.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give the film 5 rating not because I did not like it but because of the lack of sophistication in it. Just like writing, painting, composing; film-making is an art. That does not mean that it cannot use coarse language or local dialect, but it should have more than that. This is the only drawback of the film. In any work where Gandhi is a major theme, one needs to be a thinker rather than just a moviemaker. Gandhi is not a simple subject, and it is better to leave it to the intellectuals to deal with it. Yet I thought the filmmaker did an excellent job handling the contradictory ideas such as 'if someone slaps you don't retaliate but show him the other cheek'. But it was presented in a literal manner than its inner meaning. We must be taught that Gandhi was a pacifier and that is most important. All great personalities around the worlds are pacifiers and to understand that we need to develop a rational mind, not 'Gandhigiri'. Apart from this, the film did an excellent job handling the social issues. The most fascinating of all is the way it ridiculed the superstition of our society. Superstitions are rooted so deep that real hard kick on their bu**s from films like this one is a treat to the modern movie-watchers. Great job in that department of bu** kicking! The emphasis on the usefulness of scientific reasoning is another area where the film excelled again. After watching the film I thought that the filmmakers went through a lot of intellectual discussions before filming it. This is rare in Bollywood. The filmmakers also tried to keep the usual Indian melodrama aside. I must agree that they did a fair job in that department too. Except for a very few places, there was no melodrama at all. Overall, leaving aside Gandhi philosophy and some overacting (a common problem with Indian cinema), it is a good work. I'll remember it for a long time. Although it is a good film for Indian people, but has a limited appeal towards greater audience, which is not a negative point at all. If it is a good film and gives Indians something to use their brains, who cares if it is not Oscar-worthy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like everyone else I to loved Munnabhai MBBS maybe not as much others but no matter what people said I had to see this film.In this case however I feel the people have unnecessarily hyped this film.I really think people have not really liked this film as much as they think they did.Sounds weird but lets see if this helps.Just answer the following questions...1)In 1 min can you name 3 scenes or more in the movie that were absolutely hilarious, or absolutely lovable? Most of the people I spoke to couldn't as opposed to the first one.The best answer that i received is that this is Feel Good Film.My sentiments exactly.2)So can you tell me 2 (3 is too much) scenes in the movie that really made you feel good or that you can relate to, something that you would aspire to incorporate in your life even though you know you may never do it.Hmmmmmmmmm...Yet to meet one person who was able to answer this in the the stipulated time satisfactorily.YET THIS MOVIE IS BEING HAILED AS THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, THE BEST MOVIE EVER, THE BEST MOVIE BY SANJAY DUTT ETC ETC.Its rating here is 8.5/10 hell that makes it one of the best Hindi movie ever.Apply my simple questions to any movie you have seen that you feel you have loved as much and see how fast you are repeating the scenes.My personal feeling that due to lack of any good releases Hindi or English in the vicinity of the movie and the marketing force that has been put behind this movie people are convinced its much better than it is.Yet there is no denying the quality of this movie.The acting is fabulous from the entire cast, I cannot think of a single character who has underperformed or overacted.Arshad Warsi has excelled in this film and even though he will not be remember for anything special from this movie his role was much more important in this film.This movie may have supposed to be a sequel but IT IS A MOVIE WITH THE SAME CAST AT BEST.The Plot of the movie borrows nothing from the except the main characters no one in this film plays the role he played in the original.THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL FROM ANY ANGLE.I however consider this a good thing and goes to show the maturity of the audience who is willing to accept the fact that this movie is more about the characters than the storyline and almost no one is complaining about the plot holes.The movie endears but at the same time there is blatant disregard for the facts such as Munnabhai is actually a criminal no importance is given to his past criminal activities.Marketing in this film luckily is not as blatant as the other films but I really don't think this new wave of promotional tie-ups and product placement (if it can be called that )is good for the industry.Read my review on Pyaar ke side effects to see how it should be done.There were a couple of funny sequences for me such as circuits hopes of becoming great merely by going to jail and the earlier lottery system for giving the correct answers.(even i cannot name more than 2).However the feel good factor wasn't as good for me because frankly speaking I feel there are many much better movies (not recently though) in this regard.Technically also this film is up there (as any film with this kind of budget should be).The songs of this film are completely forgettable and are far below the league of the earlier one and also other songs out right now.The first half is almost boring and pales in comparison to the second.Dopnt get me wrong Gandhi was a great man and such a unidimensional look at a person can be a very dangerous thing we have to learn to deglorify our heroes and learn from not only his good qualities but also from his bad.There is no human who is perfect.I for one am not a great fan of Gandhijis political decisions while I am a great fan of his personal choices.In all a film that is good but has been over-hyped to epic proportions.Yet its a must watch but please don't go in expecting the world.-s HIGHLY Over-hyped, no really big funny or feel good scenes, poor songs, first half is boring compared to the second.+/-s not a sequel strictly speaking, Unidimensional look at Gandhiji.+s great technically, super acting, some good scenes and a good message at the end.total 7/10 (absolute and factoring in expectations).</fullReview>

Oh my how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of 970 people who voted are Indian and their only venture outside Bolliwood production were Adam Sandler movies.With this rating this movie would be ranked on 9th place on IMDb List of 250 best movies above Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that I find worth remembering from this painful experience. My only hope is that there is a lot of Hindu who like me find this movie as is -- plain stupid, with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music.</fullReview>
