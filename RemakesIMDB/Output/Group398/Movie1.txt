		<shortDescription>Good Movie but Prabhu Deva Should have changed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first Telugu movie which i saw on the day of its release because of Chiranjeevi as I am Die Hard fan of him The Movie was good.... Chiranjeevi rocked as do Srikant n Karisma Kotak she looked v beautiful n suited well to the Megastar and Dilip Prabhavalnkar as Gandhiji was good But,Prabhu shouldn't have used the scenes of Lage Raho which he did by dubbing them in Telugu.....People got disappointed on seeing that on screen... Songs are good and the direction as well but the movie disappointed a large number of masses especially. The Special Appearances by Prabhu,Ravi Teja and Allu Arjun was a treat for the audiences</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't reach expectations.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Shankardada Zindabad just last night and have to say I am very disappointed with Chiranjeevi and the makers of the movie. First of all, Chiranjeevi looks very fat and bulky. His dances weren't as good as his dances in Tagore and Indra. Secondly, Karishma Kotak is not glamorous at all. I really wondered why they put her in the film. They should have put Asin or Nayantara or Vidya Balan. But Karishma Kotak really works against the film. Thirdly, the cinematography (lighting) wasn't as good as Chota K. Naidu's other films as cinematographer. One would expect GREAT dances from the combination of Chiranjeevi and Prabhudeva. But Prabhudeva also failed to live upto those expectations as well. The only plus point of the movie is Devi Sri Prasad's music.</fullReview>
