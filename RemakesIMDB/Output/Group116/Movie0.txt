		<shortDescription>Riveting mystery stars Olivia de Havilland and Olivia de Havilland in their only film together...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Olivia de Havilland proves that she is one of the most talented and versatile actresses on the silver screen. She does so here by accepting the challenge of playing a dual role. Thanks to the astonishing visual effects and the occasional use of stand-ins, we see two of her in this movie...playing twin sisters! Tightly directed by Robert Siodmak (who directed THE KILLERS that same year, which was the film that made stars out of Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner), this intriguing film flies by at a brisk 85 minutes and is full of twists and turns. Although the film contains an excellent cast (among the supporting members include Thomas Mitchell and Lew Ayres), the mystery in the story is a simple one. Even non-mystery fans will be entertained by the film, since the plot is rather uncomplicated. The film was later adapted for radio as a half-hour episode of "The Screen Director's Playhouse," also starring Olivia. I have a recording of this episode on audio tape and Olivia's performance is fascinating: she lowers and raises the pitch of her voice whenever she plays a separate twin in order for the audience to tell the difference between the two. This episode is a must for Olivia's fans.Despite the low budget of the film, THE DARK MIRROR contains stark cinematography by Milton Krasner and a very effective music score by Dmitri Tiomkin, as well as unusually high production values. Even when seen in the eyes of someone who is currently living in the generation of digital special effects, the visual effects of the twin sisters are flawless and instantly convincing?thanks to Olivia's excellent acting skills and the creativity of the special effects department. How'd they do that? The film is worth watching, even if it's only for watching the marvelous visual effects. On a personal level, I wonder what it would be like if Olivia and her estranged yet equally-famous sister, Joan Fontaine, ever starred in a film together...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those were the days.Every director had his Freudian movie during the glorious forties:Hitchcock had " spellbound",Lang "secret beyond the door" Tourneur "cat people".... and Siodmak "the dark mirror".and it stood the test of time quite well ,almost as much as the three works I mention above.Of course ,the film owes a lot to Olivia de Havilland's sensational rendition,well half a century before Jeremy Irons' "dead ringers" or Keaton's "multiplicity".We run the whole gamut, as Siodmak brought out all his equipment :inkblood test, lie detector,mirror,and the whole kit.But De Havilland's charisma -at a time when actresses mastered their audience-survives and remains intact.We often feel ill-at-ease when we do not know who we're watching anymore(she plays twin sisters who are suspects in a criminal affair).De Havilland was perfect when it came to portraying ambiguous women (see also "My cousin Rachel")Robert Siodmak had an eventful career:after his debut in Germany,he made some works in France ("Pi?ges" (1939) is the best and deserves to be watched)then came to America where he made remarkable thrillers ("the spiral staircase";"the killers").His career ended in Europa with interesting -but difficult to see- movies about Nazism ,but the only one of those late movies we can see now is "Katia" (1959),pure schmaltz</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is a little bit light, with a bumbling detective played by Thomas Mitchell and vintage Freudian psychoanalysis presented by Lew Ayres, but the twin sister role, one a good girl the other very bad, played by Olivia De Havilland has its moments. Her soft voice can go either direction, sweet and innocent or cold and devious, and the scenes where she is playing both parts, essentially talking to herself, convey a split personality, which might not have been such a bad idea, instead of making two distinct persons. It reaches a zenith in one scene in their dark bedroom with the innocent twin tormented by the mean one, who's telling her to take her sleep medication, and who in fact would like to see her overdose. Freudianism and bungling detective work win out in the end, making this all seem too convenient, and dodging a lot of the possibilities, but the central part, or parts, is DeHavilland at her best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Not even nature can duplicate character, not even in twins"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Psychology is a dubious science as it is, but, when a Hollywood screenwriter gets his hands on it, anything even closely resembling fact is thrown out the window. In the mid-1940s, Freudian psychology reached the peak of its popularity, and films such as Hitchcock's 'Spellbound (1945)' and Lang's 'Secret Beyond the Door? (1947)' utilised their own versions of psychoanalysis to provide easy answers for their characters' delusions. Robert Siodmak's 'The Dark Mirror (1946)' is no different, in that we are offered a half-baked pseudo-scientific dissertation on why even identical twins can be anything but identical when it comes to personality traits. In fact, screenwriter Nunnally Johnson (who also wrote and directed 'The Three Faces of Eve (1957)') actively pumps the familiar but questionable notion that twins respectively represent the good and evil sides of man. This duality is similar to that explored in the earlier versions of 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920/1931/1941),' though the two sides of the human coin are here separated from their mutual shell and allowed to behave as independent entities.Olivia de Havilland excels in dual roles as Terry and Ruth Collins, twin sisters who might just have pulled off the perfect crime, even if only one knows it. When the sisters' shared boyfriend is murdered in cold blood, two witnesses place one of the twins at the scene of the crime, while three more provide a solid alibi for the other. The only problem is that nobody can tell the pair apart. A police detective (Thomas Mitchell) is torn apart by the case: how can he charge either woman with murder if he can't decide which of the sisters is, in fact, a murderess? Only through Hollywood's good friend Dr. Freud can the true nature of the crime be exposed. The distinction between the "good" and "insane" twin is clearly drawn early in the film, with de Havilland playing one sister, Terry, as a cocky dominator, and the other, Ruth, as more softly-spoken, with eyes always downcast and hands delicately clasped together. Clarifying the dual relationship is some convenient symbolism used in the film's climax: Terry is dressed in black, and Ruth in white.Convincing optical effects and the use of body doubles are employed successfully to create the illusion of two Olivia de Havillands. The actress does well as both characters, perhaps channelling her dislike of sister Joan Fontaine to portray the snarling, psychotic and homicidally jealous "evil sister." Though they start out perfectly alike, it doesn't take long for the two Collins sisters to develop distinct personalities in the eyes of the audience, and Siodmak should quickly have dispensed with the obvious name-tags (either a necklace or a single letter pin) added to ensure that the audience could follow who was who. Perhaps misguidedly, the presence of twins is at first played largely for laughs, with composer Dimitri Tiomkin keeping the atmosphere surprisingly light and fluffy. Fortunately, however, the mood darkens substantially in the film's second half, as the hatred simmering slowly within the darker twin threatens to spill over into reality. Though the unlikely psychology behind 'The Dark Mirror' tests one's credulity at regular intervals, the strong acting and unique storyline make this one worth seeking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Dr. Frank Peralta is found stabbed to death straight to the heart in his apartment, two neighbors swear to the veteran Lt. Stevenson (Thomas Mitchell), who is charge of the investigation, that they saw Ruth Collins (Olivia de Havilland) leaving his apartment late night. The detective interrogates Ruth and she has the alibi of three witnesses that she was walking around in the Jefferson Park during the night. Then he visits Ruth in her apartment and discovers that she has an identical twin sister called Terry. Lt. Stevenson does not know who the killer is and the prosecutor does not accept to open the case. The sisters can not find a job and Dr. Scott Elliott (Lew Ayres), who is a specialist in twins that had been contacted by Lt. Steenson and has a crush on Ruth, offers a reasonable allowance to the sisters to be submitted to a series of tests for his research of personalities of twins. Scott finds through the results that Terry is a psychotic woman and Ruth might be in danger. "The Dark Mirror" is a tense psychological film-noir with an intriguing story that has excellent beginning and conclusion. The impressive performance of Olivia de Havilland in a dual role is top-notch, using different attitudes for each sister; and the direction of Robert Siodmak is tight as usual. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Espelho d'Alma" ("Mirror of the Soul")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, with my background as an ex-therapist and psychology teacher, I was quick to notice that there was a lot of psychological mumbo-jumbo in this film. The whole notion of a "nice twin" and an "evil twin" just seems like a silly cliché.However, if you ignore the improbability of the film, you will be rewarded with a pretty exciting and original film. Olivia DeHavilland plays identical twins and the split screen and other tricks were done pretty seamlessly. Her acting, as usual, was lovely to watch. The film also starred Thomas Mitchell as the cop and Lew Ayers as the psychologist--and both were at about their best.The story excels in regard to how it portrayed the sociopathic sister. She was pretty realistic, as she was a good example of an Antisocial Personality Disorder--having no conscience and being highly manipulative.Some other things that I found interesting were the excellent plot twists and suspense elements. Also, I was surprised when I noticed that at least some of the Rorschach cards (for the "ink blot test") were real cards--these are NOT supposed to be shown to the general public and are to only be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. And the responses the women gave were pretty realistic. I guess someone slipped up, huh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is Something About Twin Siblings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can possibly write a monograph or study regarding this subject: the good and bad in humanity as shown by twins in movies. It runs the gamut in films like A STOLEN LIFE, THE DARK MIRROR, THE CORSICAN BROTHERS, DEAD RINGER, COBRA WOMAN, even (watered down) in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA. In the last one, the King is a drunkard, while Rudolph Rassendyl is a brave, resourceful type (in the actual novel that is the sequel, RUPERT OF HENZAU, the King develops into a paranoid villain who loathes the distant cousin who rescued him). As for the others, Bette Davis's good sister in A STOLEN LIFE watches her bad sister steal Glenn Ford from her. Douglas Fairbanks' wilder brother critically wounds his brother in a duel over a woman in THE CORSICAN BROTHERS. Maria Montez's good and bad sisters in COBRA WOMAN fight to the death for a royal crown. Davis good sister actually entraps herself killing the bad one in DEAD RINGER.THE DARK MIRROR has the same split between good and bad siblings, but it makes a stab (in fitful, Freudian, Hollywood fashion) at psychoanalyzing the situation. A doctor has been murdered and the suspect is his fiancé, one Ruth Collins (Olivia De Haviland). While Lt. Stevenson (Thomas Mitchell) is questioning Ruth, and seemingly about to close a relatively simple homicide case neatly and quickly, Ruth's identical twin sister Terry shows up. It turns out that one of the two sisters was seen by dozens that night, and the other cannot produce an alibi. But the problem for Stevenson is that the one who was seen never said what her name or identity was: it could have been either Ruth or Terry. Likewise the person who was last with the Victim could have been Ruth or Terry. As Mitchell later says to the psychiatrist, Dr. Scott Elliot (Lew Ayres), unless he happens to grab the girl just after she commits the crime, there is no way to identify the guilty sister from the innocent sister once they are both back in general circulation.Dr. Elliot is asked to examine both girls quietly. Mitchell and Elliot both are aware that this neat little alibi does not have to work permanently for the girls' advantage. You see, the innocent one does know the guilty one did it, and how long before the innocent one will crack or the guilty one will consider silencing the innocent one? Dr. Elliot studies the girls, dates both, and concludes, Ruth is normal but Terry is psychotic and jealous of her sister. Now they know who is more likely to have been the guilty one, and who the innocent one - but the innocent one still refuses to admit she is shielding the guilty one, and the guilty one (now seeing the innocent one as an impediment to her happiness with Dr. Elliot in the future) is considering how to push the innocent one over the edge into suicide.The film as a mystery is fairly simplistic, and it's resolution is too fast. But De Haviland makes both sisters have really individual personalities that succeed as separate people. Ayres gives a decent performance trying to balance his professional detachment to his growing love and concern for Ruth. And Mitchell, although supposedly a bumbler at first, does demonstrate a crafty cat-and-mouse technique with Terry at the conclusion of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder, Mystery &amp; Identical Twins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Dark Mirror" is an excellent psychological thriller about murder, jealousy, suspects who are identical twins and a psychologist who helps the police to identify a murderer. The atmosphere of the piece is, at times, rather unsettling and intense but it's also intriguing and extremely enjoyable to watch.The 1940s was a period when there was a great deal of public awareness of psychoanalysis and Freudian psychology and so the methods used to identify the evil twin in this story would certainly have held a lot of interest and fascination for audiences at that time.An investigation into the murder of a well known doctor seems to start off well for police Lieutenant Stevenson (Thomas Mitchell) as he quickly has witnesses at his disposal who can positively identify the young woman who was seen coming out of the victim's apartment on the night of the murder. The woman in question works on a magazine stand in the medical building where the late doctor worked but Stevenson encounters a problem when she is able to provide compelling evidence that she was actually four miles away from the murder scene at the critical time.Later, Stevenson discovers that the suspect is one of a pair of identical twins but then he confronts another problem as the two sisters are unwilling to cooperate and he is unable to make any further progress without any evidence to prove which one is the culprit. It's at this point that he calls in the assistance of Dr Scott Elliott (Lew Ayres), a psychologist whose speciality is research into the characteristics of identical twins.Dr Elliott carries out a number of tests involving "inkblots", "word association" and polygraphs from which he identifies which sister is capable of committing murder and he then works with Lieutenant Stevenson on a scheme to trap the evil twin into exposing her own guilt.Robert Siodmak's style of direction is impressive and very effective in building up the suspense. There are some passages where the mood becomes quite sinister and the masterful use of light and shadow enhances this atmosphere enormously. Examples of this are the opening sequence during which the camera surveys the contents of a dark room before discovering the murder victim and a scene involving the twins in which one sister is almost entirely engulfed in shadow.The techniques used to show both twins on screen simultaneously are totally convincing and Olivia De Havilland's performance in her dual role displays great subtlety and intelligence. The way she conveys the sisters' many similarities whilst also portraying their differences in an understated manner is very accomplished and best appreciated on repeat viewings. Thomas Mitchell is also entertaining as the competent, unassuming and good humoured detective who is often bewildered by what he discovers.Fans of "Final Analysis" will notice some similarities with this movie; however, in a typical neo-noir subversion of expectations, in the 1992 film, both identity swapping sisters are actually evil."The Dark Mirror" is a stylish movie and the generally swift and natural manner in which the action unfolds contributes greatly to its overall appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dark Mirror is directed by Robert Siodmak and adapted to screenplay by Nunnally Johnson from a story by Vladimir Pozner. It stars Olivia de Havilland, Lew Ayres, Thomas Mitchell, Richard Long and Charles Evans. Music is by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Milton Krasner.A man appears to have been murdered by one of the identical twin Collins sisters, but both of whom have an alibi. The police and the psychiatrist have their work cut out...Straight out of the corner of postwar Hollywood that began to take fascination with mental illness, The Dark Mirror triumphs more as a technical exercise than as anything resembling thought provoking analysis. The simplistic Freudian elements aside, film is impressively mounted and performed by Siodmak and de Havilland respectively. Story follows the trajectory of a cat-and-mouse game, with the makers nicely putting us the viewers into the same struggle the authorities have in sussing out which sister is the damaged killer.Siodmak's (The Spiral Staircase) attention to detail and grasp of mood setting really lifts the piece to greater heights. Aided by the considerable photographic skills of Krasner (The Set-Up), Siodmak creates a world of psychological disturbance, a place aligned with suspense and symbolism. Right from the doozy of an opening scene to the denouement, Siodmak manages to keep the contrivances to the rear of the play and let de Havilland and the visual textures be the prime focus.The effects work is very good, with de Havilland having to quite often play off against herself. Sure in today's age of High Definition et al, you don't have to stretch your viewing experience to see how the effects were done, but why would you? Just enjoy de Havillland's riveting performances in the dual roles (see also her excellence in The Snake Pit two years later), her skillful little subtleties as she deftly plays out the respective psychological traits of sibling rivalry gone astray.Is it a gimmick movie? Well no not really, it's honest about what it wants to achieve in terms of psychiatric observations and treatments. Yet lesser lights than Siodmak, Krasner and de Havilland would have struggled to make it work, especially as the romance angle in the screenplay nearly derails the requisite mood come the finale. Thankfully, in spite of some obvious negatives, it's still well worthy of viewing investment. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an entertaining mystery. Olivia De Havilland plays identical twins, one of whom is guilty of murder. But, you know identical twins. It's hard to tell them apart. It's driving the Chief Detective, Thomas Mitchell, nuts. Either Ruth was walking in Jefferson park while Terry was stabbing a swain to death -- or the other way round. A psychologist who happens to specialize in twin research, Lew Ayres, is called into the case and manages to unravel it.The burden of the film falls on De Havilland, and it's a heavy one. She doesn't only have to play two slightly different characters; she has to play three, because one of the two is covering up a psychotic personality. She does her best to pull off the psychotic monster when it emerges at the end, but it's obviously a strain on her talent because she pops her eyes out and goes through more mental contortions than Humphrey Bogart's Captain Queeg on the witness stand.Olivia De Havilland is simply too nice a lady. She's no longer the spring chicken of the Errol Flynn movies of ten years earlier but she remains beautiful -- and more than that; delicate, vulnerable, winsome, and edible. It would be a sin to think of her legs. In fact, though, she can be pretty bawdy. In a later interview she described some trouble that Errol Flynn was having with his tights during a kissing scene in "Robin Hood." That's what being schooled in a convent will do to you.Thomas Mitchell is the exasperated cop; Lew Ayres with a thin mustache is the psychologist who examines the twin sisters. Actually, he shows them a couple of Rorschach ink blots and at least one of them is from the real Rorschach series and showing them in a movie today would be a justiciable offense. The murderous twin's answers are rather revealing too, in a subtle way. Tainted without being obvious. The writer must have done his homework. I speak to you as your psychologist. That will be ten cents.It's always tricky to pull off a twin movie successfully. It involves a lot of clever work on the part of the visual effects team when the two identical characters appear on the screen at the same time. They've done a splendid job here.It must be said that without the twin angle there's nothing special about the movie. It's a routine B murder mystery. But with the talent exercised by the writer, the director, and especially De Havilland, it's a neater job than you might expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the day, the dual role of twins that Olivia DeHavilland did for The Dark Mirror was something she could never get Jack Warner to assign her. At Warner Brothers the pecking order was first Bette Davis and then Ida Lupino. It wasn't a question of settling for crumbs, all Olivia got from Warner Brothers were the wife and girl friend of the hero, mostly Errol Flynn. According to the Citadel film series book the Films of Olivia DeHavilland, she wasn't even behind the other two actresses because Jack Warner couldn't see her in these parts.With a whole lot to prove and now free of Warner Brothers, Olivia did this independent film for the short lived International Pictures before it merged with Universal. This is a player's delight, twins, one good and one evil. Her friend and friendly rival at Warner Brothers, Bette Davis was doing a twin role in A Stolen Life the same year. Olivia was entering the high point of her career, she would be nominated for three Best Actress nominations resulting in two Oscars in the next three years. The Dark Mirror proved to be quite the appetizer for what was coming up.A doctor in a medical building filled with doctors winds up a homicide victim and it turns out he's been dating the girl over at the news stand for some time. But when Thomas Mitchell as the assigned homicide cop investigates he discovers there are two twins who occasionally spell the other at the stand, a kind of private joke only available to twins. One's got an alibi, one's really circumstantially close to the scene of the crime, but which is which.As Mitchell says he hates the thought of one of these women beating the rap. But as it turns out in that same medical building there is a psychiatrist played by Lew Ayres who's done research into twins. Ayres becomes a police consultant, but he gets compromised himself by falling for whom he feels is the good Olivia.Not to take anything away from Olivia DeHavilland who did a marvelous job in both parts. She said that this was the most taxing role of her career, especially the homicidal twin. But there are two problems. I don't think the law would have been that squeamish then, both would have been arrested, one is clearly covering for the other after the fact. A smart prosecutor would have convicted them, but for the fact Lew Ayres's testimony would have been tainted in any trial by his involvement.Ayres is fine as well as the tweedy psychiatrist. The role is a dress rehearsal for the part of the doctor he played in 1948 opposite Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda.DeHavilland does a great job, but the story which interestingly enough got an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Story for the screen which I can't understand since it is too much to swallow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological Film Noir with Highly Convincing Central Performance(s)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DARK MIRROR is a lesser-known entry into the canon of films noir that dominated Hollywood in the mid-Forties. Directed by Robert Siodmak (THE KILLERS), it is a psychological thriller focusing on the attempts of Lt. Stevenson (Thomas Mitchell) and psychiatrist Dr. Scott Elliott (Lew Ayres) to discover the killer of a well=established doctor. The only snag is that the chief suspects are a pair of identical twins, Ruth and Terry Collins, both played by Olivia de Havilland, who refuse to divulge any further information. Siodmak's narrative focuses in detail on the twins' psychology, by deliberately frustrating our desire to find out who is the 'good' and the 'bad' twin. The costume-designs apparently make this process of distinguishing quite straightforward - one wears white, the other black as the film unfolds - but the twins' responses to Elliott's psychological tests challenge our preconceptions. De Havilland has a rare chance to play the role of a 'bad' woman and grasps it with both hands; her Chicago accent is both harsh yet beguiling. It's clear that, as the 'bad' twin, she can seduce anyone she likes, even those men who proclaim their ability to see through any psychological games. Nunnally Johnson's script is taut and fast-moving (in the print I saw, the film lasts only eighty-one minutes), while Siodmak makes clever use of atmospheric lighting, especially shadows projected on the back will behind the twins, to suggest that they are somehow pursued by internal demons. THE DARK MIRROR might not be as celebrated as other films of similar genre, but it nonetheless captures some of the emotional uncertainties and moral that characterized the material of that period; its ending is particularly cleverly structured.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As stated in everyone's write-ups, this is a story of a murder with a twist; the perp is one of two identical twins. One alibis for the other, and since both can't be prosecuted for the crime, the guilty one walks. This does not sit well with Insp. Thomas Mitchell, who tries to think of a way to implicate the guilty one - whichever one that is. And so he enlists the help of psychiatrist Lew Ayres.At first, the murder is presented as an unsolvable conundrum and in a light-hearted vein, but things get serious thereafter and, unfortunately, the plot begins to bog down over some technical psychological data. But Olivia DeHavilland saves the day and the movie with a splendid performance (or two) as the twins. Gradually there appear personality differences so that even the audience can tell the difference between the two. Not many actresses could have pulled off the layered performances of the twins, but not many actresses are as proficient or as skilled as DeHavilland.This is another neglected gem from Universal's cobwebbed movie vaults that needs to be put into circulation by that comatose studio. It is one of Ms. DeHavilland's best performances and raises an average, talky movie to classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of these twins is not like the other.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Olivia de Havilland gives one of her greatest performances in a dual role as twin sisters, one of them a psychopathic murderess. At first glance, these two ladies (who alternate working at a newspaper stand, one pretending to be the other) seem so much alike, so at first her performance is difficult to make heads or tails of which character she is playing. But everything is not as it seems, and when detective Thomas Mitchell (her co-star from "Gone With the Wind") and psychiatrist Lew Ayres get involved, it will only be a matter of time before the psycho is exposed. In the meantime, the innocent one shows signs of mental illness herself and a clever scheme ends up exposing the truth, resulting in a truly shocking ending.DeHavilland is one of those actresses who as she aged became "grander and grander", bringing in qualities of Melanie Wilkes into many of her performances with breathy lady-like qualities that made her sometimes too good to be true. But this performance is one exception, even though the manners and politeness are still there, qualities of the butterfly who spits acid are slowly revealed inside both characters. In a sense, this is close to her truly only other performance of this nature, the evil cousin in "Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte" who seemed all cream and sugar on the outside, but was filled with venom when all was said and done.The slow road to revealing the truth about both personalities is worth the wait, the examinations of Ayres' psychiatrist revealing the neurotic nature of one and psychotic manners of the other. Then, you end up confused for a bit, not knowing which one is whom as the trail leads to the end of the road for one and heartbreak for the other. The result is pleasantly perplexing, concluding in a manner that is never melodramatic in spite of its tragic circumstances. Watching the guilty party slowly being trapped and revealed will have you on the edge of your seat.While the analogy of what twins are supposedly like (mirror images the same in all but mentality) is implausible, this does reveal some pondering ideas of the intensity of their relationships. This was one of several melodramas about twins released during this time, the others being the camp "Cobra Woman" with Maria Montez and the Bette Davis melodrama "A Stolen Life", all about one good sister and one bad, but connected with the other so tightly that the result could only be destruction for one and a difficult journey for the other. Daytime soaps have also dealt with the same issue ("Days of Our Lives'" Marlena and Sam; "All My Children's" Stuart and Adam, etc), so obviously, films like this made some impression on the writers who created those characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was there anyone any smoother than Lew Ayres playing a physician?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It will take you awhile to get to Lew Ayres as a character though. The movie opens on the body of a murdered man in a dark room. At first it looks as though this is going to be a police procedural with Lt. Stevenson (Thomas Mitchell) in the lead as he methodically finds out who last saw the dead man alive, who the murdered man was with, etc. Suspect number one is whittled down to a woman who runs a magazine stand in the office building where the dead doc worked. She is hauled in for questioning, but she has an ironclad alibi that includes a concert and a walk in the park, both miles from the scene of the crime, and she has witnesses that have no reason to lie for her. The good lieutenant is just about at his wit's ends when he discovers his suspect has an identical twin. (Olivia DeHaviland as Terry and Ruth Collins). So, the lieutenant quips that one is guilty of murder the other obstruction of justice unless they fess up. Terry quips back "which are you charging with which crime?" The twins have a lawyer and are armed with the fact that you can't haul multiple people in for the same crime when you know one is innocent and just see how it shakes out.At this point Thomas Mitchell fades into the background and the film becomes a psychological drama with Lew Ayres becoming the male lead. Ayres plays Dr. Scott Elliott, initially called in as a witness for the police, but when the Lieutenant discovers Dr. Elliott has spent his career studying twins, he proposes that he make friends with the Collins sisters, offer to use them in a study, and see if he can determine which is the murderer through a psychological profile.This is the part I find hard to swallow. The Collins twins have all their ducks in a row legally, and mum is the word when it comes to talking to the police, and yet they both agree to be studied by a doctor specializing in twin psychology, both yapping their brains out about their individual thought processes, all based on the fact that the good doctor SAYS he is not working for the police? I'll let you watch and see how this all shakes out.I will say that Olivia DeHaviland, like Joan Crawford, was much better at choosing roles that showed off her acting talent than her original studio - in her case Warner Bros. From 1935 until she freed herself from WB, she was pigeonholed as a light comedienne or the love interest of Errol Flynn in whatever swashbuckler he happened to be appearing. That doesn't mean she wasn't entertaining in those roles, I'm just saying she was capable of so much more. This film is a seldom seen example of DeHaviland's excellent skill. You actually see the two distinct personalities of the twins emerging as Olivia has several conversations with "her twin" that only exists as a result of editing and trick photography.Very much worth your time, and since it is hard to find any other way, I have to highly recommend the recent pressed release by Olive Films. I don't like to plug individual commercial products, but I know of no other way to see this fine piece of writing and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Olivia is twins!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Olivia is twins! This is an entertaining noir/thriller coated with very fashionable mid-40's Freudian elements. Olivia de Havilland plays identical twins, one good (Ruth) and one bad (Terry). One has committed a murder. But how will dogged detective Thomas Mitchell and psychiatrist Lew Awyres nail the right sister? From the outset, it's pretty obvious that Terry is our murderess, and that Ayres will inevitably fall in love with the good de Havilland, Ruth. However, the fun is in getting there! Olivia de Havilland puts in some very memorable work as the twins, making Terry cold, calculating yet very much in control, and Ruth sweeter and more submissive yet still individual. The identical twins angle is an obvious gimmick, and the first time I saw two de Havilland's on screen I chuckled, yet it becomes very convincing as the film goes on, in large part due to Olivia de Havilland. And the technology is still impressive. Siodmak has lots of fun with the doubling, and creates many trademark noir moments of shadow and intrigue. Lew Awyres is quite interesting in his part. Sixteen years on from his beautiful performance in "All Quiet On The Western Front" he is very lithe, moustached and full of reassuring class. The film is pure melodrama but it's served up very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling Acting Overshadows Foreseeable Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A blend of suspense and dark romance, The Dark Mirror is a well acted film which at most showcases the impressive acting ability of Olivia De Havilland.Starting as a darkly atmospheric piece after a murder is committed, the investigation quickly moves onto a suspect named Collins, a woman who was a known associate of the murder victim. However the apparently simple investigation goes into a tailspin when it's revealed Collins is one half of identical twins. It must have been a daunting task as a performer to take on the roles of protagonist and antagonist in the same film yet Olivia De Havilland pulls it off to great conviction. Playing the parts of Terry, a cunning and manipulative psychopath and Terry's twin Ruth, a shy and more naive woman. By changing her mannerisms, vocal tone and demeanour for both roles De Havilland showed to spectacular range of her acting ability.Although the acting on show by De Havilland and others in The Dark Mirror was top standard, the same cannot be said for the narrative. It starts off well with the dilemma of identical twins causing The Dark Mirror to become a gripping mysterious piece along with the wise cracking dialogue between Detective Stevenson and Terry adding to the film's aura. Yet when the narrative shifts from thriller to dark romance with the introduction of Doctor Elliot, a man who falls for Ruth yet bitters Terry into jealously, The Dark Mirror becomes tedious due to its predictability. Although the acting throughout the romantic portion of the narrative makes for emotional involvement it also makes the actions of Terry, Ruth and Doctor Elliot predictable resulting in being able to know the narrative's outcome before its reached.On a lighter note The Dark Mirror has a good amount of comic relief served up by Thomas Mitchell as Detective Stevenson, whose wise cracks create breathing space from the drama and earlier on has great chemistry with De Havilland as her more sinister character. Unfortunately this tense relationship is under developed due to relatively small role Mitchell plays here. The comic relief also comes in the revelation of Collins being an identical twin particularly for the witnesses who are dazed by this fact resulting in a few laughs on the audience's part.Although story wise The Dark Mirror is not the most superb of films, it does not get in the way of the fine acting on display which for a time entices us into the narrative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie scared the wits out of me when I was about 10. It is the story of a murder perpetrated by one of two sisters, identical twins. One is quite normal, and the other subtly, but poisonously . . . insane. Lew Ayers plays the psychiatrist who unravels this mystery, and who speaks the line I have partially quoted, which was indeed chilling.Olivia de Havilland was superb in the double role, unforgettable, and the rest of the cast quite good. This is not a great movie, but it is effective and eerie.I close with a curiosity. The last line of the picture could qualify as the most tasteless closer in movie history.

		<fullReview>Hey! I'm certainly no prude, but, regardless of whether it's "just-a-movie", or not, I am one who thinks it's absolutely deplorable when a "professional" (such as a physician or a psychiatrist) who, due to having a very low standard of ethics, becomes romantically involved with one (or more) of their patients.And this, I'm sorry to say, was the case here in The Dark Mirror.Supposedly a "respected" psychiatrist, Dr. Elliot, who was psycho-analyzing both Ruth &amp; Terry Collins (to determine if either one of these identical twins could, in fact, be a murderess) became romantically involved with the "good" twin. (natch) The doc literally came onto this woman like a horny-toad buzzard, passionately and frequently embracing her, and kissing her, and telling her that he loved her.And I don't care that this was "just-a-movie" (even if it was from the 1940s), I think that this sort of unprofessional behaviour was absolutely despicable and completely unacceptable.And I definitely don't think that even "in-the-name-of-love" any movie (unless it's porn-trash) should give the green-light to something as contemptible as this in nature. No movie should treat this lousy business of a doctor sleeping with a patient as if it were alright. 'Cause it's not! When it comes to the likes of a professional's morals and ethics, it is very, very wrong. Indeed! And, like, who the hell did the producers of this picture think they were telling the audience that it's OK for a psychiatrist (out of his own selfish desires) to encourage sexual relations with his/her patient? And for that, this film only rates one star from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double de Havilland and Dollar-Book Freud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The postwar interest in Freudianism (probably precipitated by returning veterans suffering from shell-shock) was, in Hollywood, put to facile and often sinister ends. The Dark Mirror is no exception, despite the talents of scriptwriter Nunnally Johnson and director Robert Siodmak. Simply put, De Havilland plays a woman and her "evil" twin (though they use the word "insane"). When it's first revealed, in the investigation of a murder, that the two (Ruth and Terry) are dead ringers, the orchestral score chortles with little musical jokes at the expense of police detective Thomas Mitchell (who is wasted). Luckily the tone darkens towards the middle of the movie and De Havilland rises from blandness to effective histrionics -- could she scowl! -- at least in her evil incarnation. Inadvertently amusing are the name-necklaces and monogram pins the twins sport, undoubtedly to orient the audience. These big-city dames traipse around like high-school girls, lugging huge "T"s and "R"s on their tailored suits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Olivias - better than one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this film in years until tonight, and I love it as much as ever. I had an acting teacher who used to say that Olivia de Havilland was held back because she played Melanie, that she was a fantastic actress and capable of so much more but had a hard time getting those meatier roles. But she did, and she truly was one of the great actresses of the classic era, not to mention one of the great beauties.De Havilland stars as twins, Terry and Ruth. When Dr. Frank Peralta is found stabbed in his apartment, two neighbors swear to the veteran Lt. Stevenson (Thomas Mitchell) saw Ruth Collins is the murderer, as witnesses saw her leaving his apartment.Alas, Ruth has an alibi, and three witnesses confirm she was listening to a concert in the park the night of the murder. When Stevenson visits Ruth in her apartment, he discovers that she was an identical twin sister, Terry.The prosecutor discourages Stevenson from building a case, because how is he going to prove which one of the women did it? He decides to investigate on his own, and asks Dr. Scott Elliot, who knows the women, to help him. Scott has been studying twins for years.Scott gives the twins a series of tests. And he discovers that one of the twins is crazy.Psychology was a big thing post-war, and "Dark Mirror" is another example of a psychological story. Some of it to today's audience will sound a little lame, but that does not deter from the film being entertaining.Olivia de Havilland creates two distinct women in Terry and Ruth. People have been asking for years how the two Olivias intertwined on the couch. It probably was a cut and paste job, but it was fantastic - makes you realize what ingenuity filmmakers needed before computers.Lew Ayres as another doctor - well, that did seem to be his lot in life; he was even a medic in World War II. A delightful, easy actor with a sweet personality, he really rose out of the ashes after being a conscientious objector, even winning an Oscar. Thomas Mitchell is very good as the detective in charge.All in all, highly entertaining and a chance to see Olivia de Havilland at her absolute peak. Looking at her, I was struck by how good she would have been as Blanche Dubois in Streetcar, which would premiere on Broadway a few years later. A missed opportunity.</fullReview>

Being naive and uninformed I did not realise it was the same actress, even when the seam showed in a scene in front of a mirror as the story geared up for the climax. I was fooled the same way by The Devil's Double.The story is probably too neat, the psychological angle too simple, but the mood is just right while the lead actress raises the tension with her sometimes manic, sometimes icy menace.

		<fullReview>In its depiction of a pair of twins, one of whom is a psychotic killer, THE DARK MIRROR is a film very much ahead of its time. It's an engrossing period piece that benefits greatly from a fine performance from Olivia de Havilland playing the twins, Terry and Ruth Collins. Accompanied by some excellent back projection work (you won't see the seams!), you never stop believing for a second that both twins are separate people.Elsewhere, the plotting is fairly ordinary for a film noir type thriller. There are the flat-footed policemen getting nowhere, a dedicated shrink who finds himself falling for the murder suspect(s) and some effectively grim, doom-laden atmosphere from director Robert Siodmak. It's the sort of film somebody like David Cronenberg would have been making had he been working during the 1940s. The twist ending is particularly strong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love 1940's melodramas in general, let alone pseudo psychological studies. Speaking of breaking confidentialities! And simplistic diagnostic evaluations. Oh, well - nevertheless it was fun seeing Olivia torment herself at every turn. Probably wishing it were Joan playing opposite her. The questioning of the witnesses in the beginning had some nice characters playing their parts with an air of rightness. Olivia is a bit cloying at times in any of her movies when she is emphasizing the sweet side of her nature rather than just trusting her innate nice self. And when she goes evil, she can pull that off as well, letting that side come out. Thomas Mitchell as often as not can walk away with a movie and he went in that direction here. A little too claustrophobic even with their being many different settings. I like Robert Siodmak's directorial decisions in all of his movies and Nunnally Johnson writes good scripts as a rule. This one was of its time and sounds pretty naive now. But it is fun and nice way of showing both of them, the 2 Olivia's in the same shot vying for screen time. Get some popcorn, stretch out and enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New DVD release shows de Havilland excels in dual role...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of this movie will be delighted to know that the new DVD release from Olive Films is in pristine condition and makes viewing it a double pleasure, especially for de Havilland fans.THE DARK MIRROR ('46) is a brisk, supercharged 85 minutes, a taut psychological suspense tale directed by Robert Siodmak (who directed THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE and THE KILLERS). Dimitri Tiomkin's clever background score is an added bonus.It stars Olivia de Havilland in a fascinating dual role as Ruth and Terry Collins, sisters involved in the murder of a doctor they were both dating. When good sister Ruth gives her bad twin an alibi, detective Thomas Mitchell asks psychiatrist Lew Ayres to determine which twin could be the killer, based on their differing personalities. Of course he falls in love with the good twin and solves the case in an effective ending which gives de Havilland the chance to do some real emoting. A clever scene has the bad twin pretending to be the good one in a serious talk with doctor Ayres in which he reveals what makes the psycho sister tick.It's a double-layered cat-and-mouse scene in which he is really talking about her (not her sister) and de Havilland's reactions are fascinating to watch. Thomas Mitchell is excellent as a relentless but befuddled detective unhappy with the game the sisters are playing. Richard Long has a small role as an admirer of one of the twins--or is it both of them? Bit roles are well played with occasional flashes of humor and the whole thing moves swiftly under Siodmak's tight direction.By the way, 1946 was a strong year for de Havilland. After being off the screen for more than two years due to legal action against Warner Bros., she suddenly had four films in release: DEVOTION (as Charlotte Bronte), THE WELL GROOMED BRIDE, TO EACH HIS OWN and THE DARK MIRROR, entering a four-year period climaxed at the end of the decade by THE SNAKE PIT and THE HEIRESS--and two Oscars.Summing up: two Olivia de Havilland's are better than one. Life magazine reported that she "contributes to the impression gained from TO EACH HIS OWN that she is the actress to beat for this year's Academy Award."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Olivia de Havilland cast against type in this underrated noir gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dark Mirror is an interesting film noir about a pair of sisters who live a love/hate relationship of envy and conceit, but also adoration. The story is set around a police investigation run by detective Lt. Stevenson (Thomas Mitchell) who has caught a case involving a murdered local doctor. The primary suspect turns out to be not one, but two women who can not be told apart, not even by people who are in contact with them every day. Olivia de Havilland plays the part of both sisters, Ruth and Terry, who make a habit of playing games to keep their individual identities a secret. Dr. Scott Elliott, a psychologist who worked in the same building as Terry and Ruth, (Lew Ayres) is asked to aid the D.A.'s office in creating a profile of each sister to gauge their ability to commit murder. Both sisters fall for Scott during these sessions, causing a potentially lethal feud between the siblings.You will have to see the film for the rest of the story. Siodmak's direction is deft, and De Havilland gives a wonderful performance as two people with the same DNA, but polar opposite personalities. Fans of Film Noir should not miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Olivia de Havilland as an insanely jealous, manipulative, cold-blooded killer? If that's too much to take, you're sure to be more comfortable with her as the kind, warm-hearted, and trusting identical twin.That's the appeal of "The Dark Mirror," and it succeeds admirably. Olivia is Terry and Olivia is Ruth, in some of the most seamless "trick" photography of the 1940s. Two scenes in particular, in which one Olivia puts her arms around the other Olivia to comfort her, are truly startling. You can't help but ask yourself, "How did they do it?"This is a fast-moving film noir, directed by Robert Siodmak, and what makes it so interesting is that Olivia truly appears to be two different women. One is suspected of murder, and even though you quickly know which one it is, the suspense comes from the interaction between them. Watch for an eerie bedroom scene that's actually quite chilling, in which the vicious sister tries to drive her twin to the brink of madness.Ms. de Havilland never played such a ruthless character again until many years later in "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte." She should have done it more often. She's awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are taken inside of a dark apartment where a man lies dead. He was Dr. Peralta, a physician, the victim of what appears to be a crime of passion. The police come to investigate, but they get nowhere. The only clue from some of the residents in his building is a woman who was seen with the doctor going to his apartment. Lt. Stevenson, in charge of the investigation wants to interview that woman.As it happens, the lady in question, Terry Collins, works in a medical building. She has the magazine concession stand. She has a solid alibi, something that checks out and clears her of any wrongdoing. What the police find out is that there is another sister, Ruth, who might have been involved in the crime.Since the police is puzzled by the case, and no idea about who murdered Dr. Peralta, Lt. Stevenson asks the help of Dr. Scott Elliott, a psychiatrist, an expert that has studied the behavior of twins to give them a hand in examining the Collins sisters. His work produces surprising results. The result is that one of the twins has deeply rooted problems that could have led to the killing.A terrific story by Nunnally Johnson, one of the best writers of that era. His screenplay was based on a story by Vladimir Pozner. The International Pictures production was in charge of the great Robert Siodmak, who knew how to stage this crime drama, getting the best out of his cast and crew, but especially from the star, Olivia De Havilland, who impresses in the double role of the twin sisters, one of whom is a murderer.Ms. De Havilland does an outstanding job in portraying the two sisters. In fact, it was an amazing feat to get the actress in the same frame, something that for the time when the film was done might have presented a challenge for Mr. Siodmak. The finished product is incredible. Lew Ayres plays Dr. Elliott, the man whose work uncovers the truth about the sisters. Thomas Mitchell made a valuable contribution with his police detective. The supporting cast is wonderful.Milton Krasner camera work must have been decisive for creating the illusion of the twins as played by only one actress. Dimitri Tiomkin's musical score serves the story well. Once again Robert Siodmak proved he was one of the best directors working in the Hollywood of that time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man is murdered and one of two twin sisters is suspected. But which one.De Havilland is so good in the dual role of identical twins (Terry &amp; Ruth), I almost forgot about the trick photography the effect requires. For a while I even marveled at how two actresses could be made to look so much alike. Anyway, I expect the twin performances recommended de Havilland for her Oscar-nominated role in the intense psychological drama The Snake Pit (1948).So which of the two sisters is the crazy one. Dr. Elliot (Ayres) keeps maneuvering them into various tests to find out. The Rohrschach association tests are fascinating as we try to determine which of the twins is giving disturbed responses. I couldn't be sure since red herrings are always possible in a thriller like this. Ruth seems so sweet and dependent while Terry is more aloof and suspicious. But a caring exterior may be a clever cover-up for a murderous nature. At times, however, I couldn't be sure which of the sisters was on screen, a potentially fascinating twist had it been used more strategically. Anyway, the gimmick amounts to one of the more imaginative variations on the 'doppelganger' theme so popular at the time.Ace director Siodmak keeps the suspense moving, but I didn't notice the many stylish effects that distinguish previous efforts such as Phantom Lady (1944). I suspect he thought the concept and script strong enough to carry the story without noirish embroidery. Also, character actor Mitchell's sly humor as the aging cop meshes nicely without distracting. All in all, it's a fascinating little thriller and showcase for a fine old-time actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BBC TV has been filling its schedules with a host of B&amp;W fillers in recent weeks. A number of them I have never heard of and would never want to hear of. The Dark Mirror was one of those unknowns, or so I thought. As the story unfolded it dawned on me why I knew where the story was heading before the curtain closed on the ending credits..........I had seen the re-make in the 80s when the commercial network used to hover up the big name TV movies from America.SPOILERS BEYOND........Thankfully I have no long term memory of how Jane Seymour played the role as Olivia de Havilland is very good in this 85 minute noir treasure as the mixed up twins one of whom is a murderess. She is aided by some clever effects work for the time and a dapper Lew Ayres who plays the psychologist who must help the police solve a teasing crime of identity as the witnesses suddenly realise that their certainty is less certain when the twins are revealed.The use of ink spots and polygraphs make this quite a modern themed film and there are one of two moments of impeccably sparky dialogue amongst the cast that lifts this film well above the normal short reelers of its time.Beyond the main two cast members Thomas Mitchell provides able support as the cynical detective puzzled but determined to close the case. His ramshackle look is the kind of cop that modern day sleuths try and copy, but Mitchell fills those gumshoes with ease.Finally a mention for Dimitri Tiomkin's score which has the peaks and troughs of emotional strings in all the right places and has been parodied so many times since.A worthy watch on a rainy day.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is yet another of those vintage films that, when presented to film-goers far less sophisticated than today, would hit some 90% of its targets, leaving the audience entertained, disturbed, and satisfied in equal measure. Today it's all too easy to wonder aloud how it was possible for identical twins to grow to maturity (Olivia de Havilland was 30 when she played both roles) without one of them living in blissful ignorance (despite sharing an apartment) that her sibling was a psychopath and criminally insane with it. We also wince at the coincidence that one twin (and they switch roles for fun) works on the newsstand in a building full of doctors one of which just happens to be a world authority on twins and is more than happy to drop everything in order to help the police establish which twin has the Tony award as best actress. Having said this the film is still entertaining and the technical credits out of the right bottle. German émigré Robert Siodmak - who arrived in Hollywood via France, making excellent films in both countries - continues his exploration of twisted psyches (Pieges, The Spiral Staircase, The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry) to telling effect, throw in some first-rate optical lab work and a bravura performance from de Havilland and we're talking excellent diversion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 1946 - It seems that these days we are all too familiar with the movie-scenario of identical twins where one is innocently "good", while the other is deceptively (and murderously) "evil".But way back in the 1940s (nearly 70 years ago) this sort of intriguing plot-line was really quite fresh and its possibilities were far from being fully explored and exploited.Though it contained some dramatically intense moments, I found The Dark Mirror to be too cut &amp; dry to be considered great entertainment.At times its story was very weak and clichéd. And even though the visual effects (showing the 2 De Havilland characters together) were exceptionally convincing, this film (due to its somewhat heavy-handed psychiatric angle) contained far too much senseless psycho-babble and Freudian-related analysis in it to be at all entertaining to the average movie-goer.I also agree 100% with the point that Dalbert Pringle made in his review about the absolute tackiness of a psychiatrist having an affair with one of his patience. That certainly reduced this film's appeal significantly.Filmed in b&amp;w, The Dark Mirror had a rather short running time of only 85 minutes. It was directed by Robert Siodmak whose other films of the 1940s included Son Of Dracula, The Spiral Staircase and The Killers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this film, I somewhat got the impression that Olivia de Havilland did not really want to be in it. Oh, there is nothing wrong with her acting - in fact she does an excellent job, particularly in the 2nd half when the film warms up and the confrontations start to really heat up, and she and Thomas Mitchell are playing "cat and mouse" with each other. Lew Ayres gives a touch of class to the cast, which apart from the three principals is insignificant. Robert Siodmak has directed it with great flair, and the trick photography is very well done, while the mood music is spot on. Even at the end, one feels a little cheated, so perhaps it may be worth another viewing, if you can find a copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An evil reflection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lt Stevenson (Thomas Mitchell) enlists the help of psycho-analyst Dr Elliott (Lew Ayres) to solve a murder case. There are 2 suspects - twins Ruth and Terry (both played by Olivia De Havilland). Dr Elliott spends time analyzing the twins in the name of research but he is instructed to report back his findings to Lt Stevenson. One of the twins is a murderess......probably the insane one.....The film gets straight into the story as we are encouraged to try and work out who is the good sister and who is the bad sister. At times it is difficult to make out who is who but if you pay attention, you can manage to do it. The film portrays both sisters on the screen at the same time for much of the film and it is very well done. Olivia de Havilland is good as the twins - she plays evil and intelligence very well - and it is her film. The scenes where she pits her wits against Dr Elliott during the ink-blot tests and word association games are good, although I think that I would have certified both sisters insane after hearing their interpretations of the first ink-blot test....it's obviously a cow's head!Perhaps Dr Elliott is the crazy one. When I was psycho-analyzed at age 4, I was told to draw a picture. I drew a woman and a house on fire, the meaning of which was that I wanted to burn my mother! I didn't want to do anything of the sort. In fact, I was in love with her.....yet the psycho-man made me sound like a nutcase. I was also given some soldiers to play with and told that I had a persecution complex because I had one cowboy shooting against lots of indians. This meant that I felt the world was against me. Wrong again! I was playing out hero worship as I was hooked on the "Friday Western" TV slot inevitably starring Randolph Scott. I watched him every week being a good-guy hero and took my behaviour cues from him. These psycho Dr's get it wrong and maybe neither Ruth nor Terry were insane.....actually, one of them obviously has problems.....but so does Dr Elliott. He grows attached to one of the twins.There were a couple of silly points about the film: 1 - it's just totally unbelievable. The policeman would have just arrested them both after the murder; 2 - why have twins dress in the same clothes all the time..!!?... These points aside, it is an entertaining film that is worth keeping onto and watching again. I guess Olivia de Havilland had her own sibling rivalry with sister Joan Fontaine to draw upon for the role. Neither speak to each other to this day. They have both obviously looked into the dark mirror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An actor's challenge is when they are required to create their own mob, create the tension they are to hold. I've just seen a few "multiple people in one body" type films. Here we have something different: one actress playing two characters, exact twins.One is a murderer, we discover early in the film. The actress in question is a good one, and the film trickery is effective. Parts of the setup is as well, one evil but intelligent and the other sweet but fragile. We have intelligent cops and an on-screen psychologist who happens to be an expert in the study of twins. These allow in-plot explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, the story depends on one twin convincing the other she is crazy ? and it is just not convincing.Yet another wasted opportunity except for the last few minutes where some disguise is attempted. Let this one pass.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well-directed and well-acted, but 'well' isn't enough to overcome the gimmick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Siodmak, while not my favorite noir director, is probably above doing something like this. The same year he made the Killers, which kind of solidified his reputation as a director of solid B-movies (others include The Spiral Staircase and the excellent Criss Cross), he directed the Dark Mirror, from a script by Nunnally Johnson (most notable for scripting pics like the Dirty Dozen) that ties psychological contrivance and simplicity into a knot. We have Olivia de Havilland playing identical twins Terry and Ruth, and they are both suspected (maybe) in the murder of a man in an apartment. As the story rolls on we get a sense of where it's going- obviously so- and who the killer really is, and how the cat-and-mouse game with the doctor (Lew Ayres) will pan out.This doesn't necessarily mean The Dark Mirror is a dud; in fact if you're looking just on direct stylistic terms Siodmak doesn't do much less an exemplary effort than on the Killers or Criss Cross. It's just the basic flaws of script, where Johnson can't seem to overcome the duality-of-man (or woman) thing going on, or making a wonderful actress like Havilland in two parts seem so simplistic in each part (maybe combined it makes the most fascinating) It's a passable effort, and kept me entertained... but I wanted more with a premise that starts as a fun near joke and then turns into something else- something not as appealing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Sounds Better Than It Plays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 85-minute film was intriguing for the first half hour. Then it begins to bog down, big- time. After an hour, it was like pulling teeth for me to finish the last third of the movie.Olivia de Havilland plays identical twins, one of whom commits a murder. Most of the film is devoted to psychiatrist who tries to figure out which of the two women is the guilty party. Both twins have an alibi for the crime. That sounds better than it played.Lew Ayers plays the shrink, "Dr. Scott Elliott." Thomas Mitchell plays the investigating police officer, "Lt. Stevenson." (They never said his first name.) With a fine director like Robert Siodmak, I expected a better movie but then again, all of the Freudian nonsense usually turns me off. Also, the story was too much of a stretch. Sorry to waste Olivia's talents in this psycho-babble yawner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Mirror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film can be summed up in one word: silly. Or if you prefer two: low budget. It starts off as though it might be a black comedy, and though it is clearly not to be taken too seriously, it never quite decides. Twin sisters: one a murderess, the other either an accomplice or covering up for her, or...pick a motive. Yes, there is some clever camera-work using one actress ? Olivia de Havilland ? to play both, but these sort of tricks were certainly not new in 1946, regardless of how they were effected.And low budget really does say it all. If there is a mystery to be solved here it is why was such a plot wasted on a film that had no real love interest, no chases, no punch-ups, heck, we don't even see the victim's body, alive or dead. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about "The Dark Mirror" is that its star is still alive at the time of writing. Olivia de Havilland is now 97, and was still acting up until 5 years ago. She could have been forgiven for dying of embarrassment within a twelvemonth of this monstrosity's release.</fullReview>
