		<fullReview>Jane Seymour has enjoyed a career divided. Half the time, she's portrayed gentle, serene heroines. The other half has been made up of vicious, man-eating vixens. Here, fans of Ms. Seymour will get both! This updating of a 1946 Olivia de Havilland movie focuses on twin sisters, recently reunited after being separated as infants. One or both of them is under suspicion of the murder of a man they were dating under one identity (without his knowledge!) If one doesn't care for Jane, there's no sense in watching any of this because she IS the movie. She's in virtually every scene either as one twin or the other or both. Support comes in the form of blond, rather bland Collins as a blond, rather bland psychiatrist and Gardenia (hamming it up all over the place) as a determined cop. The movie is mainly an excuse to show off Seymour's incredible mane of hair which extends to her rear end and to put her in some hilarious Nolan Miller get-ups. Seymour also gets to show off the two aforementioned aspects of her screen persona. The story does not translate particularly well to a modern setting as the viewer has by now become accustomed to this type of story (a daytime soap opera staple by now!) It was more provocative and surprising in the 1940's. The film asks the audience to believe that two sisters can live under one identity (in a high rise apartment and with designer clothes) and take turns working at a University gift shop (!) for a living!! Whatever they made at that job wouldn't keep them in creme rinse for a week!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a true Jane Seymour fan, I was glad to see her in a movie that showcased many of her talents. I could not stop watching this movie and I was NOT disappointed in the ending at all! Vincent Gardenia was perfectly cast as Detective Church. I understand that Jane Seymour's sister played her "double" in those tricky twin shots. This is definitely a movie for any mystery fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this remake of Dark Mirror! Jane Seymour is amazing as both characters. Stephen Collins is very believable as a Psychiatrist torn between professional ethics and human emotions. Vincent Gardenia is great as a worn-out Detective faced with a very frustrating dilemma!Only flaw is the scene where "one twin" uses her finger nail to cut into her arm to see if the "other twin" feels the same pain. Alas, the way in which this is shown is not possible (no scar/wound afterward, no blood on the pillow, a deep red blood line when she drags her finger nail down her arm). It would require more than a finger nail to make that kind of "clean" cut.Other then that - well done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a compelling made-for-TV movie remake of the original 1946 film starring Olivia de Havilland. This movie stars Jane Seymour, who plays twins Leigh and Tracy Cullen. One of them is accused of murdering attorney Frank Girard and, as Detective Al Church (Vincent Gardenia) is having a difficult time finding out which twin is the perpetrator, he asks Psychiatrist Dr. Jim Eiseley (Stephen Collins), an acquaintance of Leigh's, to evaluate the sisters and run tests on them in hopes of filtering out the murderer.I haven't seen the original 1946 motion picture at the time of this review; however, this TV movie adaptation is actually quite captivating and well-acted. I enjoyed the suspense and edge-of-your-seat scenes this movie had to offer, which kept me engaged throughout the momentum-building plot. You would be left guessing throughout the story as to what the climax might unfold. Jane Seymour and Stephen Collins have some good on-screen chemistry; Collins was convincing as the thoughtful psychiatrist and Seymour did a great job doing two roles with two very different personalities.Overall, it's a captivating and mesmerizing murder mystery and well worth the watch if you happen to ever catch it on TV.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do they make such inferior remakes??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jane Seymour's performance in THE DARK MIRROR doesn't hold a candle to Olivia de Havilland's job in the original film. Nor is the script any better than the one which was nominated for Best Original Screenplay in 1946.This is a strictly below par TV drama with Stephen Collins, earnest and likeable enough as the psychiatrist in the role originated by Lew Ayres in the 1946 film. But the script is the main problem. In revising the story for '80 audiences, the taut suspense was diluted. The subtle touches that de Havilland gave to the twin sisters is missing here.Strictly for Jane Seymour fans who aren't familiar with the original movie. Passable at best. Good twin vs. bad twin is old hat by now but at least it was done with more style and vivid acting in the earlier version.</fullReview>
