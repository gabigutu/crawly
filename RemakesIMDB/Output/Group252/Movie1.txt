		<shortDescription>An elegant and witty remake ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its inevitable that this would be compared to Hitchcock's 1938 original but for me there are many pleasures to be had in this elegant comedy-thriller. Douglas Slocombe's Panavision photography is wonderful and the playing of all involved is beautifully poised. George Axelrod's reworking of Sidney Gilliat's screenplay adds a nice screwball touch with his one-liners and Ian Carmichael and Arthur Lowe as the cricket-obsessed British tourists add humanity to their chauvinistic bullishness. And as a self-confessed Angela Lansbury fan I of course relished her depiction of Miss Froy. On a big cinema screen this looks terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfairly maligned, brilliant Lansbury</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is silly -- well, preposterous really, but it's great fun.I agree that the Shepherd and Gould are a bit tiresome and overdone, but in fact, on the whole, they're fun too.The best feature of the film is Angela Lansbury. She is brilliant as the nanny, catching every nuance with perfection, and should have had some kind of award for her performance.The cricket fans are good and Gerald Harper is also convincing and chilling as the hard-hearted adulterer.It is refreshing to see a film where there are no computer effects, and where real locations are used. I don't think we'll see too many films made this way again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original but I watched this with 1 hour delay on two channels simultaneously, I was at home with a cold at the time and feeling very sorry for myself. Anyway, if you would just put the two leads aside for a moment (although Eliot Gould was SO cute in the movie and Cybil Shepperd did the visual pun of Marilyn Monroe on the air vent very well when she gets out of the train...) The thing I really liked about this film were the characters of Charters and Caldicott - they made me laugh hysterically - there they are drinking tea - understating this understating that - then suddenly.....they are really terrific minor characters. I would love a whole film on those two. Very affectionate look at English manners. ARTHUR LOWE MADE ME FORGET HOW ILL I FELT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wrong lady vanished! Someone should have stolen away with Cybill instead (and Elliott, too!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost all the ingredients are present for this to be a charming and colorful remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic: stunning scenery, lovely music and talented behind-the-scenes craftspeople. Unfortunately, a pair of anachronistic lead actors does everything but sink it. Shepherd plays an American heiress in the late 1930's, continually marrying and divorcing as part of a plan to glean her inheritance. From Bavaria, en route to London, she boards a train, still hung over from a night of revelry and wearing her evening gown. A kindly nanny (Lansbury) takes her under her wing, inviting her to lunch and seeing that she gets a nap during the long trip. When Shepherd awakes, Lansbury is gone and what's more, no one will admit to ever having seen her! Gould, a magazine photographer, begins to assist Shepherd, never quite sure if she has actually seen this woman or if she's hallucinating after a drunken night that continued into a tipsy morning. The duo is also aided by doctor Lom. Practically everyone else seems in on some grand conspiracy to cover up Lansbury's existence. Gould and Shepherd delve further and further into the mystery as the danger escalates. Despite her presence in other non-contemporary films such as "Daisy Miller" (another flop), Miss Shepherd has no business acting in a period piece. Though she does look nice in her dress, her manner is far too brusque and her carriage is far too contemporary to pull off playing someone from another era. Apart from that, her horrible, flat voice is completely at odds with the material and she simply can't muster up any enthusiasm for the proceedings. At one point, Gould accuses her of being hysterical and yet she's just as sedate and unexcited as she was before. Her makeup looks, at times, clownish, with all the highlighter applied under her eyes paired with bright blush. Gould, another actor who should only be cast in present day projects, gives into one concession for his period role. He parts his unruly hair and tries to mush it down. Otherwise he, too, is all wrong for this time and setting, though at least he attempts to give a performance. They share precious little chemistry and their misguided performances threaten at all times to derail the movie. Lansbury offers up a characterization that would soon become very familiar to viewers of "Murder She Wrote", as her work here and that of the early years of the TV series are quite similar. Lom is dependably solid. Old pros Lowe and Carmichael ably portray a couple of cricket-obsessed fussbudgets who alternately help and hinder the investigation. Harper and Runacre are a pair of secretive lovers. Nedeva does well in a small role as a nun. Some exquisitely beautiful Austrian scenery helps add a bit of luster to the film, but it's not enough to plug all the holes. While the plot line is creaky (and has been used in countless other films and TV shows), it would still be irresistible if not for the jarring presence of the two leads. Fans of theirs will be far more forgiving, but those who like a little class and authenticity in their films will be put off by their frequently obnoxious characterizations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfectly acceptable - if pointless - remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was no need for this movie to be made (but that is true for most remakes). The original is a classic and generally considered the best of Hitchcock's early British films. But if you forget about the comparisons and let this remake stand on its own, it's actually pretty decent: good-looking, beautifully scored, and well-cast, even in the secondary roles. The two leads are likably goofy (they do bring a 70's flavor to these 30's characters, which may or may not be to your taste), and male viewers will be glad to know that Cybill Shepherd spends the entire running time wearing a white dress that reveals her sexy back, arms and shoulders. If I can point one flaw in this movie, it's that the script doesn't build enough ambiguity - even people who don't know the story won't think for a moment that it could all be "in Cybill's head". But it's clear that the intention here was to create a light comedy-mystery, not a suspense classic. (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ugh! What a mess! Only Angela Lansbury among the major cast members stands out. Cybill Shepherd seems to have the "madcap" part down, but too often she is merely silly rather than funny. As for Elliott Gould, he seems completely miscast, and acts as if he wandered in from another movie. This is hardly an improvement of -- or even an enlightening insight into -- the Hitchcock original. Only intermittently entertaining, but, by all means, see it if you're a Lansbury fan : she's wonderful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Need For Comparisons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a strong tendency to compare Hitchcock's version of "The Lady Vanishes" with the 1979 version starring Elliot Gould, Cybill Shepherd, and Angela Lansbury. There's no need to do so. Both have the same title but entirely different moods. This doesn't make one "better" or "worse" than the other. They just should be judged on their own merits. Both are thrillers, one more somber and tense, and the latter version more of a melodramatic mystery with comedic touches. What I would suggest is that the viewer simply watch both versions, recognizing the strong and weak points of each. Both are enjoyable, but to interject a personal note, I tend to lean toward this 1979 version for its tone that's more like other mystery films such as "Charade" or "North By Northwest". Enjoy them both as different cinematic expressions and let others worry about comparisons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Always one to buck the trend, I love this film! And has done since it was made. It was the fantastic music to begin with, but it drew me in. Goodness knows why it's taken me such a lengthy time to write this. It's an excellent cast, very well photographed and makes me smile. What's not to like? So, it's different from the 1939 version? Of course it is: there's forty years between them! One isn't better than the other. They're just different. However, any film which makes me smile is a winner in my book. I have it on DVD, but I'm always glad to watch it on the telly. Did I mention I love the music? I wish I could buy that on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome Re-make of the Hitchcock Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angela Lansbury plays a nanny turned spy who is attempting to get back to Britain with some vital information. Set in Pre-WWII Germany this movie chronicles the trip of Cybill Shepherds character back to the UK to be reunited with her fiancé. On the train she befriends Ms. Froy and another American (played by Elliott Gould). However, things go awry when Ms. Froy seemingly vanishes into thin air and nobody on the train seems to have any memory of her. Is Shepherds character losing her marbles? - Gould certainly seems to think so...that is until he spots something out of the train window for a fleeting second. Its a superb story and very satisfying. I really enjoy this charming thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cybill Shepherd comedy, whereas Hitchcock's original was a mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of a British 1938 Michael Redgrave film with Dame Mae Witty and Margaret Lockwood. The 1979 version, done as a Cybill Shepherd and Elliott Gould vehicle, pushes mainly its comedic/farcical elements instead of it being s legitimate mystery itself. The political intrigues and treacheries of the years between the First and Second World Wars made a better basis for the 1938 film than the 1979 film had. Alfred Hitchcock had still been in Britain when his 1938 film was made. Hitchcock had a sure hand utilizing the looming dangers and unease of the time, just one year prior to Britain's actual 1939 entry into WWII. The 1979 film isn't rotten but it simply doesn't hold up when weighed against Hitchcock's original. If you watch the 1979 movie, do so expecting a comedy not a mystery, and do so before you ever have seen the Hitchcock version.</fullReview>

This version is more than competent; it entertained me. I very much enjoyed it.I agree that not only the stars but the entire case make this film. The technical aspects of it are flawless. The continuity is seamless, the dialogue surprising fresh, and the action believable. I do not think remaking this work is pointless?it is a variation and a pleasant and amusing one.

		<shortDescription>An indifferent remake of the Hitchcock classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no need to get excited when you see George Axelrod listed in the credits as the screenwriter, for this is a very tepid remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic which comes off second best in all respects. At least no attempt has been made to update the plot. Unfortunately, it just seems far more ridiculous in color and widescreen. The character changes are also no improvement. Admittedly, the original movie was a bit too talky, but this version positively wallows in inconsequential dialogue. Just about all the roles have been built up with more talk, but there is no corresponding increase in the action sequences, and the direction, alas, is totally unimaginative. Admittedly, some of the action is effectively managed, particularly the fight on board the train, but the climax is run of the mill. The director's main concern is obviously to bring every word of Axelrod's indifferent dialogue to viewers' ears. The actors are also hampered by the director's unimaginative use of close-ups which draw further attention to the weak script. Both Eliott Gould and Cybill Shepherd try hard to overcome all the drawbacks, but with not a great deal of success. In any case, this version is far to long for its thin plot. The colorful photography doesn't help either. It conveys about as much atmosphere and suspense as pink frosting on a butter cake. True, production values are good, but it's the story that counts, not the scenery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can see no reason to watch this film while the 1938 original still exists on earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an overcrowded hotel, many travellers await a train to their destination. Among them is Miss Froy - a school mistress, Robert Condon, a photographer for Life magazine and Amanda Kelly, a socialite on her way to meet her fiancée. When Amanda gets a knock on her head on the train, Miss Froy looks after her. She falls asleep for a while and wakes up to find Miss Froy gone. When she enquires, no one else can remember any such woman being on the train ? did she imagine it or is something more sinister afoot?Of course it isn't rubbish but no matter how "OK" this film it, it simply isn't comparable to the much, much better Hitchcock original ? sadly a statement that I consider true of all aspects of the film. The plot is held as in the original but for this story to work the delivery needs to be good. Hitchcock did it well producing a pacy and enjoyable film that was light but engaging at the same time. Here the film isn't too much longer than the original but my gosh it drags by comparison. The lack of tension was a real surprise to me and the film failed to draw out the mystery ? of course I knew it was not in Amanda's head but I do when I watch the original as well ? this familiarity doesn't totally account for the lack of tension in the film generally, that is more to do with the lack of urgency and the starry feel of the film generally. Filmed in lush colours and a postcard presentation of Europe the film looks professional but the brightness undercuts the tension yet again. Page generally doesn't do much with the direction to help the material or cast out ? it all looks OK but doesn't do that much. Viewers who have not seen the original might enjoy it but anyone coming to it second will struggle to find much added value in this retread.Gould and Shepherd both overegg their performances and lean too heavily on the side of humour without doing enough on the side of the mystery. Of course neither of them are helped by their lack of chemistry with one another. There is no spark at all and they generally just bluster around each other. Lansbury is OK as the lady of the title but you can't help feel that she's doesn't really deserve to share the same role as the much better Witty. Lowe and Charmichael dominate with a rerun of the amusing English clichés from the original although Lom is worth a look. The rest of the cast however, just fill in the background without too much effort or style.Overall this is a distracting and OK film in its own right but I simply cannot see any reason why any viewer would find this a more worthwhile venture than the original. In every way, from direction and tone through to performances and cinematography, the film is a poor photocopy of the original. If you haven't seen it then you should be watching that; if you have seen it then I don't understand why beyond a morbid sense of curiosity, you'd want to watch this remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't quite have the charm of the original, but as a remake it is slick, beautifully shot and the music is wonderful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit I do prefer the Hitchcock original, however one thing I did prefer about the remake is that it is slicker. You may argue you shouldn't compare it to the Hitchcock original, and by the way Hitchock is my favourite director, but the thing is people do. The remake doesn't quite have the charm of its original, and I do think it is to do with the fact that the screenplay at times is weak, the director is no Hitchcock and the film does meander in the last twenty minutes. On the other hand, it is stylishly done, with stunning cinematography and lavish costumes. The story is an interesting concept, and I did find the film interesting and a pleasant watch overall. The music by the way is outstanding, very richly scored and the main theme sticks in your head for a very long time. The performances are mostly not at all bad. Angela Lansbury is marvellous as Miss Froy, despite her limited screen time. Herbert Lom also impresses as usual, and while Cybill Sheppard has given better performances, she did look absolutely beautiful. In fact the only actor who disappointed was Elliot Gould, he had the handsome screen presence but he didn't quite convince, and just for the record, his dialogue for me was the weakest of the film. All in all, slick, underrated and well done remake, but if I were to compare the two, I would say the original was better. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but sometimes campy, remake of a Hitchcock classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, as the remake of a classic, could have been a brilliant success, such as "Murder on the Orient Express," and even the spoofy-but-still-compelling "Silver Streak." But the finished product turns out to be more of a comedy than the suspenseful "Who-Dunnit," like the original masterpiece this was supposed to have remade.Blame the absurd casting of Elliot Gould, and the horrid direction Sybil Sheppard was given.. Sheppard can be a good actress. But this is one of her more unfortunate performances. As a "madcap heiress," she comes off more like Meg Ryan's "flibberty-jibbet" character in "Joe vs. the Volcano." "Much-married, madcap heiress," she corrects Gould in his reprisal of her performance of the night before.Gould just isn't Peter Ustinov (or Albert Finney for that matter), which seems to be the men he attempts to mimic. If that is the case, he missed the mark by a country mile. He, in no way, even begins to fill those shoes.The European anti-American sentiments are well displayed and conveyed here, and Sheppard's character does little to change that.While this is still a fun, suspenseful film, it is nothing like the original in that it captures none of the fantastic suspense lent by Hitchcock's direction. Although the spoof is unintentional, this is more like the "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" version. Amanda Kelly (Sheppard) is befriended by the kindly Miss Froy (Angela Landsbury), a motherly type who lends a hand and offers the British solution for most ailments; chicken soup and a nice cup of tea. Kelly dozes off on the train and when she awakens, Miss Froy is absent. The other members of the car in which they are seated, seemingly have no memory of Miss Froy, and they begin to "Gaslight" Kelly. Even the waiter who served Miss Froy and Ms. Kelly in the dining car, has no memory of Miss Froy. Indeed, he presents Kelly with a ticket indicating that she paid the bill herself, was alone and unattended.Robert Condon (Elliott Gould), also a passenger aboard the train, is somehow whirl-winded into a search for the elusive Miss Froy, and before you know it, he is sleuthing the mystery with Ms. Kelly. Where is she, what has happened to Miss Froy, and why? Unfortunately, while this is a fun adventure, it's more funny than fun. It lacks in wit, and your humor is more at the expense of Gould's and Sheppard's performances than the dialog. It lacks the intelligence and careful direction of the original. Agatha Christie's "Murder on the Orient Express" is a much better endeavor, and I highly suggest it in place of this poor remake. Hitchcock must have puked upon seeing this.What should have been an epic homage, ended up being a sad parody of a great masterpiece of suspense. While it is still enjoyable, it could have been oh-so-much-more, and was in other versions.It rates a 4.3/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather bad remake and Hammer film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last of the original Hammer films, it's a rather bad film which does not live up to either the best of the studio's films from the late 1950s to the early 1970s or the original Alfred Hitchcock film. The film follows the same basic storyline as the 1938 version but the execution is lacking. I had mixed feelings about the fact that, in certain aspects, the film stuck very closely to the original, even using many of the same lines. On the one hand, I wish that they had done something different as, otherwise, it makes the idea of the remake rather pointless. On the other hand, the new material is fairly bad so perhaps I was spared from being even worse than it was.I like Elliot Gould but this isn't one of his better performances. He just natters on and on constantly. Cybill Shepherd is dreadful as Amanda Kelly, the "much married American heiress." She spends the entire film either speaking in a monotone, rushing her lines or screeching at the top of her lungs. They also have almost no chemistry. They're no Michael Redgrave or Margaret Lockwood. They're both thoroughly overshadowed and outacted by Arthur Lowe and Ian Carmichael as Charters and Caldicott, who were almost as good as Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford in the 1938 version, as well as by Herbert Lom as Dr. Hartz. Incidentally, I think that Lom - who played the title character in "The Phantom of the Opera" - is the only Hammer veteran to appear in their final film for 29 years. Angela Lansbury is good as Mrs Froy but, at 53, she was at least 15 years too young for the role.Alfred Hitchcock was still alive when the film was released. I doubt that he ever saw it, which is perhaps for the best.</fullReview>

Gould is too old and somewhat fey and Shepherd is acting as though she were in a Carole Lombard film. The leads in the original film gave the roles more depth; perhaps it is also the fault of the screenplay.The overall production values are good and the supporting cast is wonderful especially Lansbury, of course, and Ian Carmichael--Lord Peter Wimsey in scenes with Cybill Shepherd!.I would buy this on DVD if available.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this shouldn't be compared to the Hitchcock film. They're not the same kind of film, and comparisons are pointless. Both movies are good, in different ways.Second, I love Elliot Gould, usually, but in this film he's not good. His normal playful, easy charm is replaced by too much frowny mugging for the camera.But Cybill's fabulous. My main criticism is that this is a girl's movie, but Cybill wears the same gown throughout. And she looks gorgeous in it, but if you're going to make a girl film, for goodness' sake, let the girl change her clothes once a week. And she doesn't. But her performance is terrific - she throws herself into the part with enthusiasm and lack of embarrassment, even when she has to do fairly embarrassing things. She's tough and tomboyish and beautiful, really starry. And because of this, the film's just fine. It's a shame the normally sexy Elliot Gould's performance is kind of flat, because he can do so much better. Worth seeing. .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Under-appreciated as it is, this remake of Hitchcock's 1938 classic truly embodies my idea of how a well-crafted and entertaining light movie should be. The story is able to make flesh creep and the screenplay even manages to improve on the original plot line by taking some bold departures, but sticking all the way to the master's spirit and style. (E.g. the very effective motif of the Hitler-moustache - and the whole idea of transferring the story to nazi Germany.) The settings - real train, real land -, the camera work, the music are all great, adding to the thrill of the ride. The cast is a jackpot, Cybill Sheperd throws out sparks. All in all: this is a highly ingenious remake that makes the old original seem pale and puerile by comparison. I'm sure Hitchcock himself wouldn't have done it better as a self-remake. I want this on DVD!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much as I like and possess the DVD of the original Hitchcock version, this remake is a much better job. It avoids many of the tedious moments of the original film, especially during the first half hour or so in the hotel, and introduces a lot more humour. I mean Arthur Lowe and Ian Carmichael are nothing short of EXCELLENT, far funnier than the tedious idiots of the original. In addition we have better sound quality, superb picture quality, an extremely sexy Cybill Sheppard and a BEAUTIFUL sound track !! What more could you ask. I know little about the main mail character Elliot Gould and indeed found his performance the least interesting, but this is more than compensated for by the other performances. The Nazi Helmut played his role very well and rendered himself thoroughly dislikeable. And I have always loved Angela Lansbury in whatever rôle I have seen her. This is good quality cinematic entertainment from 1979, without special effects, something which is in very short supply in these initial years of the twenty first century. Thank God it's been issued on a DVD !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hammer's lamentable remake of a Hitchcock classic and unsurprisingly the studio's last picture ? at least until their recent reinvention as a purveyor of horror fare. THE LADY VANISHES is an odd film indeed, one that veers unevenly between comedy, mystery and thrills and never really succeeds in any of those fields: the comedy's unfunny, the mystery's obvious and the thrills muted. It doesn't help that the lead actress ? Cybill Shepherd ? is horribly miscast, giving a performance so awful that some viewers may turn off because of her alone.Then again, Shepherd may not be entirely at fault ? I struggle to think of an alternative actress who could have brought her shrill, screechy character to life. I generally enjoy films set aboard trains, planes, boats etc. but this one never makes good use of the location and the constant moving between carriages and compartments becomes repetitive in the extreme (although a late stage train-climbing stunt sequence is breathtakingly good).Elliott Gould seems distinctly embarrassed by his presence here and can do nothing with his character, while Angela Lansbury seems to think she's still in BEDKNOBS &amp; BROOMSTICKS and gives a patronising turn. It's left to the Arthur Lowe and Ian Carmichael to supply some genuine humour, although sadly their characters are ill-utilised and kept off-screen for the most part. THE LADY VANISHES marks an ignoble end for a once-fine studio and languishes today as a deservedly forgotten oddity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To my surprise, better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Hitchcock's original and did not expect much for the remake. Boy was I surprised. This actually seemed better than the original. It's a must have. It will be in my DVD collection. The actors made this movie. Lansbury, Shepherd and Gould were superb. Who would have thought Gould could compete with a Redgrave; but, he actually pulled it off. I think this was Shepherd's best performance ever. Lansbury's recent performance in a children's movie was pretty good, but this, indeed, has to be her absolutely best performance ever. Cheers to all the actors and director. If you can get your hands on a copy of this movie, do so today. It is well worth the investment. I am particular about my movie collection, but this one made the cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is great, it will keep you on the edge of your seat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film, everything about it is great and it is bound to be as it is an Alfred Hitchcock remake. It full of suspense, its funny, thrilling, the direction is good, the sets and locations are excellent, the cast are excellent, Cybill Shepherd is funny and great as her hysterical character Amanda Kelly, Elliott Gould is great as Robert Condon and Angela Lansbury is perfect as the kidnapped Miss Froy! And iam sure that in time it will become a classic in its own right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Charm Vanishes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone has commented here that you should not compare this film to the Hitchcock directed original as they are 'different' and 'comparisons are pointless'! What a very strange and incorrect comment to make on a site dedicated to comparing films of all kinds! The person has rated this film 10/10 therefore intimating that by comparison to ANY film this is top notch. If they do not wish to compare films, why comment and rate a film on the site?! Weird! Their comment that they are good in different ways and rating this as 10/10 are extraordinary claims for quality in this film that most others as well as myself think are way off the mark.This film lacks all the charm, wit and directorial genius of the original. There are many likenesses as it is the same story of course but EVERYTHING is done far less well. Even the person who rated this top marks and is a self proclaimed Elliott Gould fan says he isn't good in this. I agree for once. The acting is poor. Every character in Hitchcock's film is well developed as well as charmingly and brilliantly acted. All actors are far inferior in this version as is the director.The original has all the camera shots, suspense building scenes and clever touches you would expect from Hitchcock. This film lacks all of that. It has lost its charm and all the humour falls flat. It scrapes up to 3 1/2 or 4 out of 10 for me simply due to its great source material and me trying to judge it on its own limited merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of a classic. Missing nanny, and in this case missing acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am completely amazed by some of the other comments here, which claim it's a flawed if reasonable movie. The film is a remake of a classic, which wasn't that great in the first place, but this is simply dire. Let's just think about some of its points:The Acting: I use the term loosely. I'm really not sure what anyone was on when this was made. I don't know if people didn't like each other, whether they were doing it for a bet or what. I have huge respect for all the actors: Angela Lansbury is a treasure (and is probably the only one to come out the film well), Elliot Gould tries his best with this nonsense and Cybill Shephard works her socks off to try to make the role something else. But somehow everyone ends up as though they know they're not in an danger of repeating a classic and so just walk through the roles. If you watch as Cybill and Elliot deliver their lines, whether or not it was ad libbing, lots of it just looks, sounds and is played like a rehearsal - and not a good one at that.The Story: It's a good mystery story, but it comes off as fake. There is nobody to care about, nobody to go along with. Cybill's character comes across as just a plain spoiled brat. What's with the million pounds bit? I know the rest of the casehave to believe she's a bit mad and that her story isn't true, but I really wanted HER to vanish, not Miss Froy! Updating it correctly so it has the Nazi references is good, but the Nazis are played as comic-book baddies, so it's just odd. And the English are comic book goodies too. Arthur Lowe and Ian Carmichael do the roles to perfection, but you do end up wanting to slap them.The Direction, Script, Production... I'm putting all the rest of what's wrong with this in the same place. Other reviews have called this a much maligned film, but it really does deserve maligning. There's almost nothing good about it, unless you count its comic relief potential. It's too bizarre for words - some of the scenes should not have made it into a finished project.This is just a bad film; everything's wrong with it from the stereotypes to the casting to the direction to the look of the whole thing. It would be nice to look at it now and forgive it its flaws, but there are just too many of them! Any film you can't watch without cringing doesn't deserve a good review.It gets 2 out of 10 from me because of its classic heritage and because of Angela Lansbury. Otherwise it wouldn't merit a score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't come much worse than this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Re-makes are, generally speaking, disappointing but this has to be the worst. Cybill Shepherd gives her usual acting performance (very poor), Angela Lansbury is, frankly, second rate and the rest of the cast seem embarrassed by the awful script. There seems to be, at times, an attempt at humour but it is so childish that it doesn't raise a smile. At the time that the original was made film makers could get away with this sort of plot, and Hitchcock could make it (almost) believable, but these days a little more is required. All in all an awful film which Hammer should be ashamed of as (I'm sure) most of the cast are. Steer clear of it.</fullReview>
