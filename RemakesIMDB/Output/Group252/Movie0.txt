		<shortDescription>An Early Hitchcock Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Hitchcock was noted for his wit and often sprinkled his films with wickedly funny moments, he seldom gave comic elements such a free reign as he did in THE LADY VANISHES, which is among the most memorable of his early British films. Charmingly cast with Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave, and Dame May Witty in the leads, the extremely witty script mixes 1930s romantic froth with increasingly tense suspense in the story of sharp witted young woman (Lockwood) who befriends an elderly lady (Witty) during a train journey--and is extremely disturbed when, as the title states, the lady vanishes.Many regard this as the best of Hitchcock's early work, and it is easy to see why: the film demonstrates his growing talent for building suspense from an unlikely mix of the commonplace and the incredible. He is also remarkably blessed in his cast, with Lockwood and Redgrave possessing considerable chemistry and Dame May Witty particularly endearing in one of the character roles at which she so excelled; the supporting cast is also particularly memorable.Hitchcock guides them all with never a misstep through a complex script that progresses from very lighthearted to extremely sinister and then back again, and the result leaves audiences with both the satisfaction of a well-made thriller and the glow of a romantic comedy. Although it lacks the subtle tones of his later work, THE LADY VANISHES is among my own favorites by Hitchcock, and fans who have never seen it are in for a real treat. Highly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful comedy thriller, the best of Hitchcock's British films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes is a wonderful piece of fluff, the culmination of Hitchcock's British period, after which he started to explore more serious themes in his American films. Of course the basic plot is absurd, centering around the most ridiculous way to get a secret message through one can think of, and why did.....o well, never mind, it's the handling that matters, and Hitchcock achieves a near perfect balance here of humour and suspense that he only really matched on one other film, North By Northwest.The film spends 20 or so minutes just introducing it's characters, but they are all so great, especially the two men so obsessed with returning to a cricket match that a case of disappearance and possibly murder is relatively unimportant, that it hardly matters, while Michael Redgrave and Margaret Lockwood simply sparkle as the main couple who of course initially can't stand each other. Once on the train, the ensuring mystery and sleuthing are riveting,and full of fantastic little details- the name on the window, the nun with high heeled shoes, the fight amidst a magician's paraphenalia The final shootout is excellently staged and still quite exciting. The laughs are constant, with some helarious lines, but they never detract from the suspense. Of course there's those shoddy model shots, but hell, this is a film from 1939!Hitchcock had countless classics to come, including such complex masterpieces as Vertigo and Rear Window, but the delightful, hugely enjoyable The Lady Vanishes is a little masterpiece of it's own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast moving early Hitchcock comedy/thriller with memorable acting and outstanding script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty) mysteriously vanishes while on a long train journey through the Swiss Alps during a cold winter. Margaret Lockwood as Iris Henderson is the only person on the train who believes that Miss Froy has disappeared (or in fact that she even existed!) but Lockwood manages to persuade fellow traveller music scholar Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave) to assist her in the search. Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne (as cricket fans Charters and Caldicott) have seen Miss Froy but are fearful that an investigation into her disappearance might delay the train and therefore stop them getting to Manchester in time for their beloved Test Match so they decide to stay silent. Paul Lukas (Dr Hartz) tries to convince Lockwood she is mistaken and has imagined the entire episode due to a blow on the head she received prior to the train journey. Cecil Parker (Mr Todhunter) has his own reasons for keeping quiet as he does not want his illicit affair with Linden Travers to become public knowledge. Several other passengers on the train have seen Miss Froy but do not want to be involved which confuses our heroine and places her in grave danger as the journey progresses.Shame about the fake model shots at the start of the film but this aside Hitchcock skilfully keeps the suspense at a high level and the witty script by Sidney Gilliatt and Frank Launder is both entertaining and enthralling. Hitchcock obviously has a liking for trains as his films have often featured long train sequences. "The 39 Steps", "Strangers on a Train" and "North by Northwest" are just three classic examples.Some favourite lines from the film:Margaret Lockwood: "I've no regrets - I've been everywhere and done everything. I've eaten caviar at Cannes, sausage rolls at the dogs. I've played baccarat at Biarritz, and darts with the rural dean. What is there left for me but marriage?".Basil Radford (on the phone to London): "No, you don't follow me sir - I'm enquiring about the Test Match in Manchester. Cricket, sir, cricket!! What! You don't know! You can't be in England and not know the Test score!".Margaret Lockwood (to Michael Redgrave): "I know there's a Miss Froy - she's as real as you are".Paul Lukas (to Margaret Lockwood): "There is no Miss Froy - there never was a Miss Froy. Merely a very subjective image".Although "The Lady Vanishes" is one of Hitchcock's very early black and white British films (1938) it anticipates the future expertise, skills and talent of this accomplished director and is well worth viewing. If you are waiting to spot Hitchcock's regular cameo appearance this doesn't take place until the closing minutes of the film so settle back and enjoy the plot then watch out for Hitchcock smoking a cigar at Victoria Station almost at the end! "The Lady Vanishes" was remade in colour in 1979 with Elliott Gould and Cybill Shepherd but the Hitchcock version is definitely the one to see. 10/10. Clive Roberts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cracking plot, sparkling dialogue, great characters and sublime direction make The Lady Vanishes an all-time must see.Marking the peak of Hitchcock's British period, it is an exquisitely crafted, finely wrought, cinematic treasure, boasting a cast which reads like a veritable Who's who of British acting talent from the Golden Age of British Cinema.While the director, writers and supporting cast all deserve credit, the film very much belongs to its leading lady, the lovely Margaret Lockwood, who, as feisty heroine Iris Henderson, somehow manages to be heart-stoppingly beautiful, supremely sexy, spirited, cute and adorably vulnerable all at the same time! Now where can I meet a girl like that?The Lady Vanishes is, for every reason, but especially because of Miss Lockwood, the very best of the very best; a landmark movie which is truly unmissable! Buy it, rent it, steal it if you must, but make damn sure you see it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lady Vanishes" is one of Director Alfred Hitchcock's best British made films, in fact I think it's one of his all time best.Set in pre-WWII somewhere in Europe, A group of people board a train bound for England after having spent the previous night in an overcrowded hotel. Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) befriends a kindly old governess/teacher, Miss Froy (Dame May Witty). When Iris is struck by a falling flowerpot, Miss Froy promises to take care of her as they board the train.After having tea together, the two women return to their compartment where Iris falls asleep. When she awakes, Miss Froy is gone, totally vanished. The people sharing the compartment, "The Baroness" (Mary Clare), Signor and Signora Doppo (Philip Leaver, Selma Van Dias) deny ever having seen Miss Froy. Doctor Hartz (Paul Lukas) comes to her aid and is convinced that the bump Iris received to her head may have caused a memory lapse.Iris then meets Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave) whom she had met the previous evening at the hotel. He offers his help. Skeptical at first, he soon comes to believe Iris' story. Eric Todhunter (Cecil Parker) and "Mrs." Todhunter (Linden Travers) deny seeing Miss Froy because they are in the midst of an extra marital affair. Two British "gentlemen", Caldicott (Naughton Wayne) and Charters (Basil Radford) though having seen Miss Froy with Iris, don't wish to become involved.When Dr. Hartz brings a patient aboard the train, Gilbert and Iris become suspicious and.......................................As was his custom, Hitchcock pits his heroine against all odds in her quest to find Miss Froy. The suspense builds as the situation becomes more hopeless. This would be a theme that the master of suspense would use throughout his career. He also liked to work trains into many of his plots, including this film of which three quarters takes place on board a train.The scene in the hotel showing Caldicott and Charters sharing a bed (and a pair of pajamas) never would have gotten by the American censors. The relationship between the Todhunters as well, was quite obvious and rare for the American cinema of the day.This is one of Hitchcock's best films and hasn't suffered because of age. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early view into Hitch's genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From 1938, The Lady Vanishes is clearly where Hitch was getting comfortable in his trade. Starting slowly, it soon revs up with mystery and intrigue. But I think that was the whole point. A seemingly innocuous day can lead itself into adventure.Starting in some remote European village, a woman meets a little old lady. Getting on the train the next day, the old lady vanishes without a trace while she is asleep. When she asks about the lady, people say that there was no old lady. The mystery then ensues as our leading lady tries to uncover the plot behind a woman she knows was there.The main aspect of this movie is the everyday humor that is applied. The two English fellows who are only looking for the latest cricket scores, score themselves some remarkable laughs. Our hero that comes to the leading woman's assistance is funny and charming himself. The time spent at the beginning in the hotel may seem to be off topic, making a viewer wonder where the mystery is, but the point is that the viewer becomes acquainted with the characters and are much more believable to the viewer. Again, I think Hitch was showing us our next door neighbors and how they can rise up against unusually dangerous circumstances. I think my analysis of Hitch would be his championing the moral fiber of everyman. I think that is why Hitchcock films still stand today as some of the best ever made.This movie receives my major recommendation. Not done yet. I got more to view and review. What fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans of "The 39 Steps" need to see this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Alfred Hitchcock struck gold with such well known films as "Vertigo" and "Psycho," he made films in his native country: England. It was in the UK that he filmed such 1930s classics as "The 39 Steps," "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and "Sabotage." Among these was another slightly forgotten classic, 1938's "The Lady Vanishes." It starts as a cheery lightweight romp, it becomes a suspense-filled mystery, and it ends as an engaging thriller. Most movies nowadays get stuck in a rut and become nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action extravaganza set in a simple plot which serves as the way to get the characters on screen. Hitchcock did something else: He cared about the plot, stretched it out and made it elaborately intriguing, and then filled it in with the characters afterwards.There's a mastermind behind this, and it belongs to that big horror master himself. "The Lady Vanishes" is one of his best early films (and it would be his last British film), a true sign of what was to come in the later years of his life. It was remade in 1979 with Elliot Gould and Cybill Shepherd, but lacked the freshness and striking narrative that the original contains.In Germany, prior to World War II, a young woman travels cross country in a train, with an eccentric woman known as Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty) as a companion. Froy is a short little woman who reeks of naivety and innocence. But perhaps not everything is as plain and simple as it seems--after falling asleep on the train for a short time period, Iris (Margaret Lockwood), the young traveler, awakens to find Miss Froy absent from her seat opposite herself.The worst thing of all is that no one recalls having seen a little old lady aboard the train. Iris looks like a delusional loony, and she even starts to doubt the story herself, when odd clues start to turn up throughout the train. Enlisting the help of Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave), a goofy man who is crazy enough to believe Iris' story, the two search in a frantic race before their train meets its arrival and Miss Froy is unloaded--if she's even still on the train.The fundamentals of the story lie in its plot, and also in its characters. They're all lovable, from Gilbert to Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) and Charters (Basil Redford), two traveling men looking to get back to England for a cricket tournament. After the train is stopped towards the end of the film and a band of Germans tries to board the plane, one of the men quips to the other something to the effect of, "We'll never be back for the cricket match, now."It's interesting how so many mysteries make so much sense by the end, but you can't for the life of you guess the ending ahead of time. Sometimes this is not the case (I guessed the "surprise" ending of "Identity" from the trailer), especially nowadays with each mystery film being a retread of "The Sixth Sense." But back in the Hitch days, most every mystery was a complex one that had a totally unexpected climatic ending. Filmed on an extremely low budget, "The Lady Vanishes" surprisingly boasts some amazing special effects in some areas, at least for the decade the movie was filmed in. One of these is when Gilbert climbs the exterior of the train, and on the opposite tracks another train swooshes by, knocking him backwards. You find this type of low-budget effect nowadays in homemade movies, but then it was quite good.But other scenes are not quite as exquisite. The opening scene post credits, in which the camera swoops down into a small German village, is filmed well but the background and foreground are both models. If you look closely, you can see that the village folk walking along the street aren't actually walking at all--they're miniature figurines! Look for the little toy car that drives by behind the building--stuff like this is classic! But even with a horrible budget Hitchcock manages to control the scene the way he wants. It shows that even with a minimal amount of money he still tried to make everything intriguing and mysterious.And that he did. Not only is "The Lady Vanishes" one of the best mysteries of all time, it's one of the best films of all time, too. It takes a while to start, but once it does, does it ever! It's low budget, yes, but not nearly as hard to make out as "The 39 Steps," one of Hitch's earlier British films. There are a lot of Hitchcock fanatics out there, and they may not have even heard of some of his earlier, lesser known films. Plus, they may be turned off by how hard it is to make out dialogue and scenes. ("The Man Who Knew Too Much" is notorious for being hard to understand.) And so for interested Hitchcock fans, your journey starts here.Note: Towards the end of the film, look for a quick Alfred Hitchcock cameo. He's the man at Victoria Station who walks by with a cigarette.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best of the early Hitchcock films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best of the early Hitchcock films. The plot is absorbing, the dialogue clever and the cast great. Whether or not this was the first of the director's films to place its principal action on a moving train I cannot say, but it's a theme that would come back again in his later work, most notably in "Strangers on a Train."The film gets off to a somewhat rocky start with the camera panning over an Alpine inn and a train halted mid-journey by an avalanche. I agree with the review who observes that we've become spoilt by more sophisticated special effects. A Lionel half buried in a heap of bleached wheat flower just doesn't cut it nowadays. Think also of the stick figure engulfed in the munitions factory explosion in "Saboteur." I suppose directors of that era had to do with whatever was available.But after this point the film really takes off, and one scarcely recalls the unpromising opening. Viewers always look for the chemistry or lack thereof between actors. Well, Lockwood and Redgrave definitely have it. One cannot help but enjoy seeing how the initial sparks flying between their clashing characters develop into true love by movie's end. As the two are making their way through the train trying to locate Whitty, they move from one barely plausible predicament to another. But we love it, as one witty exchange turns quickly into another. (For example, Lockwood is asked to describe the missing Whitty and launches into an extremely detailed portrait that leaves not a single button unaccounted for. Then she ends by saying, "That's all I can remember." Counters Redgrave dryly: "Well, you can't have been paying attention.")Much of the film's action occurs in the fictional country of Bandrika, which seems to be a thinly disguised stand-in for nazi-controlled Austria, so recently annexed by Hitler's Germany. As an amateur linguist, I found myself trying to make sense of the made-up "Bandrikan" spoken by the natives, but of course was unable to do so. (What could it be? A Finno-Ugric language? :) Most of the time the identity of Hitchcock's villains remains deliberately vague, except in "Notorious" and "Torn Curtain," where they are nazis and communists respectively. It works better when he leaves us guessing.As an amateur musician I loved Hitch's "macguffin," namely, the secret formula encoded in a song which the protagonists had to memorize and carry to the Foreign Office in London. (I should think, however, that a genuine secret message might translate into something more like Schoenberg's twelve-tone music than a central European folk song, but of course that would hardly work in a film. :)The early Hitchcock seemed to like shootouts, as seen also in the first version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much." But shootouts are an ineffective way to convey suspense, and this is perhaps the one thing that dims what is otherwise a masterpiece.It's too bad the director lived long enough to see this film remade in 1979. Cybil Shepherd is no Margaret Lockwood, and it's pretty unpleasant-almost embarrassing-to see her shrieking her way through each scene. Couldn't they have waited a few years until he had passed on? They ought to have let him die in peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock announced a call to arms in a brilliant and amusing thriller, "The Lady Vanishes." The lady in question is Miss Froy (Dame May Witty), a splendid eccentric innocent old governess (in reality a British secret agent), who is kidnapped by the smooth Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas), really the master enemy spy...Involved in the rescue are Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a sincere young musicologist trying on using up unwisely his life on unfruitful pursuits; Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) a pretty girl who is returning to London to sacrifice herself on the altar of nobility - she has accepted to marry a weedy little English count; and a hilarious sporting couple, Chalders and Caldicott (Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne), whose only concern and topic conversation is the cricket match--will they make it back in home for the "big game." Other characters include Percy (Cecil Parker), the pompous lawyer who is constantly afraid that his affair with Linden Travers will be discovered... Above all he does not want to be involved... He is the voice of pacifism and self-control... While the others fight it out with the enemy, he rushes from the coach waving a white handkerchief... He is shot, and dies never understanding why...Hitchcock (and you never know with him) creates a multi-sided movie (superb, suspenseful, brilliantly funny), extending the power of stereotypes by caricaturing itself, making the audience express with laughter, and in a way they forget that they have just accepted some unpleasant tasting medicine...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was noted for his light comic touch, but history records only one attempt at a full-out comedy, 1955's "The Trouble With Harry." The real trouble with "Harry" is it's not funny, but fortunately Hitchcock did leave us with a much surer and defter comedy in the guise of a thriller. Enter "The Lady Vanishes."The opening scene gets a lot of hackles from people, as we find ourselves in a mountain valley where, after the credits roll, the camera glides over what is obviously a miniature train set. We even see a toy roadster glide by as the camera closes on the exterior of a model house.Why, it's so primitive and fake! exclaim viewers accustomed to "Matrix"-style FX.But they miss the point, and not just because they fail to take account of the time when the film was made. Here's what I think: Hitchcock shot the scene with a deliberate nod at the hokeyness of it, reminding his audience from the start that this is not the real thing but play-acting, to be taken as such. He knows it looks a bit phony (though the arresting pan-and-zoom would be the sort of opening other directors would imitate as soon as the technology let them). The focus of "The Lady Vanishes" is not politics, or even mystery. It is fun, in the same non-critical way as a child's entertainment. In this, Hitchcock succeeds, and creates no mere time capsule but a vessel of entertainment that has withstood decades of changing fashion, because it is first, last, and always fun."The Lady Vanishes" is the sort of film that works on pace, craft, and charm. The plot is well thought-out, provided you yourself try not to think about it much. There's really no reason for the story to go down the way it does, and once the movie is over, you begin to see the holes. Why is it necessary for British intelligence to go through so much trouble for info that could be just as easily delivered by telegram, or diplomatic pouch? Why, if you cold-bloodedly swipe a woman from a train, do you leave a witness behind to blurt out that there's been a disappearance? How come a name written on the inside of a train compartment window is erased by a blast of locomotive smoke across the outside of the window? But the engaging plot does what it is supposed to, keeping you interested and wondering what will happen next, rather than why it is happening the way it is.The storyline of "The Lady Vanishes" is unlike any Hitchcock film. It's so light and airy that it reminds me more of a Tintin comic book, with the mythical Slavic nation of Vandreka the sort of simultaneously quaint and suspicious setting Herge would stick Captain Haddock and the Thompson Twins. Leave aside your sophisticated Dashiell Hammett-fed expectations for a moment. If you let yourself go, you will be transported, and quite entertained. Hitchcock never meshed comedy so thoroughly in the body of a story as he does here. Even "North By Northwest" has its serious spots, but "The Lady Vanishes" features a tense fight in a baggage car that's right out of Abbott &amp; Costello and a climactic shootout that pauses for jokes between Caldicott and Charters, the cricket-mad pair who are a non-stop font of humor.Margaret Lockwood is an effective plot vehicle as doughty Iris, who refuses to believe a knock on the head made her imagine the presence of the title character, Miss Froy. Michael Redgrave (Vanessa's pop) is a revelation as Gilbert, the folk-music scholar who half-humors, half-believes her strange tale until a stray scrap of trash converts him to her cause. He has a wonderful Errol Flynn-like quality, with his toothbrush mustache and his way with a quip.Speaking of quips, the dialogue in this movie sparkles throughout, as when the barrister tells his mistress "The law, like Caesar's wife, must be above reproach," and she replies "Even when the law just spent six weeks with Caesar's wife?" Or when Iris asks how she was supposed to have replaced Miss Froy's face with that of the sinister Madame Kummer, and Gilbert replies: "Any change would be an improvement."Interesting also for the opening, which ambles on for about 20 minutes before it starts to go anywhere, establishing the characters and the comic tone without offering a whiff of what the mystery might be. The close, too, with villains who seem oddly detached once the story is resolved ('Jolly good luck to them,' Paul Lukas observes enigmatically.) But that's for film scholars to muse over.Hitchcock was never as agreeable a companion as he was here. And few films will put the kind of smile on your face like 'The Lady Vanishes,' no matter how long ago it was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dame Mae Witty gives a memorable performance as the old woman who goes missing. The rest of the cast is great with Margaret Lockwood as the woman she befriends on the train. Sir Michael Redgrave also is wonderful as the obvious love interest of Lockwood. The film is truly filled with Hitchcock's stamp all over it. He takes a simple story and makes us not only intriguing but entertaining as well. They remade the film again in 1978 more than 40 years after this film debuted in British cinema. This classic film should not be mixed up with that one. I enjoyed this film. It had its humorous moments. I think this film is really wonderful to watch without being too much. Nowadays filmmakers can take note by Hitchcock's genius and talent. You do not need grand special effects today to create a memorable film but great actors and decent writing. This film is a great film about a good old fashioned mystery without deterring the audience. This film is good old fashioned movie making at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Early Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lady Vanishes" is early Hitchcock. It was made when he was still finding his feet and style as a filmmaker. It is nevertheless a cracking thriller and a hugely entertaining film. Quite different from a lot of Hitchcock's thriller, the film doesn't throw you in at the deep end at the beginning. Hitchcock takes a good twenty or so minutes setting up the characters before even boarding the train. It seems to me that the plot of the lady vanishing is the McGuffin of the film and the main plot is the relationship between the main characters. It is also in the first twenty minutes when we see the typical Englishness of the piece ? complaining about weather/board and talking cricket. "The Lady Vanishes" was Hitchcock's penultimate British film before leaving for America and it is up there with "The 39 Steps" as one of that era's best.When the film does board the train it turns into thriller/mystery mode and Hitchcock shows an expertise in mystery and tension building worthy of his later, more famous thrillers. The train (as Hitchcock knows all too well) makes a great setting for a thriller. The tight environment, multiple carriages and constant movement allow for mystery, suspense and excitement ? view Hitchcock mix then all up when Redgrave's characters nearly gets mashed by an oncoming train as he attempts to move to another room by the outside.Hitchcock had a great talent when it came to casting his films. He filled his main and supporting characters with likable, charismatic people who were right for the roles. "The Lady Vanishes" is no exception in this regard. Lockwood and Redgrave have fine chemistry between them and create a duo which anchors the film. For a plot like this it would be essential for the main duo to be likable so the audience can follow them through their detective work and they do a great job in creating a likable duo. The snappy repartee between the two is perhaps the film's highlight.The film's editing is excellent. I find that in a lot of film like this the last act tends to drag as I become increasingly restless in wanting to know what the big secret is. "The Lady Vanishes" doesn't fall into this trap and runs very smoothly and doesn't outstay its welcome. The cinematography is also excellent. Although the shots are apparently fairly simple, one should consider the complexity of trying to get these shots done in such a tight enclosure and keep up the appearance that it is happening on a moving train. I haven't read or heard anything from experts about this film so I don't know whether Hitchcock used a real train or a stage with rear projection or something similar. But in the film itself I couldn't see any goofs that would ruin the film's illusion.You won't see this film top many best Hitchcock list because it isn't as "artistically sound" as a lot of his later works, but the film was made in 1938 just as international relations were reaching boiling point and there is certainly some subtext in the film about it. One can look at the scene were a man refuses to fight despite the enemy steadily approaching the train as an attack on the appeasement of the Nazi. Or the cricket chaps concern about their own trivialities and their refusal to get involve in the bigger, more important issue."The Lady Vanishes" is a gripping yarn that is sure to absorb one's attention and excite as much (or even more) as any film made today. It doesn't trade off characters for action. It has an intelligent script with witty dialogue and distinct, memorable characters. The film does have a fair few plot holes like a lot of Hitchcock's thriller, but they don't matter while watching the film as he never gives your breath to think about them. He forces you to move along with the engaging plot. Whether one looks at the film as mere entertainment or as a commentary on the times, it is sure not to disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable and unfocused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some see this movie working on several levels, but I tended to see it as not being able to focus at any level. As to the thriller aspect of the story, I was unable to suspend my level of disbelief to the extent required. As to the comedy aspect, there were some clever lines that made me laugh, but the general level of foolishness seemed to sabotage the other aspects of the film - take the absurd fight in the cargo car for example. The only way the movie worked for me was as a political allegory: there are the two English gentlemen obsessing over the cricket scores and not wanting to get involved with the intrigue (i.e. the impending war), there is the lawyer being more concerned about his reputation than telling the truth (the British legal system being aloof), the pacifist waving his white flag and being gunned down (the naivety of the appeasers), the earnest Margaret Lockwood (the Cassandra who sees the truth but nobody will listen to her), and so on. The political overtones are serious indeed, but they are trivialized by the inanity of the story. The first twenty minutes or so in the hotel were so tedious and stagy that I almost bailed out then, but I persisted to discover some redeeming qualities. Lockwood and Redgrave make a fun couple, Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford play well off of each other, Dame May Witty is a delight, and there is some interesting camera work. But the negatives outweighed the positives for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes (1938)A Hitchcock movie filled with mystery but lacking suspense. Which is quite fine, turning "The Lady Vanishes" into a fun movie with lots of wry jokes and clever twists. You can't take it any more seriously than Hitchcock did, and he famously had fun with his ideas. That's one reason why they are recognizably Hitch.This is a transitional movie for the director in many ways. For one thing it was hugely successful in Britain, and then later in the U.S., and Hitchcock soon moved to Hollywood where his stellar string of successes for over 20 years began. But that said, this is a film filled with provincial humor (that was a joke, in case you are British)--that is, you need to have a feel for British humor, and for the style of joking and making witty remarks (constantly) of the time. It's a hilarious movie. When you aren't laughing you're still tickled.Which is what disappoints some viewers expecting "Psycho" or something. Nope. But you'll recognize the director's hand here, mixing regular people who are misunderstood (if not quite accused of something they didn't do) and who end up having to solve the problem themselves. And so it goes, and they do rather well for a couple of ordinary folk.When I say there is no suspense I mean it, even when there is uncertainty. The biggest twist of the whole plot (not to be mentioned here!) is only kept from the viewer for a short while. Then the actors tell you! Yes, you are let in on the secret, and yet the movie goes on from there. That is--it's not about worrying and trying to figure it out. It's about watching the main characters work together and piece together their way out of a sticky situation. And of course eventually fall in love.You forget sometimes that the key element in nearly every Hitchcock movie is a love story. After all, that's what matters to most of us (or all of us?) day after day, so he zeroes in on that even as the world is threatened by uranium 235 ("Notorious"), a murderer in the apartment complex ("Rear Window"), the ghost of a previous wife ("Rebecca") and so on. (Of these, "Psycho" is an interesting exception.) So watch what is actually a romantic comedy with a dash of international intrigue in the ominous year leading up to WWII, which hasn't happened at the time of filming. Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully absurd comic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is fond of telling the story of one man fighting against staggering odds. The man is often falsely accused as in "The Wrong Man" or "The 39 Steps." Or accidentally enters into a world of horrors that they can't escape as in "The Birds" or "Psycho." And sometimes the lead accidentally becomes part of a large conspiracy in which they are forced to participate as in "North by Northwest" and "The Man Who Knew Too Much." Hithchcock is fond of the reluctant hero or heroine, people who fall into impossibly difficult situations that they did not choose for themselves. In this way his movies, even those that would not be labeled horror films, are like nightmares. The protagonist wants to scream out "this can't be happening," but barely has time to think as the rogue crop duster bears down on him trying to slice him in half. We tend to identify with the Hitchcock hero who is often ordinary--though still very much movie stars--whether they be Cary Grant living at home with his mother or hardworking family man Henry Fonda."The Lady Vanishes" is the other type of Hitchcock film--the type where two would-be lovers throw themselves into intrigue partly out of boredom and partly as a means to romance one another. As in Rear Window where a crippled photographer played by James Stewart and a pining Grace Kelly become voyeurs and then detectives, "Lady" features bride-in-waiting Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) on a journey to meet her fiancée where she begins to tussle and then solve a mystery with arrogant joker and folk musician Gilbert (Michael Redgrave).While on a train journey through the fictional European country of Mandrika, Iris notices that Miss Froy, the kindly old lady who was sharing a compartment with her, doesn't seem to be on the train anymore. Partly out of a need to forestall the doldrums of an unwanted marriage and partly because of the needs of the script, Iris throws herself wholeheartedly into finding the missing Miss Froy. Gilbert, seeing an opening, joins her in a quest. The plot thickens when other passengers claim to have never seen the little old English woman. We are then asked to contemplate whether Iris--who did suffer a blow to the head earlier in the film--might be imagining Miss Froy or whether some sinister conspiracy is actually at work. (A similar question is at the heart of the ludicrous, not very funny, but highly watchable Jodie Foster thriller Flightplan)."Vanishes" while ostensibly a mystery is just as much a comedy. Like Nick and Nora in The Thin Man series, Iris and Gilbert trade bon mots and blows with bad guys while trying to figure out the mystery. The mystery is a device upon which to hang a comedy of manners. Joining Iris and Gilbert in their comic quest are two stoic British gentlemen who are more concerned with returning to England in time to catch a cricket match than with the increasingly bizarre plot going on around them. Their continued stoical perturbation in the face of mystery and violence is a running joke throughout the film. This joke reaches a glorious comic crescendo when the bullets begin to fly in the film's climax.And what a climax it is as the train's British passengers are faced with a showdown at high tea. The nation of Mandrika confronts the English on the train and they, though repeatedly denying Iris's claims and need to take action, find their backs against the wall. Among them is a pacifist who as the action heightens becomes cowardice embodied. It is in this climax that the film becomes unexpectedly political. "The Lady Vanishes" released in 1938 between the two world wars, is a comment on the coming conflict and the necessity of war. British who are not willing to enter the fray are naive or foolish.As they are in other Hithcock films, the women of "Vanishes" are smart, brave, and resourceful. They frequently lead the charge in the film while the men try to keep up. Hitchcock reportedly had testy relationships with his female co-stars, but he frequently provided them with meaty roles. Most movies, even contemporary ones, are likely to relegate female stars to weak supporting roles where they anxiously stand by while male costars do the fighting. But "The Lady Vanishes" turns on the actions of several strong female characters."Vanishes" is above all a comedy and this intentionally or not takes the edge off the suspense. We are pretty sure all will work out in the end because the barb trading leads need to end up together. It could be argued that the film goes off the rails in the final third when the absurd plot drives the film toward a violent, tone shifting climax, but I found it in keeping with the delightful absurdity on display throughout the film.In fact each of the film's three acts have there own unique tone. In the first, the cast is stranded by snow in a small rail-side hotel and each is introduced in short, comic vignettes. In the second, the mystery is afoot. By the third act, the mystery is largely solved, but a violent conflict erupts. The film under the steady hand of Hitchcock successfully fits these disparate pieces together. While not Hitchcock's best, it still is a fun, unique film that will keep you entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock at his most accessible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, quick and easy. This is a classic movie from a classic director. I love Hitchcock and have seen the majority of his movies and this is, in my opinion, one of his most accessible. What I mean to say is that this is a very smart movie, but also not one you have to be a film buff, or even a Hitchcock fan to enjoy. The script is amazing and moves along at a very fast pace. The characters are all extremely unique and the acting is amazing. This is a very fun mystery that is surprisingly funny at times, especially for a film made in the 30s! There are many layers to this, and is a great movie to talk about after viewing it. As you probably know, Hitchcock made a brief cameo in the majority of his movies, and if I'm not mistaken it happened at 1:33.35 in this one. Look for a man walking across the train station with a cigarette in his mouth. There is much more to say about this, but just go watch it and write your own review at how good this movie truly is.

		<fullReview>"Well, anyway, I refuse to be discouraged. Faint heart never found old lady."Ah, this was a great movie! One of Hitch's best, and certainly one of his most entertaining. It was funny, thrilling, and just plain old fun to watch.The story is quite simple. A sweet old lady disappears on a train, and the only person who admits ever seeing her, is a young woman who met her the night before. As she searches for the old lady, she's helped by a roguish young man, and they soon begin to wonder just who this lady is, where she went, and why on earth would so many people go through so much trouble to make it seem like she never existed. It all makes for a very compelling mystery.&nbsp;The Lady Vanishes features some of the best characters I've ever seen in a Hitchcock film. Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave were great as the two main protagonists, and the witty banter between the two was equaled only by the two dry, cricket-obsessed Englishmen who provided so much of the humor of the film. I found this movie to be similar to Rear Window (no wonder I enjoyed it so much), as there are many subplots among the minor characters that are almost as interesting as the main story.&nbsp;I firmly believe that this is the best I've seen of Hitchcock's early movies. It has everything from shootouts to nuns in high heels. The Lady Vanishes will convert you to being a fan of Alfred, if you're somehow (drugs?) not already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes is a perfect entertainment. It is pitch perfect as a thriller with its tongue persistently in its cheek. During the climactic scene wherein the train, in which most of the story takes place, is diverted to a sidetrack and a shootout ensues, we are in suspense yet it gets away with tremendous laughs delivered by a wry and silly sense of humor.Margaret Lockwood is a poised and attractive leading lady, playing an independent young woman returning home from a fictitious pre-WWII Central European country to get married. She's amongst an assorted bunch of traveling characters keen to go back to England. On the train back after being delayed by an avalanche, she befriends a gleeful old lady played by the unmistakable Dame May Witty, while the remaining passengers in the compartment appear not to understand a word of English. When Lockwood reawakens after dozing off because of an incident with a falling flowerpot, Witty has vanished, leaving Lockwood shocked to learn that the other passengers claim the elderly lady was never aboard at all and the other English travelers deny ever seeing her.This stands as one of Hitchcock's finest works, even above some of his more celebrated films. Maintaining ideal timbre between scenes of almost unbearable suspense, particularly in a scene of exceptionally conceived simplicity, and broad humor, one of its most memorable comic moments being the reaction to a gunshot by one of two permanently nonchalant upper-class Englishmen, both of whom are perhaps my favorite characters, reflecting a proud archetype of English persona and poise. Despite the time in which this artwork of entertainment was made, it is timeless, for its datedness has since 1938 grown to be a charm.What makes a success out of a lightweight entertainment like The Lady Vanishes is its director. Many merry comic adventures have been difficult to watch again in spite of decent writing, star power and presence, and other pleasing mainstream qualities. The reason numerous become less than high-quality is because a director like Alfred Hitchcock is not only an exceptional visionary but also very hard to come by. There are even lots of directors whose work I hold very dear who perhaps would have made a lesser film. Hitchcock was a master of truly fulfilling cinematic entertainment. He very rarely made a film with any particular intention other than to entertain. That was his skill, his art, his born talent, and he did it better than nearly any other filmmaker to date. His spy stories and murder mysteries, both of which are descriptions that apply to this masterwork, are dense enough, complex enough and not too categorizable per genre so that a film that in other hands would most likely have been a much too lighthearted spy romp is a taut, perfectly English-flavored silver screen tour de force.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Master Shows His Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "The Lady vanishes" is not as polished as Alfred Hitchcock's later brilliant works, it remains a very good suspense story. At the film's beginning we see a town model ? very nice, but just a model ? of a snowy village in a fictional country somewhere in Eastern Europe. I still opt for Austria: the uniforms we later see certainly appear like Austro-Hungarian military uniforms of World War I even though that war is long past. Anyway, inclement weather has forced train passengers into a hotel run by a harried manager. Many are stranded English citizens eager to return home for a variety of reasons. We are introduced to Caldicott and Charters (Naunton Wayne, Basil Radford), two buffoonish Englishmen whose main interest is leaving the "wretched" country to return in time for the Test Match (cricket). As the game is their only concern, nothing else is of interest. Caldicott and Charters are quite the superficial characters, and they will be with us with their dry humor throughout the movie. They are lucky to get a room in the overcrowded hotel, but it is the maid Anna's room. She still needs to change there, and she no qualms of undressing with the two men present. Caldicott and Charters have no choice but to share a bed and pajamas. Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), an attractive but bratty socialite, is on a ski holiday with her two friends; it is her last bachelorette fling before her loveless wedding in the upcoming week. What else can she do as she feels she has done everything that she wants? Money talks, and the three young women get a nice room. Eric and Margaret Todhunter are traveling incognito; they are not married but on a tryst, cheating on their spouses. Of course Eric had told Margaret that he would divorce his wife to marry her; of course he has no intention of doing so. He values his judgeship more, that is, if he can get the position. Miss Froy (Dame May Witty), an elderly and kindly old English governess dressed in a tweed outfit, is the key personality. At a dinner table she tells Caldicott and Charters that she loves the nation that they are in, for it is a musical country. There are other persons of interest on the train, including Signor and Signora Doppo. Mr. Doppo has a dopey smile; as a circus performer he has an act called "The Vanishing Lady." In the evening the three gals are unable to sleep because the people in the room above are dancing to a clarinet. The main character in the upstairs room is raffish music scholar Gilbert (Michael Redgrave). Because these people do not stop their rumpus, the manager removes Gilbert; later he retrieves his room. Miss Froy is on her hotel room balcony listening to a street singer below, when the latter is strangled. She does not notice, but hums the tune that he was humming. The next morning all of the folks are jam-packed together waiting for the train, getting ready to leave. While Froy is bending down to get her luggage a flower-box from a second floor window, apparently aimed for her, misses and strikes Iris on the head instead, dazing her. She still manages to get on the train and wave goodbye to her two girlfriends. Before long, Iris, still lightheaded, has tea with Froy. She does not get Froy's name clearly because of surrounding noise, so Froy spells it out on the passenger car window condensation. Iris soon passes out, and when she awakens cannot locate Froy. She questions the train passengers and train stewards, but none seem to recall Froy at all. The lady has indeed vanished. Actually Caldicott and Charters certainly remember her, as they had sat together at the same dining table the previous night. But as the men want no possible interruption of a train search that will interfere with their precious cricket match back home, they feign ignorance. Eric Todhunter, too, has lied because he wants to avoid any attention to his affair with Margaret.On the train is Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas), a suspicious brain surgeon from Czechoslovakia. Although he seems willing to help to find Miss Froy, it is obvious that he is actually doing the opposite. And he says that Iris, because of her slight concussion, may not be thinking clearly. "There is no Miss Froy, there never was a Miss Froy. Merely a very subjective image." Meanwhile, at the next train stop, a heavily bandaged patient on a stretcher is let aboard. Dr. Hartz says that he will operate on him at a hospital at the next train stop. Now a nun assists the patient. Iris becomes suspicious as she wears high heels. But the only one willing to help is Gilbert, who had earlier repulsed her with his hotel shenanigans. But Iris has nowhere else to turn. As our two heroes investigate, they become friendly with each other. They eventually discover that not only is Miss Froy aboard, but also is in danger. Will Iris remember Froy's name on the car window? Maybe Froy is indeed the patient on the stretcher! Here the situation, directed by the movie master, really begins to build tension. There are neat clues. The pace quickens. Note how the main characters react when they realize that they are in the middle of a menace. Is Doppo involved? The pseudo-nun? A German, Madame Kummer, malevolently looking in tweed, who appeared unexpectedly? Dr. Hartz? No spoilers will be given here, but there will be a train diversion and an exciting shootout. Caldicott and Charters may have a use after all.Alfred Hitchcock, in all of his quick-wittedness, has poised himself to begin making some of the greatest movies in world cinema history in the upcoming decades. By the way, near the end at the train station was the master himself with a cigarette in his mouth and a tiny lunch box in his left hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange ways on a train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful, lively Hitchcock light romantic thriller, with touches of sexiness and eve-of- war topicality as the cherries on topAlmost as if to stretch his capabilities, Hitchcock here confines the action almost exclusively on board a train, (a few years later, he would take this to a sort of logical extreme in Hollywood with "Lifeboat") making it the opposite of his earlier on-the-run movie "The 39 Steps". That said the first 25 minutes of situation and character-setting are of the light comedy variety and include some cheeky scenes of the leggy Margaret Lockwood and her for the time fairly scantily clad two girl-friends, culminating in the introduction of the key Michael Redgrave and Dame Mae Witty characters before the adventure really begins.Yes, it's easy to knock some of the model and process shots employed and the continuity goes a bit wonky at times but with pacey direction and sharp, witty and again occasionally slightly risqué dialogue by the celebrated Launders and Gilliatt team, it never comes off track from there to the end. There's a subtle attack too, on British government pacifist appeasement policy which now looks prescient with hindsight.It's beautifully acted especially by Lockwood, Redgrave and Witty and features some typically adroit Hitchcockian flourishes, like the closeup of the "drugged" drinks and the multi-image collage scene demonstrating Lockwood's concussion and with an exciting finish highlighting the stiff British upper lip at its best, this is classic escapist entertainment and is rightly considered one of the best adventure films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitch's mystery about an elderly lady who vanishes on a train, and the cover up that mystifies a young woman, is a well done tale of old British charm.The film is more about British characters, and how they deal with an emergency, than a mystery.The obvious love interest is well done. The young man is no more annoying than usual. Indeed, a young man who isn't annoying is one who should be suspected of worse.The atmosphere for the film is one of the stuffy British men in bow ties in a foreign country. First, in a small inn. Second, in a train.This film shows us that the word "dated" is one used by those jealous of well done stories, because this is "story telling". It moves at a great pace, and never flounders. No dull moments. Something that modern movie directors could learn from. Possibly because we're given the story, without trying to sell fifty products for financial backers in each scene. It's simple and elegant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Overlooked Gems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While traveling in continental Europe, a rich young playgirl realizes that an elderly lady seems to have disappeared from the train.How to classify this film? Some consider it among Hitchcock's best. And perhaps it is. But I think it is not that simple. He entered the production part of the way through, so should we give him less credit than for other films where he was on board from day one? Maybe, maybe not. It was also his last film in England (his "farewell" film), so should we compare his English period to his American period, or put them all together? Mostly these are silly questions. The film stands on its own merits -- a great story, well executed, with more humor than your standard Hitchcock. The introduction of Caldicott and Charters is a great touch, and this pair have gone on to make other films (though, to my knowledge, probably not ones that are in continuity with this).I love the way certain scenes are shot (such as the death of the musician), and I love the mystery and intrigue of a spy/detective plot. While I would not rank this in the "top tier" of Hitchcock's work ("Strangers on a Train" and "Rope" would fill that niche), it is still better than most of the other options out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rescuing a kindly governess has complications</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes is a hugely entertaining spy story from the early years of British cinema with a lot of the skillful touches we expect to find in a Hitchcock film - comedy, romance, eccentric characters and a thrilling train ride. The two leading actors are Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave. Lockwood, as Iris Henderson, is the spunky and determined friend of an affable governess and as it turns out, a secret agent, known as Miss Froy, who suddenly vanishes from a train as it travels through the Alps. Played by Dame May Witty, the governess becomes an unlikely pawn in an espionage game. Michael Redgrave, in one of his funniest roles, is a musicologist known as Gilbert with a love of folklore. He runs afoul of Iris early in the movie but Iris's beauty and her devotion to her older friend win him over. The two of them become allies as they try to foil a trainload of accomplices in the crime against Miss Froy. We see some great shots from the window of the train as it chugs through the Alps. There is some wicked humour in the film-making, such as the rabbits peeking out of a magician's hat to view one amusing altercation. Then there is the mute nun who accompanies a patient on board the train. It turns out she is an English woman with a cockney accent and not lost for words. The two sporting enthusiasts who want to get home at all costs to take in a cricket match are amusing, if a bit ridiculous, but prove useful in the critical moments at the end. All in all, a fine movie and a must-see for Hitchcock admirers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the very least, Alfred Hitchcock's "The Lady Vanishes" should be of interest to film buffs as a look at the Master of Suspense's early work. But I derive even more. The movie's different aspects look to me like some of the things that he would use in later films. Obviously, the idea of a train setting later came about in "Strangers on a Train". But even beyond that, Iris Henderson's (Margaret Lockwood) desperation at her inability to prove what she wants to show people, that mirrors what happens to Charlie (Teresa Wright) in Hitch's "Shadow of a Doubt" five years later. Furthermore, the first few minutes - or maybe even more than a few - make the movie look like a romantic comedy before the real, much grimmer plot comes out; AH later did this in "The Birds".These are most of what I noticed, but even without these concepts throughout the movie, one can't deny that Hitchcock was showing the clever tricks that he would incorporate into his works once he moved to this side of the pond. I definitely recommend it.Also starring Michael Redgrave and Dame May Witty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey into a vanished world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the occasional setback each succeeding film Alfred Hitchcock made until the last couple seemed to get better in all departments, but especially technically. This was one of his quintessentially British films primitively but cheerfully made for 1930's British audiences to be seen and enjoyed the once, the entire industry still being on an improving curve. It's not likely cricket will ever be truly understood by the wider American audience but it was the film which proved to be Hitchcock's big break, only one more to go before Hollywood and its opportunities and coffers beckoned.Young woman Margaret Lockwood on her way to be married befriends an elderly lady Miss Froy on a European train. The only trouble is after waking up she finds Miss Froy has vanished apparently along with the very memory of her existence; everyone is seemingly against her. However, dashing young Michael Redgrave gets interested and lends his exuberant support in trying to get to the bottom of the mystery. It's completely disarmingly quaint and I've always forgiven the convoluted childishness of the plot: Lockwood &amp; Redgrave are up against some more Johnny Foreigner's who will Stop At Nothing ? except to kill them to shut them up and push them off the train and so end their problems; the greasy baddie must have awkwardly slid out of the trick cabinet silently behind them and could've polished them off and so end his problems; let's all get off the stationary train have a desultory gun battle from the woods to give the goodies a chance to get away and so end their problems. The model shots are indeed laughable, but perhaps more so by the same people who are in open-jawed admiration of todays reliance on incessant cgi cartoonery. Recognising these points and others has never lessened the entertainment value of this little movie for me, I gladly bought a ticket too to see this journey through to the end. Hitch quite rightly continually satirised British politicians' intelligence and integrity, and presciently has the only philandering appeaser on board shot dead. His usual voyeuristic attitude in the depiction of women was present, although on a side note I wonder even for 1938 did he seriously believe in Charters' statement "People don't go around tying up nuns".Is it never considered why Redgrave and Lockwood would behave so childishly and so dense? Could it be because they merely more closely represented the ordinary person, untrammelled with the cynicism and seediness so beloved by all of us nowadays. There are still millions of such people walking the streets, it's just that they're not represented as worthy of any interest any more by our artistic Betters. Hitch was always good at that ? remember the detective's kindergarten-type end speech in Shadow Of A Doubt for instance.Many members of the cast would go on to make many items worthy and arty, but the chances are they'll all be ultimately remembered mainly for this fast moving but perfectly paced inconsequential entertainment. Still incredible that this was so enjoyable and the 1979 remake was so dire ? neither was meant to be watched twice or generations later, Hitchcock's will be though. And like Miss Froy I too do hope and pray that we shall all meet again, one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime early Hitchcock film, could well be the best of his British-period films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course that summary is very subjective, but I do think The Lady Vanishes is the best of his British-period films. Don't get me wrong, the 39 Steps was also extremely good, but this was better. The Lady Vanishes was in short sublime, it starts off quite lightweight, and then the tone shifts to nail-biting and even more engaging. Of course it is a comedy thriller, and works as well as one. The cinematography is crisp and efficient, the script is pretty much outstanding and the direction from Hitchcock complete with his fashioned touches and nail-biting suspense is superb. The story is relatively simple, but really works well and is well developed helped by the fact it moves very quickly. And of course the acting is first class, with Michael Redgrave charming and charismatic and Margaret Lockwood alluring and sympathetic. Then we have a deliciously dotty Dame May Witty, fine turns from Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne as cricket-mad Charters and Caldicott and Paul Lukas great as Dr Hartz. Also the atmosphere of impending war gave this film so much power. Overall, it mayn't be Hitchcock's very best or most memorable, but it is still a wonderful, sublime, well constructed and intriguing comedy thriller. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely underrated Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "The Lady Vanishes" may not have the trademark Hitchcock look of some of the Master's later films, it is still terrific. On a train from continental Europe to Britain, Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) discovers that her friend Ms. Froy (Dame May Witty) has disappeared. She joins with musician Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) to attempt to find the woman, and in the process becomes involved in a plot involving spies and foreign intrigue. Although the end is a bit far-fetched, there are still a number of memorable scenes. Of course Charters and Caldicott are two of the funniest characters you will find anywhere (I still crack up when Charters smugly says "A thing like cricket", even though I've seen it half a dozen times), but the others are all interesting to watch. One skill of Hitch's that always goes under the radar is his affinity for simply letting the characters interact in an environment. Even though we know him best for the suspense scenes, like the shootout between the Brits on board the train and enemy soldiers outside, Hitch proves in "The Lady Vanishes" that he is far more than simply a director of action. This film is truly a must see. After "Vertigo", "Rear Window", and "Psycho" it's his best, and being the fourth best film made by a guy who turned out two dozen of the best of all time isn't anything to feel bad about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nuns Don't Wear High Heels!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a perfect film in every way, still just as magical and entertaining an experience as it was in November 1938, when it was released to great success on both sides of the Atlantic, becoming the biggest hit film ever produced in Britain up to that time. This movie has it all - action, adventure, romance, comedy, suspense, witty dialogue, terrific acting, and a great plot. Set in the fictional Central European country of "Bandrika" ("One of Europe's few undiscovered corners"), THE LADY VANISHES details the trials and tribulations of one Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), a world-weary sophisticate ("I've had caviar at Cannes and played baccarat at Biarritz. What else is left for me but...marriage.") on her way home to an aristocratic fiancée about whom she seems unenthusiastic at best. On her last night in her Alpine hotel, she meets two people who will change her life: a charming middle-aged spinster who calls herself Miss Froy, and an impoverished musicologist with a sarcastic mouth named Gilbert (Michael Redgrave in the role which made him an international star &amp; you will see why!), whose company she immediately finds less-than-delightful - although she will change her tune soon enough...On the train the following day, Iris renews her acquaintance with Miss Froy during tea, only to awaken from a nap sometime later to be told by everyone around her that there was no Miss Froy. After a totally fruitless attempt to garner support from the other first-class passengers (all of whom have seen Miss Froy and all of whom deny it for different reasons of their own), Iris decides to take up the search herself, running into Gilbert and reluctantly enlisting his help. At first, Gilbert is merely humoring Iris, and he too comes to the conclusion that she is delusional after she pulls the emergency brake in a rage and faints...but then, he stumbles across a bit of evidence which proves to him that Iris is telling the truth and since she is, that there must be something very, very suspicious unfolding on the train. From this point on the movie goes into high-gear, becoming the mother of all action films, chock full of kidnappings, chase scenes, battles-of-wits, shootouts, and last-minute escapes. Don't worry - if it all sounds complicated, it isn't - I just don't want to spoil the many marvelous plot twists! Perhaps not until 1963's THE BIRDS would Hitchcock have as many delightful character roles as he does here, with an Italian spy, an adulterous couple, an imperious Baroness, a sinister psychoanalyst, and a nun with inappropriate footwear all playing their parts in the unfolding adventure. Special mention should go to the team of Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford as Caldecott and Charters - a pair of dimwitted, xenophobic, sports-obsessed English gentlemen whose definition of catastrophe is being unable to learn the scores of the latest cricket matches but who can be trusted to do the right thing in a tight spot. They are delightful comic relief and play these stereotypical roles with such ease and chemistry between them that they themselves were elevated to stardom in the UK and spent the next decade replaying similar characters in a host of other movies, even doing a few films where they took top billing. Looked at from the point of view of today, the film exudes a very peculiar atmosphere - the atmosphere of Europe in 1938, of a world about to end and a terrible time to come - but Hitchcock accomplishes this by indirect means. The terrifying political situation of Europe in 1938 is never referred to directly, except to make a ironic joke. "Bandrika" itself could be any of the countries which were drawn into the Third Reich (the "Bandrikan" language is, for those who are curious, NOT an actual language but a combination of modern Italian, Hungarian, Greek and German filtered through Pig Latin) and in a way it is all of them. But one doesn't watch this movie for a history lesson - THE LADY VANISHES is one of the all-time great pieces of cinematic entertainment, as fresh, witty, exciting and pleasing today as it was 70 years ago. Every time I watch this film to study its construction, I get caught up in the irresistible flow of the story and skip the analysis in favor of a rollicking good time! Perhaps the ultimate tribute to Hitchcock and his team is that they managed to come up with a completely original plot - which has since been reused again and again, most recently in a film set on a plane starring Jodie Foster. Essential viewing! Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding Friends and Allies on a Train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For what turned out to be his last masterpiece in the United Kingdom before leaving for Hollywood, Alfred Hitchcock went back to a familiar theme of someone being innocently caught up in intrigue.The someone here is the beautiful Margaret Lockwood who is being gaslighted while on a train in Eastern Europe. She's made the acquaintance of Dame May Witty who disappears from the moving train and no one but Lockwood remembers she even exists. Lockwood gains a sympathetic if skeptical ally in Michael Redgrave and they search the train for Witty. Of course as it is in Hitchcock films, the train's passengers and crew are not all they seem to be either and in the end the passengers have to fight for their lives.Although Lockwood is a striking dark beauty, not the cool blondes that Hitchcock normally favored, she's a fine Hitchcock heroine. Best in the supporting cast are Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford who seem like a pair of silly English twits whose only concern is getting back for a big cricket match. They actually come through when the chips are down.Viewers should also take note of Cecil Parker who plays a barrister on holiday with his mistress whose main concern is staying uninvolved lest news of a scandal kill a judicial appointment he wants. He is one absolute horse's patoot and his death must have been cheered by film audiences in the theaters.Alfred Hitchcock was about to leave his homeland and the less expensive British film industry for Hollywood and bigger budgets. The Lady Vanishes however is a great example of what can be done even on a skimpy budget by a master craftsman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophisticated and well beyond its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes finds itself as one of Hitchcock's last British films before Hitchcock himself made his way to Hollywood. The underlying theme, or subject of artistic representation of the film is perhaps self-doubt. The entire film is laced with some form of self-doubt on every level. Whether it is Iris who doubts that she ever met Miss Froy, or the nun, who cannot decide which side she is on, or Gilbert who in the end, is unable to remember the secret tune, thus he may have doubted his skills as a musician. This film, the Lady Vanishes is characteristical of Hitchcock, because within its theme, there are at least three things that make this a Hitchcock film.The first is Hitchcock's use of trains, this film not being the first time he has used trains in his picture. Hitchcock also used trains in his film 39 Steps and later in Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, and North by Northwest among many others. Hitchcock loves to use trains, as they appear to symbolize unrest, industrialization, and uncertainty. Yet we can be certain that the events to unfold on any train were to be negative. It is as if the train foreshadows the notion that something `bad' is going to unravel. For those who are familiar with Hitchcock's films, one can look at 39 Steps in which the pursuit of Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) ensues, in Shadow of a Doubt, Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) arrives in town on a train thus foreshadowing that `this is a bad thing'. Even in Strangers on a train, where Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet, this begins the unrest of their two involvements with each other. It is clear that Hitchcock uses the train as means to portray the antagonistic features of the film.The second stereotypical characteristic of this film is the plot itself; the plot against the government, the protagonist Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) and the antagonist, Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas), in which a common person discovers and foils a plot against the government. It is often stereotypical that this protagonist also takes on a counterpart of opposite sex. All these characteristics can also be seen in such film as the 39 Steps in which Richard Hannay gets involved in a plot against the government, and North by Northwest, in which Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) too gets unsuspectedly involved in a plot against the government. Hitchcock loves the use of spies and secret agents, as used in many of his films, but more than that, he loves to build relationships under extreme circumstances with complete strangers.Strangers who fall in love are very typical of Hitchcock. His women always sophisticated and beyond their time. Even Margaret Lockwood can compare to women of our time. In Lady Vanishes, the short relationship between Iris and Gilbert becomes more important than her previous relationship with her fiancé. In many of Hitchcock's films, the woman or man strays away from their original partner. Like Alice White (Anny Ondra) chooses the artist over the Detective, and John Ferguson (James Stewart) falls in love with Madeleine (Kim Novak) over Midge in Vertigo, Mrs. Verloc (Sylvia Sidney) falls for the young detective Ted Spencer (John Loder) while straying away from her husband Mr. Karl Anton Verloc (Oskar Homolka). All of Hitchcock's films seem to have this sub plot, where lovers meet and fall in love. When Gilbert begins humming the Wedding march rather than the secret code, this could perhaps be some foreshadowing of things to come. Hitchcock's love for women is perhaps why every starring actress in his films are refined and beyond their time.One of the styles that Hitchcock used to portray different feeling throughout the film was his lighting. For example, Hitchcock always used a darker lighting tone when he was portraying Dr. Hartz. This contrast of light and dark typifies the contrast between good and evil.The entire film is laced in humor, from the two gentlemen concerned about cricket, to Gilbert, an amusing counterpart.This film is beyond its time, in both its characters and its style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Comedy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Hitchcock, and the 39 Steps is possibly my favourite of his films. I'd heard that this was similar, and I've been waiting for the DVD release for years. Eventually, a British newspaper gave away a copy of the film as part of a series of classic movies, so I finally got to see it tonight.It was very disappointing. On the plus side, Redgrave and Lockwood are great actors and keep this watchable. On the down side, the comedy-thriller balance is tiled well towards the comedy. I haven't seen another film in which Hitchcock played it for laughs to this extent.The 39 Steps is from the same era, but hardly seems dated to me. This does - the plotting is clunky, and seems ludicrous at times.Those who like Hitchcock but find his comic moments camp and unfunny might find that this is not their cup of tea. It resembles a Carry On farce in places.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Fear as subtle entertainment'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*PLOT REVEALED* An utterly worthless foray into English overbearance and haughtiness, this film marks Hitchcock as a worthy propagandist and architect of 'fear as subtle entertainment' in the pre-War 1930's. Working and financed by the ministry of propaganda in London to indoctrinate subordinate English audiences into supporting the rationale for the vilification of Germany, Hitchcock eases the tension by making this a "comedy".Wasting the first half on indulgent emptiness (the scene at an Austrian Hotel where the boring Brits are talking about Cricket and drinking tea), he then goes on to flabbergast us with indecipherable montages that are the most rank and absurd creations, the fight scene in the baggage cart for example.His support for the upper Brit classes is especially drab and tedious, meandering between hero worship and idolatry, not to mention the wooden acting of the actors. The story concerns a "secretive plot" about an old woman who has disappeared from a train traveling in the Austrian Alps, simplistic, innocuous even but Hitchcock wants us to believe that it is a most urgent matter because a fluffy headed ingenue doesn't want to think she imagined it all. Of course, she will be the agent provocateur for exposing a nefarious plot by 'evil men'. Immature plot? Definitely. Banter, insipid and devoid of any vivacity, is exchanged between high brow English snobs in the most elusive way, bordering on reductio ad absurdum and yet they seem to be assured in figuring out what has transpired on the train. This is nourishment for those who can't think very well.The story continues until the stuffy, pretentious, oaf-like English on the train become diverted by bumbling and incompetent foreign agents in one of the most pathetic scenes ever in cinema, the Brits, debating the attack itself for 5 minutes in proper English, sit there in front of open windows, with one gun and hold off 24 well armed foreign agents for 20 minutes. Also in this scene, the 80 year old woman "spy", jumps from the side and runs away into the forest just as easily, how 24 well armed foreign agents could be held from the train itself is a question any reasonable human can debate, or why they were even too stupid to see the old spy jump off. If you can believe in the superiority of British snobs, then you must believe in the idiocy of this whole conniving film.Of course you can guess the ending, the woman falls in love with the English chap who helped her on the train, and England is saved and her glorious social structure remains intact, an utterly absurd film from a director who is a specialist in fear and suspicion during the paranoid 1930's but most audiences will take this as merely a "thriller" instead of understanding its proper origin and purpose in the ideology of propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Suggested Subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to echo consensus points or recap the plot.Behind the shady doings and mysterious characters, I think, lies a political subtext appropriate to the time (1938). War with Nazi Germany is on the horizon while things are heating up all over Europe. Yet in the movie's treatment of its British characters, England appears woefully detached from the menace. Of course, the whimsical Comstock and Charters (Wayne &amp; Radford) characterize this detachment most obviously in their near-comical preoccupation with cricket, a past-time identified with English sports. As a result, the pair pays little attention to the sinister intrigues going on around them. Equally oblivious are the Todhunters (Parker &amp;Travers) absorbed, as they are, in running away from their spouses. For the most part, they remain closed up in their compartment, bickering, as if they're not a part of the larger world of the train. Then too, Todhunter turns out to be something of an unreliable pacifist once the intrigues engulf him. Even our two stalwarts Iris and Gilbert (Lockwood &amp; Redgrave) appear on the frivolous side when first we meet them. He's uncaring that his folk music is annoying other guests of the hotel, while Iris appears an innocent off on a European get-away. At first his attentions to her appear no more than a flirtatious attempt at exchanging humorous barbs, but gradually deepen as the plot thickens.Of course, such isolation from the deadly game posed by the sinister, German-sounding Dr. Hartz (Veidt) eventually compels the Brits to break their self-absorption and engage with the menace that threatens them all. In a sense, the film thus serves as a warning to British audiences of the threat posed by the German build-up on the continent. In short, England remains vulnerable unless its people pay attention to the wider world the train represents.Of course, the subtext as I've suggested is conveyed with typical Hitchcockian style and humor. Then too, the cast is flawless, especially old gal Dame Mae Witty, whose ageing Miss Froy suggests a greater amount of political sophistication than her British compatriots. She's at least old enough to recall the intrigues preceding WWI, which may account for her crucial and rallying role.Anyway, the movie is plenty enjoyable apart from the conjectures I've offered. I don't claim that either Hitch or the writers intended my interpretation. Instead, I suggest it as one way of looking beneath the compelling surface. Nonetheless, no matter how you look at it, the movie still counts as one of Hitch's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling like a Hitchcock film but this has humor that's unlike Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered as one of his best movies, this movie is not as riveting as his other thrillers but still stands on it's own niceties to be called one good ride. Shot mostly on train, you do not know till half an hour into the film what this journey would be. There are people stuck, then they get on train and then the real fun begins. I am very doubtful of the beginning of the movie coz it was very long to bring to us the suspense unlike any of his other films.What is this about, is a Lady who disappears id way just to throw in as a surprise later and then again goes off. Based upon a novel The Wheel Spins, the wheels of train that are shown for symbolism and the wheels do stop for a very obvious ending (coz I did predict it). It's very well acted by all the characters. This was the very first movie I think where Cricket was discussed by 2 Englishmen, I mean the earliest. The sub plots of a couple looking for divorce, of a Doctor and his case, of a Magician all are tuned into the script to make it more engaging. But the whole point of what this Lady does and where she is from and why is she so important are all questions that are so very underplayed. That's the trademark of Hitchcock "don't show the obvious ever, whats the point if you blow up the bomb that would kill the suspense". These acts fare very well for the movie and make it an interesting watch.I had absolutely no knowledge of this and have watched it for the first time and it was a good one, if not a great one. I am very doubtful if I would revisit this. The best part I thought of this film was Sound design that capture the real sound of a moving train in the background and giving s the dialog clear enough (dialog was dubbed of course and the train sound was just added to it).So far so good, a 3/5 for surely a good movie by the master of thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seamless Mystery\Comedy\Romance Blend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: A young lady boards a train along with an old lady that she has just met and after a while realizes that she has mysteriously vanished and that no one seems to remember her.You'll love The Lady Vanishes if: You want a great blend of mystery, romance, comedy and excellent main characters. The movie is not just a "who did it" kind of crime movie, but a lot more. In the typical Hitchcock fashion, you will be constantly with a question mark above your head, trying to connect the dots before the end of the movie, however unlike most Hitchcock movies this is more lighthearted and funny. Honestly I expected some funny quotes but not something SO funny, which was a pleasant surprise. Finally there is an E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T chemistry between the main characters of the movie that made even me, a guy that slightly hates romance in films, (especially of that era), to love the romantic aura that surrounds Lockwood and Redgrave, maybe because it wasn't forced or "fake".You'll hate The Lady Vanishes if: If you want something more action packed, fast paced or if you're looking for a movie of the same genre but a lot more "dark" than this. It's a Hitchcock mystery movie, what did you expect? Rambo??? It takes a bit of time for the main plot to start going in this film? in fact if I wasn't aware of what the movie was all about I would be like "What the hell am I watching???". The Lady Vanishes might be a bit to funny and lighthearted for some so if you are looking something more "noir" and dark themed look elsewhere. A final flow I can find about the movie is that it gives away some things about the plot. Usually Hitchcock makes you suspicious with EVERYBODY in his films, but here you will probably guess who the good\bad guys are pretty soon.FINAL VERDICT: Mystery + Comedy + Romance = Great Movie (7.7/10)[+] Great mystery movie with great plot and execution. Great main cast. Seamless blend of Mystery, Comedy and Romance.[-] Slow paced. Not for people that wanted something "darker". Gives away some clues too soon.Also Check: Clue (1985) ? Murder By Death (1976) - Rear Window (1954) ? The Pink Panther (1963)P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes starts off sort of jumpy, without any real focus. It made me think it would be about something completely different than what it turned out to be about. However, it was done cleverly. The writing is enough to get any viewer hooked, and if anything, I knew what would happen just because I have seen films that have ripped off from this one (like Jodie Foster's Flightplan). However, that did not sop me from enjoying it. The performances were solid, and it was very entertaining. Ultimately, it is a very enjoyable and satisfying film, and nice to finally see some of the Master's early work. Hopefully some of his earlier ones are just as good.</fullReview>

As with other Hitchcock films, the plot is implausible and becomes rather muddled. It's all about the journey, and the journey here features a nice blend of comedy, mystery, romance, and thrills. Lockwood and Redgrave make a charming and attractive couple as they try to solve the mystery while Witty is perfectly cast as the woman who vanishes.

		<shortDescription>A classic from Hitchcock's career in Blighty!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt about it. If I was ever trapped on a train in a politically unstable country and being shot at by foreign agents Margaret Lockwood is just the type of girl I'd like to have with me. Easy on the eye, good in a fight and full of Blighty spirit.The lovely Miss Lockwood is just one of the highlights of this great film. Hitchcock directs with a light touch the rather far-fetched story of Britons banding together when in trouble abroad. It's hard to decide who he wants to appear more foolish - the British, obsessed with cricket and afternoon tea, or the dastardly foreigners, who are just dastardly. The actual story is a spy thriller but thanks to the excellent direction and brilliant acting it becomes the most enjoyable and lighthearted thriller ever. It never veers completely into farce but you are never more than a minute or two from a wisecrack and typically "British stiff up lip" comment in the face of danger.Margaret lights up the screen as the sparky heroine and Michael Redgrave (in his first leading role) is superb as the cocky, smitten hero. The supporting roles are brilliantly played, especially the two cricket fans on a tight schedule (played by Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford, no less!).So give yourself a treat by watching this on a rainy afternoon with a cup of tea and some digestive biscuits!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Feverish and dreamy, funny, suspenseful, inventive and playful?early Hitchcock masterpieces-- The old British amusement cinema was leisurely to an enviable degree?'so excellent and smooth that I'm never thrown out of the piece for a moment'.THE LADY VANISHES, an admirable brisk funny witty thriller, a genuine demonstration of mastery, brio and gusto, oozing with fun and gusto, belongs to a class of movies so little understood nowadays, though perhaps the nicest of all?the '30s British cinema, almost always delightful. Perhaps Hitchcock repudiated some of his '30s outings; perhaps not. The fact is that what some believe to be clumsiness, etc., was merely the dominant note of careless surrealism of the British '30s cinema, a genuine quality unknown to other cinemas?if you ask me to define it in a few traits, I would say?gentle surrealism, wittiness, a relaxed, leisurely approach from which stems the brisk pace, like some especially funny comic books, thoroughly good?natured in their sense of action and fun, gently subtle, freshly original. Executed with special brio by Hitchcock, these thrillers were a British brand?the note of gentle Absurdism and sheer fun. This was my way of stating that I belong with those Hitchcockians who favor his early British career. Whatever the master himself might have lately disowned, we disown nothing. THE LADY VANISHES starts funnily, and also relaxed, by way of a long intro, or prologue, if you so prefer , taking its time to leisurely?but also briskly?introduce a picturesque assortment of characters ?. Then the action becomes straight suspenseful, and some scenes are actually chilling ?. The whole movie has a charming dreamy quality; these early Hitchcock spy thrillers are witty and humorous. The wit, the humor are their bond with his later career, when so many movies will be about death, insanity, failure, dramatic loneliness, inner darkness, anger, violence, betrayal. There are deaths and violence and dead in his '30s spy thrillers?but merely as required elements. As genre, THE LADY VANISHES is a humorous, witty spy thriller, almost a spoof, often chilling though, and made with the peculiarly Hitchcockian loose or leisurely or irregular structure; in fact, Hitchcock always handled in a relaxed way the genre's conventions, his movies' structures have something quite loose and whimsical, as if the master didn't care very much about that.The only thing I liked less about THE LADY VANISHES was its male lead, a very antipathetic one. Hitchcock was especially careful about his actors; his lead here is rather disappointing. But the girl, Margaret Lockwood, is nice; anyway, I confess liking much better the couple from 'The 39 ?'. Otherwise, THE LADY VANISHES is wonderfully inventive and, once started, finely paced; the intro takes more than 20', a strong dose of Ruritanian satire, and a comic counterpoint will accompany the action. Another peculiarity of this flick, if compared to 'The 39 ?', is the larger cast. Action?wise, the whole thing is, of course, witty nonsense, to be tasted on its own terms.THE LADY VANISHES is one of the couple of 'remade '30s Hitchcock movies'?I mean those remade more than 40 yrs later?at the end of the '70s or beginning of '80s?the other being the new 'The 39 ?'; otherwise, Hitchcock himself remade his movies, and there are more recent Hitchcock remakes of later, American movies ?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film begins with the camera sweeping down from the hills to a little village - a model complete with two plastic citizens standing by the railway carriage. Yes, 1930's special effects were primitive, but no doubt in 1938 the idea was so new. It reminds me of that wonderful pan backwards in Gone with the Wind of the aftermath of a battle which just keeps going. Two moments in cinematography which probably significantly contributed to our modern art.The leads in this film are all such strong performances, Margaret Lockwood especially so. The script is not perfect but has so many great moments including some oblique sexual references which are surprising for the era. Hitchcock's direction milks almost every moment for either suspense or humour, both of which he was the master. It's a wonder he never made a "straight" comedy, though the Trouble with Harry goes very close.It is certainly one of Hitchcock's finest, and is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An venerable ancestor of the Action-Comedy genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most casual Hitchcock fans will not watch this film, and for a justifiably good reason: it isn't Psycho. All joking aside, Hitchcock's second to last British film is a successful hybrid film which blends comedy and suspense in a way only a director like Hitchcock could do. While I can't compare it to the 1979 remake nor to other Hitchcock films of the era, I will boldly say that it has aged well and still has a wide audience.Watching The Lady Vanishes is like eating a chocolate, or how a chocolatier might encourage us to eat a chocolate. Both processes occur very slowly, but prove to be highly enjoyable in the Epicurean sense. The film takes about 25 minutes to unfold, and to be honest is rather boring. Hitchcock does, however, pepper it with witty dialog during the dinner and bedroom argument sequences. So, if you can tolerate the first open events, then your reward is one heck of a suspenseful film. When Miss Froy first disappears, Iris has difficulty finding her and accepting that she really has vanished. Hitchcock gives no indication as to where she could have gone, which increases our attention to her plight even more. We have no idea where she is, so we want Iris to find her just so we will feel relieved. This is an incredibly clever way to produce tension. Most films leave little clues as to how the person disappeared or where (s) he might be. When Iris and Gilbert actually start locating clues as to her whereabouts, the film actually becomes even more suspenseful as we still have no idea about where she is. Additionally, we still do not know why Miss Froy was kidnapped at all. The concluding confrontation with the rogues from the fictional country where Miss Froy was spying is a perfect blend of comedy and action. Some of the passengers seem so uncomfortable that watching them shoot invokes the same response when we see someone devour chocolate quickly. In both examples, our expectations of careful restraint of behavior are so completely incorrect that we laugh at how incorrect we are.If I haven't made myself entirely clear, let me plainly say that this is a highly imaginative and entertaining film. It is filled with referential British humor (two passengers are constantly complaining how they will be late for a cricket match) and genuine suspense. I think it's quite contrasting how such a comical film can also induce sophisticated tension. The resolution and explanation of Miss Froy's espionage are tad cheesy, but, from a modern perspective, most films of this era are. While one may not feel as terrified and mystified as he did watching Psycho, he'll still walk away with a warm feeling as if he had tasted the finest of European chocolates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It will take about twenty minutes into this film when you will begin to realize that a crime has been committed on a Trans-European train which was delayed due to bad weather. Once the train starts up there is a socialite named Iris Henderson, (Margaret Lockwood) who meets up with a governess named Miss Froy,( Dame May Witty ) and they both become very friendly with each other. Gilbert Redman, ( Michael Redgrave ) gets involved with Iris Hendersson and they become very friendly with each other. Miss Froy seems to be missing on the train and no one can figure out just where she might have gone. There are many twists and turns in this great Alfred Hitchcock mystery which will be his last film made in England and he will go on to bigger and better film productions. You will enjoy this film and be amazed at the great acting of Michael Redgrave who was just starting out on his great film career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock, But Not His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film more than once and I always enjoy it. I am a fan of Hitchcock and this movie bears many of the Hitchcock marks.However, I must downgrade my rating for The Lady Vanishes because of two factors:1. The use of miniature trains can be acceptable, but I feel that Hitchcock abused the privilege in this film. The miniature scenery that accompanies the trains is so obvious as to be very distracting.2. Difficulties in plot can be glossed over sometimes, but this film contains too many coincidences and weird happenstances. This is annoying when happenings appear to occur merely to serve the plot.Otherwise, The Lady Vanishes is a fine movie with an excellent plot. And Hitchcock's eye for suspense is spot on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock was just warming up with "The Lady Vanishes", but already he was showing his mastery and his sure talent as a formalistic and imaginative storyteller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legendary director Alfred Hitchcock was only thirty-nine years old when he directed "The Lady Vanishes" in 1938 and already, the British formalistic director was beginning to show his mastery and unequivocal talent that would later craft masterpieces such as "Vertigo" (1958), "Rear Window" (1954), and of course, "Psycho" (1960). Contained within "The Lady Vanishes" are many of the recurring themes that Hitchcock would almost routinely use in his later, more famous pictures and this film is almost unsung for it is a landmark movie and yet many classic moviegoers are not familiar with it. But when one does uncover it, it's not only interesting to see Hitchcock at work early in his career, but it's a terrific cinematic experience as well."The Lady Vanishes" stars Margaret Lockwood as a playgirl onboard a train to meet her fiancé since she's "done everything" except for marriage. En route to her wedding, she befriends an elderly woman (Dame May Witty) who then mysterious vanishes and nobody by Lockwood seems to have any recollection of her having been there in the first place. Another passenger played by Michael Redgrave assists her in searching for the vanished woman, trying to work out if what has happened was merely a conspiracy, or something far more terrifying and mysterious?.The interesting thing, for me at least, about "The Lady Vanishes" is that I saw it as sort of a prototype to Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece, "Vertigo", which he made in the United States twenty years afterward. Both films contain similar themes and plot contrivances: deception of the audience as well as the characters, blending the supernatural and the ordinary in the psyche, and a sort of obsession to learn the truth. While the obsessions between this film and "Vertigo" are vastly different, they are both nevertheless engaging. In fact, the whole movie in itself is not only engaging, but absorbing. And this resolves around a very well-crafted screenplay and a truly original mysterious story that grabs you at once and does not leave any loopholes for you to make any major guesses at. The movie leaves open several possible suspects, if there even are any to be, and keeps you juggling on whether the plot revolves around the ordinary being twisted into confusing you, or if it's something supernatural.Hitchcock knew that part of keeping an audience interested was a colorful cast of characters and even in the early areas of his career, he was succeeding. Margaret Lockwood is especially good in the role of the young and pretty girl trying to solve the mystery and Michael Redgrave is just as good as the charming, if enigmatic penniless passenger whose trying to help her out. The film also features Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford, who were like the Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis of their day and they provide some genuinely funny moments as they stumble into and out of predicaments throughout the course of the film. And of course I can't leave out Dame May Witty, who scores just beautifully as the mysterious woman who disappeared on the train.Bottom line, this is a great film. Hitchcock was still fairly early into his career as a director when he made "The Lady Vanishes" and already he was beginning to show his mastery and his perfection that made the movies that people today are more familiar with. If you are a true Alfred Hitchcock fan and you must see all of his landmark projects, this is one you simply cannot pass up on.P.S. Hitchcock was also already making his usual cameo appearance. Keep an eye out for the master of suspense when you delve into "The Lady Vanishes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous British films, and critically loved. There are good reasons why.Set in a fictional Eastern-European country, a train is held up, including a number of Britons. One of them is a English woman, Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman who is going back to England to get married. After an 'accident' when a flower pot falls on Iris she befriends Ms. Froy (Dame May Witty), a middle-aged governess. Ms. Froy offers to look after Iris, even giving her tea and shares a compartment with her. However after Iris falls asleep Ms. Froy has disappeared. The passengers in the compartment tell Iris there was no English woman with her and so do the train staff. Iris is nearly convicted that she imagined Ms. Froy's existence. But one man believes her, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a man she found arrogant but both grow closer. They look for evidence and it soon becomes clear that there is a spy-ring in the works. They need to find Ms. Froy before it is too late.Most of Hitchcock's have a similar plot, an ordinary person thrown into extraordinary circumstances (this time a woman). But Hitchcock is just so damn good at it. The Lady Vanishes even shares some plot elements with The 39 Steps. What Hitchcock does so well is pacing and keeps the mystery going. You have to wait have all the pieces until you know what the whole of the story is. There is fast pacing, keeping the action going, there are even giving us some good action scenes. There are also moment of humour, especially from Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford as Charters and Caldicott. The film also pocks fun as of British characteristics. Within the film is there are a number of colourful characters, and make you care about them, giving them depth and a backstory. There is a good cast, especially the leads who became stars after this film. There are a few plot holes and the ending is hokey, but The Lady Vanishes is an excellent film, especially for Hitchcock's fans. I personally do like Hitchcock's British films.There have been attempts to copy The Lady Vanishes plot. A recent example is Flightplan which is no where need as good as the Lady Vanishes. Leave Hitchcock films to Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A train is delayed during it's journey through the night in a small country in the Balkans, where high society girl Iris (Margeret Lockwood) gets a bad first impression from inconsiderate musician Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) but also strikes up a friendship with a kindly old lady who she re-boards the train with. But she suffers a bump to the head from a falling plant-holder just before boarding and falls asleep...only to find the old lady missing. She bumps into Gilbert again and he loses the brash manner he first showed to help her look for her friend. Her disappearance becomes the subject of a tense race against time to find her, as a number of suspicious people, including a wearisome doctor (Paul Lukas), a pacifistic couple (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) and two reserved English gentlemen (Naunton Wayne and Basil Redford) come before them. Is the fall on her head causing her to imagine things...or is there a much more sinister conspiracy going on? No less than 70 years after it first came out, suspense legend Alfred Hitchcock's last film before re-locating to LA has enjoyed a small re-release. Judging by it's position in the IMDb Top 250, it's one of his better liked ones anyway, one that didn't leave his army of English fans on a bad note.I don't think I've ever seen any of his other films, to be honest, despite him being renowned as one of (if not the) greatest suspense maker in film history. Or maybe this is too bland a description. Hitchcock, it would appear (it's ancient history to me), brought a style and approach to this genre that was all his own, that set him apart from anyone else. His unique style of crafting a mystery, setting it up, using clever devices to move it along and introducing us to characters who are also vital to keeping the boat floating. The clever device used here is the bump on the girl's head that, as we are caught up in the mystery of finding the old lady, does keep swirling about in our minds, making us think it may just be delirium making her think all this. And the characters on board the train she crosses in her quest to solve the mystery certainly make up the vital characters. This shows how effective thrillers could be in the old days, in a time when no sex, bad language or violence were allowed on screen, where people talked a peculiar language (to us) and had different mannerisms to what we're used to seeing. This was certainly a master at work, and he headed across the pond leaving his fans with something they'd never forget him by. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A thing like this might cause a war"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes was a crucial picture in Alfred Hitchcock's cannon. It represents the pinnacle of his British espionage adventures which he had been perfecting since 1932's Number Seventeen, and arguably the best of all his British pictures. It is also the beginning in a cycle of wartime propaganda films which Hitch would continue into his Hollywood career.One of several things that makes The Lady Vanishes stand out is its opening. It begins with a good twenty minutes or so of introductory scenes at the station hotel ? quite a significant amount for a 100 minute film ? which are mainly for comedy and characterisation, and are almost superfluous as far as the real plot goes. What's more, these scenes concentrate far more on the supporting characters ? particularly the brilliant creations Caldicott and Charters ? than the protagonists. For all the audience knows at this point, this might as well be a comedy about Brits on holiday. Normally, an introduction of this length would become boring and be disastrous for the pacing of a thriller, but it's anything but. The comedy in these scenes is brilliant, far funnier than in any other Hitchcock film I know. The characters and set pieces created here are just so purely entertaining, it's actually ironically one of the most engrossing parts of the film.Hitchcock by now had a formula for these adventure thrillers. Margaret Lockwood is not exactly the "Wrong Man" (or wrong woman) that would generally lead these pictures, but all the devices are the same. Chance has embroiled her in criminal goings on she has nothing to do with, she is desperately trying to prove a secret only she knows, but just like the "Wrong Man" trying to prove his innocence, all the evidence points against her.This is also one of the earlier examples of a Hitchcock thriller where the bulk of the action takes place in one location. True, the train is not as small as the apartments of Rope (1948) or Rear Window (1954), or the titular vessel of Lifeboat (1944), but Hitchcock clearly recognises that the best suspense comes from the simplest elements, and that there is a greater sense of danger in a confined space. The train setting itself is also a source of plenty of little devices ? the screeching whistles and thundering wheels which build the feeling of confusion and mystery, not to mention the most heart-racing moment when Michael Redgrave clambers along the outside of the train.Even though The Lady Vanishes was released a year before the war began there is a fairly clear subtext about an expectation of war in Europe. Hitchcock's espionage pictures were always paradoxically about political intrigue and completely apolitical at the same time. Although there might be talk of foreign spies and nations pitted against one another, there was never any genuine politics or explanation of what either side stood for. Still, the mysterious fictional Eastern European dictatorship in which the action takes place is obviously a nod towards Hitler's Germany ? much like the also fictional Borduria in the Tintin story King Ottakar's Sceptre, which appeared at around the same time.The propaganda angle becomes most apparent in the final act, where the dining carriage of all things becomes a metaphor for England ? isolated and forced to defend itself. Although he was usually more concerned with suspense, for these purposes Hitchcock proved he was adept at stirring the audiences emotions, and this is surely one of the most rousing "get ready" films of the era. The point is hammered home most firmly when one of the British passengers refuses to fight. As Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) tells him "Pacifist eh? Won't work old boy. Early Christians tried it and got thrown to the lions!" Despite being very much a film of its time, The Lady Vanishes still holds up today as a great suspense adventure, not to mention a great comedy. It has so many great elements, the dialogue, the direction, as well as great acting performances all round. It's also the end of an era. Hitchcock's films would rarely be quite so expressionist and flamboyant when he moved to Hollywood the following year. While he would make some great murder thrillers in the US, in my opinion as far as his espionage/adventuresome thrillers go he never quite surpassed The Lady Vanishes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... so far.I have to say that The Lady Vanishes made me "get" Hitchcock - its not exactly about suspense, as it is about comedy. Admittedly Lady Vanishes is more of a comedy than his other works (its much more fun than Trouble with Harry which tries too hard to be funny - this one i find much more natural), and so i often miss that aspect when i see other Hitch.My only problem is its total lack of music - the only theme plays during the opening and closing credits - its a bit like a stage play in that respect (though nothing like the staginess of every opening conversational scene in Hitch's American work - always two characters being very stationary in one room and having overly scripted conversations - Vertigo is a prime example).This, to me, is vintage Hitch. Because he was much younger, hardly famous at all, and British - he was a much pleasanter filmmaker, i find.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The themes of espionage and a missing person in The Lady Vanishes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1938, as The Lady Vanishes was released, Alfred Hitchcock's career in Britain was coming to an end. The release of Jamaica Inn the following year marked the end of the British period of Hitchcock's work. Similar to all of Hitchcock's films, The Lady Vanishes has an implicit and recurring topic of discussion, known as the theme of the film. The most well defined theme in the film is the story of espionage, or political intrigue. This theme is apparent in various other Hitchcock films, including The 39 Steps, Sabotage, and North by Northwest. The politics surrounding the international conflict of the plot are quite vague in all of these films. Throughout The Lady Vanishes, Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), while vacationing in Austria, is trying to locate an elderly lady she met at the inn where they had both stayed the night before. At the inn, Iris befriended the elderly woman, Lady Froy (Dame May Whitty), and continued their friendship on the train that they shared. The theme of espionage is detailed in the sincerity with which Miss Froy relays the secret message (carried in the code of a folk tune) to Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), the only passenger on the train to believe Iris' story of a missing woman. Additionally, the theme of espionage is portrayed in the dangerous gunfight that takes place once the train is stopped. The ferociousness of the fighting informs the audience of the severity of the international struggle taking place. The friendship turns to mystery when Iris awakes from a nap and finds that Lady Froy has disappeared. Iris begins to doubt herself about ever meeting Miss Froy, as all of the passengers on the train insist that they saw no one. All of the passengers except one perpetuate the mystery. Gilbert, a young musician that had met Iris the night before, believes that Miss Froy was on the train and agrees to help Iris search for her. Additionally, the theme of a missing person is apparent in the film. As in North by Northwest, the lead character is in search of a person that may not exist. In North by Northwest the audience is well aware that George Kaplan is not a real person. However, in The Lady Vanishes, the audience is just as doubting of the existence of Miss Froy as is Iris. This theme carries on throughout the entire film and as the mystery unravels itself, the audience, Iris, and Gilbert begin to figure out what has happened. These themes are especially apparent in a number of scenes. The first is when Iris awakens from her nap and sees a woman dressed just like Miss Froy, but is definitely not the missing woman. This scene initiates the mystery of the film and the doubts that Iris has about her own memory. The second scene is when Iris goes to show Gilbert the word `Froy' that Miss Froy had written on the dust of the window in the dining cart. The writing disappears just as Gilbert takes a look, further questioning the reality of Iris' perceptions. There are two specific film techniques that add to the overall film. The first technique is the motif of music throughout the film. Music plays an important role in the theme of the film. Miss Froy was a music teacher and Gilbert was a music student. Additionally, the coveted international secret was disguised in the form of a folk song. As previously stated, the scene when the secret (in the form of a tune) is passed to Gilbert displays the motif of music and its importance to the overall theme. Another film technique is seen in the opening camera sequence. In Psycho and Shadow of a Doubt, the film opens to a pan shot from a broad focus down to a specific object. In The Lady Vanishes, the opening shot pans across an Austrian village, finally narrows in on the interior of the hotel. This technique is not as implicitly important to the theme of the film as the music motif, but it does give an opening introduction to the location of the film. The obviously Alpine location paired with the English language of the characters shows that the film is taking on an international affair. The themes of The Lady Vanishes (international espionage and a missing person) are displayed repeatedly throughout the movie. The motif of music and the initial pan shot of the surroundings add to the audience's perception of the themes as they are developed. Rightfully so, this film remains one of Hitchcock's greatest films from his British period, and perhaps one of the greatest films of his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoilers--nothing but spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is almost impossible to write about such a classic film and not give spoilers. But, as with many Hitchcock films, this film gives joy each time one watches it. So, spoilers are really not spoilers at all.No other director except for Hitchcock could mix such a delightful and insightful blend of romance, intrigue, and--yes--political statement into one film. For this film, made in 1938, on the eve of World War II is perhaps Hitchcock's most political of films, although he often would return to the terrain of the political thriller. In a country not unlike Nazi Germany, while on a train, an elderly English lady vanishes, and all of the remaining English passengers on the train must take a stand against the growing (fascist) threat.We are introduced at first to the young couple--Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave--who, like so many Hitchcock couples, are initially at odds with one another. They are a mismatch. She is a beautiful, well-bred young woman who has seen the world and now feel it is time to marry for no other reason than she has seen the world and it is time to marry. He is a vagabond musicologist, travelling throughout Europe, recording folk dances for a book he plans to write in three or four years. The ravishing and dark-haired Margaret Lockwood is a relief--at least for me--from Hitchcock's preference for icy blondes, and she is anything but icy, being the prime instigator for the search for the missing Miss Froy. She has to get a bemused Michael Redgrave to believe that she is telling the truth, since he has not seen Miss Froy, and when he finally, through a tell-tale teapacket, comes to believe her, it is practically the erotic culmination of the film. It is a sexual reversal from his earlier political thriller, "The 39 Steps," where Robert Donat has to convince a disbelieving and, indeed, icy Madeleine Carroll that he is not a murderer. There, an overheard conversation, plays the role of the "tell-tale teapacket," which causes Carroll to "melt" and believe Donat. In Hitchcock films, it is "belief" and the (sexual) relief that belief brings that so often bind the couple together.The other English passengers, as I noted earlier, represent a cross-section of the English public's view at the time to the coming war. None want it (the war; i.e., involvement in the disappearance), but their reasons for their refusal to become involve range from the childish to the venal. Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford represent the former; two mad cricketeers who don't want to see ANYTHING delay their return to England for the finals of the cricket match. So delightfullly single-minded are they in their pursuit, other filmmakers would go on and have them repeat variations of these characters in several later English films. However, in their pursuit of pleasure, they will lie by omission and not backup the Margaret Lockwood character, when they know full well that she is telling the truth. The venal are represented by "Mr. &amp; Mrs Todhunter," an adulterous couple travelling under assumed names. For fear of jeapordizing a possible judgeship, he won't tell the truth, although he has seen Miss Froy. "Mrs. Todhunter" becomes more amenable to telling the truth the more disenchanted she becomes with her spineless lover, who literally dies waving the white flag of truce. As I said, this is Hitchcock's most overtly political film.As I said, this film can be watched again and again, even when you know what's going to happen. Tonight, I realized the foreshadowing of the only good scene in "Torn Curtain," where Paul Newman and a German woman have to kill a man. Hitchcock wanted to show that it wasn't easy to get somebody to die, and, here, although no one dies, Lockwood and Redgrave show that it isn't easy to knock someone out--the duplicitious Signor Doppo--either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(86%) The opening scenes set in an alpine hotel are like the lines on an old man's face. They really do highlight how old this film is. Not to say that they are bad, they are just of a time long gone. But once this gets going it's as thrilling as any well made modern production of the past twenty- five or so years. As like most Hitchcock movies the female lead character is painfully pretty; but the tone here is a touch lighter than most, which if anything works better than it it had overly serious one. The exciting and well handled shoot-out action towards the end is not something you get too often in movies of this age; and really if it's a classic entertaining mystery flick you're after then this is pretty much a perfect target.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What else rhymes with "JOY"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lady Vanishes" demonstrated that even with a small budget, a relative unknown cast, and a strong macguffin; that no special effects were needed. Money is not the solve-all for Hollywood. As films are released today, big effects and big budgets, nothing can compete with the power of a strong story. Hitchcock was aware of this, and thus, "The Lady Vanishes" was born. Criterion has included it, with a plethora of special features, in their growing collection, and for me ? it stays as one of my favorite films of all time. Like a jigsaw puzzle, Hitch gives you only small piece by small piece, not even telling you which lady is going to "vanish", and with each viewing ? the suspense grows deeper and stronger. As with most Hitchcock, it is not just about what happens in front of the screen (the introduction of the characters, the scenery, the time), but also what happens behind. It is this discovery which allows future viewings of "The Lady Vanishes" and proves Hitch's cinematic worth.As I sat down to write this review, draft after draft was tossed out because I wasn't sure what to discuss on a film that has been dissected by some of the biggest film critics (Geoffrey O'Brien, Charles Barr, Robin Barr) and discussed by another great film maestro, François Truffaut. What could I say that hadn't been said before (also ranked #235 of the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 Films), so why not pick three scenes and discuss why they impacted my decision to name this one of my top 10 favorites ? a tough list to be on ? especially today. So, here are the three moments in "The Lady Vanishes" that confirmed its honorarium in the Criterion collection as well as the accolades that Hitch has received for this body of work alone.The first scene has to be the brief introduction of our characters in the small inn. Upon first viewing, there was no indication which of the multiple ladies would not be the one "vanishing", nor was there any direct way of knowing how these groups of different individuals would eventually come together on one train. Just sitting there, waiting for the avalanche to be cleared, we see adulterers, comedians, cricketers, wealthy Americans, musicians, and a little old lady who would eventually be at the crux of all this madness. It is this unknown upon first viewing, the sweetness with the second viewing, and the complexity of the third viewing that makes this nearly opening scene one that cannot be shaken from the mind. Hitch presents you with the early "who" of the film, but without that sense of direction, the darkness allows your mind to discover all possibilities, no matter how many times you watch it. Exactly how many were involved with the plot? Who knows, and that my friends, is only half the fun.The second scene that stood out in this film was the cult window scene. Without indulging in spoilers, early in the film the window dirt is used as merely a greeting, and later as a divergence from madness. It is during the scene where the name is revealed a second time that always sends tension through my veins. The word in question is just staring at you within the scene, it evokes the need to scream from your couch to look up, to see what we all see, like Hitch is toying with his audience ? to say that the beautiful Margaret Lockwood's sanity may not be in question. With merely one word, Hitch has created audience involvement, a level of excitement, and tension beyond belief. It is as if he is flaunting it. It is an iconic scene, but also one of those that speaks for itself. This dirty "word" proved that with a small budget (and no special effects) that you could pull your audiences in deeper. I would challenge any modern film to do the same, alas; I don't think they would have the same result.Finally, the remaining scene that makes this film more than just print through a projector is actually not a scene at all, but Hitch's involvement of music into this entire film. Yep, it is a broad (and perhaps cheat) third scene, but from the beginning opening scenes a certain tune is flaunted in front of us as maybe just a mere theme music, but as the film continues we learn it is much, much more. Like the name on the window, the missing woman, the confused passengers, the music has a double meaning. It not only represents the mood of the film, but it also sends another message. What is that? Oh, I'm not telling, but Hitch smartly includes it whenever possible. Listen to the scenes, each one, there is a hint of this music throughout ? almost including you within the overall story. "The Lady Vanishes" is not just a movie to watch, but also one that should be listened to. The score (if it can be called that) carries nearly more meaning than the characters. That, again, is the power of Alfred Hitchcock.If you haven't guessed, I love "The Lady Vanishes" not just because it is a great film, but because it best represents Hitchcock's work. There is something for everyone, young audiences and mature cineophiles alike. The characters, the sound, the visuals all blend together to make a phenomenal cinematic journey. Every detail within "The Lady Vanishes" is important ? and this is a film that should be watched ? again, and again, and again. Impressive.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superb Hitchcock thriller from his pre-Hollywood days.Margaret Lockwood plays Iris Henderson, on her way via train to London to marry a fiancée she's not all that crazy about. She meets a kind old lady named Mrs. Froy (a name I will not ever forget because of the way in which Hitchcock introduces it to the audience), played by Dame May Witty, who disappears seemingly without a trace while Iris is asleep. Iris then enlists the help of Gilbert Redman, a fellow passenger played with a great deal of cheek by Michael Redgrave, one of the only people who believes that Mrs. Froy isn't a figment of Iris's imagination, and the two of them embark upon a search of the train and an interrogation of its passengers to solve the mystery of the lady's disappearance.As this bizarre story plays itself out, the WWII propaganda becomes so thick that you can cut it with a knife. By the end, all of the English passengers have overcome their indifference and/or their desire not to get in involved in a potentially messy situation and have joined the cause. It's a bit heavy handed, but easy to forgive given the time period in which it was released and the fact that Hitch keeps things so damn entertaining.Indeed, one of the things that distinguishes "The Lady Vanishes" is how funny it is. It's a virtual parade of dry one-liners and even some physical comedy thrown into the mix. In addition to Redgrave's veddy English performance, the bulk of the comedy comes from Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford, playing two English chaps whose only concern is getting back to London on time for a cricket match. Their refusal to get ruffled, even in the middle of a climactic shootout, is hilarious, old sport.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic comedic mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lovely and charismatic Margaret Lockwood (Iris) and a young, talented and equally delightful Michael Redgrave (Gilbert) head a great ensemble cast in this witty mystery/farce about a smart, level-headed, young woman (Lockwood) who is apparently the only witness to the disappearance of a middle-aged woman. The mystery story alone - without the excellent humor added by Lockwood and Redgrave's chemistry, the various and somewhat absurd cast of characters, and Gilbert's peculiarities - could have made a nice little film. But Hitchcock went the extra kilometer and gave us a lot to chuckle about along the way, and a little romance for extra seasoning. After we are introduced to some of the characters, the action takes place mostly on an express train speeding across Europe. Gilbert is obviously smitten with Iris, but she is a proper young lady who is engaged, and has recently been concussed by a falling plant pot. Iris is distraught over the disappearance of an older lady she has recently befriended early in the journey. The train has not made a single stop, and her friend is nowhere to be found - a perfect locked door mystery? Maybe.. Or perhaps... as everybody seems to think, young Iris' blow to the head was more severe than originally thought.The two main characters are eventually drawn together because Gilbert is the only person aboard the train who gives Iris' story any credibility - though it is clear that he has an ulterior motive from the beginning. As they investigate the possible mystery, several subplots, a couple of red herrings, and ample comedy unfold.The script is outstanding, all of the performances are fine (and comedic), and the pace is brisk, even for a Brit-com. Another fine piece of directing by Hitchcock, whose versatility in the film medium was rare.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Hitchcock film with sure visual flair and exciting set pieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic espionage Hitchcock film is based on the novel ¨The wheel spins¨ by Ethel White . It concerns about a woman caught in an intriguing thriller and being visually interesting and mostly involving and mysterious . A beautiful girl (Margaret Lockwood , though Vivien Leigh tested for the role that eventually went to Margaret) aboard the transcontinental express awakes from a nap to be aware herself that the elderly woman (a delightful Dame May Witty) seated near to her was abducted . After that , she meets a musician scholar (film debut of Michael Redgrave) eager to help her .The picture contains suspense , romance , tension , unlimited excitement and plenty of plot twits blended with humor . A similar premise is posteriorly repeated in ¨Foreign correspondent¨ (1940) but with a male role , an elderly diplomat with a secret clause . Besides , it has a literately witty dialog (writings credits by Frank Lauder and Sidney Gilliat) with the usual Hitch's characters , as the smart as well as elegant baddie , a brave , valiant woman and typically distinctive touches as a nun (Catherine Lacey film debut ) wearing high heels or the filming on train , the vehicle preferred for the director and usually shot in scale model , maquette and transparency . The set that the movie was shot on was only ninety feet long . Superb performances by main characters (a madcap heroine Margaret Lockwood and a brilliant Michael Redgrave) who develop a ¨screwball¨ relationship , and top-notch acting by supporting roles (particularly May Witty and Paul Lukas , Cecil Parker, Basil Sidney). Hitchcock's first real winner along with ¨39 steps¨ . Filmed in pre-war British time who Hitchcock called adventures period ; later on , he was contracted by David O'Selznick , as he goes to USA to make ¨Rebeca¨ , although his last British film was ¨Jamaica Inn¨ . Rating : Above average , having rave reviews by Orson Welles who reportedly saw this film eleven times and François Truffaut claimed this movie was his favorite Hitchcock and the best representation of Alfred Hitchcock's work . Reworked in 1979 by Anthony Page with Cybill Sheperd and Eliott Gould and Angela Lansbury as as the lady who disappears aboard a Swiss transcontinental express train.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Trifle Whimsical, I Thought ..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A motley mixture of travellers is assembled on a train heading across central Europe. When a little old English spinster goes missing, only one person - the Margaret Lockwood character - has the courage and integrity to protest. It slowly becomes clear that certain elements aboard the train are up to no good ...By the second half of 1938, when this film was starting to hit the world's cinema screens, it was clear to most intelligent observers that a world war was now inevitable. The Western democracies could no longer maintain their policy of kow-towing to the Axis dictators. Up to this point, "appeasement" (the democracies' diplomatic strategy of trying to contain Hitler and Mussolini by giving them whatever they demanded) had seemed a rational, even a noble, attempt to save the world from another global bloodbath. However, as this film was going through post-production, all doubt had evaporated. The dictators would have to be confronted - and that meant force of arms.Nazism/Fascism, so familiar to us now, was then a new and startling form of politics. Axis leaders saw the West's concessions as evidence of weakness, and compromise as a sign of cowardice. A whole string of international crises had been provoked throughout the 1930's, with Hitler and Mussolini brazenly upping the ante each time, knowing instinctively that the gentlemanly appeasers (Chamberlain, Halifax. Henderson, Daladier and even Eden, until the latter wised up) would buckle rather than stomach another European war. The Rhineland, Austrian "Anschluss", Albania and Abyssinia (not to mention Japan's so-called "Manchurian Incident") formed an impressive catalogue of diplomatic triumphs for the Axis and a long, painful retreat for the democracies.With the Czechoslovakian Crisis of March 1938, the corner was turned. Once again, Hitler bullied his way to total victory, but at least this time the scales fell from the eyes of Western onlookers. Hitler, it was finally accepted, would continue his course of unreasonable aggression until he was resisted by force."The Lady Vanishes" is an unwitting chronicle of its own moment in history, suffused with the post-Czechoslovakia mood. The Launder &amp; Gilliat script contains some sly digs at the arch-appeasers of the British Foreign Office, and the whole plot can be seen as a metaphor encapsulating the tense European situation.Michael Redgrave is excellent as the jaunty English hero, very much in the Ronald Coleman mould. He and Margaret Lockwood are thrown together by circumstances and (in the way of many a motion picture) don't hit it off at first. Like Gable and Colbert, they develop romantic feelings as they meet with, and triumph over, adversity. In that sneeringly superior English way, foreigners are portrayed as either sinister or ridiculous. The entire film has a stagebound, Agatha Christie feel to it.If flaws are relatively easy to point out, one has to concede that many of the things which make us wince today would not have troubled a 1938 audience. The Swiss village which constitutes the opening establishing shot is very obviously a model, even down to the car trundling so artificially along one of its streets. When the Prague doctor (echoes of Czechoslovakia again) drops his charming facade and points a revolver at the plucky English couple, why does he feel the need to keep it concealed in his pocket? No-one but our heroes can see what he's doing.The climax, the shoot-out in the forest, is the last word in appeasement metaphors. These grim, joyless blighters in uniform have to be resisted: there's no reasoning with them. Michael Redgrave and Chalmers and Caldecott, the cricket-lovers, are solid English gents, good sorts who are unflappable in a tight spot and don't hesitate to take on the foreign bullies when the chips are down. The whining barrister is the appeaser, wanting to surrender abjectly to the dark uniforms, "doing the sensible thing". It goes without saying that the chaps with a bit of spunk pull through alright, and the barrister-appeaser, with his risibly outdated belief that he can't be hurt because he's a British subject, comes to a sticky end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film...once the wheels start turning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE LADY VANISHES turns out to be pretty good once it gets going, but boy does it take a while to get there. The first half hour is packed with the kind of insubstantial, fluffy light comedy that I normally avoid like the plague. Once you sit through that, it becomes an engaging mystery-cum-thriller with much to recommend it.Hitch was always a master of enclosed spaces, and once the action shifts to on board the train his film really picks up and becomes a classy piece of cinema. The characters are what make this film, bringing what could have been a dry and unemotional scenario to life. Michael Redgrave begins as the most annoying cad ever but becomes a classic leading man by the end, while the comedy double act of the British cricket fans is spot on.Things pick up speed until the climax, which is something else entirely. It's exciting and frenetic and feels very modern in its depiction of a showdown of sorts. This kind of comedy-mystery-thriller is very hard to get right and yet Hitchcock is spot on; it's also a film that feels surprisingly modern, despite deficiencies in the early special effects (some dodgy model shots early on, alongside back projection here and there). For me, this is the second of the director's 1930s classics alongside THE 39 STEPS, and a film that far surpasses the two remakes that have followed in the years since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A briskly enjoyable Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an overcrowded hotel, many travellers await a train to their destination. Among them is Miss Froy - a school mistress, Gilbert Redman ? an artist and Iris Henderson ? a socialite on her way to meet her fiancée. When Iris gets a knock on her head on the train, Miss Froy looks after her. She falls asleep for a while and wakes up to find Miss Froy gone. When she enquires, no one else can remember any such woman being on the train ? did she imagine it or is something more sinister afoot?Well known as the film whose success launched Hitchcock's American career, this film amazingly stands up really well even 65+ years later. The plot is a mix of spy thriller but the simple device that sparks most of the tension is the vanishing of Miss Froy ? not even where or who, but why? The answer to that question plays out really well over the running time and is fun to watch it all fit into place. Although I have seen it many times I still get the tension during Iris' frantic hunts for the woman that she increasingly doubts is real.Added to this mystery plot is a pitch perfect humour and lightness that keeps everything moving along well. The script involves plenty of witty dialogue and the film does have enough of a mix to keep you amused when the plot is starting, or tense when the comic touch is dropped off. Hitchcock directs well ? he uses the train well and manages to get a real sense of being hemmed in as Iris faces lies at every turn.The cast support the script well and are great to a man. Redgrave steals the show of course with his light, witty and dramatic performance. He is a real English hero in the new mould of playboy! Lockwood does very well as her performance really feeds the tension and is the backbone of all the drama. Parker has a small role but does too little while Dame Whitty is a truly believable rural English lady. The villains of the film are lacking in real flamboyance and flair but still have a stony faced menace. Of the support cast I loved the cricket loving duo of Caldicott and Charters (played by Wayne and Radford respectively), their characters were hilarious in themselves and their dialogue was gently mocking.Overall this may be part of the British films that are seen as enabling Hitchcock to go on to bigger and better things, but I must say that I love this film and feel it is one of his most enjoyable pieces. The fact that this film still stands up as both funny and exciting 65 years on is proof of it's quality (especially in these days where excitement is measured in how far special effects have gone since the last blockbuster and comedy measured in the next comic taboo breached).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After rediscovering the rollicking, wonderful 'Thirty Nine Steps' this week, I had lesser hopes for this movies reassessment. I liked it previously but memory left me suspicious that it wasn't very good. It isn't. The plot is tedious and convoluted, and despite assurances that the inert first half hour is great comedy, I'd beg to disagree. All the characters in this movie are assumed to be likable and sympathetic. I found them all to be off-putting class-conscious, Anglo-centric asses.Each of 3 times I've tried to view this, it's put me to sleep. You should probably watch it once, but it's merit is long past. I have always loved Hitchcock but lately his movies leave me wanting more than his chilly technique &amp; absurd Rube Goldberg plots offer. Hitch is clearly trying to capitalize on 'The 39 Steps.' But 'The 39 Steps' is a fleet-footed wonder, and this is flat w/o any tension or charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Hitchcock movie heavy-handed with symbolism and dripping with innuendo...but there's no mystery, because it's all, fantastically, exactly as it seemed! Paranoia is glorified. although we get the sense of paranoia and intrigue, the clutter of characters, events and symbolism belie the absence of a real story. What story there is resembles a Scooby-Doo episode, except they never take off their masks and admit it's a joke. Wooden, unlikeable characters are sickeningly patronized. are we to conveniently forget, for instance, that the heroine starts out as a jaded snob, suddenly accepting her as a cute, spunky sleuth? Or are we supposed recognize the intrigue as the self-aggrandizing fantasy of her contemptibly bored, aristocratic mind? Maybe audience boredom, confusion and skepticism are intentional, but I don't think this movie is intended to be absurdist.My recommendation is: Read an Agatha Christie mystery and watch a Fred Astaire &amp; Ginger Rogers movie, like "Top Hat." these are contemporary with "That Lady Vanishes", and will provide all the intrigue, escapism, and romance of this movie, but with more wit and dancing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smooth viewing, with perhaps a loss of focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock directs this very originally and interestingly written motion picture adaptation of a book and all in all this is a very entertaining train ride, with bumps along the road both literally and figuratively, and an ability to keep the viewer constantly interested and genuinely intrigued as to what is actually going on. We're given a host of twists and turns and the development never ceases to be highly dynamic, while the acting is very good with notably the two main and the doctor characters, the dialog as always in Hitchcock films of very sound quality, and it seems just about the right length - such films turn dull after too many twists and lingering plot.The only concern one may have with this is that towards the last quarter of the film, although it's all innate to the storyline the final act resembles very little of what's been going on for the whole bulk of the film and this sort of venturing outside the atmosphere worked so hard to set initially, if one considers the name of the film, the mystery etc... it could feel a bit like this train has gone off track, despite the coherence in story, the atmosphere certainly borrows another path perhaps a bit too different.7.5/8ish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie film that would have shocked you in 1939</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes is a perfect film, masterful in its own way, and a must-see for the true Hitchcock fan.I was surprised by the complexities in the film, there despite the suggestion of screwball. For one thing, make no mistake, this is a violent film. We have an endless shoot out. A real brawl. And when it's creepy it's creepy. Throughout, it gives me the depressing feeling that things are going to keep getting worse. When Iris, the main character, makes it onto the train and there's a close up of the wheels spinning rapidly, I feel as if in a bad dream.The hotel at the beginning has a nightmarish atmosphere that I think would have been more obvious to viewers in 1939. Something could easily go wrong there. Which is why some of the comedy is more unnerving than amusing. Michael Redgrave plays his bit in Iris' room more flirtatiously than comedic, resulting in a scene which would have been perceived as rife with sexual tension, even threatening, back then. And things do go strangely wrong there.There's something about Iris that reminds me of Marion Crane, the main character from Psycho. It was the idea that even though she's seemingly ordinary, she has a dark secret. In Iris' case, she doesn't love her fiancé. She also reminds me of Gregory Peck's conspired-against, gaslighted character in Spellbound.The ongoing and extended violence - tame or campy as it might seem now - in The Lady Vanishes is a good and important indication of the depths that Hitchcock would go to in the future to scare his audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Describe THE LADY VANISHES as melodrama is real. However, I observe this melodrama from two angles. Parodic comedy and parody mystery are genre defined and at times intertwine. Parts of the film in which there is the aforementioned compounds are fantastically. Hitch is a genius.All the action happens on a relatively small area (on the train), but again loses negative impression cramped. Conspiracy theory is again present. The director took care of probabilities, which is aimed to enhance the mystery, and again in every situation added a bit of comedy.Characterization of the film is excellent. The girl (Margaret Lockwood) before marriage, which at least contemplating marriage. Harmless old woman, governess (May Witty) who skillfully hiding their true identity. Freaky musicologist (Michael Redgrave) who is much more than that. Two crazy Englishman (Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford) in love with cricket. I am delighted with their performance. Timid pacifist and false moralists (Cecil Parker) who travels with beautiful mistress (Linden Travers). Benign and curious doctor (Paul Lukas) who turns into the evil surgeon. A nun in high heels ....The pace of the film is excellent. Sarcastic comedy turns into a straight drama to which the fast continues mystery. Of course, from the beginning of the story may notice that something is amiss, but only after the disappearance of the ladies things moving in the expected genre direction.The tension in the film is present in almost every situation. This is one of the few films in which all components are functioning very well.</fullReview>

Perfectly paced, Hitchcock gives you a thorough introduction to the main characters before spinning his web of intrigue. For a thriller, the mood is actually quite light and humorous, rather than dark and edgy, which helps the movie speed along.Good performances all round.

		<shortDescription>all the major constituents of Hitchcock-ian school is hearteningly fully-fledged in this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The initial 20 minutes or so of Hitchcock's penultimate film made in UK is frolic where a bunch of passengers (mainly British) is trapped in a local hotel of the fictitious middle- Europe country Bandrika, due to an avalanche has blocked the railway line. Which is quite unusual since mystery and suspense is our knee-jerking reaction towards a vintage Hitchcock brand. But if you think it over after watching the entire movie, you will realise it is a neat conceit, not only does it imply the characteristics of its various players - e.g. proffering a plausible reason for the reaction of two key witness, the cricket enthusiasts Charters (Radford) and Caldicott (Wayne), when they are learned about the lady vanishes; it also excels in satirising the common foibles rooted deep in Britons, notably the married Mr. Todhunter (Parker) and his mistress-in-disguise-as-Ms. Todhunter (Travers), whose switch of testimony will be vividly delineated as an example that truth cannot always win over individual's self-serving reckonings. Also one key character is Miss Froy (Witty), soon will disappear in the train next morning, she is a courteous and amiable retired governess, one lingering big question is why she is the target? The real protagonists are actually an English lady Iris Henderson (Lockwood), who is going back to get married, and Gilbert (Redgrave in his screen debut), a young musician and writer, the two perfectly tallies with a good match started with dispute, she is a bit supercilious while he is very impetuous, but together, they will investigate the mysterious disappearance of Miss. Froy on the train, and a little romance is burgeoning as well.When a pair of unknown hands starts to strangle a man who is serenading under Miss Froy's room, the mystery kicks off (in hindsight, another brilliant plot device), and the next day, a premeditated murder attempt is accidentally foiled but it injures Iris and pairs her with Miss Froy, and then, after the disappearance occurs, the situation becomes more mythic and intriguing, those who clearly see Miss Froy before, all refuse to admit her existence, to the extent Iris begins to question her own rationality, thanks to a prestigious surgeon Dr. Hartz (Lukas) fanning the flames nearby. Eventually through Iris' indomitable persistence and Gilbert's aide, the conspiracy theory is debunking when a conscience- smote mole offers a helping hand (which is the most far-fetched part in the tale). And a final confrontation is a slick action stand-off, with a British-only invitation and gallows humour galore. Lockwood and Redgrave strike up charming chemistry in the fast-paced process of finding out the truth, Paul Lukas is viciously debonair as a heartless snake-in-the-grass, not to mention Dame May Witty, who is pleasantly radiant with her ingenuous facade where true grit lies. And its byproduct - Charters and Caldicott would expand their popularity in three other pictures made by different directors. Suspense, humour, mystery, romance, action, all can be found in Hitchcock's engagingly crafted homegrown piece, even its budget cannot match his later Hollywood fine arts, and certain props and settings are inconveniently discernible as miniatures and models, all the major constituents of Hitchcock-ian school is hearteningly fully-fledged at that stage. Like FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (1940), the ending of THE LADY VANISHES also evokes the looming-large approach of WWII, and the secret agent trope becomes sought-after ever since in the cinema-scape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, If Somewhat Creaky : POSSIBLE SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film by Alfred Hitchcock benefits from excellent performances by Margaret Lockwood as a beautiful young woman en route to London to be married, Dame May Witty as Miss Froy, an older woman who helps her after she's been hit in the head at the railroad station by a falling object, Michael Redgrave in an early role as an itinerant musician and Paul Lukas as a mysterious brain surgeon taking a patient aboard the same train to a hospital for an operation. Unlike later Hitchcock movies, "The Lady Vanishes" is quite predictable. One guesses early on where Miss Froy has vanished, how the pairing of Ms. Lockwood and Redgrave will end up and what the mysterious doctor is up to. Nevertheless, Hitchcock wrings more tension out of this transparent plot than might be anticipated, and he manages to seed the movie with the humor that became a distinctive feature of his long career. One scene made no sense whatever to me. I'm sure I saw a hand pushing the pot or brick that fell on Ms. Lockwood's head. The result of the knock on the head has an immediate connection to the events that follow. But if she was deliberately targeted, who might have done it and why eluded me completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Headlong Comic Thriller From Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening shot reveals a model of a snowbound Alpine village. The camera slowly pans down across the railroad station, the streets (a tiny motorcar tootles past), and focuses on a particular building, then moves in on one of the windows before a dissolve takes us inside. Hitchcock must have like the shot because he repeated it in the opening of "Psycho" twenty-one years later.Not as polished as his later generic examples like "North by Northwest," "The Lady Vanishes" is fast paced, full of fun, and suspenseful. Margaret Lockwood boards a train in Ruritania or Moribunda or some Middle European country to go back to England and marry her fiancé. She bumps into the wisecracking folk-music student, Michael Redgrave, and meets Dame May Witty, a friendly, dowdy, middle-aged governess. Lockwood dozes off and wakes to find that Witty is not only gone from her seat in the compartment but that no one else a board remembers seeing her.Her inquiries are hampered by the made-up foreign language: "Sacre de mi California!" All the other passengers that Lockwood turns to for help about her missing friend have some reason for lying or not believing her. Cecil Parker, a married man traveling with his amour, denies having met Witty because he doesn't want to be a witness at an investigation that will surely end with his name in the papers and a ruinous scandal. Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford, two unflappable British sports freaks, won't cooperate because they're afraid if the train is held up they'll miss an important cricket match back in England. Paul Lukas is a "brain specialist" who attributes Lockwood's notions about Witty to a bump on the head and subsequent delusions, and so on.Well, Witty was real all right. Half the train is in on the kidnapping of the older woman, who is not a nanny after all but a British spy smuggling secrets back home, encoded in a silly tune. Redgrave and Lockwood finally discover the truth. The passenger car is detached from the rest of the train and isolated in a forest where there follows a proper shoot out, with the British passengers on the one hand, and the mysterious uniformed figures of San Placebo on the other, led by Paul Lukas, the treacherous phony -- him and his oh-so-smooth continental charm.It's a pretty funny movie, aside from the underlying mystery. The dialog has some content of wit. When Redgrave first offers to help Lockwood, she shooes him away, telling him to get lost. "Ah, ah. No, my father always told me never to desert a damsel in distress. He carried it so far as to marry my mother." The two most consistently comic character,Wayne and Radford, play Caldicott and Charters. (Who went on to their own brand of fame.) Their every statement, whether indignant or casual, is deadpan and, when amusing, unintentionally so.You'll enjoy this. A million Mexicans did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two concise reviews can be found by gftbiloxi ("An Early Hitchcock Classic", gftbiloxi from Biloxi, Mississippi, 21 May 2005) and tripper0 ("early Hitchcock that set the tone for his later work......", tripper0 from Canada, 20 May 2002).Regarding the fictional country of Mandrika, Dtkoyzis has interesting thoughts about their language ("the best of the early Hitchcock films", Dtkoyzis from Ontario, Canada, 4 February 2001). Meanwhile, cephbasha ("A gander at a fun movie", cephbasha from Granville, Ohio 23 April 2003) has insight about the political parallels to 1938.The only flaw with "The Lady Vanishes" is it looks and sounds dated. The audio has places where it is difficult to discern dialog. The gunshots don't sound real (to modern audiences very much exposed to gun violence in movies). Also, there are some very aged, high-contrast shots. There are also unconvincing miniatures. It takes some patience to look past the technical flaws.For those willing to do so, "The Lady Vanishes" has sparkling wit, a fun detective story, suspense and romance. Hitchcock's thrillers can be very romantic. Margaret Lockwood's determined Iris and Michael Redgrave's quick-witted Gilbert are a memorable screen couple. This is true despite the story's rapid-fire dialog.The rest of the cast is solid, led by Paul Lukas as Dr. Hartz. He's the typical suave Hitchcock villain. Dame May Witty is very enjoyable, particularly as we learn her secrets. Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford as Caldicott and Charters respectively are very humorous Englishmen focused on their chief concern, British cricket. Some may dispute that they qualify as gay characters, as they seem only interested in cricket. Caldicott and Charters are stretching the limit of censorship for this period.Hitchcock always loved to intertwine suspense, comedy and romance together; here he serves up all three in a very entertaining dish. Despite the confining interiors, there are many (and often expressionistic) visuals of note. Hitchcock's much-described cinematic universe has many facets of interest. He really connects with the hidden dreams of his audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent direction and writing makes "The Lady Vanishes" Hitchcock's first official classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ask you to imagine that you're getting ready to board a train the following day. In that time before you get on the train the next day, you make a new friend who will be on the same train that you are going on. When you are boarding the train the next day, someone drops something on your head (whether it's accidental or intentional remains to be seen) and your new friend helps you get to your seat. Your train is now progressing to its destination and your friend is taking care of you for the beginning of your travel. They buy you a cup of tea to heal your headache and you share a conversation in which you learn more about each other. Then, you both go back to your seats and you take a nap. Now, imagine that after waking up from this nap, your friend doesn't appear to be in their seat. You ask the other passengers nearby about the whereabouts of your friend. You describe what your friend looks like to them, that way they know who you're talking about. Not only do they claim that they haven't seen them, but they also claim that they have never heard of such a person sitting there. You ask any person you can come across on the train who has seen this person when you were with them. They say the same thing as the people you've talked to earlier. You simply refuse to believe what they are saying, and insist that you indeed were accompanied by this person. No matter how hard you try, you can't convince anyone that such a person was on the train. Are you just imagining things or is there something rather fishy going on in this train ride? In the case of Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), the main character of director Alfred Hitchcock's outstanding 1938 British comic thriller "The Lady Vanishes", that's exactly the dilemma she's left to face. In her search for the whereabouts of an elderly former governess by the name of Miss Froy (Dame May Witty), Iris is accompanied by a young musicologist named Gilbert (Michael Redgrave). She doesn't care for him at first due to his behavior the night before, but as he assists her in solving this case, that all changes of course. As these two get closer and closer to solving this mind-boggling disappearance, they discover that there's much more behind this disappearance than they expected. Without giving anything away, there's a big plot development revealed later in the film that's very well built-up and very surprising both at the same time. High praise goes to Hitchcock and screenwriters Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder for the film's masterful storytelling and pacing. I highly admire how they let the story play out as naturally as it did since they made it feel like everything is unfolding right before our eyes. As a result, the film never feels predictable or contrived so much as it feels realistic and full of surprises around the corner. In able for a relatively simple story such as this to hold up well decades after its original release, it should be able to retain an execution similar to what Hitchcock does here with "The Lady Vanishes". But as terrific as Alfred Hitchcock's direction is, credit must also go to screenwriters Gilliat and Launder for giving Hitchcock a worthy screenplay to work with. I'm very enthusiastic over how they wrote and set up the story, so that it could have been possible that Iris was imagining this person the whole time. It just makes Iris all the more sympathetic with her peculiar dilemma and gives each of these other characters a mysterious quality to them. Credit must also go to the main actors of the picture including Lockwood, Redgrave, Witty, and Paul Lukas as a brain surgeon who proposes that our main character could be under hallucination. The actors incorporate enough charm and intelligence into their characters that they become more than plot devices used to progress the story, they feel like real people. It's been said that "The Lady Vanishes" was the film that convinced David O. Selznick, renowned producer of "Gone With the Wind" (1939), that Alfred Hitchcock had a future in making films in Hollywood and it's safe to say that he was right. After this film became a huge success in Britain where it first premiered, Hitchcock would eventually move to America to work on his first American film, "Rebecca" (1940), and eventually bring us classics like "Rear Window" (1954) and "Vertigo" (1958). In a way, "The Lady Vanishes" is arguably Hitchcock's first real classic that he ever directed. So any hardcore fans of Alfred Hitchcock's work owe it to themselves to see "The Lady Vanishes" as soon as possible before it should disappear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm very fond of THE 39 STEPS and YOUNG AND INNOCENT, this is my favorite among Hitchcock's British films. It's so marvelously constructed, with every piece falling into place perfectly. Great wit and wonderful performances, with fantastic chemistry between Redgrave and Lockwood, and a charming turn by Witty. No matter how many times I see it, I always get wrapped up in the twists and turns of the plot, feeling Lockwood's frustrations as she gets thwarted by the other passengers' agendas. Trains make such terrific locations for thrillers (for example, all the good parts of Source Code). A fun, gripping ride.The Lady Vanishes - 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Americans have *no* sense of priorities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young woman appears to be the only passenger travelling on a train who remembers an elderly lady that seems to have disappeared. It's like Flightplan, only not really, really stupid. The fact that it's been recently redone helps prove that this is an interesting concept. This actually does work out; the plot and its twists make sense, and as far as mystery-thrillers go, this should leave you satisfied, if it being made in a completely different time(which it certainly shows) does not bother you excessively. That's kind of where I found myself, however. It goes beyond merely stuff that is specific to the time, and that you might need to pay close attention to understand(and that's essentially fine, this is 72 years old). At times funny(the humor is sit-com/screwball in nature), this tries too hard, *a lot*. The Brits obsessed with cricket made me chuckle... the first couple of times. Several main characters are obnoxious, particularly the male lead. That has to do with the rampant sexism; I realize it was common when this was made, but it's fairly intolerable. The same goes for the terrible xenophobia and egocentricity. Can this please decide on whether the fictional and ridiculously negatively presented European village is German or Italian? I gotta admit, all of that made this difficult to sit through, and it would appear that the subtitle guy sides with me on that. The acting is quite good. This is genuinely creepy, and Hitchcock's undeniable, immense talent is visible some in this, and the editing can be excellent. The dialog has its moments. This consists so much of one sequence after another of the people who think something's up not being believed by anyone else. There is a little mild violence in this. The DVD is one of the only I've seen that doesn't even have scene selection. I recommend this to big fans of its director or of other films of the period. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spunky Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) boards a train in Eastern Europe on her way to be married in England. Aboard are a colorful assortment of characters including two cricket-obsessed eccentrics, a suspicious couple having an illicit affair, and a rather scary magician. One bright note is an elderly governess, Miss Froy (Dame May Witty) whom Iris befriends. As the trip gets underway, the old lady promptly disappears and no one seems to have seen her except Iris, who did suffer a bop on the head earlier and may have imagined her.While the basic plot is a lot like "Flightplan," this 1938 Alfred Hitchcock suspense story is full of comedic touches. The quirky characters are well-developed and appropriately silly or menacing and I was kept interested and guessing until the end. Lockwood is quite likable as the spirited heroine and Michael Redgrave is fun as her joking yet sympathetic new friend.The movie loses a star because model trains and bad indoor-for-outdoor sets are obviously used and in a shootout, two pistols hold at least a hundred bullets. But the overall mood is exciting as well as playful; indeed, this is a good mystery that doesn't take itself too seriously. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Best British Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a number of Alfred Hitchcock's British films from the thirties, such as "The Thirty-Nine Steps" or "The Secret Agent", "The Lady Vanishes" is a spy thriller, although the opening scenes seem more like something from a comedy. A group of travellers, mostly English, have gathered in a hotel in the fictional European state of Bandrika (for which read Germany). A young heiress, Iris Henderson, is preparing (not very enthusiastically) to return to England for her marriage to an aristocrat. A young Cambridge musicologist, Gilbert, who is making a study of Bandrikan folk-music, antagonises his fellow-guests by persuading a group of local peasants to perform a folk-dance, very noisily, in his hotel room. Eric, a barrister, has gone on holiday with his mistress in order to further their adulterous liaison. Two cricket-mad English gentlemen are anxious to get back to Manchester for the test match.Some of Hitchcock's other films have a comic opening, such as "Rebecca" in which Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier try to outwit her overbearing, bullying employer. The mood of that film, however, quickly becomes darker and more serious. In "The Lady Vanishes", however, the mood remains relatively light even when Hitchcock introduces the suspense elements. On the train journey back to England, Iris makes the acquaintance of an elderly governess named Miss Froy. (May Witty was 73 at the time the film was made, but I suspect that Miss Froy is supposed to be rather younger- she mentions that both her parents are both alive, something that would be remarkable in the case of a 73-year-old). Iris falls asleep and when she wakes she finds that Miss Froy has disappeared. Stranger still, none of the other passengers can remember ever having seen her. To make things worse, an eminent doctor suggests that Miss Froy never actually existed and that Iris is suffering from delusions. Iris realises that something suspicious is going on, and joins forces with Gilbert to investigate. They discover that Miss Froy is actually a spy working for the British government and that she is in possession of secret information, information which the Bandrikan authorities are determined to prevent her from getting back to Britain.For much of its length the film remains a comedy-thriller. Like most romantic comedy couples, Iris and Gilbert fall in love after an initial period of mutual dislike. Charters and Caldicott continue their discussions about cricket, oblivious to the drama unfolding around them. Only at one point does the tone darken. Towards the end there is a confrontation between the Bandrikan police and some of the passengers. Eric, the adulterous barrister, takes the seemingly sensible position that to engage in a shootout with the police would be suicidal and prefers the path of compromise. He steps outside the train to negotiate- and is promptly shot dead for his pains. This may have been Hitchcock's comment on Chamberlain's policy of appeasement. (The film opened a few weeks after the Munich conference).The film has some similarities with Hitchcock's earlier espionage thriller, "The 39 Steps", which also blended comedy with suspense and romance. (The closest equivalent in Hitchcock's later work would be "North by Northwest"). One difference between the two films, however, would be their setting. "The 39 Steps" has an open, outdoor feel; much of the action takes place on the wide-open Scottish moorlands. "The Lady Vanishes", apart from the hotel scenes, is set in the enclosed, claustrophobic setting of the train. It is an early example of the thriller genre in which a small group of dissimilar people are forced by fate to travel together on a dangerous journey through hostile territory; "Stagecoach", made the following year, is another. A modern film which clearly owes a debt to "The Lady Vanishes" (although lacking its humour) is "Flightplan", in which Jodie Foster's daughter seemingly disappears from an aircraft in flight."The Lady Vanishes" contains a number of typical Hitchcock elements- espionage, a railway journey, a seemingly charming and helpful stranger (Dr Hartz) who turns out to be in league with the villains. (Professor Jordan in "The 39 Steps" is another such character). One Hitchcock trademark lacking here, however, is the blonde heroine. The lovely Margaret Lockwood is one of the few great Hitchcock brunettes; the only other brunette actress to have had such an impact in one of his films was Teresa Wright in "Shadow of a Doubt". These two are among the minority of Hitchcock films where the primary character is a woman (other examples include "Rebecca" and "Notorious"); most Hitchcock blondes, such as Madeleine Carroll in "The 39 Steps" and Eva Marie Saint in "North by Northwest" are there as the companion and love interest of the main male character. Here, however, it is Iris who is the main character and Gilbert her companion. Both Lockwood and Michael Redgrave, in his first major screen role, are excellent.Hitchcock was often hampered by financial constraints during his British period, and "The Lady Vanishes" does not contain any of the great directorial set-pieces that would later become his hallmark. It is, however, together with "The 39 Steps" one of his best British films, reaching a standard that he only rarely surpassed during his Hollywood years. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. It has all the Hitchcock elements: humor, espionage, mistaken identity, conspiracy, and really fun characters. It sets the table for so many other of his films. It also takes place primarily on a train. He certainly like the milieu. It involves the young heroin finding herself with a concussion, attempting to find a woman who befriended her. The lady vanishes and a host of people either cover it up or they are indifferent or callous to her situation. She hooks up with a musician, with whom she has done combat earlier and the romance blossoms under fire. There is a bit of confusion as to what exactly she knows, but the efforts to solve the disappearance make that unnecessary. It comes to a satisfying conclusion. The great characters carry the film and there are some wonderful touches including the name of the woman seen from a smudge on the train window. See this. It's great. Then watch "North by Northwest."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining if overrated early Hitchcock offering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lady Vanishes" is regarded by many as an absolute classic and one of Hitchcock's finest. I'm inclined to disagree, but its certainly worth watching and very entertaining. First, I'll discuss the negative aspects of the film. The first third or so is all exposition in a hotel which becomes rather tiring quickly. There's a lot of droll British humor which, while cute at times, doesn't really translate well to American audiences. Also, like "The 39 Steps", it ultimately lacks the impact and character depth that makes Hitchcock's finest work the absolute perfection it is.Still, this is a remarkably entertaining and enjoyable film thats worth watching. I didn't find it particularly suspenseful, but it was unpredictable and constantly engrossing. Also, Hitchcock was already a very skilled director. He keeps the material moving at a lightning quick pace. Also, many of his signature camera tricks are on full display here. Overall, I didn't find "The Lady Vanishes" to be the masterpiece some other film buffs did, but its worth watching and very entertaining. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming English Hitchcock thriller that wears its politics a little too heavily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A warm, inviting feeling is set as the camera tracks through the (good, but still obvious) model village to rest on a comfortable old alpine château. Inside, the guests are crowding in for an unexpectedly cramped night after an avalanche delays the train that is to take many of them away. There's nothing ominous in this however, as the guests seem mostly filled with good cheer and petty arguments over accommodations and noise-making. Nothing ominous until a sinister hand reaches out and silences the singer to whom Dame May Witty as governess Miss Froy is paying rapt attention....And so begins one of Hitch's best known British thrillers. Like The Man Who Knew Too Much this suffers a bit from slightly excessive exposition, though it's more entertaining this time 'round, and more obviously significant to the story to come. Miss Froy and several other guests we've been introduced to, including a somewhat snotty young woman (Margaret Rutherford) returning to England to be married, a musicologist and linguist who quickly becomes infatuated with her (Michael Redgrave) and a couple of rather gay cricket enthusiasts (Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford), soon board the train that is to take them out of the country, and into mystery as Miss Froy suddenly disappears and leaves the young woman wondering if she's insane as the rest of the passengers act as if they've never seen her.It's murder and spies, and the film builds in excitement to an extended shoot-out and standoff in the woods, in which the worst excesses of Hitchcock's overt patriotism and the none-too-subtle allegory about pacifism in the face of the oncoming war come to the front. Cecil Parker's Eric Todhunter has been a cad throughout the film, but in the last scenes his cowardice proves deadly and we can almost see Hitch smirking in satisfaction.That doesn't ruin the film, which is full of rich characterizations and wonderful set-pieces like the scene in the magician's baggage car, but it does cheapen the effect and date the film somewhat, and for me it's a major reason why I can't place it among Hitchcock's very best. Still great fun, in a solid DVD transfer from Criterion with loads of extras</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lady Vanishes" starts by introducing an eccentric group of characters and is at this point very benign though charming. Given that this is a Hitchcock film and the film's title, it is apparent, though, that sooner or later a lady will vanish in a mysterious circumstance.It is upon Iris Henderson and Gilbert Redman and to solve the mystery, and Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave are superb at portraying an initially frosty relationship that improves as the mystery develops. An excellent cast of suspicious characters is developed, and most of them deny that there is a mystery.This film incorporates a lot humor, but the humor is never out of place and does not detract from the development of the mystery. Even the dry humor, particularly in the two Englishmen that are unfazed by any developments and constantly concerned with attending a cricket match, benefited the film. The mystery itself is intriguing and remains so with its various twists. There are a limited amount of action scenes, but the film's principal focus is its mystery, which is to its advantage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, Silly And Hugely Entertaining Early Hitchcock Spy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iris, a young woman, is travelling home to England by train across Europe. She is befriended by Miss Froy, a curious but sweet-natured older lady, who mysteriously disappears whilst Iris is asleep. Unable to find her on the train, and surrounded by passengers who refuse to even acknowledge she existed, Iris is convinced of a conspiracy and resolves to track down the missing woman.Along with The 39 Steps and Frenzy, this is probably the best of Hitchcock's British films; a great clattering spy story, full of intrigue and good-natured laughs, and populated with an entire train full of eccentric and sinister characters. Whilst the suspense is first-rate, and the conspiracy is brilliantly exploited to make Lockwood doubt her memory and even her sanity, Hitchcock is frequently more interested in comic overtones. There are whole scenes (the clog-dancing hotel staff, the episode with the sugar-lumps, the fight in the baggage-car) which are completely unnecessary but give the movie a wonderfully goofy feel - the humour plays brilliantly against the suspense, making the story scarier and more enjoyable. The cast are a terrific bunch of face-pullers; Lockwood and Redgrave have a wonderful chemistry together as a snooty society-girl and a good-natured dreamer. Lukas is a great two-faced villain, Witty is adorable, and Wayne and Radford were so popular as Caldicott and Charters, two quintessentially English stuffed suits obsessed with cricket, that they were cast together in six later movies (the best of which is Passport To Pimlico). Hitchcock showcases his typically brilliant photography and editing skills, and appears in one of his standard walk-past cameos at the train-station at the end. Scripted by Sidney Gilliatt, Frank Launder and Alma Reville (Hitch's wife), based on a story by Ethel Lina White. A great old British movie, full of daft characters and witty dialogue - at one point Redgrave wonders if there will be anyone in the cosmopolitan dining-car and checks Lockwood's watch, "Teatime. Well, all the English will be there.". Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gander at a fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes is one of Hitchcock's most lighthearted character-driven pieces. This cross-genre work is composed of a core thriller, with layers of comedy and romance atop it. It shines in it's diversity and almost irreverently acknowledges that its plot is silly; even the villainous Dr. Hartz seems like he's having fun at some points. Thematic presence is definitely not the star of this film. The term theme refers to a core idea or `purpose' of a film. Events in a said film impact, shape, and hopefully clarify the general theme of the film. Elements that may be recurring in defining the theme could be respectively called motifs. There are events and motifs in Vanishes that supplement the main theme. As previously mentioned, the main theme is somewhat vague and unused, since, after all, this film relies on genuinely fun characters and writing. This is definitely one of Hitchcock's least thematic works. The key political background of the central theme is explained perfectly in Spoto's The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: `in 1937 and 1938, English films had to maintain a steadfast neutrality about events in Germany and about German expansion throughout Europe.' This central political theme (as Vanishes is regarded as Hitchcock's most openly political film) is reinforced by the simple pair of British men on the train: Charters and Caldicott, delightfully played by Naunton Wayne and Cecil Parker respectively. These two men are uninterested with any of the happenings on the train. Apathetic towards the scent of espionage that has filled the train, all they care about is getting home in time to see their beloved Cricket matches. This is metaphorical of English and French positions toward Hitler's `appeasement' in the 1930s in which the English and French allowed concessions of certain aspects of the Treaty of Versailles and certain alliances, among things, in order to appease the hulking German nuisance. Britain wanted to avoid war at all costs as Caldicott and Charters want to avoid the spy game on the train in favor of their hobbies. This endearing couple went on to be in ten other films together; some were Hitchcock's(notably The 39 Steps). (*BEGIN MILD SPOILERS*)A similar scene that influenced the main theme of the impending war and espionage was a motif sequence where the heroine, Iris, is searching for the elusive Miss Froy on the train. During this montage, Iris looks around (use of the POV shot) the cabin to see Froy, but realizes that all of the passengers have characteristics like the old woman's. Another cinematic technique used to instill doubt amongst viewers was employed by Hitchcock in the shootout scene of the film in which Miss Froy, the spy, flees from the enemy spies during the film's climax. This sequence included a shot of a firing rifle, followed by a rear-view of Miss Froy running away through the forest, then falling. To the eye of the viewer, it appears unclear whether she was shot or simply jumped over a log. This device probably would have been effective in 1938, when audiences had not experienced it before. To a modern and experienced viewer, the result of this scene probably would be more predictable. The main supporting motif of Vanishes is the reliance on music for plot points and character building. The viewer learns that Miss Froy plays the piano, and Gilbert studies middle-European music. Later it is revealed that the melody heard in the film was a key plot point (a MacGuffin here). This revelation occurs near the end of the film when Miss Froy is happily reveling in her success. (*END MILD SPOILERS*) At heart, The Lady Vanishes is a lighthearted thriller with a touch of romance. Its genres mix like a perfect drink and it doesn't rely on thematic recurrence to keep the viewer's interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early, British Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a British film directed by Hitchcock before he went to Hollywood, in which we see the basic Hitchcock recipe taking shape.First there is star power in the romantic leads, the beautiful and very interesting Margaret Lockwood (if you've never seen her, you're in for a treat), who plays an ingenue about to marry the wrong man, and the accomplished Sir Michael Redgrave, who plays the right man. Next there is the so-called "Boy Meets Girl, Cute" formula--in this case it's more of a clash than a meeting. Then there is a romantic setting, first the alpine resort and then the train. (European train holidays were romantic in those days; perhaps they still are.) Then there is mystery and danger. This is accomplished by the inexplicable disappearance on the train of the lady Lockwood met at the resort, a disappearance that nobody but her seems to notice. When she tries to bring it to everyone's attention there is a kind of sinister cover-up and some deliberate lying by third parties (with their own agendas) so that at first nobody believes her. Indeed, there is a psychiatrist aboard who casts doubt on her mental state. Add to this mix some interesting character play by a fine supporting cast, including Dame May Witty, Paul Lukas, Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne; stir in some romantic indirections and mystery plot red herrings, and you have a delightful repast.It is interesting to compare this to some later Hitchcock films. It is more of an old fashioned "who done it" than it is a psychological thriller, more like, say, Dial M for Murder (1954) than, Spellbound (1945) or The Birds (1963). It is not as polished as those productions, but in some ways it is the better for it in that we never know where an individual scene is going. The whimsical business with Radford and Wayne and the Swiss maid, for example, is really extraneous to the story. Note the Grand Hotel (1932) feel to the opening scene with the desk clerk trying to find rooms for everyone at the inn. I don't know when Agatha Christie wrote her Murder on the Orient Express (the movie version came out in 1972) but she may have been influenced by The Lady Vanishes, or it may have been the other way around. At any rate, both stories take place in the thirties abroad trains.Redgrave, who is the father of Lynn and Vanessa Redgrave, was thirty years old when this film was released and already a star on the London stage. Lockwood was only twenty-two, despite being a veteran of fourteen or fifteen previous films. Their performance here is an early example of the romantic comedy pair set amidst a field of danger, one of most enduring traditions in the movies.See this for Margaret Lockwood whose strength of character and pretty features are still fresh and most appealing despite the intervening years. Such is part of the magic of film.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>I'll always remember this movie if only for Iris' line at the end. After spending the whole movie obviously dreading her marriage and visibly falling in love with Gilbert, she reaches the last scene, sees her proposed husband, hides, and calls Gilbert a "heartless, callous, selfish, swallow-headed beast" for finding her out. She then kisses him. Foolishly romantic, but well-played.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Example of How to Direct a Comedy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does THE LADY VANISHES stand up so well, nearly eighty years after its first release? By rights, it shouldn't do so; filmed almost entirely in Islington Studios, with extensive use of back- projections, second unit film and model shots, its modest budget is palpably evident: no CGI graphics to liven up the action here. But such criticisms seem unimportant in a film whose various elements seem to cohere perfectly. As the heroine Iris Henderson, Margaret Lockwood is both strong-willed yet vulnerable, especially in the scenes in the train where she insists that the eponymous lady Miss Froy (Dame May Witty) actually exists, despite her fellow- passengers' denials. Her male companion Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) undergoes something of a character change, as he sheds his supercilious exterior and dedicates himself to solving the mystery. The way he stands up to the evil doctor Hartz (Paul Lukas), is quite admirable. Yet Hitchcock's film is perhaps noticeable for the quality of its supporting performances. Cecil Parker and Linden Travers, as a pair of illicit lovers, are both frightened and scared of discovery; they do not want anything to do with the mystery. Parker tries his best to remain detached, even agreeing to surrender at one point; but his overtures are ruthlessly spurned. Mary Clare as an Italian-speaking Baroness remains sour-faced throughout; it's clear she's only in the whole scheme for the money. By contrast Catherine Lacey, as a would be nun in high heels, realizes the error of her ways and supports Gilbert in his quest. The two stand-out supporting actors are Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne as the cricket-loving Charters and Caldicott. Due to their obsession with the Test Match at Manchester, they are prepared to sacrifice everything, even their integrity; but when they become involved in the denouement, they prove to be worthy allies. Caldicott turns out to be a crack shot, which proves exceptionally useful in the circumstances. The duo proved so successful that they reappeared in other films, notably NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH (1940) and IT'S NOT CRICKET (1949).Hitchcock is at his most playful here, enjoying the forbidden pleasures of photographing ladies in a state of déshabillé (Lockwood, Googie Withers, and Sally Stewart), or the visual jokes of seeing Gilbert and Iris trying to find the vanishing lady in the guard's van, or Gilbert trying and failing to remember the melody that contains a vital clue necessary to Britain's future security. The plot is pure hokum, of course, but as with many of Hitchcock's British films, it is largely irrelevant. It's far more fruitful to share the director's joy at concocting such a technically near-perfect piece of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An avalanche strands a bunch of mostly British train passengers in a European hotel. When their train finally gets going, pretty passenger Margaret Lockwood (as Iris Henderson) enjoys chatting with elderly English governess May Witty (as "Miss Froy"). Then, after Ms. Lockwood dozes off, Ms. Witty vanishes? Lockwood asks everyone where the lady went, but nobody recalls seeing the old woman on the train. Prague doctor Paul Lukas (as Egon Hartz) suggests Lockwood is suffering a concussion, due to a mysterious hit on the head she suffered just before boarding; this, he reasons, caused Lockwood to imagine the old woman. Lockwood is unconvinced, and finds an ally in flirty musician Michael Redgrave (as Gilbert Redman).A dense, droll, and marvelously directed classic. Alfred Hitchcock deservedly won the "Best Director" award from "New York Film Critics". In hindsight, the group's 1930s awards seem more on the mark than the Oscars; and, Witty might have won their "Supporting Actress" prize, had they been awarded in 1938. It being purely British, "The Lady Vanishes" features Hitchcock reaching new levels of wit and whimsy; and it's chock full of the master's trademarks; you get glasses, "The Birds", and even a flash of panties (assisted by waiter "Rudolph"). Repeated viewing is recommended, especially considering the seemingly confused introduction of characters and pre-train events - which will all make sense, if you're paying attention.Hopefully, Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford have been re-inserted into their single pair of pajamas.********** The Lady Vanishes (11/1/38) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave, May Witty, Paul Lukas</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lady Vanishes ( 1938)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's last British hit before he moved to Hollywood. The Lady Vanishes follows much of the same themes as Hitchcock's past and present films including: mistaken identity, deception, and romance. The movie opens with travelers on a trans-European train stopping for the night due to bad weather, hosted by a local hotel. Among the train passengers are Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends but is now returning home to be married, and Miss Froy (May Witty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess. When the train resumes its journey, Iris and Miss Froy become acquainted, while the remaining passengers in the compartment appear not to understand a word of English. It is here, that Iris lapses into unconsciousness (the result of an earlier encounter with a falling flowerpot meant for Miss Froy) and when she reawakens, the governess has vanished. However, Iris is certain that something more sinister is going on, and ends up teaming up with old acquaintance, Gilbert, (Redgrave) to find her before the train reaches its destination. ( The whole relationship with Giblert is quite hilarious, because from a certain scene at the beginning of the film, these two would be the least two people you would think of that would team up together) The central premise itself in itself is fanstastic: the unaccountably missing, Miss Froy, who seems to have vanished on the very same train where everyone denies she ever existed. This is the conundrum that our two lovebirds are trying to unravel, and why the other passengers are claiming that Miss Froy never existed. Of course, some of the passengers are denying seeing Miss Froy for their own reasons (the hilariously singleminded cricket fans Caldicott and Charters (played by Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford), while some of the others may just be in on it. One of my the most hilarious scenes from the film is a whole sequence where Gilbert and Iris are like fighting with one of the passengers, Signor Doppo (Philip Leaver), a magician and Iris is basically just like bouncing around while Gilbert and Doppo are battling it out. " Don't stand hoping around there like a refere, cooperate," Gilbert says. Iris ends up like kicking Gilbert in the butt. However, my favorite scene from the film is the whole posioning sequnce in which the villain of the piece, Dr. Hartz of Prague (Paul Lukas) spikes both Gilbert and Iris's drinks and 1) admits his involement " Hmm. You see I am in this conspiracy, as you call it." 2) admits that his patient is ineed Miss Fray. ( Miss Fray is in fact a British spy assigned to deliver some vital information, the famous Hitchcock MacGuffin) And of course, this being 1938, there is a little bit of a shot at the pacifists as well, as one of the main passengers, a big shot named Todhunter tries to ' negotiate' his way out of the situation and ends up being shot to death like the little bitch he was. "Come on, sit down, take it easy. What's the trouble?" "If you must know, something fell on my head." "When, infancy?" "Can I help?" "Only by going away." "No, no, no, no. My father always taught me, never desert a lady in trouble. He even carried that as far as marrying Mother." " It's a conspiracy that's all it can be. All these people on the train say they haven't seen Miss Fray, but they have." "In the first place, a little old lady disappears. Everyone that saw her probably insists that she was never there at all. Right?" "Right." "We know that she was." "Therefore, they did see her. Therefore, they are delebrately lying. Why?" "Did you notice anything about that nun?" "No." "I don't think she's a nun at all. They don't wear high heels!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Margaret Lockwood meets Dame May Whitty (Miss Froy) in a hotel abroad, while clog dancers have a party with Michael Redgrave in the attic, and cricket-loving Charters and Caldicott can't wait to hear the score from Old Trafford. On the train, Whitty mysteriously vanishes while completing a puzzle in a magazine, and no one on the train admits to seeing her (including a married man on a trip with his flighty mistress, and a nun with a heavily bandaged patient). Lockwood and Redgrave become unlikely detectives but all comes out well for the good of dear old Blighty. Much better than the Cybill Shepherd remake in the 1970s, this Hitchcock thriller has bags of humour and some great character studies, as well as plenty of atmosphere which moves the movie along just fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from some cheesy models used at the very beginning, this is one of the best Hitchcock films you can watch. While it's not nearly as famous as his later films, I prefer it to most of them due to its very simple plot yet how deftly it was handled.The film begins in a fictional European country that looks a lot like Switzerland. A large group of tourists are stranded at a tiny hotel and as this portion of the film slowly unfold, you are introduced to the characters. I think that the way Michael Redgrave's character was introduced was awfully contrived, but it wasn't so bad as to mar the film.When the snow is finally cleared and the train is about ready to depart, someone makes an attempt on an old English lady's life (Dame May Witty) but poor Margaret Lockwood is hit by the falling flower pot instead. Dazed, Witty helps her on the train and befriends her. Later, however, after Lockwood naps, she awakens and cannot find Witty and no one on board admits to having seen the kindly old lady! After a while, it seems as if Lockwood could be losing her mind and even her staunchest supporter, Redgrave, is doubtful about her sanity. Then, out of the blue, the story shifts into high gear and it becomes a very, very suspenseful and exciting film--with a breakneck speed and excellent performances by all.A combination of excellent direction, acting and a dandy script make this one well worth seeing and one of the famed director's most underrated films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Vanishes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the last films Hitchcock made before going to America, he was clearly already comfortable with making comedy thrillers involving an attractive male and female partnership.Nicely made and nicely judged though it is, The Lady Vanishes adds nothing much to the format that Hitchcock established with his ground-breaking and very modern 39 Steps from three years earlier. Indeed, there is much missing. The sexual tension, the energy, the driving wit, the sheer verve, the breathless pacing, the joy and arrogance of that earlier film are lacking here. It seems, at times, that Hitchcock is merely going through the paces. The greatest moments in The Lady Vanishes either involve Naughton Wayne and Basil Radford as the English caricatures Caldicott and Charters, or any of the minor supporting characters: the hotel manager, or the other passengers in the train carriage.This is a watchable and entertaining film, but if you are looking for an early Hitchcock classic then turn your attention to the much finer 39 Steps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing and overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Lady Vanishes' is one of the last films made by Hitchcock before crossing the ocean and starting his American career. It used to be one of the preferred Hitchcock films of Francois Truffaut who confessed in his book of dialogs with Hitchcock to know it by heart. I had great expectations before seeing it, and I frankly was disappointing.The idea of the film is fantastic, and the film starts a genre or maybe two - the train (or other closed space) thriller and the denied disappearing where we the viewers and the hero are the only ones who believe in the reality of what we have seen - the combination that was lately used again in 'Fightplan'.The problem here is with the combination and ratio between comedy and thriller. The British humor mixed with national stereotypes that may have been enjoyed by the 1930s viewers did not work at all with me. The two principal characters played by Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave are quite credible, and May Witty justifies the Dame put before her name, but the rest of the actors are no more that sketches filling in the screen with conventional and sometimes wooden acting. There is little thrill in the whole film especially after the secret of the disappearing is dispersed, there is none of the famous Hitchcock suspense scenes that we can remember, and the final action scenes look completely amateurish (what happened with the Nazi officer with a a gun with one bullet at hand in the train?).This film may have spoken actual messages by the time it was made. An appeasing lawyer is shot and killed while trying to surrender - a clear message for the contemporary audiences in England or the US a few weeks after the Munich agreement. Yet for the viewers today there is too little good cinema to keep beyond the truly original idea of the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Hitchcock is as idiotic as his later films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film makes me understand better than ever just how extreme Hitchcock's influence has been on De Palma; I used to think that De Palma simply copied ideas and scenes from the chubby old geezer - but now I know that he is responsible for De Palma's bad habits, too. De Palma's unique illogical style has, evidently, also come from Hitchcock. I suppose that Hitchcock is analyzed to death and over-praised in film courses at universities, but the opposite should be done: they ought to explain to film students just how bad an influence this fat little Englishman can be. Hitchcock is clearly a director without "vision". By this cliché term I am referring to a concrete picture of what shape and form a movie is going to take. For example, Kubrick's films never drift into side-streets: they always remain on course and on target. Hitchcock, on the other hand, can't even decide if he wants to make a spy thriller or a comedy. This film starts off as a mystery, and a half hour later we are faced with a fight scene in the train's luggage compartment which is pure 100% slapstick! This meandering between thriller and silly comedy never gels - simply because it can't. Comedy thrillers do exist - but movies which switch from one genre to the other come off all wrong.But the film's main flaw is the afore-mentioned illogicality. Plus the absurdity, far-fetchedness, and some silly coincidences. When Lockwood sees "Froy" written on the window she hastily tries to draw the disbelieving Redgrave to it; but, alas, the train - just at that moment - passes through a tunnel, and somehow the writing on the window disappears when they exit the tunnel (damn predictable, too). (Apparently this is a ghost story as well as a comedy/thriller/slapstick comedy.) Then there are the absurd reasons given to us why all the passengers who are not involved in the conspiracy won't testify that they did indeed see the old lady before she vanished; the male couple refuses to co-operate with Lockwood because they want the train to come on time, in time for a cricket match! (This is meant to be hysterically funny. Ha ha.) The other couple (man/woman) refuses to involve themselves; the man does not want to be a witness and appear in the newspapers (for some very tiresome "movie reasons"). The woman (in this couple) later decides to testify in spite of not seeing the old woman herself, and then lies about the wrong woman, and, and, and... bla bla bla - a whole lot of nonsense ensues (I don't have to get into it).Just the fact that the whole thing is a conspiracy says everything; conspiracies almost always lack credibility and are rarely handled intelligently in movies. Then comes another dumb-as-dirt event: the "nun" - who is in on the conspiracy - turns against her fellow conspirators when she finds out that the old lady is English. Well that certainly makes a lot of sense, now doesn't it!!! This "nun" is willing to work against her country's government, but just because the "foreigners" want to kill the old English lady she switches sides - in a jiffy! She'll sell her homeland, but she won't take part in the killing of one single solitary British citizen! Hitchcock seems to think his audiences checked their brains at the door of the cinema. (Then again, Chubby's movies are so popular that he perhaps wasn't so far off the mark with that assumption. Treating your viewers as morons has paid off for a number of film-makers.) And so the nonsense continues... The last twenty or so minutes are just a muddle of partly predictable, partly unpredictable - but always silly - plot twists, silly dialog, absurd situations, etc. Basically, the last twenty minutes are a bit of a mess. Just a couple of examples (out of many): the cricket fan gets shot into the hand and doesn't so much as blink! (Apparently the bullets used in the 30s just stung a bit.) Another one: the rich guy (who refused to support Lockwood's claim of the old lady's existence) then decides not to tolerate the ensuing shoot-out between train passengers and the "foreigners", so he marches out of the train, carrying a white piece sign - and very predictably gets shot. As predictable as the shooting of the "nun" (yes, that's right: the "nun" who inexplicably switched sides, just for the fun of it.) In this last part of the film the typical 30s machine-gun-style dialog sounds particularly silly.The film is by no means bad; it's fairly entertaining (up until the last part), and has some charm, I suppose. But I simply cannot stand it when the parts of my brain, the ones in charge of logic, get continually hammered, over and over. Very ironically, in the last third of the movie one of the characters says that "there must be a reasonable explanation for all this". He was only half-right: there was an explanation but it wasn't reasonable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Memorable Iris Henderson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often a criticism of action films is that the lead female character is poorly imagined, acts too helpless to exist, or can't survive in any real setting. It's a criticism that existed since the first Perils of Pauline ? the early American silent series that would have Pauline kidnapped by a mustachioed villain and tied to a train track. To say the least, Pauline was not very smart. But she drew in crowds.Any film that didn't have the female going through these Pauline stunts wasn't considered an action film. The smarter females were reserved for comedies and woman "weepies"?or foreign film stars such as Leni Riefenstahl. Yes, foreign films had a gift for making their heroines smart?but they didn't draw in the crowds that the dim-witted, English-speaking girls did.Perhaps it was the comedic aspects of the romantic thriller, The Lady Vanishes, that allowed its lead character, Iris Henderson, to thrive. The character was central to not only moving the plot, but also keeping the audience involved. She not only wasn't dumb, she was exasperatingly too smart. This female role didn't drive off audiences, however. The film was an international hit.Iris Matilda Henderson is touring Europe before she has to settle down in a marriage her father arranged with some royal scion. After living off her father's self-made wealth, she is resigned to give him some royal recognition. But she doesn't let her friends talk to her about happiness. She refuses to be spoiled.Unfortunately, an avalanche interrupts her plans. It strands her and a whole host of travelers in a small cramped hotel in some fictional Eastern European country. Iris is barely inconvenienced, however. She shares a floor with an elderly governess by the name of Miss Froy, and she's bugged by a musicologist by the name of Gilbert?two people more worldly than Miss Henderson, but she's not one to judge. Besides, there is a way out. The next morning, a substitute train will come and transport them all to Paris, from which she can make her way back home to London.Alas, on the way to the train someone drops a potted plant (?) on Iris, and she blacks out. Miss Froy offers to look after the poor girl on the journey ? they both are headed to the same destination. Miss Froy prepares cold compresses, and looks after meals. Miss Henderson tries to rest. The women quickly form a bond.Around lunchtime, however, Iris wakes up, and Miss Froy is nowhere to be found. She asks her fellow car passengers, a foreign minister of some Germanic country and an Italian stage magician if they've seen her companion. They say she had no companion.Incredulous, she doesn't waste anytime. She calls them stupid, and goes to search for Miss Froy. Unfortunately, she doesn't find much help. Every passenger, especially those of English origins, have their own conceits for denying the existence of Miss Froy, and implying that Miss Henderson is touched.She doesn't care. She is much better at dishing out insults, and she is determined to find her kindly helper.The Lady Vanishes was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, but he came onto the project. Originally, the film was to be shot in multiple locations including Yugoslavia by another director. That director wasn't good at hiding the script, however. Once Yugoslavian officials read a pinched copy of the script, they objected to how their country was portrayed as dimwitted and fascist. (Although based upon a book, Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder's adaptation added characters, an obvious political message, and Italian and Germanic villains in this flick that was released a couple of months before the start of WWII.) The Yugoslavian government kicked the cast and crew out. And the entire project was put on hold.Alfred Hitchcock knew the writers, who had been trying to sell this anti-appeasement, anti-fascist adventure yarn in a Chamberlain England. Hitchcock was already in negotiations to start directing in Hollywood. He decided to revive the project, and make this one of his last films for Gaumont British Studios.Hitchcock accommodates the foreign country scenes with an obvious model train set. (No sense in letting some other country get the shot of delaying the film.) Although some of the jokes fall flat, he also doesn't try and distance himself from the comedic elements of the script. Alas, the viewer can't tell where Hitchcock begins and Gillian and Launder ends. This is a true collaboration between writers and director.Francois Truffaut when he interviewed Hitchcock, admired how much Iris was able to accomplish. Hitchcock admitted even he was surprised many of Iris' traits survived the cutting room floor. And that was the ticket. Her smarts were crucial to moving the plot forward. Previous to the 1960's, Iris was the smartest, English-speaking female character on celluloid. Oh not by degrees, or citations! No, Iris had a mystery on her hands, one that pitted her against a high powered lawyer, the minister of a spy agency, a renowned magician, a national government psychiatrist (Think Hanibal Lecture!), two staticians, minions who like to play mind games, as well as England's favor for isolation, and a lady with a secret; and she outwitted them all! Iris had the one-line zingers. She had the action sequences. In the beginning of the film, Henderson says that it's time to settle down because she's done everything. By the end of the film, many viewers agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Delightful Hitchcock Blends Suspense and Comic Relief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if you were on a European train with a sweet elderly woman of English descent, and suddenly, she was nowhere to be seen? Earlier, she helped you because of a knock on the head. She took you to tea in the dining car. She even insisted that she use her own tea rather than that supplied by the train. You come back to your compartment with her and doze off. But when you awake, she is gone.But it's more than that. You inquire as to her whereabouts of the other passengers, but everybody insists that she never existed. They insist you were alone. You return to the dining car and ask about her. The stewards say you were alone. You look at the bill, and there is a price for only one tea. No one believes you, and they think the knock on the head has caused you to imagine the woman. This is the essential premise of one of Hitchcock's early masterpieces, the Lady Vanishes.Dame May Witty is unforgettable as the charming Miss Froy whom the passengers insist does not exist. Michael Redgrave plays the young naive musician who starts to believe something is amiss. And the whole thing works as well as it does because of the tour-de-force performance of Margaret Lockwood as Iris Henderson, newly befriended of Miss Froy before the vanishing. At every turn, Lockwood finds that convincing acting window where she is at once believable and yet not over the top. Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne provide wonderful comic relief as two cricket fanatics riding the train to catch a tournament. These two are always stuck on trains in Germany, usually trying to get to a cricket match! (They later reprise the same roles in Night Train to Munich.) While for some modern viewers, the B&amp;W and the sets may seem a trifle outdated, the story is definitely worth the ride. The acting is superb, both among the good guys and the bad. A real masterpiece of early talkie cinema on a suspenseful subject, not to be missed. Hitchcock fans may be interested to know that he made this film prior to his arrival in Hollywood, CA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie but thought that it was too mild. I felt that there should've been more thrills and more excitement. A lady vanishes and yet there's not that much of tension or panicking. I wanted more of shock in this movie. Yet, it manages to be a treat. I am assuming that there would've been a controversy had they have shown more gore at that time and therefore they tried to make it light.Acting is usual, is great by everyone except for the odd man who fought with the main character. I especially liked the acting of the lead pair. The lady was the only one who was actually showing concern on her face. Others who had seen the old lady but were trying to cover up and not from the evil side surprisingly showed no tension. I mean, even though they pretended as if they hadn't seen her, I would have liked if they to conversed about the missing lady.The entire story went on like the Indiana Jones thing. It was more like an adventure, as if a lady's luggage went missing suddenly and she and the main male lead were searching for it. Even though I have mostly criticized the movie about being too cheery till this sentence, I still think it was really good. The chemistry between the lead pair was superb. As the story unfolded, it got more intriguing. But another issue. The gunfight scene too was too mild. It was as if they were shooting each other with paint ball or something! But the thing that I really liked was that the story was clean; it was good to see for a change.Its an Alfred Hitchcock movie and so it manages to entertain everyone somehow. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock pre-Hollywood is still Hitchcock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the oddest things about THE LADY VANISHES is that Hitch doesn't make his usual trademark appearance until one of the last scenes at a train station. Once he got to make Hollywood films, he made sure he appeared early on so that audiences wouldn't be on the lookout for him and be distracted from the story.This is a very British entry from '38 with a very lovely MARGARET LOCKWOOD, a brunette beauty who could act, and MICHAEL REDGRAVE (dad of Vanessa and Lynn), then an up and coming young star himself. They share most of the screen time as strangers who meet quite by accident but spend the rest of the story trying to solve the disappearance of an elderly lady, Miss Froy, (DAME MAY Witty) on a train in some fictional European country. That's the gimmick for the plot which unravels in a leisurely fashion at the start but soon gets into gear with the disappearance of the old gal and the insistence by other passengers that she was a figment of Lockwood's imagination.It's typical Hitchcock material, another one of his spy capers sprinkled with some amusing supporting characters and moments of sly humor along with the gradual building of suspense. PAUL LUKAS is excellent as a doctor aboard the train who talks about the arrival of one of his patients and seems to be involved somehow in the strange disappearance of Miss Froy.The resolution is a bit far-fetched and there are occasional lapses in credibility along the way when you stop to think about how it all started, but if you're willing to go along for the ride it makes for good entertainment for any mystery buff who likes the Hitchcock style.Summing up: One of the better Hitchcock entries from his early English period. Trivia note: Sound on the TCM print was not the best, so it's advisable to use the caption feature on your TV remote (if it has one) to catch some of the British phrases and words unfamiliar to American ears. Otherwise, you'll miss a lot of the dialog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remarkable likeness to Tin Tin comics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is very entertaining?as charming as reading Herge's Tin Tin comics. In the comics of Tin Tin there are two Britishers called Thompson and Thomson differentiated by the alphabet "P" in their names. In this Hitchcock film, two similar Britishers turn out to be ardent cricket lovers, who sleep in the same room and eat together. Like the Tin Tin comics, people disappear and there are spies lurking around who send coded messages by memorizing musical tunes. Yet it is a film with very little music. However, one of the British duo mentions in conversation that one of them mistook the Hungarian Rhapsody for a national anthem! There is a certain comic book charm in the action of the characters?writing the name "Froy" on a window pane. Yet the film charms the juvenile viewer in all of us.Humor comes in small doses. There is even a nun with high-heeled shoes! And an adulterous husband who dies waving a white flag of surrender! And a Swiss maid who changes her clothes in front of the "propah" British gentlemen.The film appears to be the flip side of "The 39 Steps": a female character is trying to unravel the truth in "The Lady Vanishes" while in the other film it is a male attempting the same. Hitchcock always seems to revert to his earlier works is some manner. In this film, the female lead states "What is there left for me but marriage?" Many years and film later in "Marnie" the female lead accepts marriage rather than imprisonment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symbolism is as elusive as Miss Froy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes Analysis by Justin LangeWritten by Sydney Gilliat and Frank Lounder Based on the novel The Wheel Spins by Ethel Lina White Cinematography by John J. CoxCast: Margaret Lockwood as Iris Henderson Micheal Redgrave as Gilbert Dame May Witty as Miss FroyHitchcockian Symbolism in The Lady Vanishes is almost as elusive as the film's Miss Froy. Not as layered as many other Hitchcock films, it lacks the wealth of subtext and veiled signification of more critically renowned films like Psycho. Interestingly, Hitchcock became involved with the project in an uncharacteristically late fashion. When he began to work on The Lady Vanishes, the script had already been written and the characters had already been cast. Logically, Hitchcock's presence was reduced, and his opportunity to be an auteur (at least with this film) was diminished. But Hitchcock isn't called `the master' for nothing. He still manages to integrate a major motif into the film-music-and develops the espionage and romance themes to a satisfying extent. Theme can be defined as an implicit or recurrent idea; romance and espionage were two of his favorites and unlike many of his other films, the two themes actually compliment each other. The Lady Vanishes is regarded as one of Hitchcock's best lighthearted romance comedies.Hitchcock's MacGuffin is an interesting one. The MacGuffin, of course, is the folk tune; thus it is also Gilbert's task of memorizing it. As Miss Froy tells him, `I want you to take back a message for Mr. Culloden; a tune that contains (in code, of course) the vital clause of a pact between two European countries.' The seemingly serious nature of the situation does exactly what a MacGuffin is intended to do: it becomes of chief importance to the characters. Gilbert's whistling of the tune annoys even Iris towards the end of the film. The tune is trivial to the audience, for the in the end, we care only about the romance between Gilbert and Iris.Moreover, it is this theme-the theme of romance versus espionage-that is integrated into the MacGuffin in an interesting twist. When Gilbert needs to recall the tune, he for once cannot remember it. All he can remember is The Wedding March. His failure to remember the MacGuffin, and more importantly, the tune which supplants it is indicative of what really matters: he and Iris are becoming romantically involved. The very thing which has `distracted' the characters from their romance with each other (and perhaps the viewer as well) suddenly reminds them (and us) of the central theme of the film. Hitchcock's use of The Wedding March is both an allusion to the probable future for Gilbert and Iris and a self-reflexive recognition of a filmic element-rare indeed for Hitchcock. MacGuffins distract characters from central themes; they don't remind them. Thus, Hitchcock's briefly reversed MacGuffin can be interpreted as a facetious interjection of wit-in other words, it's an inside joke for filmmakers.Interestingly, the MacGuffin's twist also provides an example of the romance versus espionage theme. The espionage is signified by the folk tune, and the romance is signified by the Wedding March. Careful consideration of the romance versus espionage theme reveals that they are not opposed, but complimentary. The romance between Gilbert and Iris does not hinder their sleuthing; rather, it facilitates it. Likewise, their budding romance is a derivative of the extraordinary circumstances that surround them; the two themes are inexorably linked. Unlike Vertigo, for example, where Judy's death is due to Scottie's (James Stewert) sleuthing-he is responsible for bringing her to the tower in the final scene-the espionage of The Lady Vanishes is often directly responsible for romantic interaction between Gilbert and Iris. `I'm just as popular as a dose of strychnine,' Gilbert tells Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas). He's referring to Iris-she's upset by his refusal to believe in Miss Froy's disappearance. *SPOILERS START HERE* In the next sequence, the train's chef throws the trash out the window, and Miss Froy's teabag sticks to the glass-the teabag Iris has just described to Gilbert. An ECU enunciates the shot's importance. Gilbert rushes back and sits down next to Iris. His sleuthing-his personal discovery of the tea-has confirmed Ms. Froy's disappearance and the legitimacy of Iris's claim. Thus espionage aids romance, just as their budding romance ensures a trust necessary for their espionage and the rescue of Miss Froy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British Hitchcock-lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1938 by Alfred Hitchcock on the eve of his departure to Hollywood, this enjoyable British comedy-thriller contains several features later to recur in Hitch's better-known American films - spying and nasty foreigners; disappearance and switched identity; action on a train; a developing affair between a couple who at first can't stand each other; and some pretty ropey effects and scenery, even for the '30s.Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave and the rest of the cast perform well in the stilted manner of much British film acting of that period. It would be nice to say that the movie also shows its age in its dependence on caricatures for most of its "foreign" characters, but that is still a common fault today. However, a saving grace is that the movie also pokes fun at some of the British characters, especially a couple of pompous, upper class men, obsessively interested in the national game of cricket, portrayed by Naughton Wayne and Basil Radford. This couple was so popular with the audience, that Wayne and Radford were used in the same roles in a few other movies.For all its merits, I can't agree with those IMDb posters who consider this a better early Hitchcock movie than The 39 Steps, which I feel has more breadth of action, and depth of character and emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excitement, Humor, &amp; Entertaining Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's most enjoyable British films, "The Lady Vanishes" has an exciting plot, a lot of humor, and a host of entertaining characters. It's a far-fetched story, but Hitchcock's skill is such that you rarely have the time to think about such mundane concerns as credibility while you are watching the action.The story starts a little slowly, but soon becomes intriguing. A cast of eccentric characters is travelling by train through a fictional nation that is apparently hostile to Britain. A middle-aged governess who had gotten on the train seems to have disappeared, and only one passenger on the whole train believes that she existed at all. This passenger (Margaret Lockwood) must figure out not only what happened to her friend, but why. Michael Redgrave plays her reluctant ally in the search, and the two have some fine scenes and dialogue together. Both give excellent performances.There is a very good supporting cast portraying some imaginative characters, and the setting inside the train is nicely done, creating a good atmosphere for the mystery. It all leads up to a climax that, while perhaps implausible, is quite exciting.This is a fine Hitchcock classic in the tradition of "North By Northwest" and his other lighter films. It's definitely worth seeing, and worth watching more than once for anyone who enjoys Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine movie and an enjoyable cast . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It saddens me when people compare todays technology with yesterdays movies, as if they somehow can't quite completely get into a film on it's own merits. I enjoy visiting the old classics, many times enjoying them over "modern" movies simply for their very style. Frankly, there are those who will always be short sighted and cannot see that in not too long a time, our modern movies, with their state of the art "CGI" will look equally as appalling as a "fake" train. In fact, CGI is so prevalent in today's films that this fact alone will be sure to annoy future generations. But there is something that rises above CGI and fake trains and always will, and that is a good story well told with interesting characters. The Lady Vanishes is such a story. Very enjoyable, funny, smart dialogue, and a crisp pace. I like when a film can take you somewhere else, can let you get involved with the story and characters. After that, I will accept the CGI and the fake trains as tools of the storyteller. Be sure to view the Criterion Collection version of this movie on DVD. The print is excellent, and the commentary is informative and interesting enough that you will watch the movie twice.And Margaret Lockwood is as much eye candy as you will see in any movie, anytime. This is a great film with a great history.</fullReview>

Cecil Parker, one of my personal favourites, is awfully young here and terribly serious, and as a man having a passionate affair, a tad too uptight. I completely missed Alfred's walk by, being caught up in the romantic conclusion. Sloppy continuity at times by Alfred's wife Alma. I give it an 8 because of the wonderful cast.

		<fullReview>The train out of Mandrika is delayed due to an avalanche. The passengers are forced to stay in an overcrowded inn. Miss Froy is a sweet English governess. World traveling rich girl Iris Henderson is vacationing with her two girlfriends before marrying once returns to England. At the train station, somebody drops something on Iris hitting her on the head. She passes out and Miss Froy takes care of her. After spending some time with Froy, Iris wakes up from a nap to find Miss Froy missing from their compartment. Some people have problems with English. Others claim that Iris has been alone. Nobody is willing to back up her recollections. Everybody has reasons to lie and dismisses Iris who had hit her head. The only one who's willing to help is the annoying musician Gilbert.This is a classic that has influenced many movies since. They have made versions of this on trains, and especially on planes like Flightplan. Hitchcock milks every bit of tension. The characters are so fun and unique. Many of the jokes still work after close to a century later. It does take a while to start the thriller part. The first 30 minutes is spend introducing the characters with lots of fun and joking around. Once the thriller starts, the tension builds quite effectively. Each character has their own reason to lie. It's quite a modern thrilling movie that doesn't let go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the past Christmas season I received the Alfred Hitchcock Collectors Set consisting of 13 Hitchcock films. I never really watched any of them until last night. I was shocked at the sheer suspense and adventure in this film considering its age. I had seen A. H. Psycho many times before, but this is in a completely different film from Psycho.The story is about a lady who is taking care of this woman on a train. This woman was hit in the head by something, so on the train she takes a nap and wakes up to find the lady missing and everybody on the train has denied seeing her. She teams up with this man who was rude at first in the film and later on became her side kick.There wasn't an empty moment in the film and it kept me very entertained the whole way through. From the collectors set that I received, The Lady Vanishes and The 39 Steps were by far the best films in the set. Buy it, I promise you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

And the pure and classic humor , a typical of Hitchcock. The cast is perfect,Iris Henderson is a playgirl who is about to get married, Gilbert a musician,a doctor,a magician,a newly wed couple,two Englishmen who seem to be interested only in cricket.You cannot have a better cast. Most of the film has been filmed on a train which i assume must have been a challenge and the 'difficult to shoot' camera angles make the film comparable even to today's Hollywood flicks.the plot still seems fresh. This one is surely a timeless classic.</fullReview>

She questions everybody on board but they all claim she came on alone. She gets young handsome Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) to believe her but what's wrong with everybody else? Very early Hitch film and one of his best. It's well-written (based on a stage play) and well-directed (of course) It also moves very quickly--it's full of interesting characters and situations. All the acting is good too even though Redgrave seems a little too subdued. Basically a good quick mystery. Well worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exquisitely crafted, heart-warmingly entertaining Hitchcock film! One of his VERY best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that I've just finished watching, and the smile that it left on my lips was itself incentive enough for me to want to write a review for this Hitchcock gem. Indeed, I wondered if I was being overly sentimental, but a few reviews left me reassured! And then, as I say, I just HAD to write one myself.The film, while typical Hitchcock in terms of "thriller" nature, its excellent pacing and its brilliant direction, is also amongst the most light-hearted. And seeing as it was one of the last of his British films, the "Britishness" of the excellent humour certainly tells. With the screen writing team of Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder working their magic, the movie is constantly witty--exemplified best by the comic obsessive cricket fixation of Charters and Caldicott, and enhanced by the barbed repartee between Iris and Gilbert, the two leads. Add to that the top notch acting of the whole cast and one sees that every aspect blends seamlessly to produce one of the most delightful cinematic experiences that can ever be had (that I've ever had, at least). And if this hasn't seen you running for the nearest DVD store, for further incentive, there is the ever graceful, stunningly pretty Margaret Lockwood who gives a performance that is as powerful as it is endearing. To quote another reviewer, "she somehow manages to be heart- stoppingly beautiful, supremely sexy, spirited, cute and adorably vulnerable all at the same time!" As he so rightly says, "Now where can I meet a girl like that?" Where O where?!?Watch it now and revel in a cinematic experience that is both joyous and fulfilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic movie, enjoyable, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through out the second half of the movie, i capitulated to my usual obsession, and started debating with myself if i should rate this movie as a 7, or an 8 here. There is no doubt that the movie shows a lot of masterpiece sparkles from Hitchcock - The plot is excellent, The dialog is Very funny at times, and the directing is brilliant. But - despite all my good will to become a real movie buff, and give credit to such masterpieces, the honest truth is that through many parts of the movie, i was bored, and I think that any modern movie lover who does not have any aspirations to be a cinematography student, would HAVE to be bored at times. These days we expect from a "Horror/Action" movie a lot of things, a fast going pace that will brace us, along with the all the effects to make us get excited ( disregarding the fact that most Horror/Action have become so mundane to make oneself want to kill himself ). And all these things this movie lacks, understandably since it was done before WW2 - yet still, somehow, it is very hard to really immerse yourself in the plot, without the occasional yawn. Another criticism is that as opposed to other movies i saw of Hitchcock, and other movies from the time, the characters all seem pretty flat to me, without almost any depth ( maybe it's because of the acting ? well except the 2 British blokes who were hilarious) , and that I do hold against the movie. But i lingered on the negative criticism only because i saw how high this movie was rated, and thought that some realistic counterpart should be in place. Still a great movie, Not really exciting, but still manages to get a good laugh from you, and provide an interesting view of the times back then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot to recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie truly presents a lot to recommend it. First, as an earlier work of Hitchcock, his next to last before leaving England for America, it fits superbly with his great later works, and is an fine precursor.It also presents a contemporary prewar view, very soon before England became fully-engaged in WW II. It also provides more continuing humor throughout than most of his later films, although a humorous touch was always an aspect of them.In addition to story, performances, etc., I think all of us also enjoy old films' showing us a completely-contemporary depiction of the period/times portrayed, rather than a later (or current) re-creation, however authentic the latter may appearReading about the standards imposed on Hollywood in earlier times (twin beds for married couples, the banning of some words which can appear even in "G-rated" work today, etc.), there are a couple of amusing scenes in this film which I'm sure were a bit "naughty" in 1938. These may be a reflection of a bit more leeway in England, or Hitchcock himself, probably some of each.When Redgrave goes into Lockwood's room at the hotel in an early scene, after she has had him ejected for the noise overhead, he threatens to sleep there, leaves his effects, hops over the bed, and goes into the bathroom, until she has the manager re-admit him to his quarters. And the two gentlemen, the cricket aficionados, act as if they are somewhat "closer" than just sports-fan buddies. At the hotel, the maid enters the room, and we see them in a narrow bed together, one without a pajama top (covers over his lower body). The other gets out of the bed, wearing only a top (like a heterosexual couple - man wearing the bottom, the woman the top).Nothing prurient, but an interesting touch, considering the period.Some have criticized the slower beginning of the film, but the scenes are interesting, well-establish the characters, and provide a good introduction for what follows; I don't feel this detracts, and this classic movie is a presentation well-worth viewing.</fullReview>

Traveling a great distance on a comfortable train (as opposed to hobo sling or empty reefer) is still the most exciting and satisfying way to do it. I think Hitchcock, a traveler, understood this and created an effective frame for the puzzle. Long journeys on a train bring people close while allowing boundaries to stand. There's always a bit of mystery. It's all here in this movie. I particularly love the "Two Gentlemen", who are terribly concerned about the "Test Match at Manchester. Cricket, man!"

		<fullReview>This will require a few more viewings to be certain, but right now I feel like "The Lady Vanishes" is my favorite early British Hitchcock film.Compared to some of his earlier films, this one is less experimental. It seems that Hitchcock is not quite as interested in testing the limits of the medium with this movie. His technique is more subtle than it usually is in these early British films. It has some great Hitchcock moments, so don't get the wrong impression, but this movie is more character oriented and not so concerned with delivering thrills.It's actually almost a comedy and I would describe it as a light comic adventure film with a touch of intrigue.. Most of the humor is very well done and it hasn't really aged much at all.Overall this movie has a unique place for itself in Hitchcocks filmography. I've never seen another of his films that I would directly compare with this one. It's quite unique, while still being obviously Hitchcockian and it might be one of his very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock as Patriot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great fan of this film for a number of reasons. The story is simple enough: an elderly British woman mysteriously disappears aboard a train, having befriended a young, rich socialite about to be married, and then is looked for by the young woman and her puppy-dog admirer insisting she was aboard while everyone else denies she was ever there in the first place. The script is really rather clever in this one. Sidney Gilliat's screenplay has lots of suspense, wit, humour, and red herrings laced throughout, but it is Hitchcock's great skills as a director that flesh them out and bring them to life. He also skillfully plays on the emotions, fears, and anxieties of his at-present audience as Germany begins devouring Europe and pushing Nazism on Austria. Though no Nazis are seen in this film and it takes place in a made-up country on the continent, there is no doubt to the viewer that Hitchcock is playing on nationalism and his dislike of Nazi Germany in this film. Ably assisting is the entire cast playing wonderful characters, though perhaps not with great loads of depth. Margaret Lockwood as the young woman and Michael Redgrave as her admirer do terrific jobs while all the time being playful, amusing, and affable. Dame May Witty gives her British best as the vanishing lady. But the film's most intriguing performances come from character actors like Paul Lukas, Cecil Parker, Naughton Wayne, and Basil Radford. Lukas oozes charm in a difficult role. Parker plays the Britsih snob to perfection. Wayne and Radford; however, are easily the best parts of the film as two British men trying to get back to London as fast as possible so as to see the cricket test match scores. These two men play off each other with wonderful timing and wit, and I laughed more at them and their motivations than you might expect in a Hitchcock thriller. The opening scene in a European village looks breathtaking for an obvious model, and some of the most suspenseful moments come on the train - one scene in the baggage department and another on a railway car stranded dead on the tracks. At the core of the story is espionage and what this espionage means to saving Europe and bringing Britain into the war/foreign problems that lie ahead. The Lady Vanishes is certainly one of Hitcock's best early films(along with the 39 Steps) and it remains one of his all around best for my money. There was a remake in 1979 with Cybil Shepherd and Elliot Gould as the young "couple" and Angela Lansbury as the human disappearing act. It is not that bad, but nowhere near as tautly constructed a film as this one is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The shocking thing about this movie is even though it was done in 1938, the style, technique, can be seen in virtually every action or thriller you see today. Hitch also does a great job with playing with stereotypical conventions of males and females, aggressions as far as not utilizing the typical things women can do or say within a movie. He also had a faint comedic element which made the suspense portions all the more intense. His camera technique regarding his shots was very claustrophobic which led you as a viewer to wonder was there even a lady present? this choice of shooting this way also allows us as viewers to question why this lady hasn't been found since the space appears to be so confined.

		<shortDescription>a many-sided masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who view "The Lady Vanishes" can be like blind men studying an elephant, seeing only one or two aspects of a complex beast. It is a mystery, thriller, character study, romance, and, don't forget, a SPY STORY! Hitchcock is working on many levels in this film. One must remember that the book (The Wheel Spins) and the movie were created at a time when there was great division of opinion in England over the proper attitude towards Hitler. In this regard, the movie doesn't just allude to the political tension in the world but makes the train a blatant allegory for anti-appeasement sentiments. Perhaps I am over-analyzing the parallels but I think they abound. The prime antagonist is not only Germanic, but is eloquently duplicitous and surreptitiously cunning. His paid henchmen are Italians. The British are schizophrenically depicted as petty, insouciant,bourgeois, and in denial (the two British "gentlemen") and forthright, brave, and vital (the "lady" and the two young protagonists). The lawyer is the corrupt pacifist, who, even when it is too late, cannot comprehend the destructiveness of his pacifism -- perhaps reflecting Hitchock's disdain for the legal political types who were blinded to the real dangers of Hitler. Even the train itself,the use of unconvincing "miniatures" at times, the disguising of the identity of the "lady", the magician storyline, etc. can be perhaps viewed as political metaphors, thickening even further the fabric of the subtext. That said, the movie also works on all the other levels mentioned and the genius of it is in the way all levels mesh quite seamlessly and with humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often labeled as the best movie in Hitchcock's British period, this movie certainly justifies the hype surrounding it. It's a wonderfully crafted tale of mystery, and conspiracies, all spiced up with the finest British dark humor of the time.The plot is so simple, but it's carried in a superb way that will have you enjoying every minute of it. Iris Henderson(played by beautiful Margaret Lockwood) meets a kind old lady named Mrs. Froy(Dame May Witty) while traveling continental Europe by train; suddenly, the lady disappears but everyone acts as if the lady had only existed in Iris' mind. It's up to Iris and Gilbert(Michael Redgrave), the only man who believes in her, to find Mrs. Froy.The technical aspects of the movie are awesome for it's time. Hitchcock was showing a constant perfectionism that explain the perfection of his work in America. Intelligent use of visuals give us a beautiful camera-work, all improved by an outstanding edition. Even in this early stages the master of suspense knew how to use the language of cinema.And as if that was not enough, the acting of the entire cast is the crowning jewel of this masterpiece. Everyone gives a great performance; no matter how small the role is, the cast is superb. Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne shine as the British gentlemen whose only concern is the cricket. The couple display the finest example of how "comic relief" characters should work.The whole script really helps this magic to exist. Even when it spends almost 20 minutes introducing us to the characters and their relationships, it's never boring and Hitchcock keeps the pace to unfold the script while keeping us entertained and intrigued.I could write pages and pages about this masterpiece, but the bottom line is that no matter if you dislike it(not everyone likes old movies), this is a movie that every film lover should watch at least once in a lifetime.9/10.</fullReview>

Little carnage, not much danger to speak of, fast-paced dialogue and action and set pieces. At the beginning there's almost a silent-film sensibility to shot selection, sound effects and composition.Does Clarinet Man fall for Miss Why's This Napkin Around My Neck all the Time too quickly? Sure. Does he buy into her admittedly far-fetched story right away? Yup. Is this an awful lot of trouble just to catch a spy? Oh my, yes. Just roll with it and enjoy this train ride. Have some herbal tea and trust all those Mexicans :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Hitchcock spy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film on all counts. Smartly written characters were superbly brought to life by a talented cast. The relationship between the leads is most enjoyable to watch develop. Ms. Lockwood is excellent. The suspense is maintained throughout and is very satisfyingly guided through before being most satisfyingly resolved. I cannot recommend this film enough not only to Hitchcock fans, who no doubt will flock to it, but also spy movie fans. I recently watched it again and now have a greater appreciation for the way Hitchcock introduces and establishes the characters before they get on the train. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a good Hitchcock film, but not quite a classic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good Alfred Hitchcock film from 1938. Travelers are snowed in at a European resort hotel when an avalanche prevents their train from going on. An American woman draws a European man into her search for a genial elderly woman who mysteriously disappears from the train when it resumes its trip. She tries to convince fellow passengers that something strange is going on, but has an uphill battle until the exciting climax of the film. I would classify "The Lady Vanishes" as very good, but not quite a classic. I have seen this movie half a dozen times and in my estimation, the suspense doesn't hold up to multiple viewings quite as well as some other Hitchcock classics such as "Strangers on a Train", "The Thirty-Nine Steps" or even the lesser known Hitchcock near classic, "Young and Innocent", which has more chemistry between its principal characters. Still, this an enjoyable film, well worth watching for movie fans. 86/100 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>early Hitchcock that set the tone for his later work......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lady Vanishes" was an entertaining movie that certainly falls into the realm of Hitchcock, mainly an innocent person falling into a web of international intrigue. In this case the person is Margaret Lockwood, who gives an excellent performance that doesn't indulge in the melodrama of the day. I like how Hitchcock keeps most of the action of the movie on a train, keeping character interaction to a maximum. However, the movie gets a little silly towards the end and doesn't have that trademark suspense we've come to know and love. There are shots that are reminiscent of his later works, like the close up of the cups that he has in "Notorious". It is also fun to see him working with miniature sets. His use of the train here is better than "Number 17", and it is clear that his learning process was a quick one. The only problem is that the story doesn't hold together as well as I'd have liked, but I might just be asking to much. Either way its still a good movie. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes, as Hitchcock's last British film, shows the culmination of the precious two decades of his film making. Sometimes good, sometimes not, Hitchcock continually experimented, and The Lady Vanishes brings all that experimentation to a head.The plot is excellent and well-paced, a spy-thriller that is unlike many stereotypical spy-thrillers. The acting is fantastic, the chemistry between leading man and leading lady is amazing. Humor abounds throughout the movie, adding just the right to touch to the movie's slightly sinister air.All told, this joins Young and Innocent, The Man Who Knew Too Much and The 39 Steps as the greatest of the British Hitchcocks.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Train stars in comedy thriller, actors left behind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must be one of the first feature films to star a train. From the moment about 30 minutes in when it appears, the trans-Alpine express is the essence of The Lady Vanishes, literally carrying the movie forward and enabling the action. If you are a North American deprived of rail transport, this 1938 picture will show how your rail system could be in 10 or 15 years when you have started to build it. Passengers will relate to each other, intrigues will develop and romances will bud aboard your rail system. Alfred Hitchcock makes the most of this in The Lady Vanishes, a harmless comedy that exerts some charm until it dissolves into schoolboyish bang-bang nonsense at the end. Most of the characters are stereotypes, if amusingly enough written: the English cricket obsessives, the snooty lawyer and his mistress, the scheming foreigner, the county lady who is really a spy, the clever debutante, and the chalet-boy with a private income. Hitch was a lower-middle-class fellow from East-End London himself, and ridiculing these upper-class stereotypes was the key to his success with prole cinema crowds. However, uncertainties still show through, as when the suitor Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) barges into the bedroom of love-interest Iris (Margaret Lockwood) and climbs straight on to the bed in which she lies, announcing that he intends to get in with her. I think today we find that cavalier contempt for her privacy and dignity offensive, not funny. But probably what is most dated now is the stagey shoot-out that climaxes the picture and ruptures the plot's development. The glaring plot-holes we can overlook, but an exchange of gun-fire conducted unconvincingly and at length threatens to induce a yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK suspense film with some propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's "The Lady Vanishes" is a decent suspense film that holds up for me in some ways but doesn't really excite me the way his best suspense films even of the following decade do. However it does have some interesting psychological angles, and its depiction of a menacing foreign power manipulating our lives is vague enough to help make its own brand of paranoia timeless.Iris, (Margaret Lockwood) a young lady on a train bound from an un-named European country back to some place more hospitable to British folk, meets a kind old lady who mysteriously disappears. No one admits to seeing her at all; it turns out some are part of a foreign conspiracy while some are simply afraid to tell the truth because it would delay their arrival at a cricket match or expose an adulterous situation. The only one she's able to convince is the rakish Gilbert (Michael Redgrave).I guess digging just a bit, I could see a few interesting themes here beyond just the functionality of the story. There's a propaganda aspect to the film that goes beyond some posters visible in the dining car ? of the 2 couples who knowingly deny the old lady's presence, one couple (the 2 male cricket fans) eventually become active defenders of the "lady" and the train, while the man in the adulterous relationship says it's madness to fight the foreigners (basically thinly disguised Nazis), runs out of the train and gets killed. In that way he's punished both for his adultery but more so for refusing to fight the menace. I saw this as a repudiation of the strategy of appeasement and also more broadly could be applied as a kind of attack on pacifism (the man waves a white flag as he's gunned down). And perhaps you could even speculate that Hitchcock hoped for this message to reach America with this film. In fact you could see the whole film as a metaphor for that type of political denial. When Iris says that something horrible has happened to the old lady but everyone is too busy with cricket games and so forth to pay attention, I'm reminded again of appeasement and of the kind of denial that people treated the Nazi menace with originally. That attitude of "oh, that's too horrible to be true, so you must be insane to think it." So that was an interesting subtext going on in the film ? popular consensus can masquerade as the truth but it's not the same thing, particularly when the truth is so horrible and seemingly random that nobody wants to believe it.Very good performances, especially from Redgrave and Dame May Witty, who played the vanishing lady (I recognized her from her even more endearing performance in "Night Must Fall"). It's got some sober moments but for the most part it's a self-conscious lark, and displays Hitchcock's gift for combining suspense with comedy by focusing on the central characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The pacing is a touch slow, the mystery is somewhat flat, and the ending feels rather a bit rushed and conventional, but this is otherwise a good piece of cinema, which for its time is very well made. Some of the editing techniques are rather clever, in particular the ones used to project the main character's dizziness, and the film manages to touch on some ideas about why people withhold evidence and avoid becoming involved with cases where they could be useful. Even if the mystery does not keep one glued, and the performances do impress, there are enough virtues in this early Hitchcock film to make it worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's British films were delightful in that they all have a "lightness" that the master abandoned when he arrived in America. Most of these films have equal parts of comedy and suspense. In this film. Mr. Hitchcock creates a great film that heralds what will come in a short time to Europe and will change the world with WWII.This is a classic film that will endure the passing of time. All the elements are in place for the viewer to solve the mystery presented. We are given clues, although Mr. Hitchcock plays with our perception of what is real and what's not. The cast was an inspired one. Margaret Lockwood is earthy and brunette, not the blonde heroine the director favored in most of his films. Michael Redford is also excellent in the film, as is Dame May Whitty and the rest of the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a poor film.It seems to be trying to be a drama, comedy, slapstick and farce all in one but failing badly in all areas. Even for a film made so long ago and in the period leading up to war it appears poor. The fight scene in the luggage compartment of the train was particularly hammy and amateurish. It seemed like a pantomime scene and a bad pantomime scene at that. Unrealistic and so badly done it made it stand out as a particular low point amongst many.The part where a couple of stereotypically portrayed bumbling Englishmen with a couple of pistols are able to stop troops from taking the train is ridiculous. The old lady spy is allowed to just run away and escape with no real attempt by the enemy troops to stop her. That is laughable but not meant to be I don't think. This was made when Europe was close to war and was presumably meant to show that Britain would stand up and fight but it isn't even a good propaganda film because of the laughable stereotypes and hammy nature of the whole thing.This hasn't got anything going for it. The actors can't really perform because their characters are more like pantomime ones and the corny action scenes just look amateurish and totally unconvincing. Not good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cautionary Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was made in 1938, when Neville Chamberlain was trying to avoid war with Germany. His efforts are now derisively referred to as appeasement, which is often alluded to when someone counsels peace and diplomacy rather than military engagement. Although Alfred Hitchcock was always more interested in entertaining us than anything else, this movie comes across as a cautionary tale, warning England of the dangers of Chamberlain's appeasement policy.Charters and Caldicott are more interested in the cricket match they are reading about on the back pages of the newspaper, while the serious political news on the front page is ignored. And they pretend they have not seen the missing Miss Froy, because they figure nothing really bad could have happened to her, and they do not want the train delayed, lest it cause them to miss the cricket match they hope to see when they get back to England. They represent the dangerous complacency of the British people.The train they are on is in a European country run by a dictator. All the foreigners on that train act suspicious and untrustworthy, and all seem to be part of a conspiracy to deny the existence of Miss Froy, and then to try to pass off another woman as a substitute. As the foreigners seem to be either Germanic or Italian, they represent Hitler and Mussolini, whom the movie is saying cannot be trusted.But as the danger becomes undeniable, the British passengers all start pulling together, even the spy posing as a nun, since she is of British origin. Thus the movie is optimistically saying that once the British people are shaken from their complacency, they will rally together and defeat the foreign aggressors.The one exception is Todhunter. Though he is British, yet he wants to surrender to the soldiers trying to get control of the train, rather than to fight. He is derided as being a pacifist, and compared to Christians who got thrown to the lions. When he insists on surrendering on his own, getting off the train waving a white handkerchief, he is contemptuously shot, and falls to the ground muttering words of bewildered protest. So much for pacifism.When we first meet Miss Froy, obviously an old maid, she comes across as whimsical and sentimental, boring Charters and Caldicott with her talk about the beautiful country. As she parts from them, she remarks that we should not judge a country by its politics, noting that the English are quite honest by nature, implying that the British government sometimes is not. The implication is that the basically good people of a country can be betrayed by their government, but that the goodness of ordinary folk will ultimately prevail. Because Miss Froy is the last person you would expect to be a spy, her example implies that the rest of us have no excuse for not doing our part. If a little old lady can risk her life in the fight against evil enemies, dodging bullets as she runs across the countryside of a hostile nation, we all are capable of making at least some small contribution ourselves.But entertainment always comes first in an Alfred Hitchcock movie, so none of this anti-appeasement propaganda gets in the way of a good adventure story.</fullReview>

Some comic moments, the dancers in Michael Redgraves room come to mind. As well as the two cricket fans (I had to rewind to check that one of them referred to a non-fan who didn't know the cricket score as a 'silly arse'). The film may seem dated to some,(it was made in 1938 and Ms Froy refers to a cramped space as being on the London underground in the rush hour) but please watch it and not the remakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lady Vanishes, The (1938) **** (out of 4) When an elderly woman (Dame May Witty) goes missing only a young woman (Margaret Lockwood) seems to have seen her. With the assistance of a man (Michael Redgrave) and doctor (Paul Lukas) she tries to piece together what happened or perhaps the old woman never existed at all. Whenever the director's great movies are discussed this one here never gets mentioned even though wherever you look it gets four-stars. It says a lot for a director when a film is considered one of the best of its kind yet it doesn't even get mentioned when the man's filmmography is discussed. This is without question the best of Hitchcock's early films due in large part to a great script, great acting and some terrific direction. What works best in the film is how simple the actual story is. That's not to say there aren't any twists and turns but for the most part the title says it all as we have a woman who vanishes and there's a rather simple reason behind it even though the viewer won't catch on until late in the film. What works extremely well is the humor that is spread throughout with the best example coming from the fight sequence in the baggage cart. The way the fight is handled was masterfully done and Redgrave's comic timing is wonderful. Redgrave, to me anyways, steals the film with his charm and laid back comic approach. Lockwood, Witty and Lukas are all very good as well as is the rest of the supporting cast including Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford. In the end this film will probably never get the full credit that it deserves but more and more people are becoming aware of it, which is never a bad thing. There were many, many British thrillers throughout the decade but this one here is clearly the best of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a charming early Hitchcock comedy about a woman (Margaret Lockwood) who gets hit on the head and is cared for by an elderly Englishwoman (Dame May Witty), who mysteriously vanishes on a train. It was, in fact, his last British film before heading to America and Hollywood.After she vanishes, everyone denies ever seeing her. Only Michael Redgrave comes to her aid and helps her search for the woman. The comedy part of the movie is over, and now we change to a thriller. Their search uncovers a conspiracy as the woman has some valuable information.The final part of the film is something of an action film as there is a big shootout and an escape by train. We have a little North by Northwest, and The General in the film, as well as The 39 Steps.It was all good fun.</fullReview>

I hear they appear in another Hitch film, and I'd love to see them again.The two leads are sparky and amiable, and Paul Lukas makes a great villain. What really gets me is how the only person our heroine thinks she can trust is the mustachioed East European doctor...The plot is somewhat convoluted, all revolving round spies and a thinly disguised pre-war Europe. Dame May Witty appears as the titular lady who may have more to do with the conspiracy than first thought.The film is very British: check out Charters' reaction to being shot near the end. Hitchcock is much lighter here, before his move across the pond, but his gift for direction still shines through, in spite of the hilariously fake sets.All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable little mystery from a master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvelous mish-mash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing ordinary about this tongue-in-cheek thriller, arguably on par with Hitchcock's more well-known earlier classic, "The Thirty Nine Steps", a true masterpiece of the suspense genre.The bulk of the action takes place in a train where a matronly lady by the name of Miss Froy suddenly and mysteriously disappears without a trace, the only witness to the fact that she even existed in the first place being a young lady named Iris who by chance befriended the old woman just prior to departure. Undeterred by the fact that none of the other passengers will admit to any recollection of seeing the missing lady, Iris is determined to solve the mystery and in the process is forced to enlist the help of a free-spirited musicologist named Gilbert, who in their initial encounter the previous evening only succeeded in arousing her utmost antipathy (and visa-versa). Gilbert's infectious insouciance is admirably contrasted with Iris's single-minded severity, and the resulting blend provides a wonderful counterpoint to the taut suspense that propels the action-- somewhat reminiscent of the engaging repartee between hand-cuffed Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll in "The Thirty Nine Steps". As they say, a film is only as good as its minor actors, and the Fellini-esquire montage of bizarre and enigmatic figures that populate the various berths and compartments of our train excel. Of particular note is the Mutt and Jeff duo of Caldecott and Charters, whose obsession with cricket scores just has to belie a more sinister motive, or does it? And the scuffle with the magician Signor Doppo amidst an array of false doors is priceless (pay special note of the three rabbits in the hat). Miss Froy just had to be hidden behind one of his props!The only unequivocally sinister figure in this mish-mash is a certain Dr. Hartz of Prague, splendidly caricatured by Hungarian Paul Lukas. His unctious medicalese and feigned concern for Iris' obsession with finding Miss Froy couldn't be a better foil to the more light-hearted excesses of most of the other characters. And his final lines provide a penetrating epilogue to this off-beat thriller.I've always contended that the best of Hitchcock's early British talkies were generally superior to the more conventional suspense yarns of his Hollywood years, most of which never quite had the staying power of the earlier films. Needless to say, the marvelous combination of wit and suspense present in "The Lady Vanishes" goes a long way in proving my point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incidentally, Alfred Hitcock made two other comedies besides "Trouble With Harry": Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941) and Family Plot (1976).I thought this movie was a nice little mystery. It's British and from the 30s; a world far removed from mine in the U.S. in the 21st century. The leads are pleasing and propel the story forward. There's a romance and some spies. Train travel seems so relaxing. You can have a pot of tea and cross a country border all at the same time.I can see why some modern viewers find this movie boring. There are not explosions happening and the effects are dated, yes. To the modern viewer brought up on Star Wars it's a totally different animal, and not to everyone's taste. TLV is a well-done story of personality and situation, secret identities, conspiracy.I recognized the ripoffs from this movie in the ads for Flight Plan. Naturally, movie makers of today are going to recycle stories and update them for modern audiences; it doesn't mean the movie's better, it's just more in line with what you're used to seeing. I personally like the old movies better sometimes; slower, more charming. The cricketeers and the adulterous couple were not terribly necessary to the plot, but they were an amusing diversion. Side plots like this would be scissored onto the cutting room floor today.All in all, if you can deal with a slow start and a veddy British atmosphere, by all means rent this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes is one of those movies where you could just sit down and watch anytime it is on. The film moves quickly, is fun throughout, and will leave you with a smirk on your face throughout.The script is nicely put together, and the actors seem to be enjoying themselves throughout. The two leads make a humorous amateur detective duo, and they have nice chemistry together. The two Brits obsessed with cricket bring comic relief whenever they're on screen. The movie does a good job of letting us know a little about all of these characters before tossing them into the pressure cooker that is the train ride central to the plot of the film. Like i said, its just fun to watch all these guys go.The movie is not without it's faults, but I'm willing to let most of these slide seeing as it was made in '38 (the models are embarrassing but oh well). The only thing that does bother me though, is it seems like a scene is missing near the end of the movie. There is no real conclusion to what happens to one of the German soldiers, and there isn't really an implied answer either. It's almost like they ran out of time and didn't film the scene.Early Hithcock that holds it weights in shear enjoyability compared to his later masterpieces. The Lady Vanishes is a strong ***1/2 / ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? I've always been a fan of Hitchcock's but I wasn't really on fire for his work until I got this one from the library. I checked it out so often I decided to buy it (the Criterion DVD is pretty good, if a little light on extras). This is a movie so breezy, fun, intriguing, and surprisingly lacking in morbidity (for a Hitchcock movie), how can you not watch it, no matter what your mood? Call me crazy but this is good escapist entertainment, the characters, even the villains, are so endearing you wish you could meet them (with the exception of Eric Todhunter, who everybody wants to slug). Ms. Froy, the hotel manager, the doctor, the nun, Caldicott &amp; Charters, and especially our two heros (Michael Redgrave gives one of my favorite performances in this movie).In case you don't know, the basic story is that in a tiny, fictional, and somewhat backwards European country, an English girl meets a little old English lady, a governess. On a train back home, the girl wakes up to find the little old lady is missing from her seat, and everybody on board denies that they ever saw her, including the passengers sitting right next to her, so she sets off to find out just what's going on, enlisting the help of a arrogant British man named Gilbert. Stop reading this, just go watch it already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a very good hitchcock movie, some scenes where ahead of it's time and almost the whole cast is great. the first half hour is extremely comical, there's a joke every five seconds and it doesn't seem like a suspense movie. in the second half hour the tension and suspense begins to appear, when we learn about the dissapearing of mrs troy. the last half hour is the climax of the film and when we learn what happened with mrs troy.direction is great and also most of the shots, but some scenes are ridiculous (for example the whole nun stuff), but the biggest flaw is mary day witty as mrs troy, she acts terrible and she was wrongfully miscast, but we can all forgive the master of suspense.special mention to the couple of guys who want to see a criquet match (caldicott and charters) who are extremely funny. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's early British works and his best at the time of it's release. Almost like a rehearsal for North by Northwest, 'Vanishes' is an extremely engaging film bringing together the strands of thriller, mystery and comedy and effortlessly weaving them together. The script is consistently witty and there's a whole host of well defined, engaging characters that play against each other perfectly. Definitely one of Hitchcock's best, which means one of the best films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While "Rear Window" and "Vertigo" are in my opinion Hitchcock's finest cinematic achievements, "The Lady Vanishes" ranks up among his best for sheer enjoyment (alongside with "North by Northwest" and "To Catch a Thief").If you're able to ignore the rough technical look of the film, this is first-class entertainment; a tasteful blend of comedy, mystery, romance, and even action, plus a cavalcade of great characters. Therefore I rank it higher than "The 39 Steps", which is widely considered Hitch's best of his early British films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Older Hitchcock film about tourist Lockwood discovering that an elderly traveling companion (Whitty) has mysteriously disappeared off the train they're riding in, with the majority of the other passengers denying that the old lady even existed, only to unravel a sinister scheme. Cricket enthusiasts Charter and Caldicott (Wayne and Radford) are the peak of the movie, and proved to be so popular at the time that they were featured in three other films. But for its era, THE LADY VANISHES is a somewhat underwhelming thriller in terms of a satisfactory conclusion. There are a couple of instances of odd fade-ins and fade-outs, plus some seemingly overelaborate development in the first act at the "Gasthof Petrus" inn in the fictitious country of Bandrika. Based on the 1936 novel The Wheel Spins by Ethel Lina White.**? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A somewhat overlooked Hitchock masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one thinks of Hitchock, films like Psycho, Rear Window or North By Northwest usually come to mind. This however is a hidden gem and is well worth a look.The story focuses on a young English woman (played by Margaret Lockwood, rather well if I may add) who is on her way home from a holiday from some mountainous European country. Before leaving, she meets at her hotel an older woman with whom she becomes friends and they sit together in the same cabin on the train. However after a quick nap, she finds the lady missing and it seems as if nobody has seen her. A mystery starts to unravel...This is certainly the predecessor of such films as Flightplan where someone goes missing and the main character must find that person and figure out who she/he can trust and who not. The film is an excellent thriller by the master of the genre- Hitchock. Just when the situation seems hopeless, another clue is given and we follow the main character on her road of discovery. Helping her is an Englishman (played by Michael Redgrave), to whom we're introduced a little earlier in the story.The structure of this film certainly is similar to that of similar films today. It starts off slowly, introducing us to the characters, then brings in the conflict. As the tension grows, so does the excitement, leading to a big action filled finale. I was happy to see that they didn't bother much with any overly melodramatic moments (which are usually amplified even further by the film's soundtrack which however was quite nice and fitting in this one). The only problem is that due to the film's age, the sound quality is quite inconsistent in its quality. Overall an excellent thriller and you can certainly see from where the films of today got their inspiration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was genuinely entertained by "The Lady Vanishes", however I can't help wondering why the film garners such rave reviews along with it's standing in the IMDb film rankings. I'll readily admit that maybe it's me, as I've found myself against the majority from time to time.The premise of the film is an intriguing one, a pair of women board a train in a mythical central European country. Though unknown to each other they form a friendly bond, and while Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) sleeps off the effects of a bump on the noggin from an offending flower box, her elderly companion simply disappears. It turns out that Miss Froy (Dame May Witty) is an English spy (?) who harbors a secret regarding a pact between two countries.Miss Henderson finds a willing accomplice to the mystery in Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave), who provides many a witty and comical retort to situations that arise. Both find themselves confiding in the respectable Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas) when no one believes Miss Henderson's claim; it turns out Hartz is the mastermind behind the kidnap plot. The repartee between Henderson and Redman is quick and snappy, reminiscent of Nick and Nora Charles in the "Thin Man" series.The first element that works against the film for me is the gun battle at a train stop. Now I know pistols can be deadly, but didn't it seem that the good guys were just a little too accurate in dispatching villain after villain from a fair distance? Then, when Redman forces the train engineers to get moving again, the curious ballistics that take out the railroad men is just too unbelievable.The kicker though is the manner in which Miss Froy's secret is to be delivered to her government. It's to be found in the tune of a song that she teaches Redman how to hum in case something happens to her. Fortunately, Miss Froy makes the rest of the journey safely, because jolly old Redman has his mind on other matters (Miss Henderson), and forgets the tune! One thing though, no matter how novel an idea may seem in modern films, they usually show up in something that went before. On the train, it takes Miss Henderson a while, but she eventually remembers that Miss Froy wrote her name on a window when she couldn't be heard above the noise. Pointing it out to Redman helps convince him that Iris isn't batty. Jody Foster's character would find herself in similar circumstances with identical support in this year's thriller - "Flightplan".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's 2nd to last British based film in the thirties is this classic little tale of a little old lady (played in such sweetness by Dame May Whitty) who disapears on a train. What makes this such an interesting story to unfold in the Hitchcok tradition is that is starts off as almost a comedy of manners. Margaret Lockwood, staying in an inn, is disturbed by an odd music playing and a clumping from her ceiling. Above her the manager finds clarinet player Michael Redgrave playing to a trio dancing around in a circle. Seeing this I laughed out loud, not remembering until the first murder that I was about to see a good old Hitchcokian story unfold.

		<shortDescription>One of the best of Hitchcock's earlier thrillers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady Vanishes is the last of a string of six thrillers that Hitchcock released in the 1930, associating him with the thriller genre for the rest of his career. The film starts off with a panning shot of a less than convincing model of a town, portraying the avalanche that has trapped a whole train full of passengers in a remote hotel until the tracks can be cleared. We see a conglomeration of the typical types of people all thrown into the same place, eventually getting onto a train together after the audience has had a chance to get to know them and the situations that are to make up the rest of the film.Two businessmen (you may recognize them as the ones that oddly showed up in my review of The 39 Steps) are on the train and are entirely too concerned about a cricket match that they stand to miss if the train is delayed too much. They have been cut off from communications with London, and have been rendered virtually helpless because of it. A woman named Iris who is entirely too concerned with getting married runs into a spectacularly obnoxious musician who she can't seem to get away from from the moment she meets him. It's interesting to consider some of the messages that Hitchcock passes in this film through his traditional brand of cynical humor, such as the fact that a musician is introduced as horribly aggravating but ultimately turns out to be one of the heroes in the film, as well as such things like a man who serenades early in the film is strangled soon thereafter, as well as the fact that marriage is presented very early on as something that should only be done after everything else in life has already been done.(spoilers) Just before everyone boards the train in the morning, there is an important attempt on an old woman's life that results instead in the young brunette looking to get married getting hit on the head by a falling planter. This scene is important because it shows that there is someone out to get this old lady, and it also provides the excuse given to Iris (the brunette) later in the film as she tries to investigate the disappearance of the woman, who becomes her friend on the train. You would think that someone with such important information as this lady is carrying would not be such a social butterfly with a stranger on a train, but either way, the knock that Iris took on the head just before getting on the plane provides a perfect way to get her to believe that she imagined Froy (the old woman) when she disappears. One thing that I was a little bothered by during Iris's initial investigation was the fact that she never even thought to look on the window where Froy had written her name with her finger. They were going through a tunnel when they were introducing themselves, and the train became too noisy for Iris to be able to hear Froy's name, so Froy wrote it on the window with her finger. Because it would have been so much more normal to just wait a few seconds for the train to quiet down rather than writing on the windows, you would think that this little quirk of Froy's would have struck Iris as something to check for later when everyone is telling her that she imagined the old woman and that she was never there in the first place.At any rate, Iris takes a nap early in the film and wakes up to find Froy gone, and a freaky lady across from her who looks like the Bride of freaking Frankenstein says that there was never an old woman there, and the search begins. The investigation that Iris conducts in search of her friend provides the body of much of this fascinating film, and Iris's musician friend from the hotel joins her for a good portion of it, becoming the second of the two ordinary people involved in extraordinary events in this film. The two businessmen on the train (again, you know them from my review of The 39 Steps, I watched these movies too close together!) provide much of the comic relief during the film as they are constantly concerned with getting back to London in time for a cricket match, despite even the most deadly conditions aboard the train, and the musician from early in the film provides a rather unwelcome partner in investigating Froy's disappearance.There are several interesting montages in this film. Editing is one of the most powerful tools that Hitchcock put to use in many of his early films, and it is used to great extent here, although not always with clear meaning. I am curious about the extensive montages that are shown of the exterior of the train as it begins moving, as well as between scenes on the moving train. But there are also montages that are very clever and very effective, such as the one in the middle of the movie in which Iris looks at all of the people sharing the cabin on the train with her and realizes that they all bear some physical resemblance to Froy, suggesting that maybe she really did imagine her as so many people have been telling her. That was, after all, a pretty nasty bump on the head.Late in the film there is the necessary addition of the blurring of the lines between the good and the bad guys. The neurologist who travels around performing miraculous brain surgery turns out to be not such a great guy, and the nun wearing suspicious high heels also turns out to be not quite as suspicious as she is initially portrayed. We are left unaware of who can be trusted and who is telling the truth, constantly questioning which side each person is on, even the musician and the two businessmen.In the shootout scene at the end of the film, we get the most tense and most amusing scene in the entire film. There is a lengthy shootout involving a shortage of ammunition and nowhere to run, during which the businessmen, who are themselves participating in the shooting, casually mention things like how they'll never make it on time for the match NOW, and when they are told what is happening, they don't believe it. They express one of the widespread public opinions that allows Hitchcock to be so successful with films about ordinary people in extraordinary situations ? `Things like that just don't happen.' There is also, I might mention, a curious duality in the title of the film. I read an interview of Hitchcock somewhere where he was explaining that the title refers to both the disappearance of Froy as well as the subsequent disappearance of the `lady' that Iris is at the start of the film and the emergence of the investigator that she becomes. This is a duality that is reflected in many other areas of the film, not the least of which is the fact that, like many other Hitchcock films, The Lady Vanishes contains an unusual but surprisingly effective juxtaposition of comedy and tension, resulting in an entertaining thriller that can make you laugh just as much as it can make you nervous.</fullReview>

And everyone claims that Iris Henderson was alone. So now, you don't know what's happening. Miss Froy must exist, you saw her with Iris Henderson.

		<shortDescription>A fine pre-war thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic Hitchcock film opens more like a comedy than a thriller as we are introduced to the cast in an hotel in a fictional European country. There is Iris Henderson, a beautiful young Englishwoman who is heading back to England to marry; Gilbert, a man who has been studying the local music; Mrs Froy, a governess, a pair of men desperate to get back in time for the final day of a cricket match and a couple having an affair. In the crowded hotel Gilbert manages to offend Miss Henderson who befriends Mrs Froy. As they wait for the train somebody pushes a flowerpot of a ledge; at is aimed at Mrs Froy but hits Iris. She is stunned but soon recovers and has tea with Mrs Froy. After a nap things take a strange turn; there is no sign of Mrs Froy and nobody in the compartment admits seeing her. A doctor on board speculates she imagined everything due to concussion but she insists she didn't starts asking everybody else; for one reason or another people deny seeing the old woman; only Gilbert wants to help her and he never actually saw Mrs Froy. As they search things get more sinister and eventually everybody is in real danger.Many of Hitchcock's films can be considered classics and this is certainly one of them. The plot has been repeated several times but it still effective even if the viewer has seen other versions of the story first. The comic opening of the film nicely introduces the cast and contrasts with the sense of paranoia once Mrs Froy has vanished and nobody believes Iris. The cast to a good job; Margaret Lockwood believably portray's Iris's sense of paranoia and Michael Redgrave manages to make Gilbert likable despite the character being introduces as a bit of a cad. In supporting roles Dame May Witty is good as Mrs Froy; the gentle old woman with a secret and Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford are fun as cricket mad Caldicott and Charters. Not surprisingly Hitchcock manages to keep the tension rising till the final confrontation where we learn just why the villains wanted to make the lady vanish. Overall an enjoyable film that is a must see for Hitchcock fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lady vanishes is a unique film to say the least. The pacing is a little slow in the beginning, and the plot stretches itself a little too thin. The hotel scenes were rather pointless to the plot. I found myself bored and even dulled at times. The atmosphere was rather weak and the music did not seem to stimulate a response. However, there are performances to be admired in this film. Margret Lockwood's acting surprised and entertained to the very end. She carried the film quite well and managed to evoke sympathy. Her performance is the number one reason a viewer should watch the Lady vanishes. There are also many other quirky and unique characters that give the film a sense of substance and depth. The search for Miss Froy is a long and suspenseful one. Hitchcock succeeds in the fact that he managed to make the middle of the film somewhat adventurous and interesting. However, the last 30 minutes fail to reach a satisfying conclusion. The actions of the characters become predictable and the film becomes tedious.I recommend this film to who ever loves the works of early Hitchcock. The lady vanishes is no masterpiece, but the story does manage to entertain and captivate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hinting at the war to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time "The Lady Vanishes" reached the screen, Alfred Hitchcock had made quite a reputation for himself and had left in his wake a string of movie triumphs (and failures) that made the public sit up and take notice. The New York Film Critics honored him as best director of 1938 for this picture, yet "The Lady Vanishes" is more a disappointment than a cause for celebration. Its intentions are noble enough; Hitchcock stirs up a spirit of English patriotism and solidarity against a common, albeit unnamed foe. (It was maybe a year or so after its release that World War II broke out.)Intentions aside (or maybe because of them), the director from whom movie audiences came to expect urbane amusements and vicarious thrills here seems to be repeating himself. A glaring example is the actor-hanging-out-of-the-train shot which he had done earlier. Something else he had done before--the image over an image--he had executed to more magnetic effect elsewhere.Even the acting suffers by comparison. The principals Michael Redgrave and Margaret Lockwood may have redeemed themselves in a movie that opened a year later--"The Stars Look Down"--but here exhibit qualities fans had not come to expect from Hitchcock's movie characters--a kind of middle-class fustiness and complacency.What "The Lady Vanishes" lacks is the intrigue and tension of Hitchcock's flawed "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1934); the wit and sophistication of his brilliant "The 39 Steps" (1935); the depth and originality of his box-office flop *Sabotage* (1936); or the climactic revelation in black-face of his lightweight "Young and Innocent" (1937). What it possesses must have been a twist of sorts for audiences then--a warm, friendly, fubsy sort of woman in tweed as spy--the venerable Dame May Whitty in a genial performance as the practically imperceptible Miss Froy. With the ever-Germanic Paul Lukas and the ever-English Cecil Parker, Naunton Wayne, and Basil Radford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I really want to say that I liked it. Most people do. Any Hitchcock fan, when pressed, will probably admit that he likes this one the best. I'm sure of it. François Truffaut, in his book on Hitchcock, said that every time he watched the movie he tried to study the camera angles, to work out how various shots were pulled off, and so forth, and he each time he ended up simply being caught up in the story. Normally I wouldn't trust Truffaut's opinion on Hitchcock in the least. But you'll notice that Truffaut isn't expressing an opinion on the film, either - he's just saying that he likes it.You can guess the scenario from the evocative title: Iris Henderson falls asleep on a train opposite an old lady and wakes up to find that the old lady has vanished. No-one on the train will admit that she had ever been aboard. Iris is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery. Sound like fun? Of course it does - and I can promise that it's fun all the way through.I notice that one of the young women at the inn was played by Googie Withers, who was still acting as recently as 1996, in `Shine'. `The Lady Vanishes' and `Shine' are the only two films of hers I've seen, but I remember the name. It's one of those names I marvel at. Long after I forget who played the lead roles `The Lady Vanishes', I will remember that one of the actresses was called `Googie'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock's Best British Feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Alfred Hitchcock's best known British features before his move to Hollywood where he went on to accomplish an unprecedented career in filmmaking, The Lady Vanishes is a skilfully crafted, cleverly narrated &amp; exquisitely humoured thriller that wonderfully exhibits the director's skills &amp; comfort when it comes to driving a plot with the elements of mystery.The Lady Vanishes concerns a beautiful young woman travelling by train to London who makes acquaintance with an elderly English lady only to find her missing after a while. When the train passengers n staff deny the existence of any old woman, she begins searching the train for clues to the old woman's disappearance &amp; is helped by a budding musician.Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film begins on a slow note but there is enough humour throughout its runtime to keep it a light-hearted affair even in moments of seriousness. The black n white cinematography captures each moment in crisp detail, editing steadily paces the plot &amp; brilliantly unfolds it, and the performances by its cast are quite top-notch.On an overall scale, The Lady Vanishes is an enjoyable, entertaining &amp; endearing cinema from Alfred Hitchcock that ranks amongst his finest works &amp; has successfully endured the test of time as, even after so many decades, it hasn't lost much of its touch. Incredibly witty, smartly written &amp; executed in a refined manner, The Lady Vanishes comes delightfully recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock ? long after this period ? would develop a notion of the camera that would revolutionize film. He understood this and in "Vertigo" and "Rear Window" was able to find scripts that could be bent to include a comment on this notion. And I suppose going back in his work, it is tempting to look for signs of the impending epiphany. Many film historians seem to combine this talent with the earlier ability to sometimes make very good movies.He did understand cinematic storytelling, and it is clear that a firm basis in this was necessary for later freeing the story. But let's keep things separate. This is crackerjack storytelling. It does have some really bad moments however ?Hitchcock never figured out how to handle people at a table. And the use of the locomotive was already hackneyed.But the way the story is spun is deft. So, if you are interested in a competent but unimportant movie that has some charm and historical context (impending fascism), and you don't care that it has no depth whatever, then this is your ticket.But don't be fooled into imagined greatness. That would come later when Hitchcock would meet and exchange ideas with Hollywood thinkers.(There IS that idea of performance as a code though...)Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>His last British film before making the jump to Hollywood, the great Alfred Hitchcock's "The Lady Vanishes" captures much of what made the filmmaker so iconic, yet it doesn't hold up as well against his best films of the '40s and '50s.Suspense in "The Lady Vanishes" should be a term used loosely. The story's main conceit is classic Hitchcock paranoia, but in its most simplistic form. Margaret Lockwood stars as Iris, a young woman who boards a train home from the fictional European country of Bandrika. She's tended to by a woman in her car named Miss Froy (Dame May Witty), but after a long nap wakes to find that she has disappeared and everyone on the train denies having ever seen her.It takes a good 30 minutes, however, before this all plays out, as the story begins in a Bandrika hotel so as to introduce its many characters in superfluous fashion. This beginning turns out to be somewhat comical, which isn't Hitchcock's strong suit. Trains, however, are his wheelhouse, and "The Lady Vanishes" gets substantially better at that point, even if it never takes on a darker, more menacing tone.Lockwood and costar Michael Redgrave help sell the whole mystery. Redgrave plays Gilbert, the cheeky musician Iris had a most disagreeable meeting with the night before in the hotel. Gilbert takes to believing that Iris isn't seeing things, though largely because he fancies her. Together they endeavor to figure out what's happened to Miss Froy and in doing so contend with all kinds of unusual circumstances.Yet the mystery won't have many people second guessing themselves. After all, when Iris first questions the many folks on the train, both the adulterous "Mrs." Todhunter (Linden Travers) and friends Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) and Charters (Basil Radford) lie about having seen her, the former to hide her affair and the latter to make sure they make it on time for a cricket match. There's a little social commentary there, but the script never pushes it.So unlike other Hitchcock protagonists, we don't empathize with the main character's paranoia so much as simply observe it. Nevertheless, other than a few obvious clues that point us in the right direction, we're playing Sherlock and Watson right along with Iris and Gilbert.The reveal is also a little less-than-satisfying, as it happens in such a matter-of-fact way and with plenty of time left in the film. Rather than keep us guessing to the end, the story puts all but one card down with 20-30 minutes left and then leans on putting the main characters in peril as its primary entertainment device. It all culminates in a less-than-stellar shootout and the film's final reveal, which is somewhat anti-climactic.It feels as though Hitchcock could have done more to put his stamp on the film. He has a couple sudden shots of disembodied hands coming from out of nowhere to up the action as well as one truly trademark sequence in which Iris imagines everyone in her train car as Miss Froy. They're all such creepy-looking folks to boot, so that amplifies the effect. Still, taking place on a train ends up the prime indicator that it's a Hitchcock film.There should be little question, however, that the little Hitchcock does do elevates "The Lady Vanishes" to classic status. Given the complexity of his later thrillers and other contemporary entries, it loses a bit of luster, but "The Lady Vanishes" still represents textbook filmmaking technique for the genre.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>Varnishing The Lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who has always found Hitchcock to be vastly overrated I have to confess I enjoyed this early effort. I was drawn by Micheal Redgrave, being a great fan of his; he'd done a small, uncredited role in a vehicle for fellow stage actor John Gielgud but this was his first real film and he went in at the deep end, from uncredited bit part to leading man. The screenplay by newcomers Frank Launder and Sydney Gilliatt made up in one-liners what it lacked in plausibility and its anti-PC comments that would have probably passed without comment at the time are joyfully refreshing in this restrictive age. Redgrave and his leading lady Margaret Lockwood are both on form and Redgrave was arguably the best leading man she would ever have in films. The pace of the film makes it easy to overlook the glaring flaws - would the Foreign Office seriously employ a middle-aged spinster as a serious spy; would vital information be exchanged musically rather than other well-tried methods; would someone obsessed with folk songs, one step away from a Morris Dancer be 1) interested in a pretty girl, 2) attract a pretty girl and 3) be useful with his fists when necessary and finally would a middle-aged lady cum spy 4)leave the train in the first place while armed Nazis are just yards away and 5) manage to get clean away on foot - to say nothing of the model village in the opening montage. Seventy years on it still entertains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Antiquated Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How unethical would it be to update obviously outmoded effects in a classic such as the Lady Vanishes or any number of other films of early/middle cinema? I find these antiquated effects so distracting at times that I almost can't take the movie seriously. That said I'm not sure if I would condone "fixing" these eyesores. I wonder what others think. For instance, would it be acceptable to change a simple scene in a movie that is not effects driven (like "Vanishes"), but not in a movie such as "Jason and the Argonauts" which is known as a film that was groundbreaking at the time for its effects magic? This brings up another question, as well. Is it right for a filmmaker to change his own film once it has been released in order to update or improve defects he may perceive? Is film, like a painting or even a novel still subject to the revision process even after it has been embraced by the public?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot fathom how anyone who knows anything about film could call THE LADY VANISHES "mediocre Hitchcock". I just watched a restored print. The British Hitchcock films tended to be lighter and wittier than his later American films. Humor and suspense here are blended flawlessly. Even the somewhat quaint special effects, using obvious miniatures, work well here. To compare it unfavorably to DIAL ME FOR MURDER, decidedly weak effort by Mr. H (unless you see it in 3-D), would indicate the writer has not seen much Hitchcock. In his American films Hitchcock had better technology to work with and he began to explore darker themes. The British films such as THE LADY VANISHES, THE THIRTY NINE STEPS, and the first version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH lean more into the direction of playful comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a review of "The Lady Vanishes" and "The 39 Steps", two early classics by Alfred Hitchcock. Released in 1938, "The Lady Vanishes" stars May Witty as Miss Froy, a British woman who vanishes whilst on a train journey across Europe. Attempting to locate Miss Froy are Iris (Margaret Lockwood) and Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a couple of unwitting adventurers. She's your typical Hitchcockian leading lady, headstrong and opinionated, he's a dashing musician, complete with that pencil-thin moustache so favoured by dapper British heroes. Both believe Froy to have been kidnapped.Hitchcock's films often find their heroes trapped in mischievous conspiracies. Here our heroine, like the lead in Hitchcock's "North by Northwest", is accused of being absolutely insane. She, everyone insists, imagined a kidnapping where none took place. But Iris remains undaunted. She proceeds to search her train, determined to get to the heart of what turns out to be an ingenious shell-game.Whilst "The Lady Vanishes" doesn't ascribe a nationality to its villains, it nevertheless serves as one of Hitchcock's early propaganda pieces. Most of the film finds various British characters unconcerned about Miss Froy's absence. It is only when Froy is revealed to be a British secret agent, and when a "certain European country" is revealed to be sinister and violent, that our cast of Brits spring into action (they assemble in a carriage and take up arms against the enemy). In this way, the film becomes a covert attack on British obstinacy in the face of Nazi aggression. "Why jump a fence when you can sit on it?!" one character quips, a form of passive diplomacy which the film denounces. Epitomising these attitudes are Charters and Caldicott (played by comedian duo Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne), a couple of chronically unimpressed Englishmen who'd let people vanish if it meant arriving at a cricket game on time. Because of such petty obsessions and snobbish self-regard, the film argues, kindly heroes like Miss Froy are left to die! Like most Hitchcock films, "Vanishes" is brisk, kinky (copious shots of women in their undergarments), gives complex (for the time) leading roles to women and carefully mixes thrills with humour. We also see Hitchcock's unique approach to filming space; he creates models to facilitate sweeping shots, his camera work is almost always audacious and he seems exhilarated by the challenge of shooting a film almost entirely within a train's cramped carriages.Politically, the film is a bit less impressive, its last half hour resorting to emotional blackmail (a cute, elderly spy!), British xenophobia and simplistic attitudes toward history and politics; the European fascists (particularly Hitler and Mussolini) weren't Britain's enemy in the lead up to WW2, but her chief allies against workers movements which sought the toppling of European aristocracy. It's a truism found throughout history: the enemy of your enemy is your friend, and when he gets too big for his boots, take him out yourself. The result is a film supposedly about British insularity and classism, that is itself insular and classist. Whilst typically viewed as being apolitical, Hitchcock actually made several propaganda pictures ("Foreign Correspondent", "Adventure Malgache", "F3080", "Bon Voyage", "Sabotage", "Topaz", "Lifeboat", "Torn Curtain" etc). Before all these was 1935's "The 39 Steps", an ahead-of-its time espionage thriller.Like most Hitchcock films, "Steps" revolves around a man wrongly accused of a crime. He's Richard Hannay, a Canadian tourist who finds himself in the strange world of Britain, and the stranger world of pre-War espionage. Unfolding like a noirish nightmare, much of the film consists of Hannay evading the police, lurking in shadows and attempting to solve a mystery involving the theft of stolen military secrets. Interestingly, the film reverses several aspects of "The Lady Vanishes"; where that film involved spies and secrets returning to Britian, "Steps" involves the smuggling of stolen secrets out of Britain. Both films also have their secrets stored in "music", one stored within a Music Hall performer, the other embedded within a song."The 39 Steps" has been overshadowed by "North by Northwest", but in many ways its the better film. It's tighter, darker, and would set in stone many subsequent genre conventions. Like "Vanishing", Hitchcock also mixes thrills with screwball comedy, throws in yet more shots of women in their lingerie (Hitch's camera practically salivates as women remove their stockings), and climaxes with a bickering duo becoming a romantic couple. Its last shots then echo that of "The Lady Vanishes", hands clasping as nightmares end.9/10 ? Early Hitchcock masterpiece, probably too "British" for international audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deliciously Entertaining And Witty Hitchcock Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early English Hitchcock film could well be one of his best- a taut, clever comedy-romance-thriller that introduces and explores themes and cinematic style that would later resurface in his more well-known American work.'The Lady Vanishes' is a near-perfect film- Hitchcock deftly handles the meshing of a number of genres with ease. It benefits from the director's acerbic British sense of humour, having a particularly sharp script. Hitchcock's direction is fluid and confident- he was just two years away from making the classic Rebecca (1940).The opening twenty minutes of 'The Lady Vanishes' have often been criticized as unnecessarily drawn-out, yet it subtly sets up Hitchcock's style, two central protagonists and the colourful array of supporting characters.Lockwood is great as the attractive brunette heroine Iris, a wealthy young British girl enjoying a last jaunt with her friends before her upcoming marriage (which she appears unenthusiastic about). Redgrave is Gilbert Redman, a charming, likable and eventually heroic man. Lockwood and Redgrave's first meeting, in the opening twenty minutes, is especially memorable (Redgrave: "Confidentially, you're a bit of a stinker yourself").The saucy banter and playing between the two leads (a constant theme in Hitchcock's films) continues on the train journey, where Lockwood is first helped by an old lady governess, Miss Froy (a priceless Dame May Witty), then alarmed by her sudden disappearance. The film then follows Lockwood's attempts (assisted by a concerned Redgrave) to locate Miss Froy, who may not be all that she initially seems.Hitchcock populates his story of suspense and spying across nations with a host of fascinating characters making the train journey. Who can forget the cricket-obsessed male couple who are willing to lie about the disappearance of a lady so they can get to Manchester in time for a Test match? Or the unhappy couple who debate their extra-marital affair whilst holed up in a compartment? Of course you'll remember the sharp-tongued nun who wears glossy black high heels and powders her nose between intervals. The creepy portly Italian man and the scary countess are not to be forgotten quickly either.Hitchcock's fascination with the train ride- in his eyes, an avenue for nail-biting suspense, high drama and romance- manifests itself in this film. The editing is near-perfect, with Hitchcock always keeping the action fast-paced and lively. Hitchcock's diverse and skilled work with the camera is shown in the handling of Lockwood's dizzy spells (legacy of a bump on the head). There are some great close-up reaction shots of Lockwood, effective cross-cutting between scenes, unforgettable images and creative use of superimposition. Hitchcock's knack for developing a romance in the midst of crime and political turmoil is at the forefront here.The central theme explored here is the uncertainty of appearances- one that would appear in almost every Hitchcock film after this. No one is as they first appear- whether it may be kindly governess Miss Froy, the supposedly mute nun or the cricket buff who turns out to be a sharp shooter. The MacGuffin in this film may well be Miss Froy- her disappearance brings together this band of interesting characters for a terrific, breath-taking shootout finale. Showcasing Hitchcock's complete mastery of his medium and understanding of almost every genre, this is one of the most superbly filmed action sequences in 30's cinema.Top marks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece in Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock had singlehandedly masterminded the thriller genre in film. It is no surprise that he set the highest standards for it, and The Lady Vanishes just so displays his mastery. The Lady Vanishes is one of those amazing films that existed well before its time. In an era without special effects, how had Hitchcock produced such a gem? It just goes to show that technology is not at all a precursor to good film ? something nearly all critics and connoisseurs have realized for the drama genre, but rarely recognized for mysteries and thrillers. The Lady Vanishes combines all the power of black and white film and somehow manages to evoke a tremendous sense of emotion and camaraderie. Hitchcock presents multiple 'couples' who are journeying from the mountainous regions of Europe, and their odd "eventful" twists and turns that arrive on board their train journey. It is evident that Hitchcock had just been weaned off silent films, because the initial shot is practically silent, and we don't hear any sound until over a minute into the film. To make such a transition from silent movies to a talkie that speaks so powerfully decades after it was made is something remarkable. The plot is far from predicable. The kinds of events that transpire are the most innovative ones, and it just goes to show how much of a literary genius Hitchcock was. This auteur master had figured out all the small pieces that fit together ? to show that the protagonist was indeed not suffering from amnesia as the audience is told to believe. The kind of characters that Hitchcock makes are tremendously endearing ? not just because they are outrageously courteous, thoughtful and intelligent, but they have almost basic qualities that were once considered normal, that we rarely see today. They are people who love life, have passions, and harbor humor sensibilities beyond the inane. In a sense, The Lady Vanishes is a perfect film. Nearly every element of what we enjoy in a film is encapsulated in those ninety-nine minutes. What is to be truly admired is how it was done in 1938.RATING: 10/10"She just can't vanish! They do it in India all the time ? the old Rope Trick Are there pictures of that?? "</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lady Vanishes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film from the Master of Suspense, director Sir Alfred Hitchcock, I remembered it being very engaging even though I didn't get the ending properly, so I was looking forward to seeing it again. Basically train passengers are stuck in Mandrika delayed by deep snow on the track, and they are all crammed into the near small village hotel until the next morning. While there socialite Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) meets kindly old governess Miss Froy (Dame May Witty), as well as musician Gilbert (Sir Michael Redgrave, Vanessa's father), she and the governess meet again when they get back on the train travelling through Europe. They have tea together where cricket fans Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) and Charters (Basil Radford) pass the sugar, and back to their cabin they pass Eric Todhunter (The Ladykillers' Cecil Parker) and 'Mrs.' Todhunter (Linden Travers), and they sit in a cabin together. Being encouraged to by Miss Froy, Iris falls asleep, and after waking up she is surprised to see her friend has vanished, and the people in the compartment including the Baroness (Mary Clare) and her Italian manservant (Philip Leaver) claim that they have never seen her. As Iris asks and looks around for the lady none of the other passengers are saying they do not remember ever seeing her with another woman, Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas) tries to convince her that a bump she got on the head earlier caused a hallucination. She is reunited with Gilbert on the train, and she tries to convince him that something sinister is going on where all the train passengers are purposely lying and hiding her somewhere for some reason. After on or two points where she is convinced that maybe she did imagine the earlier events with Miss Froy, Iris is definitely convinced she has been taken, and remembers the possibility of evidence, including her name on the window and a tea box. Gilbert sees a piece of evidence himself and knows that she is indeed telling the truth that the old woman really does exist, and they explore further into the train carriages to try and find her. Eventually they find Miss Froy bandaged up to look like a broken bodied patient for Dr. Hartz, and she reveals herself as a British spy assigned to deliver vital information to the Foreign Office in London. The end of the film sees all the characters truly in on the conspiracy and kidnap, the train stops and is shot at by troops, but the characters survive and return to England, where Iris and Gilbert are engaged, and Miss Froy is alive and well. Also starring Emile Boreo as Hotel Manager, Googie Withers as Blanche, Sally Stewart as Julie, Catherine Lacey as The Nun, and Hitchcock's cameo is a man walking on Victoria Station wearing a black coat smoking a cigarette. Lockwood is really good as the panicky woman, Redgrave is also appealing as her charming accomplice, and Witty is alright with her time as the dotty old woman, more than anything it is a gripping conspiracy story that keeps you hooked because you know all the characters are lying and you wonder how and where the vanishing lady is going to turn up, a great classic thriller. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock was truly a master of his art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another great film by Hitchcock. I liked the opening scene with the camera going from a pan shot to zoom on the interior of a hotel. And the silence of the start that gives place to total cacophony. The first 20 minutes or so are very funny. Hitchock takes time to set the table. In fact, you start to ask yourself the question: "is this a traditional Hitchock with a murder or two and a cloud of mystery over it all"? Some scenes are hilarious, like when the maid is changing in her room now occupied by the two Enghlishmen. But eventually, there is a murder. Transport yourself on the train and there will be more surprises. Where could Ms. Froy be? The film also contains a "clin d'oeil" to Sherlock Holmes. I was pleased with the chemistry between Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave. Very funny when he's fighting with the magician and he tells Iris not to jump around like a referee and cooperate a little! Great line also by the doctor: "I'm sorry that this took such a melodramatic course"! I burst out laughing when Hitchcock makes fun of Englishmen's phlegm: when one of them is shot in the hand and without losing his coolness, goes back into the train. One word on that train: it makes for a perfect setting for this kind of mystery/thriller. And the film being done in 1938, it plays well with the geopolitics of the time. While watching the movie, I thought it reminded me of Tintin. I was surprised to read after that another comment on this site mentioning the same thing.Seen at home, in Toronto, on January 2nd, 2005.84/100 (***)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock is so overrated in my book---these early British era films are the worst but none of his movies deserve the following they have (in my humble opinion). This one is particularly bad.The film was made for propaganda purposes to allow the target audience to vilify Germany and Italy. My problems with it are several. The production values are incredibly cheap.. it looks like they photographed a miniature train set with paper maché mountains etc... Also the scene in the luggage room which degenerates in slapstick and is so incongruous with a murder mystery that it is mind bend stuff.Next, the characters are unlikeable upper class stuffy etc... more concerned with cricket than doing what is right. I especially disliked the American one who was en route to be married having experienced all of life= Baccarat in Biarritz etc etc... so it was time to get married and take on Mayfair. Shallow and insipid. And she was a lead character!It is not a good sign when you dislike the main characters.I actually kind of liked the axis characters...they were the only fun part of this film.Finally the absurd ending where 3 Brits take on a couple squads of well armed militia and take off in a train they pilot themselves... it is absurd. People get shot and show no pain. Two dozen well armed men are only feet from the train but don't storm it. And the denouement making the old woman a secret agent who escapes by walking through squads of militia.This has to be his worst film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely underrated Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "The Lady Vanishes" may not have the trademark Hitchcock look of some of the Master's later films, it is still terrific. On a train from continental Europe to Britain, Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) discovers that her friend Ms. Froy (Dame May Witty) has disappeared. She joins with musician Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) to attempt to find the woman, and in the process becomes involved in a plot involving spies and foreign intrigue. Although the end is a bit far-fetched, there are still a number of memorable scenes. Of course Charters and Caldicott are two of the funniest characters you will find anywhere (I still crack up when Charters smugly says "A thing like cricket", even though I've seen it half a dozen times), but the others are all interesting to watch. One skill of Hitch's that always goes under the radar is his affinity for simply letting the characters interact in an environment. Even though we know him best for the suspense scenes, like the shootout between the Brits on board the train and enemy soldiers outside, Hitch proves in "The Lady Vanishes" that he is far more than simply a director of action. This film is truly a must see. After "Rear Window", "Vertigo", "Psycho", and "Notorious", it's his best, and being the fifth best film made by a guy who turned out two dozen of the best of all time isn't anything to feel bad about.</fullReview>

This probably makes me a bad film viewer in some way, but so be it.The first half of this film is pretty different from old Al's usual repertoire, consisting of lightly comedic, almost naturalistic interaction between a variety of characters. Of course, about halfway through the mystery starts, and there's the usual interesting playing with appearances and reality. Here it's the question of whether you should trust others' experiences over your own. For the first hour the movie is genuinely charming, but it seems to lose this by its climax, culminating in a static shoot-out that feels the need to attack pacifism just to liven things up.Of course, everything works out in the end, and the heroine ends up with the charming guy who invaded her bed and mocked her incessantly.

		<shortDescription>Dated, cheap and vapid. This is still called a classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to report that Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes is a train wreck. I want to find a masterpiece from him and while there's many I like out of the dozen I've seen, there's none I truly love just yet. This is his worst, even worse than The Birds. Now, I didn't expect a blend of genres here, I thought it was a straight mystery thriller, but instead it wants to be a comedy. Unfortunately it has no sense of humour. Or perhaps all its unstoppable barrage of cheap gags were original at the time but they're now dated from the moment they were printed on celluloid. It wastes the first half hour with a meandering inquiry into the lives of its unnecessarily large set of irritating characters, each seemingly on a different wavelength to each other. The biggest problem with the film is that it has such an awkward blasé attitude towards its vapid plot.It hardly feels Hitchcockian at all, nor an imitation of Hitchcock. It never offers any moments of legitimate excitement or suspense instead resulting in a farce voiding on parody without a hint of satire. There are sporadic moments of charm and where it makes sense, but it doesn't combat its ills. With obvious models, careless photography and clunky editing, its production quality just hurts it further. Some of these flaws could be forgiven since it was made in the 1930s, but there was more competent work made beforehand. It's not a painful film, but it induces too many eye-rolls to ignore, it just doesn't work on any level. I get that some people may have a nostalgia for it, but I can't believe that this is still called a classic. However, watching The Lady Vanishes does complete a small goal of mine which is to watch the entirety of IMDb's top 250, of which this finishes off their list at the end of 2009. So there's a bright side.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's best pre-Hollywood film, in my opinion. Copied many times but never as good as the original. It's an exceptional mystery film with lots of comedy and wonderful characters. Among these characters, who we first meet at a small European inn, is a young Englishwoman (Margaret Lockwood) who befriends a nice old lady (Dame May Witty) and clashes with a flippant musician (Michael Redgrave). Soon after they all board the same train, where the old lady seems to just disappear. Nobody on board the train claims to remember her, which leads the confused young woman to investigate with help from the musician.Lockwood and Redgrave are both terrific but the standout of the film is Dame May Witty in what is arguably her most famous screen role. Among the other passengers on the train are Paul Lukas, Googie Withers, beautiful Linden Travers, and, as a couple of cricket-obsessed Englishmen, Naunton Wayne &amp; Basil Radford. These two would play basically these same comic relief characters in other films after this. They're a lot of fun to watch. It's an excellent movie from the Master, blending so many different elements together as he always did so well. It may not appeal to everybody but fans of Hitch and classic film fans in general should love it.</fullReview>

The Characters are All Mostly Overbearing and Grate the Nerves. The Comedy is British with a Capital "B" and the Whole Setup is Nerve Racking.Thankfully, this Film Gets Better with Each Unfolding Minute. By the Time it All Ends it has Redeemed Itself from that Aggravating Opening (lets not even deduct points for the laughable miniatures) and Overall can be Recommended for its Complications, Whimsy, and Some Directorial Touches that Impress.The Politics are Heavy in a Duck Soup (1933) Like Fictional Country with Made Up Names and Unrecognizable Uniforms. But Considering the State of Europe at the Time the Inclusion of Things Like Appeasement, Pacifism, Indifference, and a Self-Serving Citizenry are Paraded Out in No Uncertain Terms.There is Mystery, Suspense, and a Whole Lot of Humor (maybe too much humor), and a Final Shootout that is Quite Effective. Recommended for Some Illustrious Imagery, its Energetic Pacing, and for the Master's Pre-Hollywood Touch. But the Movie, Although Universally Praised and Fawned Over Relentlessly, May Irritate Some Viewers Who are Not British Subjects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film does not take anyone by surprise, nor does it have any shade of the Hitchcock landmark. Despite the fact that Hitchcock directed this film, he demonstrated that it wasn't directing that was his forte. He was a far better producer than he was a director which was demonstrated by 'Dial M For Murder'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely dreadful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually enjoy Alfred Hitchcock's movies but this one was just terrible! Probably Alfred Hitchcock's WORST movie (although Frenzy was pretty awful.) Absolutely no suspense and was difficult to follow. I can't believe so many people like it. The quality of the picture was awful, I could barely make out what they were saying and see on the screen what was going on. I was surprised this movie was made in 1938 because I've seen earlier movies then 1938 and the quality of the picture is way BETTER. GRAND HOTEL was made in 1932 and I absolutely loved it. The quality of the picture was amazing for that year and way better then THE LADY VANISHES. One word of warning to anyone thinking of seeing THE LADY VANISHES. It's complete rubbish.</fullReview>
