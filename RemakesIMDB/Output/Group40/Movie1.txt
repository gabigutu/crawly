		<fullReview>I'm never against remakes. What is there to lose? If the remake is inferior it just reaffirms the rarity of and how difficult it is to produce a true classic. If the remake is superior, then we have a better movie! This movie stands on its own as fair and light entertainment. The performances are right in line with popcorn comedy and will produce a sufficient number of chuckles and laughs.The problem, of course, is this movie cannot stand on its own. If you remake a classic, you have to make the comparison. This version just doesn't measure up to the 1950 original on any level.Since many people have not seen the 1950 Born Yesterday, I think this movie will do them just fine. Sooner or later though, if they love movies, they're going to stumble across Judy Holliday's outstanding performance and then this remake may seem a bit weak.As with most attempts at remaking classics, the 1993 version of Born Yesterday falls far short of the original. It does, however, maintain a charm of its own and it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. However, I certainly, without reservation and whole-heartedly recommend the original as a "must-see"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why bother to remake an all time classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Born Yesterday (1950) is one of funniest films ever made. Thisversion has Melanie Griffith attempting the impossible,trying torecreate the role that won Judy Holiday a best actress Oscar. Although Griffith tries hard, she is no match for Holiday, and DonJohnson is certainly no substitute for William Holden. The only oneof the cast who comes close to the original, is John Goodman. For anybody that doesn't know the story outline, Harry Block,(JohnGoodman ) a crooked junk tycoon hires a journalist Paul Verrall(Don Johnson ) to teach his girlfriend Billie Dawn, some socialskills, as she is unused the high society life of the Washingtonelite. In a choice between the two, watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly...not terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the 1950 Judy Holliday/William Holden/Broderick Crawford hit farce, adapted from Garson Kanin's popular play, about millionaire businessman hiring a tutor for his dizzy girlfriend, which backfires when she becomes wise enough to know she's being played for a dupe. In the leads, Melanie Griffith, then-husband Don Johnson and John Goodman all have a propensity to lapse into shtick, but, for her part, Griffith is well-cast and very likable. The men have a harder time: Johnson is charmingly low-keyed in a dull role (the problems with it go back to the play) and Goodman works hard at being both vulgar and sympathetic. Not a complete success by any means, this update still hasn't figured out how to make the last act work (the plot mechanisms become congealed, the action becomes stagy and the finale is limp), but there are some nice laughs spread around and an occasionally witty flash of original thought. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rebirth of a Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rude, selfish and arrogant businessman Harry Brock (John Goodman) travels to Washington with his mistress Billie Dawn (Melanie Griffith), his adviser Ed Devery (Edward Herrmann) and his assistant JJ (Max Perlich) to have business meetings with senators. Billie is a former showgirl from Las Vegas and does not have culture, embarrassing Harry in the social events. He hires the journalist Paul Verrall (Don Johnson) to teach Billie that is an intelligent woman and soon she does not accept the treatment spent by Harry toward her. Further, Billie and Paul disclose dirty businesses of Harry and fall in love with each other. "Born Yesterday" is a remake of the 1950 film with a storyline inspired in "Pygmalion" (1938) and "Educating Rita" (1983). The romance is entertaining and funny and the gorgeous Melanie Griffith shows a great chemistry with her husband Don Johnson. John Goodman completes the cast with great performance. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Renascer de Uma Mulher" ("The Rebirth of a Woman")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>insipid TV type movie remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is sort of OK as an afternoon TV movie but stands no comparison against the Oscar nominated and winning original.The Cukor version has class written all over it with stupendous performances from Broderick Crawford, Judy Holiday and William Holden, great comic timing and real pace.This is just ambling along, making the motions, insipid in comparison, the famous gin rummy scene is a bit embarrassing really. John Goodman can't make his mind up whether he wants to be a bully or sympathetic, his pest controller in Anachrophobia was a far better comic performance I think. Don Johnson is so low key he seems to be sleepwalking through the role. Melenie Griffith was far better in Working Girl with an all round superior character transformation. So maybe the script and especially direction have to take the blame to a greater degree.Cheap off-cut compared to prime rump steak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Okay Remake That Feels Odd In Places</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a 1950s screwball political satire and in some ways it is both stronger and weaker than the original. First, the weaknesses: the main problem with this remake of Born Yesterday is the plot. All they've done here is copied and pasted the original screenplay and shoehorned into a time frame where the material seems out of date. When we see Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith walking out on the streets of 1990s Washington, D.C., we hear their dialogue and somehow it doesn't jive with the world around them. We feel the presence of the film crew standing behind the camera capturing this "cute" moment between a pair of movie stars. It's like we're observing a big high school play performed for an audience in the park and it just feels awkward. There isn't much chemistry between Johnson and Griffith and that's another part of the problem. Griffith is fine as the ditz with hidden depth and definitely did not deserve her Razzie nomination in 1993. In fact, she's one of the best things about the remake and I liked her in the role. Don Johnson feels out of place as the smart guy teaching her how to be an intellectual. He just doesn't seem the type and seems terribly miscast. John Goodman is the perfect combo of sweet and tough as Harry, the corrupt businessman pulling the strings of senators. Born Yesterday is a flawed remake but the stuff that's good is really good and makes me wish more effort had been put into updating the material to fit present day sensibilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But Too Smart-Too Fast, So Stick With The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1950 film which starred Judy Holliday was okay, but nothing super. The major problem was credibility with Melanie Griffith playing "Billie Dawn." I'm sorry, but with her voice and mannerisms in all the movies I've seen her in, it's not believable enough for me to see her as a woman who suddenly gets very smart. Anything is possible! However, she gets too smart, too fast and it's just too much. "Yeah, right," is what you wind up saying over and over. However, I'm not saying she didn't do a good job acting, it's just that I know her too well to have her be credible in this particular role.I also was sorry to hear another example of a classic-era film re-done with profanity. Here, John Goodman (no surprise) blasphemes here and there as boyfriend "Harry Brock.".This story is nice enough with a bunch of good messages without having to mess it up with needless profanity and sexual innuendos. Can't Hollywood make ONE modern-day comedy without that? Speaking of credibility, I can picture a slob like Goodman being paired with Roseanne Barr, but a hot babe like Griffith? No way.No wonder there was little chemistry in this film.However, I have to say Don Johnson, of Miami Vice television fame, was a very likable character in a pleasant low-key role as the tutor-reporter. I was never a big fan of his but I liked him in this movie. Still, the 1950 version was good enough to stand on its own, not needing a re-make in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wakey, Wakey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The casting of crude millionaire Harry Brock is crucial to the success of this film simply because he dominates the story even when he isn't on screen. Choose the wrong actor and the whole thing will collapse because he is the origin of the story's conflict and therefore needs to be strong and bold. Luckily, the producers cast beefy John Goodman in the role and he managed to strike just the right combination of pent-up rage and apple-cheeked smiles. Although he's a Citizen Kane-type monster who slaps his girlfriend around and believes the offer of jewellery or money can soothe all ills, he also displays moments of genuine emotion that makes him quite likable at times. I guess the idea was to show how the nice guy he once was has been devoured by his hunger for money ? hardly original, but nicely played by Goodman, anyway.The story is essentially a wake-up call to the slumbering giant that is the American public masquerading as a romantic comedy. A book called Democracy in America ? which was actually written in the 19th Century by a Frenchman named Tocqueville ? plays a big part. By studying its concepts, Brock's moll Billy (Melanie Griffith) awakens to the fact that she is being duped by Harry, who represents the forces of rampant capitalism, and rises up against her oppressor. Whether the message is particularly relevant to its target audience is open to question, but perhaps its assumption that it won't really be taken too seriously allows the film to make its symbolism so literal that few will miss the parallels. For example when Ed Devery (Edward Hermann), Brock's right-hand man who clearly feels he has sold his soul ('I died twelve years ago,' he tells Brock after his employer shows concern for striking him in a rage) picks up a copy of the book it signals a reawakening of his conscience which is quickly quashed when Brock snatches it from his hand and throws it to the ground. Others, like the radio presenter, pay lip service to the concept without really understanding it. The way the message is couched in this straightforward simplicity raises the film higher than others of its type.In a bland, thankless role that goes nowhere, Don Johnson wears horn-rimmed glasses and combs his hair forward to dispel memories of designer-clad cops. Even if he was anything more than a workmanlike actor he would struggle to do anything with the role. Griffith is likable enough, but her rapid transformation from bubble-headed blonde to hair-in-a-bun brain-box is so fast it fairly takes your breath away. One minute she's impatiently searching for something to watch during the dead time between the soaps and Entertainment Tonight and the next she's teaching a group of Senators the American constitution.The film itself is entertaining enough; it certainly isn't as bad as you'd expect, and it's rating on this site is surprisingly low. But then, I suppose a lot of people watch this because they've seen (and liked) the original, which is a major hurdle for any film to overcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Propensity for trying...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If at first you take and forget that this is a remake, it will help for those who remember the original actors and such to get through this. On the other hand, as this is a current movie, (at that time) and sometimes updating a story can be entertaining, fun and necessary. Some stories don't seem to age well, now I'm not at all talking about this movie in that context. But with all said and done, after the movie ended, I had a good time. I really enjoyed it, so did many others, when "Born Yesterday" played in theaters . Don Johnson, as Paul, the reporter was good, no tough-talking bad boy role here. Then there was, the third character, John Goodman. Here is a comedic big-man! He has and brings a whole different ingredient to this story. If it had been another big man, it would have been all together not the same. Now Melanie Griffith, I have always had a 'soft' spot for in my heart for her, in a friendly way. She came in behind Judy Holiday and took on the role of a modern day 'simpleton' wife, who had her routine and therefore was happy as a pig in mud. It won't win any awards, but if you just look at that body of work and give it an honest chance, it comes through, delivering good laughs. The chemistry and interest among Johnson and Griffith was sustaining and entertaining which if it's lacking, will ruin just about anything that the main story could offer a viewer. Born Yesterday, has a propensity for trying. Sometimes 'trying' is too much and doesn't work and sometimes the movie makers hit a hard-and really good remake and make a new stake in the film remake game. At any rate, this was an enjoyable film that I would recommend to a comedy fan. With John Goodman playing it out and out funny and the bad-guy too, you can't miss. It's tough to beat William Holden, in a dirty-day mature adult affair type story, so this doesn't have the feeling to it that the original has. Even so they are two different films that can be enjoyed. The supporting cast was a nice choice as well as the main personalities. (**)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Born Yesterday is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!! Melanie Griffith is terrific as she plays dumb Billie Dawn who is constantly mocked for her lack of political knowledge. Her boyfriend, played by John Goodman, wants to smarten her up and goes to great lengths to do so. What happens from there may surprise you!! The plot is intriguing and keeps you interested the entire time. Great movie to show at parties. I've hosted a number of parties over the years, and people seem to like this movie the best, so now I only show this at parties. Can't go wrong with Born Yesterday!! It's a great comedy with two very talented actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judy Holliday won a well-deserved Oscar in 1950 for "Born Yesterday," which was directed by George Cukor. The cast also included Broderick Crawford (fresh from his Oscar-Triumph; All The King's Men) and William Holden. One of the great political satires of all time, "Born Yesterday" still remains a classic in every sense of the word. Then comes this.....a remake with Melanie Griffith in the title role. The only thing I can say is that they're (the producers) are lucky they can't be charged with capitol punishment! This film is a total disaster....A FLOP!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Born Yesterday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a brave move to remake such a classic George Cukor comedy film, and this was a challenge to see if the makers could create the near same enjoyment that I remember from the original. It follows the same premise, Billie Dawn (Melanie Griffith) is the girlfriend of construction planner and corrupt crook Harry Brock (John Goodman), and she is not all that intelligent about certain things, and is causing embarrassment. So Harry pays $5000 to Paul Verrall (Don Johnson) for him to teach Billie things she should know to make her look more acceptable and intelligent. As she learns more and more, Billie doesn't seem to be so thick after all, and it is obvious the teaching from Paul is turning into something more passionate. Billie is soon intelligent to know that Harry is bribing senators, and making her sign documents that make her owner of his illegal matters, and she plucks up the courage to refuse. In the end, Billie hands in the incriminating evidence to Paul to give to the press to finish Harry, and she says she will only give back small portions of his empire back as long as he leaves them alone. Also starring Ri?hie Ri?h's Edward Herrmann as Ed Devery, Max Perlich as JJ, Michael Ensign as Phillipe, Benjamin C. Bradlee as Sect. of the Navy Alex Duffee, Sally Quinn as Beatrice Duffee, William Frankfather as Sen. Kelley, Fred Dalton Thompson as Sen. Hedges and William Forward as Sen. Duker. Griffith is quite likable as the ditsy-turned-smarter bimbo, but she doesn't have lacks the comic timing of Oscar-winning Judy Holliday, in fact, she was nominated a Razzie? However, Goodman is a great and nasty as Broderick Crawford was, and the highlight for me was the 27 Constitutional Amendments song, to the tune of the 12 Days of Christmas, a pretty good comedy remake. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the movie is entertaining, it is not an unforgettable masterpiece. If you haven't got anything better to do it's not a bad way to kill time but don't expect this movie to be thought-provoking. Absurd as it may be, it is still interesting to watch how Melanie Griffith goes from being a bimbo to composing songs about the constitution and appreciating Van Gogh paintings. Don Johnson sort of blends into the background as Goodman wildly raves on and on shouts at everyone in sight while Griffith tries her best to prove that her character is more than just a pretty face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the bad reviews this movie received, I didn't think it was that bad. Maybe it's just because it's a remake and it's a known fact that people just don't like remakes. I don't remember ever having encountered a remake that people liked more than the original. And nostalgia for the originals plays a huge part in this, trust me.But I don't think they changed too much of the script, and it's the script which I really liked anyway. While for the other aspects, well, I guess I have to admit that most of the acting wasn't particularly good, the only character I really felt was played with sparkle was Melanie Griffith as Billie.Anyway, it is worth a watch especially if you haven't seen the original version (same title, 1950) in which case you might be kinder on your comments. If you loved the original, don't like remakes, then be cautious!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not The Original, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can never recreate a classic, but that's no reason to dismiss BORN YESTERDAY.The lead trio of Melanie Griffith, John Goodman and Don Johnson are terrific as they update the classic play/film about a dizty blonde who unleashes her untapped brain power under the tutelage of a newspaper reporter. Goodman in particular is outstanding, drawing our hatred and sympathy with ease as the bribing workaholic fervently amassing a fortune when money is far from his main problem. It's impossible to recall him ever being this effective or adding so much to a film.All things considered, however, this is Griffith's film. True, she's no June Holliday, and this is certainly not the 1950 landmark picture. But our sexy star is not out of her league in bringing Billie Dawn to color, ably growing as her once-vacant head is filled with knowledge and free thought. Laugh-out-loud comedy is not necessarily her forte, but she can elicit a chuckle here or there when called upon. Her chemistry with tutor-turned-fiancé Johnson doesn't exactly set the screen on fire, yet the pair remain fun to watch.When it comes to BORN YESTERDAY, the best advice has already been given: stick with the original. That said, if you wind up catching this remake and judge it on its own merits, you'll be pleasantly entertained. It's a harmless, if unspectacular effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Born SPOILERS* Billie (Melanie Griffiths) is the epitome of the 'dumb blonde'; she is blonde and, well, dumb as a rock.Her boyfriend (John Goodman) pays Paul (Don Johnson), a geeky, glasses-wearing journalist, to give her a little culture; what Paul does is making Billie conscious of the life she's living, of what she really wants and of who.And during the lessons, there seems to be an alchemy between him and Billie that's hard to deny...Having never seen the original movie with Judy Holliday, I can say that this remake is a nice comedy movie, and a good way to kill time.The performances are run-of-the-mill (even if it was a refreshing change to see Don Johnson as a quiet guy, after a lot of his roles, like 'Miami Vice', 'Nash Bridges' and others), but we're not talking Academy Awards material here...Born Yesterday (1993): 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically this is a watchable enough movie that however as a comedy is too lacking in humor and it suffers from some poor character treatment.It's by no means an horrible movie but it's one of those movies that make you wonder why it was made in the first place. The movie as a whole makes a pointless and redundant impression, especially when considering that this is a remake as well, of a 1950, multiple Oscar nominated, movie.It's not a comedy with over-the-top humor or characters are comical situations. Instead its humor is more subtle with as a result that this movie doesn't provide one big laugh. The humor lacks some real creativity, even though the actors try really hard to make the humor still work.Without the fine actors the movie really would had been a lesser one. John Goodman, Melanie Griffith, Don Johnson and Fred Dalton Thompson are all fine actors. They still give the movie some flair and joy. However their characters don't really work out as good as they could had been.Griffith's and Johnson's roles are too blank and boring. Almost as if they were holding back. John Goodman's character is a hard one to understand. It's unclear whether the movie makers wanted to make him look sympathetic or like a ruthless hard corrupt business man. You don't know if you're supposed to like or hate him, which also does provide the movie with some uneven moments. Some serious poor character treatment if you ask me.But despite all its flaws, this movie still remains a perfectly watchable one. After all it's not a movie that will bore you to death or will make you cringe. However it's also a movie that you can easily do without seeing it.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not see the original 1950 version of 'Born Yesterday', so I cannot compare it to this one directly. However popular critical consensus is that this remake is clearly inferior. This one has John Goodman as the oversize, shady businessman who has taken dumb blonde, Melanie Griffith, Las Vegas showgirl, as his companion. In Washington for 'business', he gets embarrassed by her, so hires a professor, played by Don Johnson, for $500 a day to help her seem smart. Things start to go off target when she gets genuinely interested in learning.SPOILERS follow, quit reading. I said ... QUIT READING!!He is bribing congressmen to keep a military base open so his planned real estate project won't tank. In the process he has been putting each of his individual companies in her name so he won't risk losing everything. She just signs where she is told, doesn't know what is going on. But when she starts to figure things out, and what a louse he is, decided to marry her tutor, take true possession of her companies, and plans to give them back, one per year. Nothing groundbreaking here, just a nice feeling that the bad guy gets his comeuppance. The title comes from one of her lines near the end, "What do you think, I was born yesterday??"</fullReview>

If you actually concentrate enough to pick at the dialogue, you'll notice that it is actually very clever and witty. This type of comedy is more on the sophisticated side as oppose to a "cheap laugh" side. Besides that, Billie (Griffith) also makes some really good points about life. If you're someone who actually puts some effort into understanding a film, you shouldn't miss out on this movie !!!!!!!! I LOVE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this remake of 1950's "Born Yesterday" with Judy Holliday is better than the original! Melanie Griffith is great as Billie Dawn, because she's so sweet and soft-spoken at the end...you can really see the transformation! And I think John Goodman is really funny when he goes on his tirades. I especially like the part when Paul arrives after going to the newspaper office. He and Billie are carrying on a simple conversation about each other's health. Harry (Goodman) keeps looking and them, then says abruptly, "OK, can the tea party crap!!". I just think that's so funny! =)I also think Don Johnson is great as Paul. He should wear those glasses all the time! But even though I like this version better, I still think William Holden was better in the original.Therefore, I give "Born Yesterday" a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since half the audience doesn't realize that this movie was a remake, let me be the first to announce that it is. Melanie Griffith once again picks a decent role for her to portray. She is not only breath taking like always, she does the role justice and does it well. John Goodman, who made his career as the lovable /devoted husband on the hit series Rosanne, has been known to be funny as well as lovable. Here, Goodman takes a chance by playing a mean / greedy political businessman. He is not only scary at times, but amazing. Since then, Goodman has gone on to do a series of dramatic roles. Born Yesterday is one of his first well done dramatic performances. It was also nice to see Don Johnson and Melanis Griffith in another movie together. Even though they are no longer an item, they have remained friends and kept a good relationship on screen. This is something hard to find in Hollywood.</fullReview>

Here's how they rank:#1 The Play#2 1993 version (and relatively close in caliber to the play)Last--The 1950 version.I love classics, some of them. But having seen the 1950 version, I can't understand what all the fuss was about.Griffith and Johnson both give respectable performances in this film and Paul Verall is not a prototypical Don Johnson role by any stretch of the imagination. SPOILERS ahead--maybe.This is a good update and the supporting cast, including Edward Hermann fill their roles pretty well. It is well-shot and a good '90s view of Washington for a first-timer. The script is okay (and the defenders of the 1950 version will claim--rightly so, that it had good base material to begin with--the play).I would never be so foolhardy as to claim that this version is Oscar-worthy or could ever hope to be Oscar-worthy. But get this--by all rights, the 1950 version doesn't fit in that category either in spite of its cast. The original Billie is pure froth and maybe she's supposed to be but that's not so spectacular or such an over-the-top spoof that it deserved an Oscar (Leslie Anne Warren's blonde mistress in Victor/Victoria comes to mind here). Also, some Oscar-winning roles and Oscar-nominated films (the Olivier Hamlet and the Olivier/Garson Pride and Prejudice; revered cinema from the '30s and '40s respectively) are total trash. The 1950 version of Born Yesterday doesn't fall into that category. I suppose it's just a cautionary tale. At any rate--see this movie. It's enjoyable and funny. Scenes to watch for include--Paul's coaching at the first dinner party and the Amendments song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie is not the waste of time most movies entail; I am not a Melanie Griffith fan, but it's worth watching for (1) script (2) camera work (4) de Tocqueville (5) (above all) the 1st ten amendments of a hallowed document.</fullReview>
