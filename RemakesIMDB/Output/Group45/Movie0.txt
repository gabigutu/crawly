		<shortDescription>Parallel stories, synchronized storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare to find a movie with a meaningful, political context that is also good drama. Br?dre / Brothers has two interwoven story lines: one about the relationship between two brothers, the other about the difference between comfortable Western civilizations sending out soldiers to various missions and the actual war zones. These stories mirror each other and both brothers change roles during the movie: One starts in prison, the other ends up there; one is a family man; the other takes over this role after his brother's death. There is a nice ending, but I find that the only element not fitting the overall structure.I like this also because it is well edited. Synchronization of images is used to tell the story of Michael in Afghanistan and Sarah in Denmark. Frequently a shot of Afghanistan is shown and directly followed by the same shot in Denmark: looking at a road, from a bus or car, etc.Initially rhythm is established through a central 'Afghan' theme song. Once the characters are established in our minds, the acting takes over. I'm still wondering why Danish actors (and Scandinavian actors in general) are so good in what they do: Is that a compulsory subject in primary school there because even the children act so unbelievably natural.The ethical dilemmas facing soldiers are well presented. Michael first has to demonstrate how a launcher works, knowing it will be used against his own people. Then comes the ultimate decision. The traumas he faces are real and reminded me of actual, similar stories of soldiers returning from Bosnia, Afghanistan or Iraq.Susanne Bier has come out of the Dogme-movement as one of the better directors. In a world with not that many (talented) female directors she is someone to be cherished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant depiction of the impact of war on families</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best picture we've seen in 2005. Why can't Hollywood make movies like this any more? Great cast, great direction, dialogue perfectly written comes through with power even in Danish with English subtitles! Connie Nielsen is in a league with Myrl Streep as an actress. The portrayal of the rough and tumble relationship of the brothers is so real it seems alive. Make sure you see this movie either in the theatres or on DVD. Nielsen is gorgeous but realistically portrays a housewife. The parents are classic Scandinavians, stolid and down to earth. Two little girls are played with zest and great energy. And the brothers, are quite believable as brothers. If you are interested in serious cinema and grown up movies "Brothers" should be on your list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surviving a war, but losing the peace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susanne Bier's "Brothers" is a gripping account of the relationship between two brothers. Ms. Bier, a distinguished director, presents in this new venture a psychological study in the mind of one man who has been scarred by events beyond his control. The screen play by Ms. Bier and Andreas Thomas Jensen is one of the most powerful things that have come out from the Danish cinema.If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.At the beginning of the movie, we are shown Michael who is picking up a prisoner from a jail. It turns out that the released man is none other than Jannik, his own brother. It's clear, at the outset, these two men are as different as oil and vinegar. They quarrel along the way and Jannik gets out and walks into a field to get away from his brother.Michael, a major in the army, is for all we see, happily married. He is preparing to go to Afghanistan with his unit. His pretty wife, Sarah, and his two young daughters are going to be left on their own, but everything seems to be under control.When Michael's helicopter is shot from the sky by enemy fire, he is reported as dead, something that affects Sarah deeply. Jannik, the distant brother in law, suddenly gravitates toward Sarah and her children. Sarah, in her grief over her loss, becomes closer to this man.Michael, on the other hand, hasn't died. We see him as he is taken to an enemy camp where he is seen sharing a cell with another Danish soldier. There's hardly any contact between captors and prisoners. The two men bond, but the other man is seen weakening because of he senses they will be killed. Death arrives, in a devastating sequence that has to be one of the most heart wrenching thing in a film in recent memory.As the camp is liberated, Michael is repatriated. Sarah knows something has happened to her husband, who never talks about the tragedy at the camp. What's more, one watches in horror as Michael begins to spiral out of control. His guilt finally explodes in a rage, even Jannik, can stop. Michael, in his state, suspects about his own wife's infidelity with his brother. He accuses her of betrayal, something his older daughter, Natalia, seems to be convinced happened between her mother and uncle. Michael, being so tormented, breaks down and begins trashing the house. Jannik comes to help and the brothers have an almost fatal confrontation. At the end we watch as Sarah visits Michael in jail and how he breaks down and tell her the horrible secret he has been hiding all along.Ulrich Thomsen is the best thing in the film! Mr. Thomsen's performance is one of the most complex we have watched in a while. Mr. Thomsen makes Michael come alive in front of our eyes. Connie Nielsen, an actress that has worked extensively in the American cinema makes also quite an impression with her portrayal of Sarah, the wife that has to deal with the false death of her husband, only to find out he is alive. The other good performance is by Nikolaj Lil Kaas, who plays Jannik, the problem brother. All the supporting players make a contribution to the film.Ms. Bier shows she can hold her own against much more accomplished directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fragility and Strength: A Study of Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Br?dre'('Brothers') is a remarkable film from Denmark written by Anders Thomas Jensen and Susanne Bier who also directs this microscopic examination of the intricacies of family bonding, the significance of the blood ties between brothers, and the effects of one of the brutal realities of war on every individual member of a family. It is a tense drama made palpable by some phenomenal acting and direction.Michael (Ulrich Thomsen) and Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) are polar opposites as brothers: Michael is his father's dream, a man who is committed to his family, his beautiful and devoted wife Sarah (Connie Nielsen) with whom he has two daughters, while Jannik is a carefree drifter who drinks too much and refuses to have the stable life his parents expect of him. Michael is off to war in Afghanistan and is in a tragic helicopter accident and reported as dead. When Sarah is informed her world crumbles, as does the mental state of her father-in-law. Jannik hears the news while drunk but slowly awakens to the awful reality that his brother is gone and his sister-in-law and nieces need the support he has never been able to muster.In Afghanistan we discover that Sarah's inclination that Michael is not really dead is true: Michael has been captured by the Taliban and the experience as a prisoner changes him indelibly, breaking his shell of perfection and he becomes vulnerable and fragile. When Michael returns home to the surprise of everyone the dynamics that have reversed between the family and Jannik and the force that bonds Michael and Jannik is challenged and we are left to examine the fallout.The script in Danish is supplemented with excellent subtitles in English, but one wonders if the words are even necessary - so fine is the acting of every actor involved. Connie Nielson is a major force in cinema today, a brilliant actor whose spectrum of dynamics appears endless. Both Thomsen and Kaas are equally fine in their difficult roles. This is a superlative work, a psychological drama that strikes chords of familiarity on many levels. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family Dynamics After War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The family man Major Michael Lundberg (Ulrich Thomsen) is happily married with his beloved Sarah (Connie Nielsen) and adores his two daughters Natalia (Sarah Juel Werner) and Camilla (Rebecca L?gstrup Soltau). His younger brother Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) has just left prison on probation for bank robbery and has issues with his father Henning (Bent Mejding). Michael invites Jannik to have dinner at home with their family. When Michael arrives in Afghanistan, his helicopter crashes and he is considered missing in action. However, he is captured and sent to a camp where he meets the radar technician Niels Peter (Paw Henriksen). After a long period imprisoned, Micahel is forced to kill Niels with a bar to survive. Meanwhile Jannick comforts Sarah and the children and he becomes close to Michael's family. When Michael is rescued, he comes back home emotionally detached and paranoid. Further, he is convinced that Sarah and Jannik have slept together during his absence. When the envious Natalia lies during the birthday dinner party of her sister telling that her mother and Jannik had shagged to upset her father, the disturbed Michael triggers an intense paranoia jeopardizing his family. "Br?dre" is a powerful and realistic drama about lives destroyed by war. This film is extremely well-acted, with an adequate cast that gives credibility to the plot led by the gorgeous and excellent Connie Nielsen. The sensitive director Susanne Bier of "Efter Brylluppet" makes another extraordinary movie based on the family dynamics. Jim Sheridan remade this film in 2009, but in a shallow teen "americanization" version. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Brothers"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man and his family suffer when he cannot talk about the extreme decisions he has had to make - and live with. Anyone who has friends or relatives that have been in a warzone or war-like conditions will recognize the strong emotions that sometimes take control of people when they come back into their daily realities. It portrays a man who seems to have lost control and brings home a lot of repressed anger, which almost costs him his family. Great movie with a great story and great acting portraying real ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Part of this movies strong emotional impact comes from the use of hand-held camera and lots of wonderful close-ups. Near-life, near-reality, near-death</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Well Played and Well Cut Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is filmed mostly with hand held camera, and the technical quality is not the best. I am normally not a fan of these so called "Dogme" movies, but it gives the opportunity to tell a story with a small budget and without having to waste time on special effects and so on. And what a movie. The actors play so intense and fascinatingly well, that I often sat on the edge of the seat, had "goose bumps"(gaasehud), wept like whipped(graed som pisket). The cutting is also very special and interesting. For instance a scene, where representatives of the military arrives to tell Sarah, that her husband is missing, it is cut right before they tell her the bad news. It gives a good effect. I would also like to welcome Connie Nielsen to the staff of fantastic Danish actors(her first danish movie) and will look forward to possibly/eventually watch/experience her great magic i a Danish movie again. I must write her a fan letter(my first).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not hard to classify this one--it's an intense psychological drama. Whatever mood you were in before you started, you are most likely to be in a somber mood at the end. Perhaps the less you know about the story the more it will involve you. This is one of those movies that makes you ask the questions, "What would I have done in that situation," and "How would I have lived with my decision."The main thrust of the story is an intimate examination of how a tragedy affects family dynamics. Nature abhors a vacuum. Guilt, jealousy, and doubt drive this to an intense climax.Parformances are first rate, particularly Connie Nielsen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damaged goods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Brothers" is about going away to war and coming back damaged and violent. It's also about how the dynamics change not only when a family member is away at war -- one of the brothers is an officer sent to Afghanistan -- but change again even more drastically when he returns. "Brothers" is harrowing to watch. That's its success. It has to disturb. Otherwise it wouldn't have done its job. But I felt so brutalized by this film that I could barely think.Michael (Ulrich Thomsen), the officer, has a beautiful wife, Sarah (Connie Nielsen) and two pretty little girls, Natalia (Sarah Juel Werner) and Camilla (Rebecca L?gstrup). His parents live nearby -- his mother Else (Solbj?rg H?jfeldt) steady, young-looking; his father Henning (Bent Mejding) bossy, a bit sullen, a drinker. Michael's younger brother Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) is handsome in a rough way, drinks, smokes, smiles, likes a laugh. All these people are filled in with a hand-held camera whose vérité edginess links events in Afghanistan with happenings in the family back in Denmark.The single, jobless Jannik is very much a part of this tight little family but he's a punching bag for the father and Michael because he's always had trouble and is now just out of prison for a bank robbery and assault. He doesn't seem to be looking for a job and both the other men scorn him.Nevertheless, Jannik's a strong presence at the farewell dinner before Michael, a major in the Danish army, leaves for a second mission to Afghanistan, this time of three months. Jannik's blunt criticisms of the Danes' making war in Afghanistan (which Michael has called "rebuilding a country") are pungent and not unconvincing. Jannik is his own man, and despite his unimpressive life so far, he speaks with confidence and is the more charismatic of the two men. Michael's stolid inwardness isn't very appealing.Michael seems to have been hoping for an easy tour of duty, but on arrival in Afghanistan he's immediately told he must go and find a young Danish soldier who's just gone missing in enemy territory. That's cut short as quickly when Michael's helicopter is shot down over water and back home he's declared dead. In fact Michael is taken prisoner and something horrible happens. This part of the story, which is cut in briefly between scenes of the family back home, isn't shown in detail; everything happens bang! bang! bang! What we see at the enemy encampment alternates between long periods of silent hopeless waiting and a few moments of intense brutality.In response to the news that Michael is dead the family regroups as it grieves. The previously careless Jannik finds he deeply misses his brother and reacts by taking on some of Michael's responsibilities, spending time with the two girls, getting a couple of boozy carpenters to help him finish the kitchen Michael left under construction and then continuing to work with them as a team. Michael's absence has made Yannik grow more serious. He still gets drunk -- this is a hard-drinking country -- and runs out of money at the local bar, but this time he calls Sarah at four in the morning and she cheerfully comes and collects him. Jannik and Sarah, who were at loggerheads, are discovering they like each other. Occasionally they kiss, but Jannik resists the temptation to go further. He befriends Natalia and Camilla, who bond with him.Eventually American troops storm the Islamist encampment in Afghanistan where Michael is held and rescue him. He pretends not to remember what took place there while he was a prisoner but he does. When he is returned to Denmark, he's distant, angry, numb, and inarticulate. He stays bottled up and gradually gets worse. He can't deal with the new dynamics and is sure his wife has betrayed him. This leads to a crisis that as the movie ends may finally be forcing Michael to speak up and get help.The question is, though, can any help he receives, even if it comes, resolve the residue of Michael's brutal Afghan past now? Michael is complicit in an event for which he might justifiably feel forever guilty. There's no forgiveness in sight as the movie ends, and judging by a shocking declaration from little Natalia, the girls seem to have thrown their allegiance in with Yannik and turned against their father. When he finally loses it and grows violent, it's scary and life-threatening, and you wonder how this family could ever be safe with him again.The shattering experience "Brothers" provides is hard to assimilate, and that's probably intentional. The persistent difficulty is that the character of Michael is never really sympathetic, even at the beginning, and hence his transformation is less complex for the viewer than it might have been. Yannik is a more successful creation: the way he is written and acted strikes a nice balance between unreliability and warm appeal from the start. But the movie is not notable for its subtlety. The beautiful Connie Nielsen provides a winning, serene presence that doesn't intrude unduly on the events that swirl around her. If it were not for her and Nikolaj Lie Kaas as Jnnik, there would be no one much to sympathize with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The realism lies not in the war scenes, which work, but in the family ones, which are harrowing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brothers (2004)A remarkable movie in several ways. The first is just that it's well made, with two main layers of story line that are compelling, and some surprising and mostly believable turns. The second is that we (in the U.S.) have a look at the war in Afghanistan from non-American eyes. The echoes are inevitable, and so are the differences, in attitude by the soldiers and in public reaction. The lead actor Ulrich Thomsen is compelling and versatile, and in some ways makes the movie. His range (which you have to see for yourself or you'll be tipped off) is terrific. His wife, played by better known Connie Nielsen (in her first Danish movie, even though she is Danish herself, and knows seven languages) is perfect, too, though she plays someone who is admittedly "boring" and so has less range. Finally, the lead man's brother, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, is charming and a wild card, making the trio appropriately imbalanced. I say all this because it's an acting movie, and a movie about relationships and therefore about plot. It's not a war movie, but more about the effects of war. It's recommended for people who have absorbed American movies like The Hurt Locker. But more than that, it's just a well made, emotional, human interest film. There are a couple flaws (including the key part about the helicopter crash, which just doesn't hold up to common sense), but they are small in the larger, gritty realism of the whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Danish Take on the Usual Post- War PTS Syndrome, Updated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Brothers (Br?dre)" is a Danish "Coming Home" crossed with "Deer Hunter" and the novels of Tim O'Brien with the added frisson of Cain vs. Abel, as updated to the war on terrorism in Afghanistan. While I can understand how this is a new experience for Danes, it could have more impact for someone who has never seen a post-Viet Nam War movie. Otherwise it's like a fairly predictable cable TV movie about post traumatic stress syndrome on a channel that allows four letter words, including as has been done in British television films about returning peacekeepers from the Balkans. The excellent acting rose above the stereotypes to make it very moving anyway, including very natural child actors who were very un-Dakota Fanning-like. Nikolaj Lie Kaas is particularly charismatic on screen, even more than he was in "Reconstruction," and should now be in the international pantheon of rugged male stars who play "bad boys" really well, emphasized by portraying brunettes in the land of the blonds. So I give director/co-writer Susanne Bier extra credit for not fulfilling the most obvious direction of the plot, but instead letting tension hang in the air, which is more powerful. Connie Nielsen, using her native language, has warm and charged chemistry with both her co-stars, but is pretty much just the beautiful wife/mother. Unfortunately, the distributors didn't spring for American English subtitles so you have to interpret Brit slang as if you're watching BBC America. (I did learn in one instance that the F word sounds pretty much the same in Danish as in English but the subtitles didn't match that sound again so I was wondering what other curse words were being replaced with the fundamental English one.) Some times the translation is just plain confusing; for example, the word "assaulted" seems to have a different connotation than something in the Danish dialog, as a plot point gets confused for a subtitle reader. The translation is particularly a problem during a critical scene where the older girl has an outburst, as it's quizzical how scatological her terms were in Danish as opposed to the English choices to understand how incendiary the scene really is.The Afghans are uniformly shown with the same level of subtlety as North Vietnamese, let alone Nazis, in prisoner-of-war movies. It is ironically interesting that English is now the lingua franca between freedom fighters everywhere. The cinematography is beautifully color saturated, but is grainy; perhaps it's blown up from video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shattering experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susanne Bier has made a film that is both superb and complex: it explores profound love and disaffection, the transference of senses across a continent, sibling rivalry, severe guilt, familial dysfunction, and, most of all for me, the insanity of war and how it filters down to a single microcosm -- the family -- and destroys it.That Bier manages to do all of this in less than two hours is a major achievement. You would be hard-pressed to find greater acting anywhere in a single film. Ulrich Thomsen as Michael, the ill-fated Danish soldier and father, is devastating in an acting tour-de-force as a man who comes unwound after a soul-destroying experience as a prisoner of war in Afghanistan. Nikolai Lie Kaas plays his presumably irresponsible brother Jannik -- his opposite -- with a rough tenderness and nuance that's very difficult to see these days. His facial expressions when he hears about his beloved brother's fate are remarkable examples of flat-out great acting.I was stunned to find that this was Connie Nielsen's first film in her native Denmark. She's apparently been working in Hollywood. As the middle-class loving wife of Michael, she is the very picture of a tormented but warm and loving mother caught in a crossfire of emotions over the assumed loss of her husband and her attraction to the flawed Jannik. Her performance requires a high-wire act of emotions, but she manages to understate her work, a very difficult thing to do in such a demanding role. She's a beautiful woman, but director Susanne Bier manages to shift the focus from her beauty and concentrate on her plight as a conflicted wife and mother. That's not easy to do.There are many themes at work in Brothers, but the one that really caught me was the deceptively simple way that Bier shows us the shattering reality of war and militarism in general. Behind all the medals and the bravado (I'm a former soldier who's familiar with this stuff), human beings and human relationships are very often profoundly, and irreversibly, affected. Yet we rarely hear about the intimate details of these very real tragedies. There's a lot of hand-held camera work in Brothers, and it seems to flirt with a number of Dogme 95 principles. It's very difficult to make a Dogme 95 film with all l0 principles intact, it seems to me. Even Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, the prime shakers behind the movement, have drifted away from the 'purity' of Dogme. Despite its severe restrictions, I'm still a basic fan of the movement. After being saturated with so much CGI, it was inevitable that the dialectic was set in motion and Dogme 95 was unleashed in a furious proclamation by von Trier and company. There just HAD to be a severe reaction against the CGI fanatics who INSIST on destroying artistic cinematic expression.Susanne Bier has done a masterful job with Brothers. I was just swept away by the sheer power of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Learning to forgive oneself is not easy to do. A hard medicine of a film, thought-provoking and 'soberingly' touching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Danish film "Brothers" 2004 aka Brodre, w-d by Susanne Bier, is NFE (may not be for everyone). It's about love, a showdown of emotions (the opening music and repeated strains remind me of Sergio Leone's spaghetti western sounding tone). The fact that Michael ('Tour De Force' performance from Ulrich Thomsen of "The Celebration" 1998 aka Festen) keeping his traumatic experience within himself, unable to share with anyone, even his dear wife, is a sobering thought from the post-war effects. He's full of paranoia and is suspicious of everyone around him. It's so hard on him, on family members/children who do not understand what he had gone through that affected his 'warped' emotions and predicament. We cannot weather trauma alone.As audience, we were privy to what happened to Michael as a prisoner of war - we saw what he had to experience - the circumstance and 'no-choice' decision at the time. His determined will focused on 'must stay alive to see his family and loving wife again' kept him hanging on amidst fear and uncertainty under the atrocities/ravage of war. Learning to forgive oneself - to not blame yourself - is not easy to do. What happen happened under circumstances out of your control and yes, it's easier said than done to say that you mustn't bear the burden or guilt feeling within you. We need the love and support of family/people around us - to be able to trust them that they would listen and understand.Connie Nielsen as Michael's wife Sarah and Nikolaj Lie Kaas as Michael's younger brother, Jannik, provided an insightful portrait of the triangle of relationships that thrived and yet to survive. In the opening of the film, Bier has on screen along with intriguing graphic imagery and an eye close-up: "I will always love you. That is the only truth that remains. Life is neither right nor wrong, good or bad. But I love you. That's all I know." Towards the end, the graphic imagery and the eye repeated: "Life is neither right nor wrong, good or bad. But I love you. That's all I know." I caught on Sundance Channel, Dutch documentary filmmaker Heddy Honigmann's "Crazy" 2000, provides 'unpresuming' accounts of how some of the once Dutch soldiers or former workers of UN missions, are dealing with post-war effects by listening or tuning to music as relief. She also did "Good Husband, Dear Son" 2001, a documentary about the surviving women reminiscing their loss of husbands and sons during the 1992 Yugoslav civil war. It's heart-breaking films worth watching.From the PBS special of Dr. Wayne Dyer's Inspiration: Your Ultimate Calling, I heard about Immaculée Ilibagiza's book (collaborated with writer-journalist Steve Erwin) "Left To Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust" - sounds like the act of forgiveness can be easier to practice by learning from her autobiographical account. Couldn't wait to absorb from her shared spirituality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Acute observations..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danish screenwriter and director Susanne Bier's eight feature film which she co-wrote with Danish screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen, is inspired by Homer's poem "The Odyssey". It was shot on location in Denmark and Spain and is a Denmark-Norway-Sweden-UK co-production which was produced by producers Peter Aalb?k Jensen and Sisse Graum J?rgensen. It tells the story about a man named Michael Lundberg who lives in a lucrative home in with his lovely wife Sarah and their two daughters. Michael is like the recipe of success and as opposed to his rebellious brother Jannik, the pride of the family, but his life takes a new course when he is sent on a mission to Afghanistan. Briefly after his departure, Sarah receives a call and is told that her husband is missing in action. Alone with her two children Sarah seeks comfort in Jannik who is more than willing to take on Michael's role. Early on Susanne Bier divides the film into two parallel stories which converges into a dynamic confrontation. The substance in her incarnated character drama is the sporadic relationship between Michael and Jannik who are of the same blood, but of different caliber. One is the apple of the family's eye and gets all the love while the other is the black sheep who has been reminded so often about his shortcomings that he no longer sees any reason in trying to meet the expectations of his family. Both of these characters personalities alters significantly during the course of the film, but the gravity in this in-depth study of character lies in Michael's transformation from happy family man to demoralized war victim.Family relations is a characteristic theme in the films of Susanne Bier and the frequent close-ups which recurs in several of her films is also present here. In "Br?dre", Susanne Bier examines family situations with acute observations which illuminates interpersonal truths. Danish actor Ulrich Thomsen "The Inheritance" (2003), Danish actor Nikolaj Lie Kaas "The Idiots" (1998) and Danish actress Connie Nielsen "Gladiator" (2000) are the central characters in this compassionate drama triangle and their commendable acting performances are one of the main reasons for this films individuality. It lives on it's own terms, many questions are left for the viewers to answer and the natural progression of the characters is given a higher priority than satisfying conclusions. Susanne Bier creates archetypal human figures, tells genuine stories and invites the viewers into her human insight with her distinct and engaging directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No soldier - in fact, nobody - should ever have this moral choice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this gripping and haunting movie in 2005, and spent a long time thinking about it. I began a review, but never finished it because I could not find words adequate to convey the depth of my feelings; even now, I'm not sure that I can do justice to the story (which has been very ably described by many reviewers here already).Thematically, however, it's about a moral dilemma and a man's attempt to justify his decision - initially to himself, and then to others. Hence, in that, the story shares a similar theme as in Sophie's Choice (1982); those who have seen Meryl Streep as the agonist in that film know what she had to do.The twist here, however, is that the soldier faces inevitable death for himself, regardless of the choice he makes. The only question he must resolve is: if I do the right thing, I die immediately - if I do the wrong thing, I die at some other time. But, die I will...and so will another, regardless of what I do. Hence, in biblical terms, the viewer is implicitly asked: to what extent are we all our brother's keepers?Faced with that sort of choice, the soldier has only hope to hold on to - hope that he will not die too soon. And, fortunately for him, the plot allows the 'cavalry' to arrive before that happens.And that event sets up the story of that soldier's rebirth and redemption - all against a backdrop of a wife who thought he was dead, and an ex-con brother who puts his life on the line to help his brother come to terms with the enormity of his...choice, which may or may not have been a crime. I'd not seen any of these Danish actors before. Quite simply, they cannot be faulted in their performances. Technically, the film was well produced and presented. The script was brutally realistic, with the crucial torture scenes in Afghanistan almost unbearable.This is not a film for children. Nor is it a film for adults who cannot accept the truth about what soldiers can face in war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been there. I've had the training. I know what you are supposed to do. But sometimes life happens when you are looking the other way. Two brothers - one a criminal and the other a soldier; one a respected member of society, and the other the shame of his family; one just out of prison, and the other off to Afghanistan.Writer/director Susanne Bier presents a compelling drama that examines how people react to stress, and how people can suddenly change when circumstances call for it. It was beautifully shot, it has a compelling score, and it had one of the most beautiful actresses of our time in Connie Nielsen.Nielsen was incredible as the wife of the soldier (Ulrich Thomsen), trying to keep things together when he was reported dead. She had to show even greater strength when he returned damaged by the war. In the middle was the younger brother (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) who stepped in to help with Michael's two daughters.The story of this family and how they dealt with tragedy was compelling. Anyone who has a family member come back from war can relate.It is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, in more ways than one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A kind of prune Danish about a happily married couple, Michael and Sarah and their two doll-like daughters, and Michael's reckless and irresponsible younger brother Jannik. Michael, a major in the army, is sent to Afghanistan where his helicopter is shot down, and he's thrown into a prison cell with a Danish comrade. Beaten, and with a gun at his head, Michael is forced to batter to death his cell mate and friend.Meanwhile, back home, having been informed mistakenly that Michael was dead, Sarah and Jannik come to respect one another and even to be attracted to one another, although nothing goes beyond a tentative but meaningful kiss.Michael is rescued and returned to his home. But, unable to face his own guilt, he claims never to have seen any other prisoners, and he tells his family nothing about his part in the murder, which, although bloodless, is an especially brutal scene. He's not the guy who left home. He partly blames his family for the killing because it was of them that he was thinking when he bashed his friend's head in. He's irritable, suspicious of Jannik and Sarah, bullies the two kids, strikes his wife, and finally is jailed for smashing his own home. Sarah visits him and orders him to tell of his experiences or she will leave him for good. He tells her, and presumably Michael recovers and the family remains intact. I say "presumably" because this isn't a simple movie with simple answers to questions with labyrinthine implications. The film doesn't endorse the cliché of "getting it off your chest" and putting it behind you. It's not that dumb.That, basically, is the story. It's a rather long movie considering that it isn't very dense with incident. I kept waiting for boredom to set in but it didn't happen. For one thing, Connie Nielson as Sarah is very attractive. For another, the performances all around were outstanding. Michael, in particular, embodies the sort of compulsive military type who believes that everything should be in order, that individuals should take responsibility for what they do, and that talking solves nothing. John Wayne would have approved. Then, too, I was curious to see just how far this post-traumatic stress would drive Michael. Would he really kill his family? We know he's capable of the most tempestuous emotions, despite his outer reserve, because we have seen him scream with horror when a cocked pistol is pressed against his forehead.Finally, it gradually came to me that this is a story about people who fought terrorism and are not Americans, although the invasion of Afghanistan and the toppling of the Taliban was a response to the attacks of 9/11. In many Europen cities on September 12th, 2001, major newspapers ran headlines like, "Today We Are All Americans." And some of those nations went to war with us and some of their soldiers died doing it. It has been not quite six years since those horrible initial events. And who would march beside us today? Where are OUR brothers now? What happened? It's a sobering and enlightening movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unexpected gem - I had heard good things about the film but what people told me made me expect a war thriller or something and instead it is this simple yet powerful story about family, war, violence, brothers, secrets and recovery. The performances are splendid, the script is lean and strong. So many emotional scenes are delivered with no speaking - just emotion and the whole film is well shot. The director knows just when to leave a scene and go to another. The scenes of war and a prisoner's camp are so real, so raw - they are at times hard to watch. A real gem - a powerful drama. The relationship between the the brothers is so well set-up - you know who they are immediately and yet they are not stock clichés. They are both multi-dimensional. Human. Something you don't see in 2005 Hollywood movies that much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very moving film takes seemingly familiar elements (two brothers in love with the same woman, a Cain and Abel good brother/bad brother set up) and makes it complicated, disturbing and sad. Abetted by excellent performances all around, this Danish film tells of a woman whose husband goes off to the Afghanistan War an is presumed dead. She forms a bond with his previously"bad" brother who tries to clean up his act for her and her children in the absence of his brother... only to have the brother return home from war - having been a prisoner - a deeply damaged man.As in "Things We Lost In the Fire"?? Bier shows a knack for setting us up to assume we know the roads a story will tread, only to take us somewhere richer, more affecting and more deeply human. There are flaws, but any film that quietly packs this kind of emotional punch about the damage that war does, the way people can change, and the deep messy-ness of families deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

When in this one all appears to be shot in steady cam, the American way tries to put some melodramatic trigger.This version is about feelings, about situation and personal change: life make us evolve like every decision we take and nothing is good or bad, there is a lot of in between. The chose to accumulate the short shootings, practically no music or just a few notes on one instrument,are trying to bring us along this day to day story really well interpreted. The characters in their flaws or every day basis are believable, there is not so much emphasis like in the good but too much American film. It's in their nature to modify, adjust the deepness of the movie and after seeing this 2004 version, we actually miss something: this authenticity.In both versions, dialogs, ellipses are exactly the same, but characters turned out to be different. We actually have to exact opposite films and this is a real challenge to see both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War traumas in Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2001 the invasion in Afghanistan and especially the ensuing occupation took me by surprise. For in the eighties the Mujahideen had been glorified as the brave freedom fighters, who defended the sovereignty of their nation. President Reagan stressed their rights to live according to their religious beliefs and (backward) traditions. Since 2005, when the international occupation was extended to the hostile south, I was fascinated and indignant at our presence, in particular since the Dutch forces played a (relatively) appreciable role. Seventy years ago the Netherlands itself were occupied by the Nazi regime, without reason. What would this role reversal do to the minds of our soldiers? Although war films are not my primary focus, the Danish film "Brodre" interested me. For it elaborates on the theme of occupation, and Denmark is in many respects the sister nation of the Netherlands. The film tells the story of a Danish officer, who snaps morally during his mission in Afghanistan, and commits a murder. He returns to his family as a mental wreck. The mental problems of veteran soldiers after a military campaign in alien regions are well known since the Vietnam war, and add to the enormous costs of such operations. The narration in Brodre is credible and succeeds in upholding the suspense. We witness the incomprehension of the colleagues and the family with regard to the traumatized behavior of the returned soldier. Nevertheless I am not certain if I have truly grasped the message of the film, in particular the relation between the two brothers. Morally they switch sides: whereas officer Michael commits an atrocious crime, his brother Jannik puts an end to his past as a robber. Obviously the whole family balances on the verge of social dysfunctionality. The father of the two brothers is rude and for instance disposed to drunk driving. The wife of Michael is not the very picture of the faithful spouse. And his children are disobedient, and one of them even gossips without justice about a supposed affair between Jannik and her mother. In the beginning Michael seems to be the solid corner stone of this fragile family. The spectator does not expect that this man of all people is capable of committing a horrible murder. One is inclined to attribute the derailment to the particular borderline nature of his social environment. Still on reflection the story has a more general validity, since military personnel often originates from morally floating communities (few strong personalities will be willing to risk their lives in dubious expeditions). It is interesting that exactly the same theme was addressed in the Dutch film "Stella's oorlog", and therefore a comparison seems obvious. For me the comparison results in a draw. Brodre is more thrilling, whereas Stella's oorlog has the more credible story. In Stella's oorlog the traumas result from a derailed behavior during combat, and friendly fire. The atmosphere in these North-European films is strikingly different from American counterparts like "The deer hunter" or "Apocalypse now", that depict heroism, targeted aggression and inflexibility. If you are interested in the facts, you might consider seeing the documentary "Rethink Afghanistan".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Brothers" is another outstanding film from Danish Producer, Director and Writer, Susanne Bier. After watching "Open Hearts" (2002), "Brothers"(2004), "After the Wedding" (2006) and last but not least "Things We Lost in The Fire" (2007) a recurrent theme emerges from her filmography. In "Brothers", Susanne tells us the story of two contrasting brothers, Michael (Ulrich Thomsen) and Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas). Michael is a scrupulous Danish Officer and family man who is sent to Afghanistan on a rescue mission. Jannik is the younger brother who can't keep himself out of trouble and has recently been released from Prison following a sentence for robbery. Assisted by a beautiful soundtrack and an amazing photography, Susanne shows us the beautiful depth of Michael and Sarah's (Connie Nielsen) love before Michael is sent to Afghanistan. There is a scene at the beginning where Michael tells his soldiers to expect the unexpected in the war-scenario. This scene introduces a sense of 'impending doom' and tragedy that at first seems to be confirmed when Michael's helicopter is shot down. The amazing twist of irony in the narrative, is that the real tragedy is still to come. Prompted by a dysfunctional and emotionally inept father, Jannik decides to help his sister-in-law and nieces through the difficult bereavement. Maybe moved by grief initially, Jannik ends up falling in love with Connie Nielsen and they kiss each other. At the same time and after having survived the helicopter crash, Michael is captured by a group of afghan troops and locked up in a warehouse with a young army technician he was meant to rescue. The captors then decide the young soldier is no longer useful and force Michael to kill him with a lead-pipe to save his own life. The camp is then attacked by British troops who rescue Michael and bring him back to Denmark. Unable to deal with the guilt of having killed the young technician, and consumed by jealousy, Michael starts experiencing bursts of anger and mood swings. The plot reaches its dramatic peak, when the eldest daughter of the couple attacks Michael at the dinner table and in a very crude way tells his father that he is resentful because Sarah prefers to have sex with his brother. Enraged, Michael assaults his wife and brother and is arrested by the Police. The film ends with Sarah visiting Michael in Prison and asking him about what had happened in Afghanistan. At this point, Michael breaks down and starts sobbing in a scene of high emotional intensity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And the consequences of that scene make the end so sad: I do not think that the person played by Connie Nielsen, who demands that 'If you don't tell me, you'll never see me again,' will be able to understand the situation depicted in that ugly scene in Afghanistan. Nor should the man who has created himself the defence 'Do you realise what I did to be with you?' be completely understood. But he will need years to overcome the self-defence, if he ever will. (Perhaps the warning example of his unpleasant hard-line dad will prevent him from becoming as despicable as his father.)

		<shortDescription>the rippling effects of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Danish film, "Brothers," offers a powerful reminder that the dehumanizing effects of war often extend far beyond the confines of the battlefield.In this tale of two siblings who couldn't be more different, Michael is the "good" son, a solid family man with a wife and two daughters and a very strong sense of moral rectitude. Jannik is the "bad" son, a ne'er-do-well drifter who is routinely in trouble with the law and who, as the movie opens, has just been released from prison for seriously injuring a woman in a botched robbery attempt. When Michael is shipped to Afghanistan as part of a U.N. fighting force, he is quickly shot down and taken prisoner by the Taliban militia. Believing him to be dead, the military mistakenly informs Michael's family that he has been killed in action. Jannik is so devastated by the loss of his brother that he vows to help Sarah raise her two daughters. Against their better judgment, Jannik and Sarah begin to develop romantic feelings for one another, a situation that leads to great complications after Michael is eventually freed from his captivity and he attempts to pick up where he left off back home. Unfortunately, Michael's return to normalcy is further complicated by the memory of a heinous act he was "forced" to commit against one of his fellow soldiers while in the camp. Before long, Michael is taking out his anger, guilt and frustration on his own terrified family, and in a sudden role reversal, it is Jannik who must now come to the aid of the brother who had always been there for him when he needed him most. In many ways, this is a story about two brothers who both find redemption for sins of the past.Although the love triangle aspect could easily have relegated "Brothers" to the realm of soap opera, the movie manages to avoid that fate, thanks partly to the restrained way in which the script deals with the subject matter and partly to the sense of reality that permeates the film. These are all fully fleshed-out human beings trying to cope with events far beyond their control - be they the brutalizing psychological effects of a war in a foreign land or the more familiar entanglements and complexities in all things related to the human heart. No one is made out to be the "hero" or the "villain," which belies the wisdom of labeling people in such simplistic terms to begin with (as the boys' father clearly does, having long ago declared Michael to be his one "true" son and all but disowning the troublesome Jannik). The film is filled with haunting, memorable moments that touch us at a deep level, as we see a decent man being driven to madness by a single gruesome action in his life, as well as the devastating ripple effect it has on those he loves.The actors - Ulrich Thomsen, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, and the exquisite Connie Nielsen - truly make us care about the characters they are playing, and the final scene of confession and redemption is haunting in its subtlety and simplicity.As one of the first films willing to acknowledge, let alone explore, the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the small-scaled but memorable "Brothers," written by Anders Thomas Jensen and co-written and directed by Susanne Bier, earns a place in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Melodrama With Pretensions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This melodramatic film does have some fine acting from the principal players, skillful cross-cutting and certain other spare externals which place it in the fashionable Dogme school of cinema, but at the same time it suffers from an excessive lifting of plot and characters from other and finer films. The central plot strand, for instance, one of two brothers, the good one the apple of his father's eye and the bad one the source of the cartoonish father's consistent irritation, is by and large an inferior retelling of that old James Dean flick, "East of Eden." In fact, it's so imitative of this last, it even has the bad brother becoming a candidate for the affections of the woman initially devoted to his good sibling. Secondly, the Afghan war plot strand, with its focus on the surprising and horrific actions war may unleash in the otherwise most pacific of men, though actually shocking, is nevertheless too heavily indebted to and not as good as the memorable Vietnam War sequences of "The Deer Hunter." These Afghan scenes, by the way, do have the courage to show Taliban members as brutal fascists, a daring that "sensitive" Hollywood has yet to engage in.But the real poverty of this film is revealed not just in its too heavily imitative melodrama, but in its status as a melodrama with philosophical pretensions. It aspires to comment on the human condition, but its vision is merely therapeutic and sadly trite. Thus we have not only repetitive visual sequences of reeds blowing in the wind, but even a stale, repeated jingle about there being no good nor bad, nor right nor wrong, "save Love which never dies." This last I put in quotation marks, since it's not only the philosophy of the film but embarrassingly also the quoted credo of the absurd feminist Katisha from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado." In seeking to rise above melodrama to the transcendent, this film becomes one more fallen soufflé.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the movies I liked the most this year - others wrote a lot about acting etc., let me tell you about my reactions.I enjoyed the movie from the very first to the very last moment, it let me feel. Despite the heavy questions there's no solution in the end, and I still felt I take something with me. I understood and lived through something important. There's no 'this is right' and 'this is bad' in the movie, director Susanne Bier presents situations and then shows how each player of the drama tries to cope with it - just like in life.To my surprise, although I didn't know these Danish actors, they play very very well. I don't remember Connie Nielsen (Sarah) from Gladiator as many do, but her performance here is very impressive. The two brothers, Ulrich Thomsen (Michael) and Nikolaj Lie Kaas (Jannik), show a sensitive and fragile relationship between the two brothers. The whole movie pops out just like real life, and the dogma style caught me on, I felt like watching a real home movie, recorded from life.I was touched by the dialogs, the acting, the music, the atmosphere... I have a friend who's husband has been recently returned from war. She told she feels that he must have gone through a lot of things she has no idea of. Now I can imagine what she meant. Therefore I especially liked the moments, when I got a couple of ten seconds to breathe, to digest watching the landscapes; to see people sigh on the screen and sigh with them.This was not an easy movie to watch, but I wish, I could watch more of these, and encouraged me to check out more films played by Nielsen or directed by Bier. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Br?dre: Intriguing and Entirely Real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its American remake a thing of recent memory, Br?dre began steadily to tempt me more and more. A great admirer of co-screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen and general fan of Danish cinema, I recently acquiesced to these mental demands.Having just collected his irksome and opprobrious brother Jannik from prison, Michael sits down to a last family dinner before shipping off to Afghanistan. As he prepares to leave behind wife Sarah and their two daughters, his younger and less adulated counterpart argues with their father. When Michael is reported MIA presumed dead, Jannik is forced to pull himself together to take care of the family his brother has unwillingly left behind.A film based almost entirely on the complexity of familial dynamics, Br?dre quickly establishes each of these to us even before Michael departs early into the film. We see instantly the strained relationship between Jannik and his father, the unmistakable fraternal bond, the love of a father for his daughters, and the quiet trepidation of a family sending one of their own to unknown territory. Br?dre's strength lies, as well as in the clarity and accuracy of its characters' relationships, in co-writer/director Susanne Bier's ability to forge a subtle yet almost tangible tension and animosity in scenes. Her film combines the merest of glances with the shortest of sighs to show us all those things exposition cannot, the weariness of a son living in his brother's shadow one of many such things conveyed almost subliminally. Regular parallels are drawn between the film's two settings, the shots regularly mirroring each other and flickering from the eyes of one character to another. Nikolaj Lie Kaas delivers a consistently brilliant performance, the film's best in my eyes, expertly combining the general dislikeability of his character with the softer kinder touches which cause the audience to warm to him. Both Nielsen and Thomsen offer fine performances, but the true praise belongs to their characters' children, the young actresses churning out astonishing displays of genuine emotion to shame their elders. Issues of family, jealousy, love, and lust are covered in equal measure, though the standout theme is that of war and the horrors engendered by its experience. Thomsen's granite face of stoicism tells a story no words ever can, affording us much emotion and further drawing us into this compelling and engaging story. To highlight a flaw, the cinematography was not always the most appealing, the film's low budget shining through in this respect, though never detracting from the effect of the film itself.Upholding the hugely high standard I've come to expect from the Danes, Br?dre serves up an intriguing and entirely real family drama, bringing with it a rumination upon war and the effect it has upon those who are involved in it both directly and indirectly. Not afraid to put its characters, and thereby its audience, in a difficult place, it makes for a unique and memorable viewing that offers plenty to chew on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is hell... in Danish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having directed a string of "typical" Scandinavian movies, director Susanne Bier goes against conventions with Brothers, a strong product that deals very frankly with some universal concerns, mixed with a sharp look at a traditionally American film subject, i.e. the effects of war. And while the mix isn't always successful, it remains a compelling effort.The story, as suggested by the title, is that of two brothers, Michael (Ulrich Thomsen) and Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas). One is a devoted family man and committed military officer, the other has just been released from jail and is generally considered the black sheep of the family. When Michael is declared dead after his team goes missing in Afghanistan, Jannik does his best to help his sister-in-law Sarah (Connie Nielsen) and his nieces, and eventually forms a very strong bond with all three. Of course, things get complicated once Michael turns out to be alive and returns home with serious emotional scars.Although not a Dogme movie, Brothers retains certain characteristics of the Danish film-making movement, most notably the relative simplicity of story and location, and the use of hand-held cameras to achieve a greater sense of realism. Paired with the almost Biblical theme (in fact, the film's Italian title is based on one of the ten commandments), it makes for a particularly strong experience, aided by the naturalistic performances of the three leads: Thomsen and Kaas, having already appeared in the likes of Festen and Open Hearts, are used to the Scandinavian style and pull off their work with typically heartfelt conviction. As for Nielsen, she is a genuine surprise in the wake of her long Hollywood stint (The Devil's Advocate and Gladiator come to mind, obviously), reverting to her mother tongue and a more stripped-down approach to her character.This isn't to say the film is entirely without flaws: the use of dream-like sequences to bookend the picture contrast quite negatively with the overall realistic feel (the Dogme effect mentioned earlier), and the running time is a bit punishing, with the war-centered part taking up a little too much space in the first half of the movie. But those are just minor quibbles that shouldn't prevent anyone from gaining a positive cinematic experience out of such a strong movie, especially since the American retooling is, well, a little too American.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...I was blown away.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely a film comes along that resonates not only due to its aesthetic quality, but also metaphorically on the level of personal experience. Brothers is such a film. When I saw it, I was blown away.Michael (Ulrich Thompson) is the older and more stable brother of Jannik, played by the by now Danish Superstar Nikolaj Lie Kass, who must first bail his brother out of jail, then report to duty as a soldier in Afghanistan. The helicopter of his platoon is quickly shot down, and Michael finds himself held as a prisoner by an Afghan warlord with one other of his soldiers.Meanwhile, Michael's absence seems to have a good effect on Jannik, who befriends his family and children, and by all observances begins to turn his life around. In an interesting scene, the Afghan leader who has gotten a hold of a shoulder rocket but doesn't know how to use it, asks how assemble it. He confronts the other soldier who doesn't have the know-how how to arm it. When he starts to scream and it looks like he is going to kill them both, Michael Calmly steps in and shows all the steps necessary for engagement of the missile. Now everyone knows that this rocket will now be used to kill as many as a dozen more soldiers, but this is a choice that a person, Michael, has made under pressure that peaked my interest and almost sent chills down my spine. This is a person who loves his family so much and wants to live so badly to see them again, so much so, that he doesn't care for the moment that others will die, he just wants to live.The Afghani quietly notices Michael's will to survive, and soon thereafter off-handedly orders him to kill his comrade. By hand. Michael refuses, then when threatened summons up his will, and yes courage, and beats his comrade to death. It was like a 5.7 tremor shook when this happened. He wants to live so much, and feels he has so much to live for, that he is willing to do anything.Back home, Jannik and Michael's wife, Sarah (played by attractive Connie Nielsen), get news of Michael's death. Since Jannik has become one of the family and spends much time with them, opportunities arise for infidelity, served up with savory dramatic irony for the audience in the pitch-black theater. A raid on the Afghan camp ensues, and in moments Michael is free. And this is the beauty and power of the picture; after his release he is free in the physical sense but is in a spiritual choke hold from his previous action for the rest of the film. This is where the movie begins to take off. It is as if everything else was a primer for the real conflict. I do not think a screenwriter usually thinks about escalating conflict in this way. The entire film, as one reviewer notes, is "a marvel of screen writing." The way in which conflict in this film segues from one level to another is genuinely inspiring; from family, to the politics of war, to the home.This is exactly what low budget films should aim to do. In a production aspect, they should be sure to please a small group of the audience, this I imagine being the European Union in this scenario, and in a story aspect they should resonate with meaning and life. The Dogma 95 style of films also seem to help accentuate and streamline the message.This is a kind of movie which hardly anyone goes to see grosses $300,000 in the U.S., and then fifteen years later, someone comes along, feels it's power, and remakes it in English. They would perhaps draw out everything, and add money to the production budget, and maybe make a small fortune. One critic has said that this was the "Deer hunter for the war on Terror." From what I cam remember, I personally think it is a stronger film.There really isn't much one can do, in my opinion, to make Brothers a better film. In fact, I can not think of a single thing, which makes me look naturally elsewhere for reasons for its narrow box office appeal, in America at least. It is true then what I have been reading about Americans' aversion to reading subtitles, heck, to reading anything for that matter, other than the Star and the Enquirer. God Bless Oprah, and Oprah's book club. Sometimes you have to be big to be noticed, and maybe, just maybe, if this film was in English, with a higher production budget, it would be up for an Academy Award. But most probably, it would be made with much less skill and sensitivity than the original, as we have seen countless times with other foreign films such as Ringu, and Insomia, I am told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The roles of two brothers change in gritty film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main premise of this story is eerily reminiscent of other films such as "The Deer Hunter" and "Coming Home" but that's where the similarity ends because this is a script that definitely has it's own heart and priorities. Story takes place in Denmark where we see Michael (Ulrich Thomsen) who's a Major in the military but before he ships off to Afghanistan he picks up his brother Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) who has just been released from prison after committing assault on a woman. Michael has always been the levelheaded one of the two and has succeeded in pretty much everything in life but Jannik is the opposite and is considered the black sheep of the family.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Michael's wife Sarah (Connie Nielsen) has never really liked Jannik before but she and her two daughters starts to change their minds when he starts to help out around the house after Michael ships out for duty. Meanwhile, a helicopter in Afghanistan is shot down and Michael is taken prisoner by Afghan rebels and it doesn't take long before Sarah and the family are informed that he has been killed. While a prisoner Michael is forced to kill another soldier with a steel pipe in order to stay alive but after he is found by friendly forces he doesn't mention the terrible act that he performed. Michael returns home but he's definitely a changed man and haunted by his behavior in the prison camp and his relationship with Sarah and their daughters starts to suffer. He starts accusing her of sleeping with Jannik but the final blow comes when their oldest daughter proclaims that she doesn't like her father and likes Jannik instead!Written and directed by Susanne Bier this film trudges on material that's already a bit familiar but her script does possess it's own air of freshness to the point where the viewer isn't sure where it's conclusion will end up. The ending is ambiguous and it should be because anything that would even remotely resemble something neat and tidy would compromise Bier's effort and (in effect) turn this into another "one of those" films. This does possess three solid performances that each stand on it's own and it's good to see Nielsen in a more complex role. After serving as eye candy and as the love interest in Hollywood fare she's finally given a meatier role to perform in and let's hope it leads to other films such as this because she's a darn good actress. Thomsen is a sold actor (and terrific here!) but this film offers Kaas the opportunity for a breakout performance and with his brooding demeanor and rugged good looks he delivers the goods. While this film probably won't pop up on too many top ten lists it's still a pretty good effort that stays true to it's heart and gives three very good actors a chance to show their talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brother there art thou?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now Danish movies are beginning to really hurt and Susanne Biel is a good runner-up to Lars von Trier. This is about the Danish mayor who is believed to have fallen in Afghanistan. It's about his daughters, his wife and most of all his brother, the no-good who's temporarily (?) out of prison and has too (?) good contact with the mayor's wife.The acting is good and the conflicts heavy. But they aren't that heavy that you feel alienated. Why can you watch action movies there people are killed all the time and don't mind it? Because it has nothing to do with your life. This movie has, although the situations are extreme, but in a completely other way.Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing is Fair in Love and War?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film features brutal moments, thus not escapist fare nor fodder for my wife as an example. I think she also would have had trouble with the shaky handicam footage. Still despite the fact that this had my stomach twisted up in knots, this film was a compelling watch, and deeply cathartic in some ways.One could see it as emotional response to the war(s) of the day, taking the global and shooting it like an RPG into the local. The film reaches a point-of-no-return, and then soldiers on past that. The audience, like the lead portrayed by Ulrich Thomsen, however may have some trouble after that point. Some shrapnel sticks in the soul...If one reduces war "to kill or be killed", well perhaps that is too cut and dried. Certainly too cut. And in such a reduction, much is lost. The thought of a soldier being ordered to kill, it can never be an easy one. And in this film, that order is charged with deeply unsettling overtones.Kudos to Susanna Bier, interesting to see a woman director who captures the male psyche so well in my estimation. The two male leads are well fleshed out, levels of sibling love and yet sibling dislike are strikingly meshed together. In briefly reading up on some of her films, it seems the notion of a taboo romance is something she is drawn to like a moth unto flame.As others point out, the brothers in this film mirror each other in ways, reflections of atonement. Never an easy action to capture on film, sure there can be physical gestures...but the power of atonement takes place on a very different sphere, if at all.This film is almost like the 7 Up series of documentaries for me, in that when the curtain falls, I was curious, *painfully* curious, where things will be after a period of time.I'm less curious about the lighting of the film, seemed like a glowing oval was superimposed on much of the footage. Didn't pay enough attention to see if it only came at certain moments. It felt intentional, but consciously it did not cohere for me.One last comment, I thought the music was sublime ( a little reminiscent of the soundtrack to "Deadwood" but with some sort of nyckleharp and Afghani aromas as well...) As the film itself screams its emotions so strongly at times, the understated sonic themes were a welcome counterbalance.7.5/10 Thurston Hunger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good even tho i dun understand the language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favourite pick for this year's Intl Film Fest is a Danish film of 2 brothers with totally different characters and life, who are at their crossroads. This was the only film i watched it alone as it wasn't really hyped up or anything so it's like a surprise hit to me and I like films that I will remember in hindsight after more than 1-2 weeks later (my memory is so bad).Acting is the key element in this film and strong feelings are involved here for the 3 main characters and even the 2 children are good. I like the story twist between the 2 brothers and the underlying love/hatred/jealousy for each other can be felt when the tables are turned. The lead actress is very pretty, she's quite a well known actress in Hollywood acting in movies like Gladiator, One Hour Photo?though her acting is more forgettable.The film intercuts between family life and war scenes, quite a big contrast in terms of familiarity vs estranged, quiet vs noise, stablility vs uncertainty, love vs hate. The elder brother who had a stable life and family suddenly toppled to the bottom and became a prisoner while the younger brother, a bummer and alcoholic, was presented with a responsibility and handled it with more composure than anyone think he would.What would you do if you were kept from seeing your loved ones forever? People will do the most unthinkable actions and risk everything they had. Well, what seems to be a great sacrifice for you might not be one for your loved ones. Do keep in mind and this is what I've learned from this film, dun let your love turn into hate. This film ended with a well-deserved round of applause from the viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic drama about a homecoming (SPOILER)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A realistic film about the consequences of being a professional soldier sent to Afghanistan to help rebuilding the country. This portrait of a dysfunctional family is done with drama and nerve. Both in what is said and done, but also through what is left out.Ulrich Thomsen and Nikolai Lie Kaas play their roles to perfection, and Connie Nielsen's first danish-spoken role suites her well.WARNING! MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!This film about the brothers Jannik and Michael is indeed very realistic. Jannik (Kaas) is the younger brother who can't keep out of trouble and Michael (Thomsen) is the older, responsible one. When Michael is sent to Afghanistan and presumed dead, his brother unexpectedly takes the responsibility no-one thought he could. Things go horribly wrong, when Michael returns home to find his role not so solid and when he suspects his wife (Nielsen) to be having an affair, he goes totally amok. Did I miss anything at all? Well,only a better sound quality on the dialog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little tragic tale, in a country called Afghanistan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susanne Bier, is a very beloved director in Denmark. Her movie "Den Eneste Ene", is one of the most popular danish movies ever, in Denmark. A self-claimed classic.Her latest movie, Br?dre(Brothers) is set in Denmark. We get to know a little danish family, and get to witness the story of when the man of the family have to go to war. The biggest flaw of Brothers, perhaps is that it never really takes off. Not as a war movie, nor as a drama. It stay in a quite cohesive mix between the two. While it certainly has a good point and heart, and while it is quite shocking, Brothers never really manage to truly capture the spirit of a truly good movie about war.What is interesting though, is the changing psychology behavior of the characters we get to see, and how they change. Danish filmmakers are not experienced with this kind of movie or theme, so it is to be expected that the movie feels rusty and all over the floor. Much like Danish current politician's, and the hole discussions about Denmarks place in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's a pretty solid movie though. It's good enough to watch. It's just not great. It never really gets intense enough, and that's to bad, because it has the the right premise, not just the muscle to put it into effect.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong film with a few bloopers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this movie I must say that it's good! It has a good plot, a few but very talented actors and without doubt Susanne Bier is also a talented director. I won't bother you with details about the movie since every body else do that, but I'd like to point at a few points where the movie has some grave errors: The brother who is in the Danish army comes from Jydske Dragon Regiment, a regiment placed in the center of Jutland and which is an army regiment. Nevertheless does the movie take place on Zealand which is a completely different part of Denmark and most of them talk with a dialect. Furthermore the regiments base is an airfield!??? It just bothers me that Susanne Bier hasn't made the effort to learn at least a little bit about the army before she made her film. It's such a great film but if you know a bit about the army you'll constantly be nagged about some flaws in her picture of the army. Another thing is that the soldiers doesn't act as real soldiers: Nothing said about the scenes that takes place in Afghanistan, nothing wrong here as far as I can see. It's just that soldiers tend to act a bit more masculine and hide emotions, but not the soldiers in "Br?dre". In this film they all hug and talk to each other like normal people would do. Again: If you know a bit about the environment you'll be bothered with this, but it's probably not something other people will notice.But again, a great film other than that. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Acting; Plot line Disappoints Despite Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my top 5 favorite movies is Suzanne Bier's "After the Wedding." This movie is as close to perfection as a film can be. So I was anxious to see another one of her productions and had to actually purchase a copy of Brothers in order to view it. With such rave reviews, I thought it would be worth it (fortunately paid only $7 on amazon).Unfortunately this movie a disappointment. The plot line holds so much potential, but for some reason it just doesn't work. Connie Nielsen, whom I loved in Gladiator, doesn't give us much of a performance here, and her hair is looks unwashed in a lot of scenes, I assume that's due to the highlights she had at the time.The actor who portrays Michael did a superb job. He is put in a terrible position while in captivity and we feel his anguish as the film progresses after that incident.The brother who becomes a potential love interest is so unappealing as to make her interest in him hard to understand. He's unattractive and smokes incessantly, and I hate to be shallow but honestly, how could anyone be attracted to someone who smelled like smoke all the time?! I did like the final scene and was satisfied with the ending. But everything else was so-so. Perhaps my expectations were too high.The various crying scenes were not well-done at all, and in a movie which involves so much gut-wrenching emotion, it was vital the actors get those scenes right. But they failed miserably.Rent it if you want to see it, but don't buy it. I give the story an 8, but the acting a 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this is how Dogma films all play out,I may not be seeking many more of them. "Brothers" is my first exposure to Dogma and although some of the elements of this simple film deserve praise; I had a hard time watching it to the end. So many lingering shots of the characters gazing and being juxtaposed with each other. I found it too slow. Lingering shots can be extremely effective. Jim Jarmusch is a master of them for instance. If you are going to use this technique make sure the shot reveals something to us about a character, don't use it just to be arty. The story was thin, and unlike many stories that deal with post war trauma, I never believed the three main characters development. I didn't believe the oldest daughter, as young as she was, would say what she said at a reunion dinner. The one character I found to be most well written was the alcoholic father of Michael and Jannick. He was a fine actor as well. In fact, I must say that all the acting was quite good. The script and the style were not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was concerned when Miss Nielsen played royalty in 'The Gladiator '. I have the highest opinion of Ridley Scott but am still plagued by his decision to cast Connie Nielsen. The only explanation I can find in regard to the casting of her in a major role in 'Brothers' is that she agreed to do the film . In the 'world of film' Denmark does not house a large 'Star' pool . My suggestion to her is to take a year or two off from the screen and perhaps ,with the help of Miss Hepburn,begin her studies with something like 'The Lion in Winter'.This apparent manipulative move doesn't say much for Miss Bier I'm afraid either. Lars Von Trier was able to use Bjork in his film 'Dancer In The Dark' because he and she are warrant the gamble. Very bad choice on Bier's part in attempt to join the ranks of world cinema...</fullReview>

Also, we know from previous movies that the director is very talented.But the semi-Danish female lead, Connie Nielsen, is obviously miscast.Yes, she may be a big name in Hollywood. But she only masters one facial expression - and so uses it throughout the entire movie. They could have used a mannequin doll and no one would have noticed the difference! For me this ruined the entire movie. How very annoying, I almost wanted to slap her face - just to provoke some genuine expression.This is supposed to be a serious drama - not a Loreal commercial!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Susanne Bier seems to ride on the horse of current danish film, which have received a lot of attention during the 1ast 15 years or so, mainly due to the revolutionary work of von Trier, Vinterberg and others. Therefor, it is of great importance not to be mislead by the mere fact that Bier's movie is danish and of anno 2004. What is there to say about such a performance? Two brothers, Michael (Ulrich Thomsen) and Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) lead two very different ways of life. When Jannik gets released from prison in which he spent couple of years because of a robbery he committed, Michael is sent to Afghanistan as a major of the Danish Army. Those among us, who are familiar with the American "Vietnam" movies may feel in this early stage of the film, what is about to happen. An amazing fiasco of kitch, scenes and ideas stolen from a countless number of other movies of the same kind, most notably "Returning Home" and "Deer Hunter" and the worst - a sick, racist attitude toward Afghanis, fighting against the occupation of their country, and contempt towards Muslioms in general, as well as their presentation as stupid inhuman monsters. The film was designed in such a fashion, that it seems that Bier was striving an invitation from Hollywood. And indeed, as Bier herself told reporters, she didn't have to wait too long. What a shame, that good actors like Ulrich Thomsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas cooperated with such a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello Moviegoers, I saw Brothers at the Palm Theater which usually plays the great films. This Danish import, however, is awful. It starts out miserable and depressing and goes quickly down hill from there.Michael is a Danish soldier who's sent to Afganistan and taken prisoner. He's thought dead at home and his ex-con alcoholic loser of a brother rallies some maturity to support Michael's wife and daughters. Meanwhile Michael is forced to a barbarous act by his Taliban captors, this is when I walked out. Sorry folks, I'm prepared to withstand some ugliness in a film, but ya' gotta give me a reason to stay. I wasn't willing to sit through the barbarity in Afganistan only to watch the agony promised for his homecoming.And I haven't even mentioned the pretentiously arty camera work, puhleeze. Pointless extreme closeups and dark corners, I thought the projection was faulty. I'm not impressed. And I don't think morose is much of a stretch for actors. Brothers, see it only if misery is your idea of entertainment. Gerald Clare KPYG-FM San Luis Obispo California</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I heard both good and bad about this film before I went to see it last night, things like "Danish remake of Pearl Harbor" and stuff like that made me aware not to expect too much, but then for me, Ulrich Thomsen has always been a guarantee for quality, and (once again) he gave me all I bargained for in the film aswell; he is fantastic. Even Nik Lie Kaas who usually play the same role was incredible. The plot in itself is nothing new and brings nothing new to the light of day, but it's still a very watch-worthy piece of cinema art, no question about that.A few things that bothered me, though... Connie Nielsen, big Hollywood star coming to grace the danish film, is almost totally faceless in this film - she is beautiful, no question about it, but the question is if that is enough to play a lead in a movie? I don't think so. Her lack of expressions made her character almost irrelevant, although of course half of the movies problems evolve around her (her character, that is..)Niels Olsen, for many years a loved "funny man" in danish film (and still is..), but it's very hard for me to "accept" him in his role, to take him serious. The reason is simply that his face, and facial expressions, resembles so many of the funniest jokes ever delivered on danish film and stage, that putting him in this movie was like putting John Cleese in that Frankenstein film that starred Robert deNiro - they can act the hell out of anyone, but it just does not work because you cannot help laughing as soon as they enter the screen....too bad, cause Niels Olsen (and John Cleese for that matter..) are BOTH marvelous dramatic actors aswell - but ...sadly, it just doesn't work...However, a great film and I'm gonna buy the DVD - 8/10</fullReview>
