		<shortDescription>Of such strokes is suspense made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The operatic approach of adding a musical dimension to menace with a killer-theme on the soundtrack has been greatly used in Orson Welles' glorious suspense film, "Journey Into Fear," where the little killer obsessively played a scratchy old 78 rpm disc of someone singing "Chagrin d'Amour." The assassin was short and fat; his belly large, his chin and neck flabby... I do not recall him having a line of dialog to speak? But the whole film was spread with heightened menace when he sat, his little round eyes blank behind his little round pebble lenses, listening compulsively to the atrociously scratchy record, confusing the words of the song at the wrong speed, the needle jumping from groove to groove; his nerve-ends, unlike ours, immune to the discordance?This was a spy thriller set in the wartime Near East, about an innocent American engineer (Joseph Cotten), pursued by Nazi agents and blundering from danger to danger without seeming to know too much of what it was all about?It was essentially a hunter-and-hunted story, with settings that were often seedy but always exotic?The opening was in Istanbul, the climax in Batum, and all the terrors between were forced claustrophobically between the low ceilings and narrow partitions of a neglected little steamer plowing the Black Sea? "Journey Into Fear" lives for its portrait gallery, its atmosphere, and for Welles' touches and excesses?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joseph Cotten plays an American armaments engineer on the run from the Nazis in "Journey into Fear," a 1943 film with a script by Cotten (from a story by Eric Ambler) and costarring Orson Welles and Delores del Rio. Cotten is working on a deal to supply Turkey with weapons to fight the Axis. The Nazis don't want the deal made and are trying to stop Cotten from getting back to the U.S.There are some very exciting scenes in this extremely atmospheric film, in particular on the ledge of a building between Cotten and the terrifying assassin. Most of the film takes place on board a dingy ship where Cotten is taken, thus beginning his Kafka-esquire nightmare.This is an entertaining film for sure, but I've always been troubled by it. First of all, it seems like there are scenes missing. Second, it's on the confusing side since there are irrelevant characters thrown in. Third, you can drive a truck through some of the plot holes. Fourth, the ending to me has always felt abrupt.Suspenseful? Yes. Intriguing? Yes. Ultimately disappointing? Yes. Cotten is good as a man blundering through something he can't quite figure out - the problem is, the audience can't quite figure it out either. Welles has a small but effective role as Dr. Haki.Strong on style, weak on substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wartime noir thriller with Cotten and Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wartime noir crafted from an Eric Ambler thriller, with a screenplay by lead actor Joseph Cotton with Orson Welles, and the influence of Orson Welles is everywhere. He produced and designed the film, and speculation is that he lost control at some point in the production, that RKO brought in another director to take over the project, and that extreme cuts were made. The run time is very short, just 68 minutes. Character development (other than Cotten as protagonist) seems spotty and and events seem to accelerate in the last third of the film, an acceleration not explained by the escalating excitement of the story-line. Nonetheless, the film works as a splendid admixture of wartime intrigue and film noir, and bears the mark of Welles's vision, the strong camera angles, the shadowy sets, the large and small spaces, the cutting. Cotten is fine as Howard Graham, a naval engineer whose assistance to the Turkish navy the Nazis would like to cut short. The plot has a many intricacies and concealed identities, but the strongest character by far is the Turkish head of intelligence, Col. Haki, played by Welles as a powerful, shrewd, smart man with a trace of self-mocking humour. The propaganda function of the film?including its indirect persuasion directed to the U.S. about joining the effort to defeat the Nazis?is very well handled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually arresting...but quirky and bizarre tale of murky espionage...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere along the way, someone took scissors to this film and left it with plot holes that don't connect. Despite the obvious flaws in continuity and plotting, Eric Ambler's novel has been so changed in transferring it to the screen that he didn't even recognize it as his own story, according to Robert Osborne of TCM.The marquee value of Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles is likely to lure viewers into thinking they will see another classic along the lines of THE THIRD MAN. Not so. This is a visually interesting espionage yarn, very little of which is coherent and much of which leaves the viewer in as much confusion as Joseph Cotten's character is. Whom should he trust and who is really trying to kill him?Cotten plays a U.S. Naval engineer aboard a dilapidated freighter who learns that Nazi agents are planning to kill him. The usual Welles Mercury Theater players fill the supporting roles, along with the beautiful Dolores Del Rio. Once the film leaves the claustrophobic freighter and shows Cotten running from his captors, it takes on heightened interest. The scenes in the torrential rain are wonderfully staged and the B&amp;W cinematography gives the illusion of menace in every shadow.But there is virtually no coherent plot and Welles is completely wasted in a small role that he underplays. While the credits say that Norman Foster directed, it is highly probable that Welles himself directed much of it. Perhaps it all made more sense before the running time was cut down to 71 minutes.Ruth Warrick has a couple of nice moments as Cotten's patient wife but none of the characters are fleshed out enough to really understand or care about. Cotten gives his usual workmanlike performance but it all ends with a rather abrupt finish, much ado about nothing.Too many weaknesses to call a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did He or Didn't He?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JOURNEY INTO FEAR was one of the original five mystery - spy - thrillers of Eric Ambler, and while not as strong as A COFFIN FOR DEMETRIOS is a better then average story. He introduces his head of the Turkish Secret Police, Col. Haki, who would reappear in DEMETRIOS. He also continued looking (as Ambler did) on the precarious but desperate attempt to keep Turkey neutral in World War II.The story is simple. Turkey in 1940 has hired an American engineer, Howard Graham, to help do some rearmament work on their ships and fortifications in the Black Sea and the Dardenelles. Graham can get away with this (supposedly) because in 1940 the United States (like Turkey) was still neutral. But Nazi agents are interested in these changes. Graham (who is traveling with his wife) finds that both are endangered, especially after there is an attack on his life at a nightclub. He sends Mrs. Graham ahead to Baku from Ankara, and he takes a boat to hopefully trap the German agents. The only person who knows what he is up to is Col. Haki, who has an agent on the same tramp steamer as Graham is on. But the agent is murdered, and Graham (in the close confines of the steamer) is constantly facing the two Germans who are involved, and there are no apparent people he can turn to. Or are there?He reaches Baku, and just manages to evade the Germans. But how long can he do so, without endangering his wife or himself? Will Col. Haki show up to help?The film has gotten into the Welles' legend as an example of how KANE's after effects led to Welles losing control over films and being branded a second-rater. He was to produce and direct JOURNEY INTO FEAR but he was also producing and directing THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSOMS and then sent by the government to Latin America to do IT'S ALL TRUE. AMBERSONS was cut to ribbons by Robert Wise and a new ending tacked on. IT'S ALL TRUE was abandoned when pressure from the Brazilian dictator, Getulio Vargas was applied in Washington (Welles had taken a dim view of Vargas and his so-called populism regarding fisherman in poor communities on the northern coast of Brazil - the third section of the film dealt with a visible protest by the fisherman). JOURNEY was filmed in 1942. Welles later was gracious, and said the film was directed by Norman Foster, but there seems evidence that Welles did more than produce the film. Certainly he had an affect - scenes are shot showing ceilings, and special camera angles appear. Also his agent Jack Moss was used to play the part of a Nazi assassin (a silent, but effective part). So were Mercury players from Broadway, Radio, and CITIZEN KANE: Joseph Cotton (as Graham), Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warwick, and Everett Sloan, and one Mercury player from AMBERSOMS (Richard Bennett). A dancer - adventuress was played by Dolores Del Rio, who at the time was having a love affair with Welles. While a producer could arrange for his girlfriend to pop up in a bit part in a film (or if she is a good actress in a better part), it's rare for producers to put most of their friends into a film unless they size up the roles fit the friends. It is obvious that Welles had more to his role as producer than just watching the balance sheet. The acting is good, Welles being his usual commanding "man of mystery" here, with twisted nose and astrakhan hat. Cotton is sufficiently increasingly nervous (especially for wife Ruth Warwick)to make the claustrophobia of the ship scenes more realistic. There are great set pieces, such as the introduction of the film where Moss is shown preparing for his assassination mission in his hotel room, carefully grooming his untidy self, to a broken record, and then leaving his rooms. In it's length to the conclusion it resembles how Welles planned to originally open TOUCH OF EVIL with the assassination of Rudy Linnaker. The shooting at the nightclub (involving Hans Conried in an early good performance) was pretty good too. It is not the greatest thriller, but it is more than ordinary in it's production and result and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Your Best Shot At Joseph Cotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While returning from a conference munitions expert Joseph Cotten and his wife Ruth Warrick are taken to a nightclub in Istanbul by the mysterious Edward Sloane where Cotten is almost killed. Magician Hans Conreid is a victim of his own slight of hand, but it's Cotten who's the target as Orson Welles as the Turkish police inspector deduces. Welles's solution get Cotten out of the country so if he's killed at least it won't be on his watch. Welles books passage on a tramp freighter for Cotten and the freighter is loaded with highly interesting characters, one of whom at least is a Nazi assassin.This was another Mercury Theater production with most of the regulars from Citizen Kane/The Magnificent Ambersons back again. Welles's police inspector is a small, but crucial part of the story. Welles, for whatever reason is being unduly modest. Journey Into Fear is undoubtedly the greatest film that Orson Welles never took credit for directing. I can find certain touches here from Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, and The Stranger. If he didn't officially direct you can take it to the bank that Norman Foster knew exactly what Welles was trying to get out of each and every scene.Look also here for a good performance by Mexican cinema great Dolores Del Rio as a most mysterious femme fatale on the freighter.Journey Into Fear is a short film, slightly less than 70 minutes running time. I'm sure that RKO had it playing at the bottom end of double features. Maybe we'll see a 'director's cut' of this one day and know what Welles's own perspective was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging Noir with a healthy dose of humor from Welles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the noir masterpiece we've come to expect with the likes of Welles and Cotton in the cast, but still an engaging film with cleverly shot scenes, witty dialog, and suspense. Joseph Cotton plays Howard Graham; an American armaments engineer in the midst of a deal designed to supply Turkey, a U.S. ally, with weapons to fight the axis. The axis, in particular the nazi's, have other ideas and are determined to prevent Graham from reaching the shores of the U.S. to seal the deal. During a magician's act at a club in the heart of Istanbul, a hit man mistakenly kills the magician instead of graham - or was it really a mistake? Graham is immediately questioned by the head of the Turkish secret police Colonel Haki (played with joyful exuberance by Welles) and for his protection, and the interests of the Turkish military, is put on a ship deemed the "safest" route back to the U.S. Of course this is not the case and the ship is filled with a cast of menacing characters, many not what or whom they seem. JOURNEY INTO FEAR is most enjoyable for its humorous subplots that are eluded to, but never explicitly. When Graham had to suddenly disappear he left behind a wife, and Colonel Haki has taken upon himself the duty to inform her of the crisis but elects to mislead, indirectly suggesting that Graham is a womanizer, with the possible objective to seduce her in this weakened state. "What's to become of me?" She asks. "We'll think of something." Is Haki's coy reply. And so it goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptive Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American ballistic expert and naval engineer Howard Graham (Joseph Cotton) is traveling with his wife Mrs. Stephanie Graham (Ruth Warrick) to Batumi by train. They stop in Istanbul to meet Kopeikin (Everett Sloane), who is the armaments representative of Graham's company, and he takes Graham to a nightclub to discuss business. Kopeikin introduces the dancer Josette Martel (Dolores Del Rio) to him and during the show, the magician invites Graham to go to the stage. The killer Banat (Jack Moss) tries to kill Graham, but hits the magician instead. Graham is forced to go to the Turkish police and Colonel Haki (Orson Welles) from the secret service shows him photograph of Banat, who has been hired by the Nazi Muller (Eustace Wyatt) to kill him. Haki asks Graham to travel to Batumi by steamship since it would be a safer trip. However, Graham stumbles over Banat and Muller, in the beginning of his journey into fear."Journey into Fear" is a deceptive classic with an entertaining spy story. With the names of Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton and Dolores Del Rio, any viewer would expect a great classic but the result is a disappointing plot. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Jornada do Pavor" ("Journey into Fear")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good illustration/adaptation of the classic suspense novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Journey Into Fear' certainly has an Orson Welles look. Although he received neither directing nor writing credit (credit went to Norman Foster and Joseph Cotten, respectively), I think that most of what is there is his. The problem is that there is not enough there there. The on-board relationships should have been developed more. All of them seem perfunctory.Combining the shooting by a good marksman who misses his target and stalking him in the nightclub are combined into an altogether more satisfying single event.The escape from the Nazis is more protracted and less violent than in Eric Ambler's book. It is very noirish and photogenic, and the combination of wet chase and the presence of a murky character played by Orson Welles and an all-American one played by Joseph Cotten prefigure `The Third Man.' Joseph Cotten had some of the same American innocence and ready outrage in both films. He's an important munitions engineer here and a hack western writing there. He doesn't get the dark beauty (Alida Valli or Dolores del Rio) in either, though he has and keeps a wife in `Journey.'The film probably makes sense to those unfamiliar with the book (and such viewers aren't distracted by thinking about what's been changed). It is suspenseful even for someone like me who recently read the book</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric and enjoyable thriller but far from the classic that the names involved suggest it will be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Graham is an American engineer returning from Istanbul with his wife Stephanie. A close call in a Turkish nightclub sees a man assassinated by mistake when really Howard was the target and he and his wife are quickly taken to the Turkish secret police. Colonel Haki informs him that he is a target of the Nazis and immediately gets him transit out of the country on the next available boat while he protects his wife. However Howard quickly finds that he is far from being out of danger as his pursuers are on the boat as well.With keys part of the Third Man cast involved in this thriller, I decided to take a look and had hoped for a film that perhaps would be as enjoyable as that. However it was not quite all that I hoped it would have been as I didn't find myself that gripped by it. The early scenes suggest a real mystery with a good pace but quickly the mistaken assassination of the magician is slowed down and complicated by unnecessary characters and dialogue, some of which seemed to serve very little purpose other than setting up some other scenes later on. With Mrs Howard away somewhere out of vision and therefore out of mind, we focus on the action on other boat and, although quite tense at points, it didn't have the sort of sustained tension that should have been made easier by the confined location of the boat. It does enough to engage though and I did find it quite enjoyable but those claiming this as a classic up there with some of Welles' other films are mistaken because this is only quite good ? not any more than that.The cast was the reason I was here but they were not as good as they have been in other films. Cotton is a bit brash and loud and aspects of his character aren't brought out that well; he was still an interesting leading man but mainly because I have always liked him. Welles has a small role and seems to enjoy himself playing a role that has little screen time but is mentioned throughout the film; I'm not sure if he did direct his own scenes but that is the rumour. Del Rio is sexy and a nice presence but I wasn't overly taken by her other than that. Moss tends to steal the film with his big character lurking around early on, meanwhile the rest of the support are OK, with other languages being spoken rather than the usual American actors putting on vague accents as was often the case (and still is!). Assuming that he did direct the majority, if not all, of the film (and I do believe this) Foster does a very good job of working with shadows in early scenes and in the boat ? some of his angles are effective, although it is easy to see (with some of his shots) why people generally believe that it was Welles calling the shots.Overall this is an enjoyable thriller with a dark atmosphere brought out by good direction throughout. The cast are OK but none of the famous faces really stood out for me here, meanwhile the plot was not as tight as it needed to be, leaving some holes and using some distracting plot devices along the way. Still worth seeing but not the classic that it is often touted around as being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don't grade this movie on the KANE curve... it's a cool little flick!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is a good movie and not a put-on like another poster has said, there is a plot, that the nazis want to kill an arms dealer (cotton) who sells guns to the turks, who're allies of the americans, so that if they kill him the guns for the turks will take a long while because the americans will have to send someone else over to replace the arms dealer. whew! well it is confusing i agree but so are a lotta noir movies and so are a lotta espionage books (this movie is based on an eric ambler novel). it takes a couple times to watch a film like this to really get it. jo cotten (that's how welles' refers to him spelling and all) is great as the lead. he makes a fantastic pawn like in THE THIRD MAN (i think he would have fit the lead in LADY FROM SHANGHAI because he has a lost-in-confusion quality about him and welles is always very powerful and unafraid). orson welles is hardly in the movie but he is fun to watch as a turkish colonel, Haki (pronounced HAWK-E). everette sloane is also fun as his assistant and his fake accent rules. agnes moorehead plays one of the passengers on the boat, where most of the action takes place. and one of my favorite characters is GoGo who is a handsome (tall, dark and handsome if you will) poker playing manager of the beautiful delores del rio - cotten's siren in the picture. it's no 'Citizen Kane' or 'Touch of Evil' or even 'The Stranger' for that matter, but it's a blast to enjoy. a kickback movie that was edited i'm sure by the studio henchmen who crucified welles throughout the forties and wanted him to look mediocre, something he was far, far from. i enjoy the heck out of this little flick and i've owned the VHS tape (hard to find but it's findable) for about a year and i've seen the movie more than a dozen times already. it's good fun and that's that - take it for what it's worth...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ambersons Effect Pt. I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not recommend seeing this on your first round through cinema or Welles, or if you're inexperienced with narrative. It will seem ordinary with some flourishes, and easy to dismiss as a botched studio job. If on the other hand, you've come to be a lucid viewer that collaborates with the film to create your own space, then I urge you to watch this as the Japanese do their gardening.Now we cannot go past Welles when talking about this. Bodganovich believes he had something to do with directing, certainly the few obvious scenes where the camera dances. Welles himself discards any such thing but does not deny collaborating - and can you imagine a film where the genius behind Kane is involved and does not bend the vision to his?In one or the other capacity, this is an Orson Welles film, there's no way past it.But Welles also claims that, if it hadn't been for RKO's meddling, the film was going to be a straight-up entertaining thriller, classy, emphasis on characters and story. That is fine, the way Hitchcock did things, but it's not what we have. RKO rolled in and deliberately botched it, the sooner to be rid of its wunderkind. So popular opinion has naturally filed this under muddled story with some interest where Welles is supposed to have directed, and largely forgotten all about it.No, something else goes on here, what I call the Ambersons effect. Ambersons was the other film that RKO destroyed while Welles was away in Brazil (the two films were simultaneously filmed), and is a much more clear example of what I'm talking about. It was going to be something on the scope and innovation of Kane, was botched, almost one third of it, and we're left with an unfinished, peculiar masterpiece that in turns is and hints at the film it was meant to be.My notion is that both this and Ambersons indirectly benefited from this meddling, the result being a radically new type of narrative. The Ambersons effect is a story that collapses in on itself as focus shifts 'on' the story, which comes from studio editors cutting a complex story for continuity. It is one of those genius accidents that no one could think of until it simply happened by itself. I elaborate on this in my post for Ambersons.So look at this. Superficially, it's a noir thriller about an American arms adviser in Turkey who is forced to go on the run to avoid being murdered by Nazis. He's forced to go undercover in short notice, boarding a freighter with a sexy cabaret dancer. But he has left a wife behind in their hotel room.So how to exemplify intense anxiety that comes from dislocation in the world of the narrative? Here come two amazing narrative devices written in by Welles.The first is that he's writing a letter to his wife that explains his prolonged absence, we never see him actually write but bits of this are narrated to us all through the film. The feeling of guilt and adoration that pours from it so peculiar, it makes one wonder if he hasn't really eloped with the dancer - or desires to - and our film is really his far-fetched fabrication where nothing happens of his own free will and he's practically buffeted around by forces beyond control. The other is where the entire plot is set in motion on a stage with murder as part of a magician's disappearing act, except the magician is killed in our man's place. What better way to stress fabrication?So a world that magically shifts so that fates are in control and calling the shots, fabricated as a narrative that excuses loss of control that is desire for the woman in the cabaret, the deceit mirrored in the host of strange characters onboard the ship acting roles.One is a henpecked husband who discovered he can spout off communist talk to embarrass his wife into submission, another clue here; over time, he became the invented role and now believes in the act. He's now a fervent communist. Another is the Turkish hit-man registered on the passenger roll as a Greek businessman. This has a rich political subtext on the region the ship sails through, the Pontic coast, where hundreds of thousands of Pontic Greeks were massacred by the Kemalists, the regime served by Welles' character in the film.There is poker involved as means of wrestling away control of the story, and another agent counter-plotting. Of course moral anxiety our man is feeling becomes so devastating, the voyage becomes this strange ritual journey where characters prepare him for death. Notice the talk on the deck - also deceiving - about change and time stopped. Notice the sailor who pretends to shoot him and cackles hysterically.So how does he come back into the light? Of course he tears away the story as soon as he's finished actually writing it. The wife will never know, or the thing never happened, normal life can be resumed. This is great stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Case Of "Potential Unfulfilled"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Journey Into Fear" is an intriguing wartime thriller which features a frightened protagonist, a Nazi assassin, exotic locations and a variety of rather eccentric and sometimes threatening characters. The story which is based on Eric Ambler's espionage novel of the same name is quite involved and the action takes place in an environment which is often tense and menacing.Howard Graham (Joseph Cotten) is an American armaments expert who visits Istanbul with his wife during World War 11 and is met almost immediately by a man called Kopeikin (Everett Sloan) who is his company's local representative. Kopeikin is very pushy and quickly persuades Graham to go with him to a local nightclub where a magician is shot and killed in circumstances which convince Graham that he was the intended target.The nightclub incident is investigated by Colonel Haki (Orson Welles) who's the Head of the Secret Police. Haki is aware that Graham's expertise is vital to the planned re-armament of the Turkish navy and that if anything happened to him, the project would suffer a very damaging setback. Haki tells Graham that the attempt on his life had been made by an assassin called Peter Banat (Jack Moss) who'd been hired by a Nazi agent and then, for his own safety, promptly arranges for him to travel on a cargo boat to Batumi.During the journey Graham grows more anxious as he finds himself surrounded by a strange group of passengers which includes Peter Banat and when he tells the ship's captain that he's seen an assassin on board, the disbelieving captain openly ridicules him for being paranoid. At the end of his journey, Graham is ushered into a waiting car by Banat but when the car has to be stopped to change a flat tyre, Graham makes his escape. A frantic chase follows before the story reaches its extremely tense and exciting climax.Expressionistic lighting and some eccentric camera angles are used to good effect to create the disturbing atmosphere which seems to permeate the whole movie and the impressive opening sequence and a shoot-out which takes place on a hotel ledge are both exceptionally well executed. Norman Foster is credited as being the film's director but over the years there's also been a great deal of speculation concerning the extent to which Orson Welles was involved. What is indisputable, however, is that "Journey Into Fear" certainly has a great many of the characteristics which audiences readily recognise as being Wellsian.It's well documented that Welles was committed to completing this movie for contractual reasons and no doubt, this fact and the studio's subsequent heavy editing resulted in an end product which has a real throwaway quality about it. There's so much that's so good in "Journey Into Fear" that it inevitably leaves the feeling that, with greater commitment, it could have been even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusion gloriously reins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it says Journey Into Fear was directed by Norman Foster, but many sources say it was actually Orson Welles who directed it. Possible of course since this Mercury Theatre production was produced, co- written {with co-star Joseph Cotton} and starred big Orson himself. But wait! Welles is on record as saying he did no directing on the film and it was his friend Foster in the chair. Except for Welles' own scenes which were directed by anyone handy since they were rushing because Welles was due in Brazil to film It's All True! There has also been re-cuts by Welles, added scenes and a narration at the beginning and end that has been and gone over the years. It's all appropriate confusing conjecture tho since the film itself has a strange quirkiness nestling within its arresting visuals.The story is based on Eric Ambler's highly regarded spy thriller, and sees Howard Graham {Joseph Cotton} as an American engineer, who after a conference in Turkey finds that someone is trying to kill him. We are then thrust into a murky world of espionage where everybody, their motives, and their identities are suspect. Graham is the classic innocent man abroad, we the viewers, as well as everyone in the story but Graham, knows more than he does! I bet Hitchcock loved this film for it be right up his alley. The majority of the film takes place aboard a cramped dilapidated liner, this gives off a wonderfully claustrophobic feel to proceedings. The stifling nature further enhanced by the fact that 99% of the film is set at night time, with Karl Struss' photography utilising shadows and exuding an almost bizarre menacing sheen. There's some nice technical Welles trademarks in here, such as crane shots {the opening scene is moodily awesome} and Welles' well publicised love of magic is given a cute nod during one particularly impacting sequence.Along side Cotton the cast contains solid performers like Dolores del Rio, Everett Sloane, Ruth Warwick and Agnes Moorehead. But it's Cotton who rightly makes the big impact. Understated and quiet, his Howard Graham infuriates with his inability to grasp what is going on, or to act at times when it clearly calls for the swift clank of brain being put into gear. A real smart bit of casting here from Foster, Welles or whoever! Journey Into Fear, for texture and technical composition belongs in the film-noir genre, certainly as far as the early cycle goes. But really it's a film for the general cinema purists, at times brilliant, at others chaotic, it remains engrossing from start to finish. See it if you can. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Journey Into Fear was a mostly fine thriller from Orson Welles and company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched The Magnificent Ambersons last night, I decided to watch the next movie that involved Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, and Agnes Moorehead: Journey Into Fear. Let me first address the credits-I'm willing to believe the quote from Welles that he did not direct nor write this movie but simply produced with Norman Foster helming and Cotten himself adapting the screenplay from an Eric Ambler novel. But the beginning pre-credit sequence and some dialogue exchanges certainly have a Wellesian flavor. Overall, while there are indeed some talky sequences that don't always move the story along, there's nothing boring about any of them especially considering the short running time (for a major studio A-picture, anyway). I especially liked Frank Readick's performance as Mathews-a cockney socialist-especially near the end when he says some radical things in front of his wife (Moorehead) to hide something he's planning with Cotten's Howard Graham. Also good is Jack Moss as silent heavyset gunman Peter Banat who's trying to kill Howard because of his occupation. This was Readick and Moss's only film appearance and they were both excellent with what they did with it. I also liked Dolores del Rio and Jack Durant as Josette and Gogo Martel. And Hans Conried-who I'll always fondly remember as the voice of Captain Hook in Walt Disney's Peter Pan-is compelling in his brief role as a swami magician. Cotten himself is fine as Howard constantly tries to avoid getting killed as he goes on ship before the showdown at the hotel parapet. And Welles deliciously chews the scenery as Colonel Haki with whatever foreign accent he chose for his role. If there were some disappointments, well, Ms. Moorehead didn't do much in her role and neither did Ruth Warrick as Howard's wife Stephanie. And, yes, there could have been some cut scenes that could have explained some sequences clearer. Still, I loved the atmosphere that was conveyed throughout and the finale chase was very exciting. So on that note, I highly recommend Journey Into Fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles graciously denied having any directing role in Norman Foster's 'Journey into Fear (1943),' though his influence appears to be all over it. 'Citizen Kane (1941)' first showcased Welles' fondness for filming people via low and high-angled cameras, a stylistic technique that distorts statures, placing the audience in a position either of power or helplessness. Here, the talented Karl Struss ? who also worked on such films as 'Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927)' and 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)' ? employs similar techniques, capturing human faces with a threatening immediacy that distorts their features and suggests imminent danger. You won't, of course, fail to notice that the film's cast also boasts more than a few Welles regulars, mostly members of his Mercury Theatre team ? Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Everett Sloane, Ruth Warrick and Welles himself. The film's screenplay was written by Cotten, his sole attempt at writing {outside some uncredited work on 'The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)'}, a pity since the dialogue is frequently crisp, intelligent and memorable.'Journey into Fear' is one of those rare WWII-themed films of the early 1940s that you wouldn't automatically class as propaganda. Indeed, the Nazis are only mentioned in passing, and the sinister agents who attempt to assassinate Cotten could just as easily be motivated by reasons other than war. Much of the story takes place on a small passenger ship, on which American engineer Howard Graham (Cotten) seeks refuge from German assassins, who are hell-bent on delaying his return home with important Allied intelligence. Silent enemy Peter Banat (played by Welles' agent, Jack Moss) watches ominously from across the ship's cabin, never saying a word, but suggesting sadistic menace through every dryly-amused smirk. Cotten is strong in the lead role, playing Graham as a frightened and confused amateur, a role reminiscent of Holly Martins from 'The Third Man (1949),' rather than the experienced and resourceful American spy we would otherwise expect in such a film. Welles lends his mighty presence to the role of the Turkish Colonel Haki, though he is noticeably more subdued than usual.In one final manner, 'Journey into Evil' is very much like an Orson Welles film: it was re-edited at the studio's request. According to some sources, Welles did some of the trimming himself, recutting the final reel and adding Joseph Cotten's rather awkward narration. At just 68 minutes in length, the film certainly feels as though it has been tampered with. The relationship between Graham and Rosette (Dolores del Rio) is brief and poorly explored, and certainly not worthy of the repeated reassurances that the former frequently bestows upon his anxious wife (Ruth Warrick); there's little indication that the their affiliation extended beyond exchanging a few harmless pleasantries. Though the film doesn't exactly feel incomplete ? as did a noir like Renoir's 'The Woman on the Beach (1947)' ? the bare-bones narrative gives the sense of a minor and inconsequential work. Even so, 'Journey into Evil' is well worth seeking out for its terrific photography ? including a superb climax on the slippery ledges of a hotel exterior ? and the talents of a very talented cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks Like Welles to Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ingredients are there for first-class international intrigue?Welles, Cotten, an Ambler novel, and the terrific RKO team of D' Agostino and Silvera behind so much of the studio's b&amp;w artistry. So why is the end result short of the classic it should be. IMDb lists 3 uncredited writers in addition to the credited Cotten. Maybe that's why the narrative is so choppy as other reviewers point out. Then too, maybe the studio exercised a heavy hand in the editing room as they were known to do. Whatever the reason, the story never really gels into the suspenser it should be, despite the impressive visuals so clearly Wellsian.Nonetheless, the nightclub scene especially stays with me. Catch the neatly choreographed staging as the characters dart in and out of the foreground reminiscent of the high-kicking dance scene in Citizen Kane. And who else but a magician (Hans Conreid) would trick himself into a casket with such Wellsian flourish. Note too how visually appropriate non- actor Jack Moss is as the "obese gunman". Apparently, he couldn't be entrusted with any lines, but looking like a mutant garden slug he rivets the eye by sinister presence alone. In fact, this may be the kind of film made more enjoyable by turning down the sound and just reveling in the visuals. Yes indeed, the narrative may disappoint, but the very real Wellsian compensations remain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat interesting career footnote of Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Journey into Fear" is one of those 'what if' films...in this case, one wonders, "What if Orson Welles had not been taken off this film by the studio? Would he have been able to make it another masterpiece on a par with "Citizen Kane" or "Magnificent Ambersons" (despite its studio-tacked on ending)? The opening shot of "Journey into Fear" is riveting, pure Welles, and promises of great things to come...but they never do, until perhaps the final ten minutes of the motion picture. Great tracking shot in the opening, fine premise set up with the film's first (and principal) villain, then the scene cuts to Joseph Cotten, Edward Sloan, and Ruth Warrick, and suddenly it is like the driest stage play one can imagine. What happened? Joseph Cotten has played many memorable roles, but he was not know as a writer, and the screenplay of "Journey into Fear" is paper-thin. Welles' performance is somewhat interesting, and his camera-work in the opening, closing, and a few fleeting moments in between are brilliant, but it is not enough to carry this film. For completists only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While in Turkey with his wife, Navy engineer Howard Graham (Joseph Cotten) finds himself pursued by Nazi agents out to kill him for reasons that aren't so clear to him (or us). Colonel Haki (Orson Welles) of the Turkish secret police puts him on a steamship to get him out of the country safely. On board he meets an assortment of colorful characters before realizing the assassins have followed him onto the ship.This is one of those movies Welles acted in that has so many of his directorial touches, yet another person is credited as director. In this case, Welles' friend Norman Foster. There are conflicting reports on who actually directed the film, including different statements from Welles himself. What we know for sure is that Foster directed at least some, if not most or even all, of the picture. Welles was set to direct but had to back out. He did co-write the screenplay and his notes for when he was going to direct were likely still used by Foster. This looks nothing like Foster's other films yet it does have that Welles feeling so, whatever the truth about who stood behind the camera, I think it's safe to say creatively the movie is more Welles than anybody.A blend of film noir and a WW2 espionage tale, the story doesn't always make a lot of sense but it's such a good-looking movie that it kept my interest throughout. It's also a short movie; about the same length as the average B picture of the time. The cast backing up the always-good Cotten and Welles features some entertaining Mercury Theatre regulars like Agnes Moorehead and Everett Sloane. Dolores del Rio is fine, as well. It's got a nice atmosphere and a reasonable amount of tension. As I said, it certainly looks great. In many ways, this feels like a Hitchcock imitator. But don't expect that kind of pacing or tight storytelling. It has suspenseful moments but the confusing plot brings the momentum to a halt at times. Welles fans will probably enjoy it more than most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything Orson Welles endeavored after Citizen Kane has at least some controversial or intriguing behind the scenes skulduggery. This one is certainly no exception. Film Historians, to this day, discuss just how much he was involved Directing, Writing, and Editing this Foster Child. Like so much of his Art there is an infallible indication of his presence on screen. To keep it simple, the tone of the Movie. The look, feel, and ambiance that was unmistakable Welles.This one has all that and shows signs of outside tampering but it is nonetheless a better than average little Noirish Espionage Thriller that has an appeal of snidely foreigners in dark and wet locales that give this little story of an Inventor/Bureaucrat caught in the muck of undercover uneasiness and life threatening fear. It is that journey that our everyman Hero must wiggle, sidestep, and use his wits to stay alive.This is richly atmospheric, and the beginning and closing scenes make this worth more than most. There is some effort involved to keep a handle on things as they do get muddled, but it is all a lot of sinister fun and the Talent involved couldn't help but pull off a rather entertaining, if minor, Gem. This reminds one of Underground Art, apart from the Mainstream and just below the surface of the regular stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mercury Production Is No "Citizen Kane"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rather innocuous collaboration between Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, the final and weakest of the trio of films released by Welles' Mercury studio (the other two being "Citizen Kane" and "The Magnificent Ambersons")."Journey Into Fear" plays like second-rate Graham Greene, with Cotten playing an American munitions dealer who finds himself the target of an assassination attempt by a group of Nazis. Much of the picture takes place on a seedy steamer intended to carry Cotten to safety. The film's got some nice touches, and there's a pretty exciting shoot-out finale that's something right out of Hitchcock, but the overall package isn't that memorable.Welles has a supporting role as a Turkish police chief and Welles regular Agnes Moorehead appears as a grumpy French woman. Cotten, the go-to actor for playing Americans stuck in the middle of foreign intrigues, wrote the screenplay.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** American US Navy ballistic engineer Howard Graham, Joseph Cotton,is in Istanbul Turkey trying to get the Turkish Navy the latest state of the art coastal defenses. This is in the event of a possible German invasion, in order to outflank the Soviet Red Army, of that natural country.It isn't that long that Graham is targeted by this bumbling and enormously overweight assassin Peter Banat, played by Jack Moss in his only acting role, who's being paid by the Nazis to murder him. Banat, the best hit-man the Nazis can get, is so clumsy and incompetent that he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from as close as a distance of less then ten feet! This makes Banet not only one of the most bizarre hit-man in movie history but at the same time one of the most comical.Put on a boat traveling to the Black Sea port of Batumi by Turkist police Col. Haki, Orson Wells, it's thought that this would keep Graham safe and out of arms way until he can safely return to the USA. As you would expect the over-sized Banat ends up a passenger on the boat together with his intended target Howard Graham. Also on the boat is Banat's boss a Germen Agent called Muller who's disguised as an old man, that's about as far as I can go without revealing his identify, intent on living out his last days at sea.After a number of near misses by the butterfingered hit-man Banat it's decided by his boss, who now reviles himself to Graham, Muller to get the job done himself! This "Master Plan" by Muller is to be done in such a mind boggling and incomprehensible way that it makes even the totally incompetent hit-man Banat look like a genius in comparison! By then Graham, who's anything but a hero, makes his escape from both Muller Banat and a group of Nazi agents in a hotel in Batumi where his wife Stephanie, Ruth Warrwick, has been staying, courtesy of Col. Haki, since the start of the movie.The big final has Graham chased along the ledges of the hotel, some eight stories up, during a driving rainstorm by the almost blind, with his glasses all wet and fogged up, Banat. Col. Haki who joins the chase in order to keep Banat from killing Graham ends up falling through a hotel window as he tries to come to Graham's aid. Like we've seen all throughout the movie Banat proved to be a total dud in not only using up all his ammunition but foolishly trying to murder Graham bare handedly which proves to be, with his massive weight unable to support him, his own undoing.The whole story is told to us in a long and boring flashback by Howard Graham himself as he writes his wife, who seemed to have walked out on him, Steph explaining his unexplainable actions in the film. In Graham's letter to Steph, which he later tears up, he's trying to prove to her that his relationship with dancer and singer Josette Mantel (Delores Del Rio),another passenger on the boat he was on, was of purely innocent nature and nothing ever came of it.P.S It seemed that both the movie's star and director Orson Wells as well as its screenwriter Ben Hecht had their names removed from the credits. This must show how much they liked, or disliked, the film that they were so much involved in making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WW2 Thriller with a Turkish Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the number of WW2 films set in Western Europe, those set in Turkey and the Middle East are rare. This is an interesting example; a spy/mystery/noir thriller about an innocent man who becomes the target of a political assassination plot. Joseph Cotten stars in his own screenplay (based on a novel by Eric Ambler, master of the WW2 spy story), with a cast studded with members of the Mercury Theatre troupe (Welles, Moorehead, etc.).Welles takes a plum part as the head of the Turkish secret police, who forces Cotten to leave town on a "traveling slum" of a boat, filled with interesting characters (at least one of whom is probably his would-be killer). Deft plot twists mingle with moments of humor and a touch of romance. Watch carefully and you'll even recognize Hans Conreid ("Snidely Whiplash") as a hapless magician. A cliff-hanger (or hotel-hanger) ending is a good wrap-up to a brief but interesting war thriller.</fullReview>

While the whole cast seems to simply deliver their lines (as was the style of acting in the 40's), Orson Wells truly lives his (small) role, delivering a real performance among crudely exaggerated parts by other actors! The script is frustrating, the story ends without a very much needed development - the promised plot offered some good possibilities but none were taken. The opening scene, for example, is really exciting and one could even expect a movie with the suspense levels of a Hitchcock's but the expectation soon dies out. Physically the roles were well cast but one would expect much more in terms of acting...and I've seen great acting in films from the 40's so age is no excuse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinda cheap, but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that may well qualify as a cheap thrill ride. It has a mix of mediocre, but also some pretty good scenes. Orson Welles is listed as an uncredited director, one can assume that he has had some influence here. Although Welles is barely in the film, and with one of his more mediocre performances, he still out acts all the others, even Cotton.The film's main problem is that it does not bother to go particularly deep into things. It seems like they were in an awful rush just to make something. Characters fly from side to side, and nobody seems to know exactly what to do with them. It tries to build up a little humor, but it usually falls rather flat.Despite all this, Journey Into Fear is an entertaining movie. The climax scene is phenomenal, and it has many good scenes to back it up. A couple of not too surprising twists makes it exciting enough, but not more than your usual B-crime movie. A not too long running time makes the problems not bother me as much as they otherwise would, albeit some extra scenes and more innovations could have done it some good. But as I said it's entertaining enough. Good enough to relax to after a tiring day when you do not care to think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has plot holes you could fly a jumbo jet through. And it has absurdities that will drive you crazy. To say that this movie is totally incoherent would be an understatement. I was just lucky that I'd read the book before so I kind of knew what was supposed to be going on. I also didn't understand the reason for most of the changes from the book: Why would an American in Istanbul travel to the Georgian port of Batumi in Eastern Black Sea, part of the USSR, to get back to the US?! Why is his wife with him in Istanbul? She disappears in the beginning and reappears in the end. Why he's not delivered his coat and suitcase from the hotel before the boat leaves? Etc. etc. These changes don't make any sense, either plot-wise (tighter) or production-wise (cheaper). Silly.Cotten plays like a robot. Except for him, there is some promising casting but the actors have neither the time nor the lines to do anything with their characters.Maybe somebody shot a proper full-length version of this movie and then a mad joker cut out the crucial 1/3. Then somebody edited it while trying to land a plane in a hurricane. I don't know. It certainly has not aged well at all. If you're looking for another "The Mask of Dimitrios," this isn't it. This accident of a movie reminds me of some shorts from the 1920s. Pity.PS: I saw the version with the horrible voice-over and the terrible ending..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen two versions of this film - the 68 minute version supposedly recut by Orson Welles as part of his contract settlement with RKO (see IMDb trivia) and what I assume must be the first Norman Foster cut which was panned by the critics at the time. The latter I first saw on Melbourne television in the mid to late 1970s, and was impressed enough for me to rewatch it on two subsequent occasions within the next 10 or so years. The opening sequence with the fat assassin and the gramophone particularly stood out for me at the time because it was so unlike any movie opening I had seen in movies from this period. Anyway, I had simply assumed that this was the version everyone else saw until I revisited the film again on Melbourne television last week and immediately realized from the opening minutes that this was not the same version I had seen all those years ago. Normally when I say this it is hard for people to believe I remember old movies this well, and simply dismiss it as being in my imagination, but fortunately I had an old VHS copy left over from my last viewing and was able to compare the two versions scene by scene.For what it is worth, I prefer what I assume to be the original Norman Foster version, and it is this on which I have based my score of 8 for this movie. I still suspect that Welles had a directorial hand in this, all denials notwithstanding.</fullReview>

The plot plods along with strange contrivances. The relationship between Cotton and his wife does not sit well and ends with the worst scene in the movie. The only thing to fear in the movie is Everett Sloane's twitchy performance and the insane getup of Mr Welles. The bad guys are quite useless. Cotton is barely there.

		<shortDescription>Journey Into Fear:The US and Euro Cuts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May 2016:Reading IMDb's Film Noir board,I found an excellent post about an Orson Welles-starring Noir.Looking for more info on the title,I found out that there were two cuts of the movie,with the "Euro" cut being vastly different to the US one. Finding more details on Welles sites about recent screenings,I was disappointed to learn that the "US cut" (whose presentation is on a long deleted French remastered DVD) was the only one around on US and UK DVD.Trying to find out more about the Euro cut,I spotted a post which revealed that the Euro cut has come out on DVD(as Estambul) ?in Mexico!July 2016:Crossing my fingers when the disc hit the landing that it was the Euro cut,it hit me that I had not picked up a disc of the US cut to compare it to. Glancing at downloads in order to do a quick comparison,the very first link I clicked on was for?the long out of print French remastered version,which led to me getting set for two journeys into fear.The plot-WWII-Turkey.Entering the hotel,US ballistics expert Howard Graham (who wants to help re-arm Turkish ships) and his wife Stephanie are met by Kopeikin,who works for Howard's company.Wanting to talk business,Kopekin takes Howard alone to a night club.Unknown to the guys,a mysterious man looking across the streets follows them.During their chat,Howard joins a magician for his big set-piece.Dimming the lights,a loud gun shot is heard.Aiming for Howard,the stranger discovers that he killed the magician instead. Pulled from the club to the secret police headquarters,Howard is told of a Nazi plot designed to send a shiver of fear down his spine.View on the film:-Note:Due to how different they are,I will give both cuts separate reviews.Reuniting with two fellow stars of Citizen Kane,co-writer/(along with Richard Collins/ Crime Without Passion director Ben Hecht &amp; Orson Welles) Joseph Cotten gives a striking performance as Howard via skilfully blending Howard's wide-eyed, fish out of water Film Noir loner with a quick-wit, that gives Howard's battle against the underworld an espionage atmosphere. Hightailing in a year before she would break up with her co-star (and uncredited co-director) Dolores del Rio shakes the movie with a sassy purr as dancer Josette Martel,whilst Agnes Moorehead (who loses the most in the US cut) gives Howard's escape plans a frosty bite as Mrs.Matthews. Stomping round as Jack Moss's Peter Banat hisses in the corner, Orson Welles gives an excellent performance as Colonel Haki. Displaying a real relish in chomping out orders, Welles keeps a playful Noir cunning just under the surface of Haki's military march,which reveals itself on the murky dealings of the ships floor.The US cut: 6/10.Solely credited to Cotten,this adaptation of Eric Ambler's novel moves at a quick pace,partly caused by studio enforced dissolves.Going for a lighter.more comedic mood,the addition of a narration completely changes the perspective of the movie,due to it being made clear that Howard is talking about events from the past,which clips the Film Noir dread that setting it in the "present" allows the Euro cut to grip on. Emphasizing the comedic elements with chainsaw editing,the relationship between the Graham's is limited to just two scenes.This leads to the movie being transformed into a cheerful man on the run caper, complete with large jumps in plot, (where does Howard get the gun from?) a lack of psychological depth into Howard's Film Noir nightmare,and an ending that is chopped off, with a misshaped happy coda that brings a character back from the dead.The Euro cut:8/10Pulling the narration,happy coda and focus on the comedic side,the screenplay by Welles/Cotten/Collins and Hecht open up the raw war time Film Noir paranoia,by smartly making Howard's attempt to escape from Banat on a ship,to sail onto fragile relationships,where doubt and mistrust is lit by the Film Noir troubled times. Taking place in the "present" the writers make Howard's relationship with Stephanie a beacon of light shining in the darkness,as Howard has to grasp at the smallest hope to send Stephanie a sign of life. Catching Banat lingering silently in the background,the writers bask the title in Film Noir dread,via giving Howard a raging fear over Banat's tune whirling down a brittle Film Noir street pelted with a haunting ending that leaves Howard melting in the Film Noir rain.Turning the volume down on Roy Webb's energetic score, co-directors Norman Foster &amp; uncredited Orson Welles and cinematographer Karl Struss ship Howard to a murky Film Noir world,diced via unbreakable shadows allowing Howard's fear of Banat appearing to fester. Running out of the gunfire,the directors give Howard's escape from Turkey a warm,dusty shine spun by stylish tracking shots which are looped onto the claustrophobic corridors of the ship,as Howard goes on a journey into fear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The could-have-been classic espionage Welles movie or routine RKO fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American ballistics expert Howard Graham is in Istanbul, Turkey. After being recalled home to the USA, he dim-wittingly stumbles hesitantly through an assassination plot from one dilemma to another in ever-decreasing circles while trapped on board a ship travelling to Batumi, a Soviet port. The snare he finds himself in, involving the differing military interests in Turkey, grows tighter by the minute, leaving him bewildered. Orson Welles contribution as Turkish secret police Colonel Haki is quite understated in this film, not allowing his presence to dominate the screen, so instead showcasing the lead actor's talent with the screen being hogged by Joseph Cotten. We follow his character Graham weaving along a dark path of distrust and treachery, that ultimately leads to a fatal confrontation between the competing conspirators in a nighttime, rain-soaked Turkish hotel. Ruth Warrick plays Graham's wife and sultry Dolores Del Rio (at the time of filming, Wells's current partner), a courtesan and traveling companion, are the feminine interests. Eustace Wyatt provides the meat of the Nazi lead villain - Muller, with Jack Moss as the creepy bespectacled assassin Banat. Directed by Norman Foster from an Orson Welles - Joseph Cotten screenplay; Journey Into Fear is anything but that and feels solely as a director-actor combination contrivance for the studio's (possibly contractual) need to provide the release of product. Even one as butchered as this, RKO failed to damage Welles's long term acceptability and credibility, though Welles did enough damage to his career himself. As wartime espionage, the plot though apparently convoluted, is simple and formulaic, with the proceedings plodding, the action minimal, the ending coming sooner than expected and unwelcomed. Contributed in part by harsh editing, to the rushed pace of the final reel. As a film noir, it also fails to grip the viewer due to lack of suspense &amp; tension and little emotional connection with the protagonist. This makes it for me, one of Welles's least successful films - one to forget. Other reviewers have taken time to detail the film's failings in plot, execution and continuity, which most likely was due to the severing of connections between RKO and Welles's Mercury Productions prior to the film's release. I am not bothered and truthfully I have spent far longer in reviewing this than is necessary, but wanted to state why it disappointed me so much. I feel that later viewings may elicit a better psychological &amp; emotional connection with the film, now the plot generally holds no significance. I watched the British released version, without as I have been advised elsewhere, the USA version's opening narration or final letter scene between Haki and Graham. The UK version presented by Talking Pictures TV recently, premiered on Freeview 81; prior to the end credits finished with Graham outside in the torrential rain on the (third-floor?) hotel ledge gripping the wall - when his wife Stephanie, unaware of much of the proceedings, calls to him emphatically to come down immediately as if he is a stupid boy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Orson Welles' attention torn between "The Magnificent Ambersons" and "Journey Into Fear", and a three year affair with Dolores del Rio about to come to an end, the movie winds up pretty much a chaotic mess. Based on a novel by writer Eric Ambler, the task of writing the screenplay was handed off to Joseph Cotten who had never done one before, which goes a long way to explain why he had such a confused look on his face for a good part of the story.Which is not to say the picture is all bad. Viewing it, one might have the same reaction as watching the proverbial train wreck. The set up with Cotten's character is interesting enough, and the murder attempt on his life that's foiled by a magician's act hinted at an intriguing story, but most of what follows just doesn't flow very well. Naval engineer Howard Graham (Cotten) didn't seem to be particularly troubled by the idea that his life was in danger, and if Peter Banat (Jack Moss) was supposed to be an effective assassin, his prior victims must have been pretty dumb.In a way, this movie reminded me of well regarded Hitchcock films that many fans find praiseworthy but simply leave me baffled. "Shadow of a Doubt" immediately comes to mind, perhaps because Joseph Cotten happened to be the killer in that one, and conveniently fell off a train at the moment he was going to make his own niece his fourth victim. The ledge scene had me wondering if the gimmick was going to be used here, and sure enough, Banat loses his balance and takes a header into the pavement. What puzzles me even more though is why Graham thought it a good idea to pursue Banat out on that ledge in a torrential downpour, what sense did that make on any level? So it's not surprising then that novelist Ambler, after seeing the movie, remarked to Joseph Cotten that the picture so little resembled his book that he would be able to sell it as a movie all over again. In that event, I'd probably be willing to give the story another try, provided they keep the odd filming angles and claustrophobic atmosphere intact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, atmosphere-laden chase thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fun noir thriller, teaming Joseph Cotten (SHADOW OF A DOUBT) and Orson Welles (CITIZEN KANE). An arms dealer in Turkey finds himself the subject of an assassination plot by Nazi agents who are determined to stop him helping the alliance. The story begins proper during a magic show when a magician is accidentally shot; the intended victim (Cotten) must then flee on a ship back to America, but all on board may not have kindly intents towards him.Oddly, the film this most reminded me of is the fun Sherlock Holmes story PURSUIT TO ALGIERS, which has a very similar storyline. In any case, JOURNEY INTO FEAR is a fun film to watch for the visuals, featuring plenty of moody black-and-white photography and menacing shadows from which an assassin could spring at any moment. The story picks up when the setting moves to the ship, the director making the best of the claustrophobic confines.Cotten has always been a reliable star and that's no different here. Welles himself plays the larger-than-life supporting role of a Turkish ally, while the villains pitted against the pair are a lot of fun. The high rise climax is a hoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convoluted Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know. It was directed by Norman Foster but it's got Orson Welles' fingerprints on it. It was the last cinematic gathering of the Murcury Theater crowd -- Everett Sloan, Agnes Moorehead, Joseph Cotton as a naval engineer trying to reach his destination across the Black Sea without being murdered first.There are occasional odd camera angles, a few shots from floor level, and sometimes strange lighting. It was co-written by Welles and Joseph Cotton. But it's not really Orson Welles. It's about one half of an Orson Welles which, by 1942, was already plenty.Stripped to its armature, it resembles one of Alfred Hitchcock's "ordinary-man-in-jeopardy" films of the period -- "The 39 Steps" or "Saboteur." Cotton is traveling through war-time Turkey with his wife, assigned to help Turkey improve its naval guns or something. The Nazis try to prevent this by the simple expedient of murdering him.Most of the film was shot aboard a mock up of a small freighter and there is little sense of being at sea. The passengers all seem to be lying about their identities and intentions. Welles himself comes on like a ton of bricks as Colonel Haki of the Turkish Secret Police. He seems to be enjoying himself immensely. Among the languages spoken are Turkish, French, English, Greek, and Russian.The sometimes dull proceedings are lightened by the performances. The ship's captain laughs insanely when he's not slurping soup through his phenomenal mustache. Some are plain grotesques. Agnes Moorehead hacks away at a French accent. As the Nazi hit man, Albert Moss, in ridiculous fedora and eyeglasses like Coke bottle bottoms, resembles some kind of slimy pallid thing you might find by turning over a large boulder.The final shoot out is pretty well handled. And Joseph Cotton does a respectable turn as the bewildered American swept up in a tangle of intrigue.A curiosity, more than anything else, it's still worth one watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish RKO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Journey Into Fear (1943) *** (out of 4) Joseph Cotten plays a US engineer aboard a boat being stalked by Nazi assassins. I've read about this film for several years now and there's seems to be some debate about Orson Welles re-editing the picture as well as filming new scenes for it. The movie plays out a lot like something Welles would do and it seems he had more of a hand in the production than he's credited with. With that said, this film plays out like a lot of the RKO products of the time in that it has a small budget but tries to make it as stylish as possible. The film on a technical level looks very good with some nice camera-work, which helps push the story along. The screenplay by Cotten could have used some work but it's good and the film pushes its 68-minute running time nicely. Cotten is very good in the lead and the supporting cast is also impressive with Dolores del Rio, Welles and Ruth Warrick turning in fine work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a curious movie. Drawn to the presence of Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles I tuned it in on TCM and soon after the start, realized I had seen it before and wondered why I didn't remember it. Watching it again all the way through made me realize why. The movie is all facade and no content. All the conventions, devices, tricks, and images of the espionage thriller are reeled off one after another in pursuit of a plot line that is largely non-existent. We have the sleazy hired assassin, the cheap hotel, the Turkish colonel, the hidden identities, furtive escapes, tramp steamers, balcony chases, etc. etc. etc. to no apparent purpose. I have a suspicion, knowing Orson Welles' sly sense of humor and his presence as both co-director and co-producer, that this may have been exactly his intention, i.e. to erect a glittery (or in this case, gloomy and rain-streaked) film noir edifice with nothing inside, just as a lark. As Gertrude Stein said of the city of Oakland, "There is no there there." At any rate the movie is interesting to watch, at whichever level you choose to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what it is, but I can't get enough of this movie. I bought a used VHS, since it's not on DVD or new VHS, and I've seen it about ten times. It's not that it's an all time classic like CITIZEN KANE or TOUCH OF EVIL, in fact, it's not even as good a movie as THE STRANGER, but it's such a fun, simple story, nothing too deep but I love it. Orson Welles has a small, but important part and when he's in the movie he steals it (like in the THIRD MAN); Everette Sloane is fun to watch too; and of course Joseph Cotton, the main character, is always good. Watch this movie and don't except anything too incredible, but have a good time, sit back, drink a beer, and enjoy. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if KANE is steak, JOURNEY INTO FEAR is dessert. And hey, does anyone know how much of the film Orson Welles directed before he was thrown off? If so, email me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JOURNEY INTO FEAR is not as good as it could have been, probably because the studio trimmed some segments. Granted, it was not as much of a butcher job as RKO did on Ambersons, but there are some abrupt transitions and slight continuity problems.The main issue I have with JOURNEY INTO FEAR is that there are too many characters. But even so, we are not given enough of a chance to sympathize with their problems or understand their motives. Mostly it's a big stew of chaos and convoluted plot twists without any clear direction or relatable elements.The film is brimming with atmospheric touches, that is one point in its favor (with an uncredited Welles overseeing the direction). But too much style and too little decipherable substance makes for what is basically a flat movie. In a way, it's a high-brow freak show that only Welles &amp; Company can deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Norman Foster made some of the Charlie Chan and Mr Moto films as well as the campy Batman TV series which explains this low key rather mediocre film which stars Joseph Cotton and has a cameo from Orson Welles as the Turkish Colonel Haki.Cotton plays a naval engineer and arms dealer travelling in Istanbul with his wife and ends up nearly getting killed by hired Nazi agents. He flees without his wife aboard a steamship but the agents pursue him.The film is a not too long B film, short on thrills and has big plot holes. It plods along as Cotton blunders through the film trying to figure out what is happening to him.You end up thinking that the film wants to hang on to the coat tails of the other better known Welles and Cotton collaborations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good illustration/adaptation of the classic suspense novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Journey Into Fear' certainly has an Orson Welles look. Although he received neither directing nor writing credit (credit went to Norman Foster and Joseph Cotten, respectively), I think that most of what is there is his. The problem is that there is not enough there there. The on-board relationships should have been developed more. All of them seem perfunctory.Combining the shooting by a good marksman who misses his target and stalking him in the nightclub are combined into an altogether more satisfying single event.The escape from the Nazis is more protracted and less violent than in Eric Ambler's book. It is very noirish and photogenic, and the combination of wet chase and the presence of a murky character played by Orson Welles and an all-American one played by Joseph Cotten prefigure `The Third Man.' Joseph Cotten had some of the same American innocence and ready outrage in both films. He's an important munitions engineer here and a hack western writing there. He doesn't get the dark beauty (Alida Valli or Dolores del Rio) in either, though he has and keeps a wife in `Journey.'The film probably makes sense to those unfamiliar with the book (and such viewers aren't distracted by thinking about what's been changed). It is suspenseful even for someone like me who recently read the book</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm curious to know if anyone truly believes that this screenplay was written by Joseph Cotten? To me, the entire film has always looked like an Orson Welles film. Does anyone know how much input he had on the screenplay, aside from the re-editing and additional scenes?The lighting, editing and use of sound all seem to hold Welles' signature to my eyes. The use of sound overlaying shots as well as to bridge scenes and cuts would seem to show his hand, as well.I never seem to see anyone discussing this aspect of the film. It's a tremendous piece of noir, and if Cotten did indeed write it, why did he not go on to write other classic stuff?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Hitchcock Than Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do I like Joseph Cotton so much? He just had such a wonderful every man quality about him, and it was never more appropriate than in "Journey Into Fear." Watching the mixture of bemusement, anger, and confusion on his face as he's batted around from one situation to the next is the highlight of this film.This is another movie classified as a "noir" for some reason, but don't believe it. Yes, it's shot in black and white, and, yes, there are shadows, but those two things together don't always equal noir. "Journey Into Fear," with its ordinary man caught up in an extraordinary adventure involving assassins and war-time plans, has more in common with Hitchcock than it does Hawks or Houston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused early noir thriller with fine cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America has entered the second world war. Howard Graham (Joseph Cotten), an American munitions engineer, has completed an assignment to help upgrade guns on ships of the Turkish navy. He and his wife are in Istanbul, en route for home. German agents are attempting to assassinate him to prevent his return. Colonel Haki (Orson Welles), the head of the Turkish secret police, assists Graham to escape by boat to Batumi, on the Soviet Black Sea coast. But the Nazis are on the boat....Good enough to watch and enjoy, this is an overrated film, riding on Welles's reputation (as the uncredited director) and some perfunctory early film noir elements. The plot is riddled with loose ends. The ridiculous White Russian, Kopeikin (Everett Sloane), fails to warn Graham's wife (Ruth Warrick) of his escape by boat - Haki makes a point of it, but it has no obvious significance to the story. Haki has a reputation as a ladies' man, but the story of his train journey to Batumi with Mrs Graham is not told. Graham says he likes the Turks, he has been working there, he must be a man of some experience, yet he allows Kopeikin to take charge of his stay in Istanbul and drag him off to a Russian night club. These early scenes are dominated by Kopeikin, who seems, at this stage, to have a key role in the plot, but then he is suddenly dropped and the entire pantomime seems to have been created only to stage the bungled shooting, to which Kopeikin seems to have no relation. Again, the main purpose of the recurring theme of Graham's attraction to Josette Martel (Dolores del Rio) is to engineer his perfunctory, unconvincing, search of the cabin of the killer, Banat (Jack Moss). In 'The Third Man', Cotten portrayed a naive American with total conviction, but in this earlier film he is loud and just plain stupid, most notably in his histrionic behaviour on the ship, a caricature of the American abroad. Welles's performance as Haki is surprisingly wooden. A relatively small part, it ought to have offered scope for Welles to play up a sinister Turkish master of spies, but he is just plain dull in the role.Although the film does not hang together, and fails to create real tension, it has some good things. The dark cinematography (Karl Struss) is atmospheric, especially in the chase in the torrential rain. The hints at a looseness in the relationship between Graham and his wife are surprising and interesting. The exotic and cosmopolitan locations are convincingly evoked, with Turkish, Russian and French spoken where called for. Not an uninteresting film, as any film involving Welles must be, but a bit of a mish-mash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I've ever watched. It glues you to your chair, and you keep thinking about it for weeks. While some people say that Colonel Haki is the most memorable character in the movie, I think that Peter Banat is. He's the perfect assassin - he's fat and silent. His personality is frightening. He's not a thin and muscled boxer, but a man who can kill a man in a fight because he's fat and heavy. But his mostly memorable because he's silent - he doesn't say a word during the whole movie. This is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the turmoil in the aftermath of Kane one could suppose that we're lucky to have even a truncated second/third film from old Awesome. It was, of course, always going to be a problem following Kane even if everything was running smoothly, as it was, Welles was here, there, and everywhere initially trying to decide on a project, then leaving a second masterpiece in the hands of the abattoir known as RKO whilst off in Rio on an aborted project and somewhere in the middle of all this deciding on an Eric Ambler novel - all his life Welles was a sucker for espionage thrillers - rounding up his Mercury players, assigning Jo Cotton - who had never written anything more ambitious than a Christmas card - to adapt the novel, playing only his second ever acting role on screen, albeit a brief one, coming up with another collection of 'signature' shots and handing the directing credit to Norman Foster. Okay, it's less than perfect - in one sense it resembles a blueprint for Mr. Arkadin - but even imperfect Welles is light years better than, for example, overrated 'pure' Hitchcock. If ultimately disappointing it is at the same time fascinating.</fullReview>
