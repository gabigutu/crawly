		<shortDescription>Spies are US</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a lesson to be learned by Hollywood is not to try to remake whatever was already made, and better. Which seems to be a lesson American movie people seem to forget. The criteria might be that the original film didn't reach a wide American audience, thus the reason for the remake, but frankly, neither Stan Dragoti, the director, or Robert Klane, its adapter, put a dent in what Francis Vever and Yves Robert achieved with the original.Then again, if one hasn't seen the French film of the same name, this comedy will appear to be the real thing. In fact, there are hardly any laughs in the film. The best sequence involves the Richard and Maddy in the seduction scene where some of her hair is caught in a zipper.In a way, this was Tom Hanks' third film as a lead man. One can't blame him because he is bogged down by a screen play that could have been better. Tom Hanks pales in comparison with the original Pierre Richard, who was a better comedian.The cast shows several familiar faces, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Edward Herrmann, John Belushi, but ultimately the ones that fare better in the film are Lori Singer and Carrie Fisher in smaller roles, but ones that afford these two actress good opportunities in which to shine.Stick with the original version if you can find it in DVD format.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some very funny lines and situations permeate this movie. Tom Hanks does a great job of being a very likable "every guy" in the film, but some of the funniest lines belong to Jim Belushi as his best friend. Dabney Coleman and Charles Durning do well with their parts as competitive agents of the CIA and FBI. If you like spy movies with a twist, check out this under-rated comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sunday-afternoon viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, it's not the most brilliant piece of art in the world, but neither is it the turkey that the video guides make it out to be. It's a cute spy-cliché spoof with good performances from Hanks, Durning, Coleman, Belushi, Herrman and particularly Tom Noonan as the deadpan Agent Reese. Super music by Thomas Newman (one of his first scores), an elegant string of sight gags featuring Belushi and a couple of corpses, and a sweet ending scene more than make up for the underlying silliness of the plot and a handful of flatly delivered lines. Good to watch on a Sunday afternoon when you need to occupy your mind, but not TOO much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the first films totally starred by Tom Hanks in a bemusing spy-comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an American remake from French film written by Ives Roberts and Francis Veber.An innocent concert violinist(Tom Hanks, in the role of the French, Pierre Richard) is wrongly targeted, then he's pursued by a corrupts CIA agents(Art La Flour, Tom Noonan, among others) led by a nasty chief(Dabney Coleman, in the role of Bernard Blier). It's all because an assistant(Edward Herrmann)to head(Charles Durning) of CIA picked the violinist when he was in the airport as a decoy to dupe his contender. Meanwhile he falls in love with a sexy girl(Lori Singer, role of Mireille Darc)who's spying him. But the villain boss orders his complete elimination .This is an easy-going comedy with hearty humor, suspense, and a little of action . The tale involves murders, botchers spies,loving lies and quite amusing. Considerable comic talents act with hilarious perfection, they include Hanks, James Belushi and Dabney Coleman, among them. The film is plenty of gags, especial mention for the laughters with a director orchestra interpreted by David Odgen Steirs, arguing against his bumbling players Hanks acting at whole show, Belushi and Carrie Fisher who are playing 'Scherezade' by Rimski Korsakov. Catching musical score by Thomas Newman, though is composed by synthesizer and appropriate cinematography by Richard H Kline. The motion picture is regularly directed by Stan Dragoti. He's usual comedies director, such as, Love at first bite, Zorro gay and Mr Mom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this for Carrie Fischer, not Tom Hanks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So sue me if I come across as a hormone driven male, but the most redeeming quality of this movie is seeing Carrie Fischer (before she started aging, and she really hasn't aged all that well...) in a leopard skin bikini. Otherwise, you've got Tom Hanks, Dabney Coleman, and Squiggy from Laverne &amp; Shirley in a mildly humorous spy movie about a man (Hanks), a stereotypical 'disheveled genius', who is mistaken for a spy by the US government. Predictable slapstick comedy ensues. It's certainly not a bad movie, and it has some moments, but it's not something that will stick in your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of the 1972 French comedy "The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe" hasn't the flair needed for sophisticated spy comedy, and so instead fizzles a bit despite a colorful cast. Tom Hanks is green and occasionally shrill as a concert violinist who is mistaken for a spy by the CIA and is completely unaware that he is being followed, photographed and shot at; Lori Singer struggles with a real puzzler of a role as a beautiful agent(always back-lit)who has to seduce Hanks--but she seems so fed up with his bumbling that their romance comes as something of a shock. Jim Belushi has some fun as Hanks' musician buddy whose wife is cheating on him, but Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning and Carrie Fisher are all wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keep your expectations in check and you won't be disappointed. This film was hilarious! While not the best vehicle for Tom Hanks to show his talents, the movie's pacing, score, visual style, sound effects, and black humor were extremely effective. James Belushi was at his comic best as Hanks' best friend whose facial expressions constantly suggest he doesn't have a clue as to what's going on, but he's still probably the sanest person in the film. Well worth a look, despite what the other over-critical reviewers had to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a good spy spoof, and Oh, that dress!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Tom Hanks and I have collected almost all of his films (I can't get myself to buy Bonfire of the Vanities, however.) Seeing The Man with One Red Shoe again after 15 years, I still find it to be a pretty good spoof of the spy genre, perhaps even at times a little too uncomfortably close a portrayal of some of the shenanigans our intelligence services have gotten involved in from time to time. Tom Hanks is charming and funny, as he was in most of his films in the 1980s, but the script did not let him develop his character as much as in his next film, Nothing in Common. Dabney Coleman is also very funny as the "rogue spy." All that being said, however, the most memorable moment in the film has got to be when Lori Singer turns around and reveals the last word in "backless" evening gowns! That scene alone makes this movie a "must rental."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regular Joe is caught in stupid spy web</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other day I read again Maltin's review on this movie and found it unfairly unjust. What's the guy talking about of not letting Hanks be funny in this movie? Has he seen the same movie as I? The main strong point of this film is a normal guy ensnared in the web of stupid bunch of paranoid spies. He doesn't need to funny with more than his face that reads "Oh, my god! In what mess have I fallen into?" The rest of the team provides an incredible comedic value to the movie, acting like the dumb jerks they really are and seeing a conspiracy where there is none apart from the guys who set up the trap. Okay, the pace is uneven and some characters are overdrawn, like the two spies that follow Hank around, protecting him. But it's a nice movie to see in a pinch if you're down to an awful selection at the video store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>induces some laughs, but the original is still better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this remake of the French comedy "The Tall Blonde Man with One Black Shoe", Tom Hanks plays a violinist who randomly gets selected as a spy, leading the government to turn his life upside down. There are certainly some really funny scenes here - namely anything involving plumbing - but it's really undesirable when Hollywood remakes a foreign movie. "The Man with One Red Shoe" is pretty characteristic of Tom Hanks's career before he got into serious roles: innocuously silly.So, I recommend the original, but this one isn't bad. Just don't expect any kind of religious experience. Also starring Lori Singer, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Edward Herrmann, Carrie Fisher, James Belushi and David Ogden Stiers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland, Weak Misadventures in the Pseudo-Spy Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolutely pointless, witless, aimless sendup of the spy genre that manages to flame out on the runway despite its name-studded cast. Tom Hanks is the center of attention, to the surprise of none, as his usual aloof '80s bachelor in search of more than just another one-night stand. His character's unfortunate choice of footwear on a long flight leaves him tangled in a web of espionage and deceit; a hapless patsy in a high-stakes game of cloak and dagger. Jim Belushi and Carrie Fisher support, in roles that don't really go anywhere or mean anything, and work no miracles with the base-level material. It's an unfocused film with no ambition, no personality and a bald, spell-it-out sense of humor that's better for eye rolls than snickers. Harmless, but also useless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mediocre Example Of Tom Hanks Early Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a comedy that's going to have you rolling on the floor with laughter? Well, "The Man With One Red Shoe" isn't it. It's a mediocre film. It builds up a little bit of steam as it moves along, and it has a few humorous scenes, but there was little in it that struck me as truly "funny." It's notable as a very early example of Tom Hanks movie career. To this point he had starred in "Splash" (which I enjoyed) and in "Bachelor Party" (which I haven't seen.) Hanks is fine in this. He plays his part fairly straight - which is the only way this would have worked.The basic story is about mistaken identity. There are two factions vying for control of the CIA. One, led by Ross (Charles Durning) deliberately turns Drew (Hanks) into an object of suspicion to be pursued by the other faction led by Cooper (Dabney Coleman). Drew has no connection with either side or with the CIA. He's a violinist and not a spy, but so desperate is the Cooper faction to believe that he's a spy, that everything they find in his every day life is filtered through that lens, making him more and more suspicious to him. I suppose there's a bit of a warning there. If someone wants to be suspicious of you, no matter how innocent you are, they'll find reasons.Drew ends up in a variety of mildly amusing situations as this unfolds, and pretty good use is made of the actors with whom he interacts most regularly - Maddy (Lori Singer), who works for Cooper and is trying to trap him, but ends up falling for him; Morris (James Belushi), his best friend who sees so many strange things happening around Drew that he starts to think he's going crazy; and Paula (Carrie Fisher), Morris' wife who desperately wants to have an affair with Drew. It's the scenes with Fisher and Belushi that are responsible for most of the humour, and some of the scenes with Singer are amusing, and Singer is quite beautiful, especially in the "backless" (and somewhat more) dress scene.Overall, though, this is a mediocre film of no great note, except that it is early Hanks in the days before he was a huge star.

He trips, falls, bangs into stuff. Meats the woman of his dreams.Why is he only wearing one red shoe when is he picked out of a crowd of people? You have to watch the movie!Like I said though you really must have an odd sense of humor to truly enjoy it.

		<shortDescription>A typical early to mid 80's Tom Hanks Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Tom Hanks fan. Being the fan that I am I do admit some of his earlier stuff was just so-so. This was one of those projects. I mean it had its moments but it just seemed like it was thrown together. Hanks and Belushi do an excellent job and they should have worked together more often when they both made it bigger maybe they will who knows. I think Tom Hanks has wondered to far away from comedy which he does really well. Splash, Bachelor Party, Big all great films in the 80's of his so if you want to see some of his older but good stuff those would be better. If you are just looking to pass the time this movie would be fine but if your looking for Tom Hanks at his very best this movie is not for you. 5 out of ten stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good enough and underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By any standard, Red Shoe should be an 80s classic comedy. Based on the scores of mindless comedy from that era, this film is above-average. The problem with the negative reviews is the people who write them. Babyboomers will always love Hanks more for his yuppie dramas because drama and their generation is all they care about. Generation "Y" will never like Hanks' 80s comedies because there wasn't anyone putting their tool in a pie or falling down every other scene. The evidence is in the reviews that find the zipper scene the only funny scene. I found it funny too, but THAT is as typical or predictable as any comedy gag out there. That is barely humor, and only as a site gag, not due to its wit.This wasn't the greatest film and the comedy was dry. But Hanks never had a challenging role anyway until maybe Big or A League of Their Own. The concept in Red Shoe was fresh, the plot was clever, and if one pays attention...the dialogue and many scenes can be very funny. Sorry if you have to think a little, but sometimes the wit is what makes content and humor intrinsic. So it's a remake...big deal. It transfered well to an American platform, especially considering the actual conflict discovered between our own CIA and FBI. And if you didn't "get it" then the twist worked or you weren't paying attention to the first 5 minutes. Watch it again!When people don't find movies like this funny, it reminds me of people who don't get Far Side comics or Monty Python. Because YOU don't get it or it's not straight forward, doesn't mean it's not funny. Keep your beer in the fridge and pay attention to ALL the scenes (not just when people slip on banana peels), then maybe it'll be worth the precious 90 minutes you "wasted" on it.I beg anyone to validate how Turner &amp; Hooch, Dragnet, Money Pit, Joe vs the Volcano, or Volunteers are as good. Please don't quote box office numbers because that just as easily points out how well masses are fooled by marketing groups.</fullReview>

Is there anybody that can honestly say they don't like Tom Hanks? It doesn't matter what he's doing on screen, he's just a watchable, loveable guy. Almost anyone can relate to him through all his roles. For instance, his character in "The Man With One Red Shoe" is a character that deserves our praise! He's sexually frustrated, musically ingenuitive, a loner, and funny. This is the kind of Hanks movie that it doesn't matter if the viewer is capable of relating to Hanks' character, he will anyway. The piece he writes for the girl at the end is simplistic yet amazing. He writes it on his steamed up mirror, how awesome is that!

		<shortDescription>Underrated masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two rival CIA factions try to out-do and discredit each other; innocent bystander Hanks gets caught in the middle. Hilarity ensues.While this movie has it's share of problems (mostly having to do with continuity and sound editing), it is still one of my favorites. The humor is pretty understated most of the time, which is probably why a lot of other commentators on this site didn't get it. I agree with another poster who opined that these are the same folks who think that a guy screwing a pie or a girl rubbing semen in her hair are the epitome of comedy (I'm surprised, though, that they didn't find the flushing ambulance funny). Either that, or a false sense of culture makes them think the French original is better ("Look at me; I'm cultured; I like a French movie," they sniff).Some favorite moments (not in order):*Richard Drew (Hanks) gets darted in the arse as he tries to come on to Maddy (Singer), whom he discovered in his apartment. He gets lost while talking about fate as the drug take effect and then rambles on about it before passing out with the line, "No ma, I'm not watchin' tv; I'm practicin'!" then mimes playing the violin. The camera work here is a big part of the humor as it begins to wobble around in a drugged fashion; it then wobbles over to the spot on the floor where he is going to land when he passes out, which he then does. The sound gets a bit woozy during this part as well, which adds to the effect.*Drew goes to the dentist because his best friend (Belushi) gave him a pack of fake peanuts. Burt Cooper's (Coleman) team figures he's got some microfilm hidden in his teeth and send one of their dentists to retrieve it. (Cooper: "Take one of our dentists, and get that tooth for me." Carson: "How do I know which tooth?" Cooper: "Yeah. Well; better, uh, better just yank 'em all."). The "dentist" gets there early and knocks everyone in the office out with an aerosol spray, then lays in wait for Drew. Ross's (Durning) underling Brown (Herrmann) sends one of his own operatives to intercept and protect Drew. Drew shows up at the dentist's office to find no one around, the phone ringing incessantly, and moaning coming from one of the back rooms which stops as Cooper's dentist re-gasses a patient who started to wake up. He says, "huh-uh," and leaves. As he is getting into the elevator, Ross's man (Noonan) gets off the other elevator. Cooper's dentist mistakes him for Drew, knocks him out, and takes all his teeth. When Cooper finds out that Drew left, he is still under the impression that Drew is some kind of super-operative whose finely-honed instincts smelled the trap (never once considering that it was his own agent's incompetence that tipped him off).*A string of mishaps cause Morris (Belushi) to think he is hallucinating dead bodies. He goes to the bathroom and, as he is standing there urinating, the door creaks open to reveal yet another dead operative hanging on the back of the door. He turns slowly around (unmindful of the fact that he is still peeing), sees the guy hanging there, turns to the camera and cries, "Aw, come on!"*When Drew decides that perhaps the dentist is not the best idea and leaves, he catches Maddy's sweep team off guard; they still have his apartment mostly disassembled. In their rush to get things back together, they put things back together wrong (shampoo in the toothpaste tube, plumbing re-arranged) and the effects are seen throughout the rest of the movie.*The car/bicycle chase where you think the car is going to go up a ramp and jump a truck.I could go on and on. This movie is simply hilarious. Yes, there are problems; as when Maddy (Singer) delivers the line; "GBLX?!? But that's in charge of our entire missile defense system!" I had to groan at that one. Cooper's on-again/off-again glasses in the final foot chase scene. Some lines of dialog that were obviously dubbed in later (I guess some of the physical humor was *too* subtle for test audiences). But these are minor issues.You may need to watch more than once to get it. And I almost forgot to mention the soundtrack, which is outstanding! I became an instant Thomas Newman fan (Road to Perdition, The Green Mile, American Beauty, Finding Nemo among many others) with this movie and was very disappointed that there was no soundtrack album available. In fact, I originally bought the VHS primarily so I could hear the soundtrack in stereo but fell in love with the movie itself upon repeated viewings. He is my favorite among the musical Newmans which include brother David (Ice Age, Daddy Day Care), cousin Joey (TV series Providence, Once and Again), 9-time Oscar-winner father Alfred (Seven-Year Itch, 20th Century Fox Logo theme), and uncles Lionel and Emil; all are well-known composers, not to mention cousin Randy.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tries to be quirky and is charming but there is only one laugh in it. That is the hair in the zipper bit. Even the old collapsing chair gag (a trusty stalwart) flops here. But I don't care, because the actress who has her hair caught in the zipper is Loroooriii Sing....no, I can't type it without shaking. Oh God, it's an impossible dream, having Lori SiiiNng..thing caught in your zipper or anywhere NEAR your zipper, for that matter. Even FRANCE would be near enough to get me hot under the collar. She put the 'God' in goddess. It is unbearable watching this film. She has big hair. There's that scene where she runs in slo-mo in the baseball stand in black shorts. So if you hit the slow on your remote, it goes REALLY slow. It's too much. Then there's the scene in the hotel suite. She is in this slinky black number with a plunging (we are talking Niagra Falls here) back. Gibber. And that voice. "Come and sit beside me and get comfortable." "Relax, and let me take control". She runs her hands down...excuse me, I can't go on. Never mind 'Saving Private Ryan', you want to lose Tom Hanks. Nothing serious, just a couple of broken legs. I know this is a terrible thing to be thinking as he is something close to a national treasure in the states, but that is the SssIInnger affect. He should be removed from that expensive looking sofa and replaced by me. Oh, mother. Oh, God. This film is torture. Has Lori been in anything else? Well, there's that tv show and that bit part in 'The Falcon And The Snowman'. So she's a STAR! I feel a bit of stalking coming on. Only she's too old now and there's an ocean in the way. But with film, stars stay young forever and you control the vertical, you control the horizontal. What you can't control is your undying devotion. Okay LUST. I admit it. With video you can get to where you need to go. And with Loor...you've already arrived before you've even started to leave. If you see what I mean. Dabney Coleman is also in this comedy. He is not pretty normally, but as he is in a film with Lorrr Snngrrr he has sexiness bestowed upon him. He must look great in the shower. The character Tom Hanks plays in this film is diagnosed as being sexually repressed. It's a metaphor for the audience, I think. Not that I know what a metaphor is of course. The only metaphor I'm interested in is one that involves ..you know who. She called me up and I metaphor a drink. You will not laugh at this film, but you will cry. Boy, *sob* will you cry. Oh, God. Lori. I don't have one red shoe but I do have one helluva red CENSORED.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mistaken</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many different excuses to laugh, and any film that gives us one of them falls into that big bucket we call comedy.I don't suppose anyone knows much about what makes us laugh, but like yesterday's stock market results, everyone seems to have an opinion about failed comedy. This is a classic failed comedy, regardless of whether you thought the original French film successful.The story is that a crew of trained professionals mistakenly assume one thing and then grind that conclusion quite literally to death. The same thing happened to the crew that made this stinker.The women are marginally interesting. Lori singer was a real string player; here she plays the prostituting spy to a string player. Carrie Fisher was deep into her skinny drugged out highly sexed period and plays someone much the same (with a reference to Princess Leia and the wookie).Hanks only once in a rare while really tries to act. This isn't one of those times. My own theory is that he needs a challenging director.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Tom Hanks isn't what we are used to today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short, The Man with One Red Shoe is not a good movie. The best part of this movie is Tom Hanks. It is funny to see how well he does with this role even though everything around him is hacky and cartoonish. There was one point in which I almost turned this movie off because I couldn't handle much more. I ended up powering through it and I am glad to say that it is finally over. The Man with One Red Shoe isn't the worst movie I have ever seen and the performance that Hanks gives bumped the movie up one star for me. If Richard Harlan Drew (Tom Hanks) were played by anyone else, it would have been a completely different result. Hanks wasn't great but he definitely made the movie more tolerable. I could see this movie being The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) if Richard were played by Bill Murray which still wouldn't be as bad as having someone like Tim Allen or Jim Carrey go completely overboard with this role which would make this movie pretty much unwatchable. Hanks was a little strange in the role and the almost afro was a bit distracting. At some point, Hanks felt like he wasn't fully committed to the role or just not enjoying the direction given. Speaking of direction, Stan Dragoti makes this film feel as old as it is as some of the shots and sound do not hold up at all. I have seen movies that were made around the same time that do not use some of the same types of shots that totally hold up so that is the bar and Dragoti went well below that. Have I mentioned that this is not a good movie? It's not good. I don't think I need to beat this dead horse anymore. Try to avoid this one unless, like me, you are trying to complete your Tom Hanks filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted potential ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Tall Blonde With One Black Shoe" was a delightful spy-farce written by the French Billy Wilder: Francis Veber. It was a tale of mistaken identity, featuring a poor schmuck who had the misfortune to look weird enough at the airport to be selected by secret agents as a foil for a rival organization, in order to create a distraction while a real agent was operating. Most of the gags resulted from the hero's ignorance of what was happening, being the straight man of a rodeo of gags he unknowingly caused.It's certainly a credit to Veber's talent (more than probable connections with Hollywood) that most, if not all, of his films were remade by American directors; they exuded a particular flavor that could be easily cooked up with American ingredients. Still, the problem with the remakes is that they were all remakes, which means that they didn't try to change the original plot, let alone to improve it. In the best case, they had the merit to awaken the curiosity of some foreign movie buffs who probably thought it would be a better idea to check the original film instead. "The Man With One Red Shoe" is one of these 'for-the-sake-of-it" remakes.The director, Stan Dragoti, is in such a hurry to get to the infamous airport scene that the whole set-up in Morocco is irrelevant; it could have gotten to the point as well without trying too hard to give an explanation, and the assumption a 'serious' set-up for a promising screwball gag is immediately deceived when Tom Hanks makes his entrance, as Richard Drew. The film then challenges your patience while the first gags (because we don't expect subtle verbal humor, there had to be gags) take their time.I like Tom Hanks in his clumsy curly-haired earlier roles, but it's a shame how his talent is underexploited for the role, it's another shame that with such a great comedic casting (Dabney Coleman, Carrie Fisher, Charles Durning and Jim Belushi), the comedy fails lamentably. Even Lori Singer was good for the role but there was no way left to us to believe there was chemistry between her and the unfortunate hero. She was just the beautiful blonde agent, Richard a gentle bachelor and ta-ta, it had to work. Dragoti takes the original script for granted and never tries to outsmart it a little bit.Not that the gags were totally absent though, Jim Belushi saves the day as the cuckolded best friend, but even in the supposed-to-be-funny scenes where he tries to show Hanks that something weird is going on, there's a problem of timing, of direction, that makes all the gags fall flat, like a false note. The film even fails to reprise the most iconic moment with Singer's bottomless robe when her hair is stuck in the zipper, in the French film, it took time to get to it, here it's so fast we don't have time to savor the growing romance. If reprising a good film was enough to make another good film, many directors would use the same trick.Reading Roger Ebert's review, I noticed he said "the first film wasn't even funny in the first place", not true, it was funny in a patient and subtle way, it was funny because it was French agents acting seriously like in James Bond movies, which was already a gag by itself. "The Man With One Red Shoe" could have done better if it didn't try to imitate French imitating Americans, simply make the agents more ruthless, a darker humor, more blood, more chaos around Hanks. But it's like they didn't even trust their own capabilities, at the end, the film, ironically, gets even less violent than the remake, which is saying a lot. Didn't I say the director didn't challenge his own material?And how about the ultimate confrontation between the leaders, the whole punch line is missing. For all we know, Durning turns into the mastermind to another employee and that's that, nothing else, Coleman and Durning together, that would have been something. Anyway, the film doesn't bring much newness to the screen to a point that it didn't even attract the Razzie's attention, it's just one film without pretension, a plot recycled to please the American audience, but without trying too hard. Why not inserting KGB agents? Why not having Singer playing a Russian spy? How about some outdoor gags, given the budget they had for the opening scene, they could have afforded it.But no, they played it to the cards, and 30 years later, as it shows, the film is totally forgotten, not worthy enough to be called a cult-classic. I liked it when I first saw it but then I was only 11 and didn't even see the remake. Ironically, I saw more Veber's remakes before the originals but each time, they didn't hold a candle. "The Man With One Red Shoe" doesn't trust its own potential and can't exceed the limits of the original script, which doesn't work for an American setting.At least, "Dinner for Schmucks" tried very hard to Americanize the French version and to give it a taste of zaniness; at least, Steve Carrel reinvented a whole new character, different than the original. The remake wasn't better for all that, but at least it tried.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap and humorless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that when you watch it as a kid you laugh hysterically but as you grow a little older you realize how dumb and unfunny this is. It's terribly sad to see Tom Hanks, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Carrie Fisher, James Belushi and Edward Herrmann in something so out of ideas, so lifeless rarely achieving a minor sense of comedy. Mr. Dragoti, the director, has so much better than this, the cute and ten times funnier "Mr. Mom" with Michael Keaton. Comedy doesn't hit near in this story about a violin player (Hanks) targeted by two opposed cells of CIA, with one chief (Coleman) wanting the position of the other one (Durning), and obscurely one of them includes a mysterious and inexistent man that is very important to maintain his chair of director of the institution while the other is led to believe such man is the innocent and messy musician wearing one red shoe. The movie's scheme is to follow the duel between both chiefs using of plots, surveillance and handling of the poor subject who doesn't understand anything that's happening around him at the same time he's followed incessantly by his best friend's wife (Fisher), married with another musician (Belushi); and there's an attractive agent (Lori Singer) used as bait to attract Hanks character, the only plan that works.Humor can be found in the bathroom scene where all the objects functions were changed when Hanks was out of the house, so he has a lot of trouble to understand how the shower, sink and toilet work; Belushi overhearing a recording of his wife cheating on him, played on a fake ambulance; and the two field agents led by Herrmann character. But the rest is just worthless. Gerritt Graham is usually funny but here he was giving less than nothing to work with while Coleman is really annoying as the "smart" chief who think he knows it all. Above all, the movie falls on its own stupidity. You're giving us dumb characters in dumb situations but that doesn't mean all of it has to be presented in a stupid way. With elaborated sequences, a more gripping story that requires more than good humor on ridiculous ideas, and this wouldn't bomb all that much. It's tiring to see just people chasing people that you even forget what's the ultimate goal. The music is one of the few good aspects of it with the fun and present themes by Mr. Thomas Newman. Hope to see one day the French film that originated this, I heard great things about it. Now "The Man With One Red Shoe" is just useless. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the French film "Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire," this American version stars Tom Hanks, Lori Singer, Dabney Coleman, Carrie Fisher, John Belushi, Charles Durning, and Edward Hermann.Hanks plays Richard Harlan Drew, a violinist, who is chosen at random as a "spy" by Ross, the head of a CIA-like agency, Cooper (Durning) when he knows that his second in command (Coleman) is out to destroy him and take his place. As expected, Cooper, having bugged Ross' home, is all over Drew and enlists the aide of another spy (Singer) to get close to him and get information.It's an amusing plot - a kind of Everyman whose every move, every piece of music played, every friend, is misinterpreted as something to do with espionage.The problem is, the film is amusing when I think it was intended to be hilarious. The best performance for my money comes from Dabney Coleman, who has the best line in the movie: "Honey, will you please - what are the odds of the Russians attacking on a Thursday night?" The big chase scene at the end, with Drew on his bicycle, is for my money the best scene in the movie.Doesn't make much of an impact, but everybody in it is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie had one red shoe and very few laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks was not always the sure thing money maker he became in the 1990's and is still almost a sure thing now. No, back in the 1980's he was very much hit and miss as far as his box office earning powers. Granted, I like a lot of his movies from the 1980's that did not exactly do great at the box office, but this one was one of his worst. A comedy about a guy that gets mistaken as a spy or something had potential to be rather funny. This movie however, was almost devoid of laughs when I saw it as a kid. It is a shame too, as it has a nice cast of actors though Hanks was really just starting to become a lead actor so I can forgive him for his weakness in this one. I just expected more from Dabney Colemon as this just seemed a role he should be able to knock out of the park. This also happens to be a remake so that just proves that Hollywood would use someone else's idea back then too. The only scene that really made me chuckle is the poor guy who got mistaken for Hanks' and ended up having some stuff removed. I am sure there was more than that, but that is the most memorable to me now. Most likely a film though that should not have been remade, perhaps just marking the original version to a wider audience would have been the better way to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The old Tom Hanks comedy style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a period when Hanks still isn't a great Hollywood star, but he was only a likely player of fresh comedy. This is the case of `The man with one red shoe', remake to a French flick, where two big C.I.A. heads, against between them , involved a calm violinist in their fight for the power. It's true, the movie can seem goofy and his humour is coarse and vulgar, but it's funny. I had ever admiring Hanks, even in this kind of comedy, I believe that he is likely and funny and also if the story isn't the high intelligence anyway it's a good entertainment supported by a good cast, Charles Durning and Dabney Coleman as the two C.I.A. heads, Tom Hanks as the violinist, James Belushi and Carrie Fisher as a young couple violinist's friend. My rate is 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin? There is a problem with almost every facet of this film. The first major flaw is that the plot is rather confusing. I suppose that would be alright if this were a more sophisticated comedy. However, "The Man With One Red Shoe" is purely a silly little flick and it shouldn't leave its viewers scratching their heads wondering who is doing what to whom and why.Other problems include characters that are ignorant beyond belief, boring "action" sequences, one-dimensional characters and flat performances. I literally laughed only one time during the entire picture. The "hair in the zipper" scene is one of those classic movie moments like the "hair gel" scene in "There's Something About Mary". If only the rest of this film was even half as inspired. Sadly...it's not.Tom Hanks went through a dry spell for several years early in his comedic career. This movie was just one of those blunders before he got things back on track with "Big". The only other positive aspects of this dud are the cool Thomas Newman soundtrack and Lori Singer's slick sunglasses. Unfortunately, those don't pull enough weight to make this anywhere near a quality film. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, But Ultimately Unsuccessful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks becomes unwittingly involved with national espionage and the CIA in this admittedly funny but empty comedy. Chosen at random from a crowd at an airport, Hanks gets into all sorts of odd situations as spies follow him around while he never realizes what is really going on. James Belushi is the real star of the film as the best friend who believes he is going crazy due to a seemingly endless number of strange coincidences. The film is watchable and not bad, but it is not too good either. The reason is because of a routine that becomes tiring early on and a screenplay that over-indulges way too much. Fair. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poor Remake of A Great French Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a textbook example of why movies shouldn't be remade! The original film, "Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe", Starring Yves Robert, was the quintessential French film: light-hearted espionage with a hapless hero, and petty, scheming bureaucrats. None this translates well to American audiences, but rather than add American idiosyncracies or do things which the original filmmakers never had time or money to do, they simply rehashed the entire film. Pathetic.Hanks is wasted as Richard Drew, a shy, unassuming violin player. His entire life is dull when compared to his French Predecessor. Yves Roberts' character, Pierre Richard, was quirky, but bold enough to carry on an extra-marital affair with his friend's wife (a true Frenchman!). Hanks outrightly refuses Paula (Carrie Fisher)'s hussy ways, clinging to American Puritan virtues! Likewise, Fisher is another wasted talent!Perhaps the biggest waste of all is Jim Belushi. Unlike Jean Carmet's Maurice, who tries to stoically carry on despite being the target of French Intelligence services, Belushi's Morris (notice the Americanized characters?) stumbles through the film, totally unaware of what's going on around him; ready to kill Hanks in one scene, and then crawling to him for comfort in the next. There are very few remakes of films which have been successful--but those that were achieved it by what can best be described as A Noble Contradiction: remaining faithful to the original story, while simultaneously moving in a different direction. Take "Heaven Can Wait", for example, a remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan". Were you aware that the first film--HCMJ--was in fact a remake of a stage play, titled "Heaven Can Wait"? You see? Warren Beatty (who both directed and starred) must have done his research. The core of the story is the same, but with intriguing differences.But this was not done in "Man With One Red Shoe". The core of the story was the same, the names were virtually the same, but the characters were flat and lifeless. Take note, Hollywood. You blew it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies are supposed to be funny, right?Right??Then why does "The Man with One Red Shoe" take funny actors, good ideas and classic setups and go absolutely nowhere with them? I don't mean that the jokes just bomb or fall flat: I MEAN THE JOKES AREN'T THERE!Nothing is funny here, not a thing. Not even Hanks, who can be the funniest man on this entire planet at times. He's just the straight man without a clue as to the joke.The others aren't much help. Singer is a total waste of time in acting terms as well as humor, Coleman seems to be playing the same character he did in "War Games", Fisher is just a frump - save for the leopard print undies scene (rowrrr....), and you'll no doubt recognize a lot of familiar faces here and there (Lander, LeFleur, Graham, Noonan, Stiers, etc....), but they only have a scene or two then are gone. Even stalwarts like Herrmann and Durning seem to be just coming in for cold readings. Nothing works, nothing connects and the only one who makes an impression here is Belushi. Now HE tries: he yells, screams, runs, jumps, staggers, hyperventilates and collapses into a blubbering heap...but he tries TOO hard, you know? All you can do is feel sorry for him and mad at everyone else for making him carry the load.In the end, I'm lucky I remembered anything from this Cold War comedy (there's a category for you); other than being a low point in Hanks' otherwise illustrious career, I'm sure it will be remembered for little else.One star, in appreciation for Belushi's efforts, and for helping make the Cold War look about as much fun as it was, which ain't much.</fullReview>
