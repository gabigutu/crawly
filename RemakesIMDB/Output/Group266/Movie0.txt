		<shortDescription>Hysterically funny French spy farce!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was one of the most successful crossover French films of the 70's, and for very good reason. It is a delightful spoof of the spy genre, with a hapless musician unknowingly caught in the middle of a war between two factions of the French secret service. The plotting is extremely funny, the directing tight, the music (played by Zamphir on the pan pipe!) unforgettable, and above all the ensemble acting by a stellar cast will have you watching this again and again. Pierre Richard, playing the title character, brings an unusual elegance and sense of class to what would otherwise be a Woody Allen-esque role (it was played by Tom Hanks in the American re-make). Mireille Darc is the femme fatale, and there were quite few teenage boys in the 70's who never got over the image of her in a jaw-dropping backless dress. The rest of the group, from the cool head of the Secret Service, to the efficient but misguided spies, to the bumbling best friend and his wife, all leave indelible memories. Thirty years after having seen this film for the first time, I can remember everything with crystal clarity, and my own kids have found it just as delightful. Go ahead and rent this one for truly fun evening, you will love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Comedy with Great Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy/mystery is simply delightful. You can call it a masterpiece of its genre(s) or you can just enjoy its great timing, hilarious physical comedy, its story that involves spies, murders, and a sexy blonde (Mireille Darc) in a dress you have to see to believe. Pierre Richar is excellent as the blond man of the title who one day became a "person of great interest" for two rival departments in the French secret service. As we know, it is very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room especially if the cat is not in the room and that's what the experienced employees of the secret service try to do - to find the sense in the routine activities of a man they are convinced is an important spy and who is in reality an absent-minded and oblivious violinist and the object of the practical jokes by his fellow musicians.If it is not enough, there is a soundtrack written by Vladimir Cosma and performed by the King of Pan Flute, a famous Romanian musician Gheorghe Zamfir. Cosma recalls that when he was composing the music for The Tall Blond Man, he was thinking of the movie "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" and he wanted to use the elements of the Eastern European music. His idea to use the themes of Romanian doinas played by Zamfir was a stroke of genius. Once you hear the melodies, you won't be able to forget them.YES to the movie and YES!! to the soundtrack</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INCROYABLE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Pierre Richard is HILARIOUS! The script is tight as a mosquito's leotard and the action unrelenting. The story, based in part on a serious of government agencies play SPY vs. SPY games and bureaucratic CYA, arbitrarily pick a fall guy for their foil and who better than a musician hooked on modern music. The amazing thing is Richard's apartment where the walls are covered with pictures of modern composers, dominated by a huge picture of Stravinsky. And, the riotious aside when he tells the girl trying to pump information from him that he has a "secret." When all of the spying evesdroppers stretch their ears to hear, he announces, "Je compose." Is this some new code? They look from one another as Pierre takes his violin and warns, "Mais, elle est moderne," and launches into a chromatic allegro ala Stravinsky. The movie goes on with great slapstick abetted by the marvelous timing of Richard who is rivalled only by Peter Sellars in that means. As the other reviewer noted, there was a decent American version with Tom Hanks, who played the part a lot more low key than Richard. I've seen this movie more than a dozen times and plan to see it again soon. Each time I find some new twist that gives me an extra tickle. Check it out! On s'amuse assez avec ce film-ci!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting commentary on privacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An earlier comment was sophisticated slapstick, but while there are the occasional pokes in the eye -- the scene where an exploding cigar goes off and all the spies silenced weapons go "pfffht" (no blood, just lots of people falling over with silly expressions) is wonderful -- I think I'd instead classify this as sophisticated silliness. Reminds me of the old David Niven movies, except much less restrained.But I also want to point out that the movie ends with a quote: "Every person is entitled to the respect of his or her private life. Penal Code, Article 9." Indeed, the wry tongue in cheek is pointed squarely at the absurdities of the French intelligence community. I find looking at the movie in that light adds another bit of fun to identifying the "good guys" and the bad guys.Well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If imitation is the highest form of flattery, then Hollywood has paid homage to this Gallic gem. And, as usual, the original is better than the Hollywood copy.The best description of this classic is the oxymoron: sophisticated slapstick. But there is much more. Like the category list suggests (comedy, mystery, and more) there's something for everybody, and you needn't be a Francophile to enjoy it.Simply delightful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many, many years ago -- the mid-70s, in fact, this movie was on TV in our local area. It was one of the few times I'd seen my dad really excited about a movie, and watched it with him.It's stuck with me ever since.This is a brilliant piece of film-making, satisfying as both a comedy and a spy movie. Pierre Richard has a masterful sense of comedic timing, on par with Buster Keaton.If you get a chance to see this, do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To make disparaging comparisons between this and the Hollywood remake would seem obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But there's a reason why "obvious" gets to be so... well obvious.Despite the fact that the print I saw of this had colour so mucky I would've been better off watching on a black and white TV set and that it was the dubbed version and not the original French version it is still better by far than the Hollywood remake in the 1980s.First off the director of this has a sense of timing which goes a long way. Scenes like the opening interrogation using a lie detector move fast and with a Spartan minimum of activity.More importantly is the fantastic art direction and the score by Zamfir (master of the pan flute). The hero's apartment could've easily graced the pages of Progressive Architecture. Especially his bathroom - no really. Only 'The Prisoner' made better use of art direction.Even the dubbed dialog retains a level of precision with lines like "I didn't see you behind me" "Ah, but I'm already ahead of you...". They could've gotten a better voice-over for Maurice, but at least the sound effect for the guns was an inspired choice.Some things like the bagpipe-as-a-snake scene don't work so well (at least outside of France) but they're a minor annoyance. Most of the comedy set pieces are inspired genius worthy of Chaplin, Keaton or (Harold) Lloyd.By all means see this movie - and make sure to see it before you subject yourself to the American remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first, excuse me for my English bur i didn't write in this language since 2 years. This movie was one of the best i've ever seen. Pierre Richard is the same as usual, with all its "tics" like : - his face with a little smile and look like someone which don't have any idea of what he's making here ! - its clothes are always out of fashion or completely "vintage" Moreover, the french version is more interesting because it's the VO so he "word games" are respected. In fact, all the characters are good in this movie, they all see to be exactly what they seem to be. The men who are supposed to be secret agents are too much : their raincoats and their shoes couldn't have been better than this. then, the music sound is one of the best i know. i can sing this song all the day without any problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The French Comedy Classic with a Catchy Theme?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Each citizen has a right to privacy" says the ninth article of French code penal. A nice touch from the director, Yves Robert, to remind us at the end of the film that privacy is a luxury that is not necessarily guaranteed just because we live in a democracy, and one might never be too careful that his secrets could be unveiled. Still, let's suppose now that the government needs to know some secrets. Suppose that the person to spy on can be a threat? Now, suppose that he's thought to be dangerous, but in reality, he's just an average schmuck no better, no worse than the other fellow. That's an interesting basis of comedy, isn't it? Now, why would an average schmuck be spied on? Let's say he's used as a booby-trap to prove one agent's incompetence? Why? Well, imagine an Agent 1 wants to get rid of his second in command? Well, now you have the perfect set-up for one of the most iconic French comedies of errors. Wait, there's still one piece of the puzzle missing, they still have to pick a random guy in an airport, and chose him as the unfortunate pawn of a deadly chess-game. Who? A tall black man with a green collar? An old man? A young? wait, who's coming here? A tall blond man with a black shoe ? in one foot, and a reddish brown in another, it's so peculiar it looks premeditated, it's perfect, and the guy is the master spy, and the perfect booby trap and the most memorable entrance of a character in French cinema.In French Cinema, there is a fistful of movies whose only mention of their titles is enough to bring back a particular imagery, music, some iconic shots, forever rooted in people's memory. "The Tall Blonde with a Black Shoe" is one of these immediately evocative titles, Pierre Richard's iconic entrance in Orly's escalator, Mireille Darc's black dress with the naughty buttock cleavage (the French equivalent of Marylin Monroe's white dress), the rivalry between two veteran actors: Jean Rochefort and Bernard Blier, respectively #1 and #2 of French Secret Services, Vladimir Cosma's immortal Pan's flute theme played by the no-less legendary George Zhamfir, and so on and so forth. Everything screams 'classic!' and for reasons."The Tall Blonde with a Black Shoe" 's particular flavor relies on two comedic ingredients: people taking the most peculiar things with an absolute seriousness, one man totally oblivious to the chaotic situations he creates around him and a goofy screwball thought to be a genius, three premises combined in one film, whose abundance of gags is never tarnished. The center of this oddball universe remains Pierre Richard in the most defining role of his career as François Perrin, the 5'10'' tall man with curly blonde hair and two unsuited shoes, the quintessential funny-looking character.What is remarkable in Pierre Richard's performance is the way he embodies the natural goofiness of the character and yet remains straight all through the movie, he's either the Auguste clown causing trouble to a bunch of white-faced clowns around him, or he's the straight man of a grotesque masquerade. It's not surprising that the film was co-written by Yves Robert and Francis Veber, the latter would know how to use other actors' talent to highlight Richard's comedic appeal. But here, everyone is so damn serious yet everything seems so crazy and the film's laughs plays in an almost surreal level, as we follow the adventure of François Perrin.Speaking of Perrin, It's interesting to note that he's the only one with a normal name while all the others are named from cities, to avoid any confusion, the writers took these precautions and exploited him for pure laughs as there are two thugs named Poucet and Chaperon a reference to two fairy tale characters, the film is like a timid parody and oddly enough, it works. In "The Tall Blonde", all the actors play their parts seriously and the laughs don't come from Perrin's weird situations but from the way they're interpreted. It can get a bit repetitive in the first act during which they bug his home, and follow him in his most intimate moments with Paulette, Maurice's wife, and Maurice his best friend played by an irresistible Jean Carmet.The film takes a brilliant turn during a hilarious symphony sequence featuring the wife, the lover, and the cuckolded husband in the instruments and Yves Robert doing a brilliant cameo as the conductor, the laughs reach their pinnacle with the unforgettable evening at Christine's house. Relying on Richard's comical talent and not without some ad-libs, the film doesn't avoid the use of pure slapstick comedy allowing us to take a break from all this sophistication displayed in the previous scene. And while the film doesn't try to be funny every time, it remains consistent in quality. And of course, even indivisible element of the film, the catchy score of Vladimir Cosma, probably the music that would pave his way to glory.Asked to make a sort of parody of James Bond themes, Cosma chose to follow his instincts instead of these advices, and dig in his Slavic background to come up with this Soviet-like little tune, not too oriental to be exotic, but catchy enough to be forever associated with the film. While Veber disagreed with the music's choice, Robert kept it, and as it was pointed out in the making-of, the music fitted perfectly the film as it sounded like a sort of Gypsy Dance to Death. I didn't know what it meant, until I remembered the parts where the first shots were fired. I thought it was over the top, but after a second thought, I guess they perfectly captured the spirit of a film that should not be taken too seriously.And we all know, from the film, the danger of taking stuff 'too seriously'.</fullReview>

(I think casting Hanks and Belushi was as close as we could get to the original with big name actors. It was like seeing your friends perform "Taming of the Shrew".) The physical comedy of the best friend makes this good story even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although an early work - actually only his fifth credited screenplay - this Francis Veber script is only marginally behind his later output and he would, of course, go on to work with Pierre Richard again and again and memorably. Richard here is not quite the complete klutz of Le Chevre but neither is he a candidate for Mensa; he's not unlike those likable goofs Danny Kaye used to play and in fact the premise of an innocent dupe getting mixed up in murder and mayhem is not a million miles from The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty. Richard IS a dope - the title is explained by the fact that his colleagues in the orchestra with which he tours the world nailed his shoes to the floor thus obliging him to wear two different colours to return to Paris - but not SUCH a dope that he can't ball a colleague's wife or have the government agent Christine (Mirielle Darc) speak glowingly of his prowess in the sack after bedding him in the name of duty. I don't know what the French made of their Secret Service being portrayed as childish and largely inept overgrown schoolboys but for non-partisan viewers this is another great French comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film, Great Score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hapless orchestra player becomes an unwitting pawn of rival factions within the French secret service after he is chosen as a decoy by being identified as a super secret agent.The film was remade in English as "The Man with One Red Shoe", which makes me want to see that version -- I never really had an interest before. This version is quite good, and I especially love the score. It is whimsical and light, keeping the material fun.The topic of secret agencies against themselves sort of suggests a Kafka-type plot, but it never reaches that level. Because of the humor involved, it might be closer to compare this to a Peter Sellers film. Certainly more deserving of attention than it generally receives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The British films have their flavor with mysteries but the French have the Gallic way of infusing humor in the most unlikely manner that the mysteries become terrific platforms of French humor at its finest. Film Movement is re-releasing this 1972 gem of a film and it hasn't lost a bit of its allure. Written by Francis Veber and writer/director Yves Robert this little pastiche is a treasure. Two factions of the French Secret Service (Jean Rochefort and Bernard Blier) involve a seemingly normal but hapless orchestra player, François Pignon (Pierre Richard), into their battle as one side uses him as a decoy by being identified as a super secret agent.. Soon, agents are all over the place, and one of them, Christine (Mireille Darc), is sent to seduce François. Meanwhile, François has his own problems, tangled up in an affair with his best friend's wife.This is French comedy/mystery at its best and it is just as radiant today as it was in 1972!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Yves Robert film makes good fun of spies and their funny methods !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, French comedy film "The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe" parodies and lampoons espionage films. Its success is guaranteed on two key principles involving spies. Firstly, spies can also be spied either by their juniors or seniors as every spy has to have the honor of having a dossier written about him/her by another spy. It is for this reason that no secrecy can be guaranteed as almost anybody is vulnerable to lack of secrecy. Trust is the difficult thing to be had for spies as it is betrayed at regular intervals. For this film, it is evident that director Yves Robert has been in the favor of 'common man' as any ordinary person can be easily converted as an easy target for an espionage organization. This film's tone is light and situations depicted are highly plausible. It is this quality which makes adventures of the tall blond man with one black shoe very appealing to viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh out loud spy farce played dead pan to perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ordinarily I'm writing criticism mixed with praise, and that takes line after line. Can I stretch three words into 10 lines? "See this one." Jean Rochefort is the spy boss, and he has a subordinate, Bernard Blier becoming too independent. So he sets him up to follow an innocent bystander, a violinist, Pierre Richard. Blier and his crew of deadpan spies then follow Richard, interpreting his every move as something subversive. Lovely Mereille Darc works for Blier in trapping Richard while herself getting trapped.The wit of the set pieces is of the dry variety, but you will find yourself laughing out loud during a number of them. Near the top is an orchestra sequence involving Richard, his friend the tympanist, the latter's wife playing harp and the mistress of Richard. Then there is the sequence where Darc seduces Richard while being observed secretly by Blier and his agents.This is a comedy with its own pace and humor and originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In what appears to be an homage to 1930s screwball comedies, rival factions of France's secret service are trying to discredit each other, so they need a pawn, but the orders are to choose any random person. So, they find a musician (Pierre Richard) wearing different color shoes and proceed to turn his life upside down. Some of the funniest scenes are their recordings of his personal life, and what the peripheral characters must be thinking when they hear the recordings! I've seen a few French films from the late '60s and early '70s, although I can't claim to be a connoisseur. But from what I can tell, "Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire" - called "The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe" in English - constitutes a formidable representation of the screen's new permissiveness of the era (just check out the woman's dress in that one scene!). The American remake "The Man with One Red Shoe" starring Tom Hanks obviously wasn't quite the same, but still provided a few laughs.All in all, a laugh riot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire' is French for 'the tall blond man with one black shoe'.Standing out in this spy-comedy is Mireille Darc's spectacular classy black dress -- adding at least 10% value. While covering Mireille's front side up to her throat, it reveals her bare back all the way down.In her 2005-autobiography 'Tant que battra mon coeur' ('this is the way my heart beats') Mireille tells: "At the front side I show with an impeccable elegance, in this floating black dress of a superb classic design .... it made a tour around the world". The impact of this dress evokes a comparison with Marilyn Monroe's famous scene in 'A seven year itch'.One may well say that this dress took the film along. Apart from it, 'Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire' just shows no flaws. Its rich, well-timed tongue-in-cheek humor is as fresh as it must have been in 1972.</fullReview>

My guess is that someone found a copy of the 1972 poor U.S. release at a flea market somewhere and has taken a position that the copyright has entered the public domain after 28 years as per statutory section 17 USC 303 of the copyright law and is publishing copies of that worn out flea market copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an interesting movie for me to watch. I was staying with some friends parents and the mother remember this movie being really funny. So we all watched it and I enjoyed it. I like how the movie never took itself seriously, but never moved into the realm of the absurd. I thought it was funny and had a few laugh out loud moments. The dress of course will be remembered for years and kind of summarizes the movie as a whole. The movie did not seem very well made in some parts. The shots were not framed well and the zooms were often sloppy. The camera seemed to move at unnecessary moments and it took away from the experience. This is why I give the movie a 6 and not a 7. My mom would enjoy it, but my brother would be mad at me for making him watch it. The acting was as appropriate, but nothing special. The movie felt very french and the Paris setting was very enjoyable. I am not sure if I would watch the movie again, but I am kind of glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a pretty inventive French film that I really wanted to like. I picked up the video because it starred Pierre Richard, who I really liked in La Ch?vre. However, unlike this later film, Le Grand blond avec une chaussure noire wasn't really the wacky film I hoped it would be and I found Richard's performance to be a bit too restrained. In other words, the film was billed as a wacky parody of spy films but it just didn't get wacky enough--I expected something more. And, while Richard was occasionally clumsy or a little dim, his performance really wasn't all that funny. As a result, to me it's really just a time-passer.The actual story idea is pretty creative. Two rivals within the French intelligence agency are at odds with each other. One decides to try and outwit the other by pretending to have a top agent who has incriminating information on his rival--hoping to get his rival to believe that some sap chosen at random is actually this agent. And, the supposed top agent is Richard. While I could go on and describe the plot further, it's probably best you just see the film. One highlight I really DID like was Richard's friend who kept seeing dead people at the end of the film. Yet each time he tried to show Richard, the bodies disappeared...making him seriously doubt his sanity. This was pretty funny, though the rest just seemed to miss the mark somehow.</fullReview>
