		<shortDescription>"Walter Paisley Is Born"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Purportedly made in five days, A Bucket of Blood is one of those films that just seems to grow on you after each viewing(beginning with the first!). Dick Miller plays his most substantial role in his long and varied career as a very stupid, amoral busboy for a beatnik cafe. His name is Walter Paisley and he wants to "fit" in with all the other cool cats at the cafe like the pompous Maxwell who recites poetry, the two clowns higher than kites that just take space and never order any coffee, the cafe owner Leonard that wears the trappings of being a beatnik but is more concerned about making a buck, the lovely artist Carla that wants to be surrounded by creative and artistic people, and a host of other beatnik types. Walter, by a set of bizarre and ridiculous circumstances, takes a cat he accidentally killed and covers it with clay. He brings it in to his "friends" and that laud him as a great and gifted artist. From there Walter works his way up to human sculptures. The story is filled with loads of black humour including a heavy dose of fun poked at the beatnik culture. Miller plays Paisley wonderfully with a certain innocence. All the acting is pretty good with a few stand-outs. Anthony Carbone as Leonard adds a lot of credibility to the film with his more realistic performance, and he has some of the best lines and facial expressions. Barboura Morris is beautiful and credible. But the top acting honors easily go to Julian Burton(where is this guy now?) as Maxwell. He is the poet that makes every word sound as if art were dripping from his tongue. He recites lines like, "Life is an obscure hobo bumming a free ride on the omnibus of art" and "ring rubber bells, clang cotton gongs, strike silken cymbols." He is wonderfully over-the-top in his whole portrayal and always makes me laugh with that garbage he utters. Director Roger Corman has little budget to work with here, but he makes a minor masterpiece with what he did have to work with. Walter Paisley is Born. And he lives on in video and dvd!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicious black comedy from Roger Corman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This delicious black comedy is one of the films that Roger Corman used to make before he got a bigger budget and went on to do fantastic adaptations of Edgar Allen Poe stores, starting with 'The Fall of the House of Usher', the year after this was made. A Bucket of Blood stars Dick Miller, whom you may know as 'that guy from Gremlins', which Dante almost certainly cast him in due to his affiliation with Corman, as he plays a character named Walter Paisley in both The Howling and A Bucket of Blood. Anyway, in this film he has been cast a busboy for a public house, who is also an aspiring artist. However, Walter lacks creativity and is looking for an idea when he inadvertently kills his landlady's cat, which he then proceeds to cover in plaster and present as a piece of art. The art world is filled with weirdo's, and because of that, this sculpture becomes an instant hit and Walter is now very much 'in'. One masterpiece isn't enough, however, and Walter must add more to his collection to gain the fame he wants...but where is that next masterpiece going to come from? Aside from being a cheap black comedic exploitation thriller, A Bucket of Blood is also a commentary on the art world. Anything can pass for a masterpiece when it comes to being 'creative' (shown by that strange woman with a bed in real life), and a dead cat certainly fits that bill. The film also comments on the fact that one masterpiece isn't enough for an 'artist' to cement themselves in the annals of history and thus they need several. Dick Miller's portrayal of the aspiring artist at the centre of the tale isn't award worthy, but he does a very good job. The character is naive, with an air of pathos, spanning from a need to be accepted, and Dick Miller captures this essence so well that you cant imagine anyone else in the role. I really enjoy seeing Miller on screen and it's a shame he didn't get more roles as he has a lot of potential for playing characters of this sort.This film is an obvious predecessor to many other indie themed exploitation thrillers, such as The Driller Killer and is important for that reason. The jazz styling makes a nice atmosphere for the movie and it helps to capture the pseudo-cool jazz trend that is often associated with art in the late 50's and early 60's. And, aside from everything I've said so far; this film is just really good. It's a lot of fun and many of things shown on screen are really funny. There's also some lovely death sequences including, most notably, someone being cut in half with a buzz saw. Naturally (considering this was made in 1959), we don't get to see the death, but it still happens and it's not Corman's fault he couldn't show it. This film is a damn good time and it's a shame that it hasn't gained itself a more established following the forty-five years since it's release. Recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1950s beatnik/horror classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman will always be remembered for being the guy who made all those cheap and nasty exploitation movies in the 50s and 60s. What people DON'T remember is that many of them were actually very good! 'A Bucket Of Blood' is one of his best, possibly THE best.'Bucket..' is a black comedy concerning bus boy and wanna be artist Walter Paisley (the immortal Dick Miller) who works in an arty coffee shop frequented by poets, painters, beatniks and druggies. By an odd series of circumstances, which I won't spoil for those that haven't watched this, he becomes "the next big thing". As his career takes off he becomes hip, cool and adulated by most. He does have one enemy who knows his secret and an undercover cop is sniffing around, so poor Walter better stay on his toes...This movie is a lot of fun, still holds up well, and is an entertaining, well made (for its obvious low budget) satire on art, success, fame and death. Dick Miller has gone on to a long and varied career since the 50s, but no matter what he does he will ALWAYS be Walter Paisley!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror comedy of different clay!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not including almost every entry in the terrific Edgar Allen Poe cycle he did, "A Bucket of Blood" unquestionable is Roger Corman's best and most entertaining film. And ? coincidentally or not ? this movie also contains many references towards Poe (a walled-up cat!!), so maybe Corman simply needs the legendary horror author's oeuvre in order to deliver great movies? "A Bucket of Blood" is a truly slick and ingenious little quickie that terrifically blends the classic terror premise of "Mystery of the Wax Museum" with the typical psychotronic-humor that Corman largely invented himself. Corman regular Dick Miller (terribly underrated throughout his whole career) gives away a near-perfect performance as Walter Praisley, a clumsy waiter and wannabe artist whose biggest wish to get as famous as the talkative stars he serves coffee to every day. His dream accelerates rapidly and unexpectedly when he covers his landlady's dead cat in clay and people proclaim it an art-masterpiece. Walter naturally enjoys his easily earned artist-status but he also realizes that he'll have to move on to bigger (read: bloodier) projects if he wants to stay in the picture. Dick Miller's exhilarating acting together with Charles Griffith's wit scripting skills, makes this a very fun production that every cult-film fan will enjoy watching. Although chuckles clearly have the upper hand in "A Bucket of Blood", Corman doesn't ignore the horror entirely and some of the death-sequences are definitely more chilling than the ones featuring in other contemporary and "serious" horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corman's first black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Roger Corman's autobiography, he credits himself to creating the sub-genre "black comedy". His version of "black comedy" featured gruesome elements, that were sometimes played for laughs. With BUCKET OF BLOOD and LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, he furthered this along, and although I'm not sure if he did indeed invent the "black comedy", he sure had a good run with it.BUCKET OF BLOOD is near-perfect. Which is saying a lot when you think of some of Corman's films. BUCKET OF BLOOD stars Dick Miller in his only starring performance. He plays a struggling busboy/artist, whose only real desire in life is to impress the local beatnik girl (the talented Barboura Morris). Miller works at the same coffee house that Morris frequents. The place, run by Anthony Carbone, features poetry and art. There are also pretentious beatniks, drug dealers, and undercover detectives.I don't want to give much else away, aside from that the film itself has a life of its own. The energy is high, the camera and editing work are effectively polished, and the dialogue is uniformly crisp. Corman's direction is fluid. Next to LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and maybe a few of his Poe films, BUCKET OF BLOOD is his best film.Dick Miller, has never received such a juicy part to play as this. He handles the jokes well, and his interplay with Carbone, and especially Ed Nelson, is great.The sets are cheap, the conclusion is rushed, but BUCKET OF BLOOD made me giggle, and unlike some horror films, it is supposed to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate art-house spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone is fed up with the pretentious nitwits that dictate what is good art, chances are you'll enjoy this classic campy tale. The protagonist is a weakling who works as a waiter at a beatnik coffee shop and hangs around psuedo artist snobs, sucking up their every last syllable as if it is a mocha frapuccino. He wants very much to carve a niche for himself in this group of losers and manages to do so when he makes a sculpture out of his landlady's dead cat! True to herd mentality, everyone is soon basking in this guy's coolness, singing his praises, and generally kissing his talentless behind. Only problem is, he keeps making sculptures from bodies! By the time these Bohemians catch on to the fact that this guy may not be so hip after all, the death toll has risen and laughter is abound. Also make sure to look out for the fat bearded character Maxwell, this guy is a total riot. The sad thing is every time I go to an open mike I meet some "poet" who is just like him. Great sardonic humor from the master of the macabre Roger Corman. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That darned cat!(in the wall)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman has a gem here. First, I really dig that Beatnik scene man: groovy! We start off at the cafe with the sax wailing and Maxwell shooting the audience with words of wisdom. It's a great opener to our story. Dick Miller is great as Walter Paisley (great name play there!) who makes you root for our down trodden busboy. Plus, who knew landladys were so controlling back then? Sheesh, a guy can't even bring a dame over! Add great support especially from Julian Burton who's Mr. Brock (please call me Maxwell) really lives it up as the ultimate beat poet and has a terrific time doing it! He kind of reminds me of a Beatnikesque Oliver Reed. Leonard De Santis provides laughs as the stuck up cafe owner who learns to stop belittling Walter if he knows what's good for him. Even Bruno VeSota is an art aficionado. My favorite scene has to be when Walter turns 180 and visits the cafe (love that beret!). Or maybe it's Walter as the triumphant king! All in all, Bucket of Blood is a whole lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you call this piece of art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Paisley is a dim-witted busboy who works at a coffee shop that's populated by beatniks reciting their poetry, playing their jazzy music, throwing around their words of wisdom and praising each others' work. Walter really wants to be part of this crowd, but they don't take him seriously. So he goes home to make something out of clay, but his stopped because of the constant meowing from the landlady's cat that's stuck in the wall. Trying to get it out, he accidentally kills it, so he decides to cover with clay and take it to the coffee shop to show off his work. Everyone is impressed, but they want more. Which, Walter does deliver.Now this is what you call an entertaining horror/comedy B-movie that delivers on what it promises. Thank you Roger Corman for such an humorlessly offbeat offering that has personality. 'A Bucket of Blood' is a drive-in quickie that mocks that of the art society in the late 50s to 60s with such blackly laced humour in a tongue-in-cheek approach. The spoof elements seem to fuse impeccably well with the amusing satirical attacks on the beatnik culture. It's hard not to grin at how pompous this lifestyle is with them finding masterpieces in the strangest things, then labelling the artist some sort of master who's got to continue his budding work. Also there's their intellectual lingo that supposedly has a deeper meaning to it all? far out! You could say that this beatnik generation lives in their own little world, but their artistic shallowness definitely moulds itself into the picture.Now you're probably wondering when does the horror come in. Well, the wry humour might be heavy, but the violence has a rather bitter and twisted feel as it becomes an obsession for Walter to knock off people to advance his social status in the art world and to please those artists who see big things in him. The deaths are executed rather well, actually. They do hold such a chilling and grisly sting, because the victims are obliviously to what's going to happen and we see the cold, obsessed transformation of Walter taking hold. Dick Millar nails down the part beautifully in depicting a character that might not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but it's his unstable patterns that come to the forefront. Millar's performance was very memorable, but the rest of the cast were very good too with a nice mixture of animated characters ranging from the variety of zesty beatniks to Walter's interfering landlady. The cheap budget seems to do wonders on the dreary atmosphere. That of Walter's gloomy, but cosy apartment where he does the finishing touches (the nitty gritty stuff) to his work, which shows the true loneliness and why he wants to be accepted.Surrounding the film is a hip and jazzy score that manages to spice up proceedings by gelling together with its artistic context. Director Corman manages to keep things moving at a reasonable pace with it flying by quick enough. He succeeds in making a fun satire that has whole range of surprising developments and he knows when to tighten the screws with some razor edge thrills, which makes way for a satisfyingly, ingenious outcome. No way is life imitating art here.A delightfully dark and quirky premise with many memorable performances, but no more than Dick Millar. A very well done production all round by Corman and co.Side-note: 'The Little Shop of Horrors' was made on the back of 'A bucket of blood' with basically most of the same cast and sets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Corman's Best, But Still Worth-Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, I've been trying to convince myself that renting A Bucket of Blood (1959) wouldn't be a waste of money. On the one hand, it's a Roger Corman picture; on the other hand, it's a Roger Corman picture. He did some great work - Rock n Roll High School, Little Shop of Horrors, some of his Poe adaptations, etc.But he also directed the Terror which, well, I wasn't too fond of.In any event, I discovered a fifty cent copy of the Bucket of Blood DVD at the local Target and, well, it was hard to pass up. You can't get a candy bar for fifty cents these days, let alone a DVD, so I didn't have much of a choice.It was a wise investment. A Bucket of Blood, though not nearly as fun as those aforementioned Corman classics, has plenty of wonderful set-pieces, some hysterical dialogue, and a terrific performance by Dick Miller (B-movie actor best known as Mr.Futterman (sp?) from Gremlins and the owner of a bookstore specializing in paranormal literature in The Howling).Like most other Corman pictures, this one is more humorous than horrific. Of course, that's what makes them fun. Not to give too much away, the story follows Dick Miller as Walter Paisley, lowly busboy at a Beatnik Coffee Shop, who discovers through an interesting encounter with Frankie the Cat his inner artistic genius.I'd really like to tell you more about Frankie the Cat because, well, it's the most absurdly funny thing I've seen in a long time. That would ruin the surprise though. Instead, I'll tell you about the naked lightbulb hanging from the ceiling in Dick Miller's apartment. For some reason, when knocked off-kilter this lightbulb, dangling from a cord as lightbulbs in dive apartments are wont to do, moves back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, creating a nice, eerie effect as the shadows jump around. Yet, and maybe this was because I had been drinking before I sat down to watch the movie, the lightbulb, in the scene involving Frankie the Cat never seems to stop its pendulum-like performance. The violent oscillation never seems to diminish. I feel as though that's defying several laws of physics, but I could be wrong. Anyway, it was a nice touch and I found it entertaining.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Beatniks Go Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very funny B movie by Roger Corman about a hapless busboy who works in a fifties coffee shop and wants more than anything to be accepted by the beatnik in-crowd. He is prevented from doing so, however, by his complete lack of artistic talent (not that most of the regulars are particularly gifted either). After accidentally killing his landlady's cat (rigor mortis setting in immediately, apparently), he decides the best way to cover up his crime is to cover the critter with clay and pass it off as avant-garde art. His hep cat customers are blown away; Walter is delighted to be accepted at last; only to hold their interest he has to keep making sculptures? The film is not particularly scary (and probably wasn't meant to be), but it works very well as a horror spoof and amusing, if occasionally heavy handed, satire on beatnik culture and the modern art scene (although considering that today rotten meat and crucifixes immersed in urine are taken seriously as art it's as though reality has caught up with and outdone satire). The bearded poet Maxwell who writes of cotton gongs and the sour cream of circumstance is, as others have commented, a dead-on parody of the type of writer who to this day can be found at café readings. (He is strangely likable, though, maybe because he is so genuinely enthusiastic about his pretentious poetry). And for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, I thought the final scene where Maxwell leads a bunch of other earnest beatniks in a chase after a now completely crazed Walter one of the funniest episodes I've ever seen in a movie.If you've never seen a Corman film before, this is a good place to start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Bucket of Blood is a nice little Corman horror film. It plays better than many of his other non-Poe, non-Price films. It's the story of a "backwards" busboy in a beatnik dive trying to fit in by becoming an artist. His creations are the talk of the joint. But just how is the seemingly talentless busboy able to create such realistic images of death? Dick Miller plays the busboy in one of the few feature roles I remember seeing him in. The mix of emotions he imbibes into his character is a highlight of the film. At one moment he's confused, the next a raving lunatic. Corman kept the screenplay simple and it works. I've seen too many low budget directors try to creative effects, etc. that their budgets just do not allow. Corman doesn't do this. This one is definitely recommended to fans of the 50s quickie horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Omigod, this film !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this on TCM just now, for the umpteenth time, I can no longer resist singing the praises of this little, unpretentious gem. From its lurid title, to its opening shot of the beat poet spewing his inspired nonsense with satirical conviction, the evocative musical score by Fred Katz, and the amazing potpourri of quirky, diverting characterizations by the cast of players ... its hard knowing where to stop. It's a pleasure to see that this film's relative genius (considering its budget) is widely recognized in the reviews posted here, and I have to compliment how incisive so many of the comments I'm reading here are. One thing I like about this movie, and "Little Shop of Horrors" to which it compares in many ways (as one reviewer here notes) is the sheer expression of rejection it represents -- rejection of the preposterous, over-budgeted, empty, special-effects-based style of so much of Hollywood's product nowadays -- in preference for something to appeal to the sensibilities not senses, the intelligence of its viewers not the arrogance of their stupidity ... sorry, I just read a review that posted moments before mine, I gather in response to somebody else's viewing of today's TCM showing, giving the film one star and calling it "poorly made" ... (how dare they try to diminish this little cinematic treasure)By the way, delicious black comedy that it is (borrowed that excellent phrase from another right-on reviewer here ... apologies, I know, "repetition is the death of art") -- there is one moment in the film deserving mention as drama. It's the tour de force one-man scene in which Walter (Dick Miller) accidentally kills his cat. It's launches in absurd enough fashion, with Walter's stupidity taking on tragic dimensions. The dead cat, as he frees it from the wall behind which it was trapped, is presented not as some freshly killed animal hanging limp, but rather a ridiculously stuffed/mounted taxidermist's work, all stiff, dry and lightweight -- almost as if to try and trip any viewing "squares" into saying "Hey look, you can tell it's fake" (duh) -- as if that is even remotely the "point." Standard enough fare in some ways. But as Walter goes to transform the animal into art by covering it with clay, the comedy vanishes for a moment as he breaks down in an emotional anguish made acutely real for the moment by Miller's dramatic talent, which shines brightly. One acutely feels the protagonist's essential pain and loneliness for just this brief scene in the film, driving home vividly how these themes underly the entire story (much as in the equally hilarious "Little Shop of Horrors").Necrophiles may indeed dance upon the placemats in an orgy of togetherness, I have no problem with that. Yet, films like this can't be made anymore because they are not geared to the cheapened tastes of today's mass audiences. Pity. But they can't take "A Bucket of Blood" away from us, heh heh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Morbid Comedy!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliantly simple and incisive script pokes fun at the 50's Beatnik era and the pretensions of the nascent California avant-garde. Half-wit savant Walter Paisley (Veteran character actor Dick Miller in his first starring role) works in a seedy coffeehouse, pining with unrequited love for the hostess Carla who is the only person to show him kindness. He is in awe of the poets and artists, however bombastic and pretentious, that surround him and boasts that he will be like them. He isn't about to let an utter lack of talent stand in the way of his determination. It isn't until a series of horrible accidents, involving his landlady's cat and an impetuously ambitious narc, show him the way to fame. He literally covers up these tragedies in clay as the rambling poetry he knows verbatim echoes through his head: "The artist is?, All others are not? Let them die and by their miserable deaths become the clay in his hands that he might mold them into an ashtray or an ark..." They are proclaimed as prodigious masterpieces that gain him the attention and respect he so longed for. Unlike the insane artistes of Mystery of the Wax Museum and House of Wax, Walter starts out an utterly meek and innocent man whose neediness, powerlessness, and seething resentment make him ripe for tragedy. Circumstances will start him on a downward spiral as he makes that fateful decision to go from reliance on what Fate brought him to making more work on his own. But fame has its price and when he finds that the love he thought he would gain from Carla does not come, he plunges further into the depths. When at his first showing, the secret of his work is discovered by Carla, the resulting climax and denouement is a more fitting tribute to the work of Poe than all of the lavish adaptations of the great writer's work Corman would later produce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious beatnik satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gem of a B-movie -- funny, gory, with a spice of sex (for 1959). Miller leads with his sincere performance as Walter Paisley, a dimwitted yokel so eager to impress his beatnik friends (who all hang out in the coffee shop where he waits tables) that he kills in order to create his macabre art. Spoofs Beatnik fashion, superiority complexes, artiness, and personal hygiene. Carbone also contributes some funny moments as his employer, eager to make a profit from Paisley's art although he suspects Walter's methods might be more than a bit shady. Griffith's script is the best thing about the film (next to Miller's righteous performance); Corman has the guts to make it as written (a grace he did not give Griffith's purportedly similar "The Undead", in that case shooting it straight and ruining the film), but he shows just as little excellence in direction here as usual. Mourris is cute and convincing as Paisley's friend who's impressed by his art, but not his mojo.A classic in the E.C. Comics tradition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Roger Corman made some films that were technically superior ("House of Usher", "The Intruder"), "A Bucket of Blood" remains my personal favorite film by him. Many people think of Corman as an exploitation filmmaker who churned out cheap films to make a buck. While that may be true to some degree, the fact is he made some really good films and seemed to be generally interested in crafting quality. "A Bucket of Blood" is the first masterpiece of Corman. It is more than just a cheap exploitation film. It's one of the most hilarious satires on the eliteness of the art world and also a touching character study. I've never seen anything quite like it.As much credit that goes to Corman is also due to screenwriter Charles B. Griffith. It's definitely his best work. The film skewers how pretentious and ultimately meaningless so much modern art in actuality is, and how to be accepted among the snobs you have to commit murder. It perfectly balances slapstick comedy with a much darker sense of humor. The acting is great also. Dick Miller is a cult film legend simply because of this role, and his status is completely justified. Him and Griffith manage to make Walter Paisley an entirely sympathetic character no matter how gruesome his murders become. Barboura Morris is terrific also, but the real scene stealer is Julian Burton as the beatnik poet Maxwell H. Brock. His "hip" poetry shows how meaningless a lot of "metaphorical" and "deep" poetry actually is ("Burn gas buggies and whip your sour cream of circumstance and hope"). "A Bucket of Blood" is one of the greatest cult classics there is. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor simpleminded waiter, Walter Paisley(perfectly brought to the screen by vet Dick Miller)just wants to fit in with the self-important Beatnik "artists" at the Yellow Door coffeehouse. He's the object of jokes and ridicule as Walter amiably converses with them while his employer Leonard(Antony Carbone)just wants him to take the drinks to them with his mouth closed. When Walter makes a wax sculpture of a cat he accidentally kills and later a police officer undercover trying to catch dope-pushers mistakingly suspecting him of using, the waiter becomes an overnight celebrity. Although, his employer knows about the two killings, the profit and press that his café is getting is too overwhelmingly positive to report. So Walter then strangles a nude model, who insulted him in the coffeehouse, and it seems there's no turning back. He has fallen madly for Carla(Barboura Morris), a beatnik herself highly respected amongst her peers and highly moved by the sculptures Walter makes. After the beheading of a factory worker, Walter's notorious habits for creating sculptures will soon get him in hot water..how can someone like Walter get away with his murderous ways too long before something fishy isn't discovered?The Beatnik arts are beautifully scathing thanks to the dark-humored screenplay which places a "nobody" amongst a crowd full on themselves. These are the kind of people who love the sound of their voices and act in a manner they deem cool. It's all performance and show, and Corman just pokes holes in their hilarious facade. A ton of fun for those with a macabre sense of humor or are genre fans of the wax-museum type horror flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fun art of murder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night, I saw Dario Argento's The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. Tonight I watched Roger Corman's A Bucket of Blood. Good thing I saw the Argento film first, because after Corman's skewed, but hilarious take on art, fashion, society and murder, I would have had trouble taking Bird seriously. Playing with the cliches of 50s hipster noir, Corman and his cast had a ball with this story of a nobody -- played by Dick Miller in the defining role of his career -- who becomes a renowned bohemian artist. Shot in an absurdly short time (3 days according to legend) on a budget that wouldn't have bought dinner for a major studio's crew, the movie is consistently engaging and funny. Always witty, with inspired, goofy beatnik poetry, a cast of eccentrics, and those great exterior shots that characterize Corman's black and white movies, Bucket is drive-in cinema at its finest. Is art murder? Are art dealers accomplices? Is this movie art? Well, no, but it's not murder either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's 'Art'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being an avid fan of classic B-movies, I had not seen a Roger Corman movie before, 'A Bucket of Blood'. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.Now to be honest, I'm not as clear on the history of dark comedies as much as I probably should be. However, my assumption is that this has to have been one of the first, or at the very least one of the first great ones. The film follows a painfully awkward man named Walter (Dick Miller). He is a busboy at a local hipster hangout who doesn't quite seem to fit in despite his personal aspirations to be one of the crowd. One night Walter goes home to his depressing apartment and decides make an attempt at creating a sculpture. He quickly becomes frustrated and angry when he can't seem to figure out how to make anything out of the clay.During the apex of his frustration he accidentally kills a neighbors cat, and feels horrible about it. After calming down he has an idea, 'Why not just put clay over the body?!' The next day he takes the clay- covered feline "sculpture" down to his work, where it is an instant hit.Without divulging too much into the plot, Walter eventually goes on to murder in order to get more bodies to cover in clay. Eventually Walter gains a huge following as an artist.There were several reasons why I enjoyed this film. One of the major reasons was the excellent acting. Dick Miller does such an wonderful job playing Walter, the awkward waiter/murderer. It is literally uncomfortable to watch him interact in social situations. His awkward passes at women in the interest of love, or his discussions with men who are interested in his artwork, seem like the interactions someone who might actually turn people into clay sculptures might actually have! On top of this, the hipsters at the bar overact wonderfully. I especially enjoy the character of Maxwell Brock (Julian Burton) who praises all of Walter's 'Work' as if the sculptures were sent down from the Gods.As a psychological piece I also find it interesting. I especially noticed how Walter's murders progress. The first murder was completely accidental (albeit the murder of a cat), the second was self-defense, the third vengeance, and the final; cold blooded murder. I think it's an interesting look at the progression of Walt's violence.As a dark comedy it is also effective. The overacting on the side of the hipsters is great and the general story itself is pretty amusing, in a dark way. It's one of those stories that is so absurd, but at the same time taken just seriously enough the viewers will chuckle more then a few time throughout the film, while enjoying the picture as a semi-serious tale.Highly recommended for: Dark Comedy lovers, B-movie lovers and honestly, film lovers in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art-y satire stabs it deep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a handful of Roger Corman films, including Little Shop of Horrors with Jack Nicholson, but I actually have to admit I've never seen 'em quite as good as this one. Corman hits a home run with a stellar script, good actors, and some great art design (quite literally, the art department had to recreate what within the movie is all-too-realistic). In fact, up until the end when Walter's conscience starts talking in voice over, this was an almost perfect movie. That unfortunate twist aside, you really gotta give this movie some credit.The key is the dialog. Charles B. Griffith has hung out with his fair share of intellectual bohemian layabouts. You've got the self-important poet ("Repetition is death!"), the blitzed out leeches ("We came here to make it a happening!"), the vain groupies ("I went to find Henry Miller but he's all the way in Europe!"), and even those tragic few who actually care (love interest Carla, played by Barboura Morris). They all create a landscape of everybody's favorite Beatnik coffee shop, headed by Leonard de Santis (Antony Carbone), the only person with the ability to see what's really going on. With expert use of limited sets and some creative sculpturing, Roger Corman actually makes a very realistic and integrated little community, the exact type of which I've stumbled upon first hand a few times myself (it's always amusing when you run into these little niches where everyone knows each other a little too well).Walter himself is an interesting character study as a lonely and attention-starved busboy who stumbles upon a way to make his name, his mind too simple to really grasp the full reality of what he's doing but also sharp and quick enough to figure out how to keep doing it. He walks the line between savant capable of remembering every single word of a conversation (or poem) and a person completely oblivious to the subtleties behind the words themselves. You can both relate to this character entirely and be repulsed by how obviously messed up he is--even before the body count starts.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Bucket of Blood (1959)Beats, Artists, and a Sweet Tempered KillerThis is a romp, a riot, and a rebellious ripoff. Most of all it's rotten, so rotten it's terrific. It's a must see, in a way, for anyone into the beats, and into C-grade horror films. Is it good at all? Yes, yes! As clumsy as it is, Bucket of Blood has an innovative (if ridiculous) plot. It has an unlikely hero who meets an unlikely demise. It has real poetry, and real hep cat talk (of the lowest form, but hey, show me more fun). It has mood, heroes and villains, a chase scene (on foot), stupid broads and stupid cats and funny situations.One key to liking this kind of thing is to remember that the filmmakers, even if on a starvation budget, are no idiots. Director Roger Corman most of all. They know they are making a laugh-out-loud send up of horror films, and they know the beat slang is absurd, and they know the plot is crazy, man. So you can have fun with them, and really get a good laugh, and a little chill, and a weird reminder that in some sad sad happy way, this is what it was like in smaller city coffeehouses where Ginsberg never set foot but where Corman and crew did. Even the photography, led by Jacques R. Marquette (of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, quote unquote), is really worth watching.There is nothing like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever film is more creepy than comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The character of Walter Paisley, the shy and frustrated bus boy played by Dick Miller, may be Miller's best performance. Miller manages to make the psychopathic Walter believable, and initially sympathetic. He is such a lost soul, that your heart goes out to him, but near the end of the movie, Miller subtly alters his portrayal, so that the awkward, lonely misfit becomes a genuinely frightening character. How Miller manages to do this, without crossing over into parody, is a mystery, and a performance that deserves to be seen more often, but the movie is a real cult item, little known to many outside of Fifties horror movie buffs and Roger Corman fans.Excellent screenplay by Charles Grifith, and fine playing by supporting cast, especially Julian Burton as the beatnik leader and Antony Carbone as the conflicted café owner. Lovely Barboura Morris is enchanting as always. The sets and locales have an oddly convincing feeling, as if we had stumbled onto a beat hangout and ended up observing the various poetry readings and art shows. Because of this, the movie captures a unique moment in time when such places and people actually existed.The movie is certainly satirical of the art world and pretentious people who pose as artists and collectors, but I feel the movie is not as much of a comedy as many would have it. Some viewers have commented on an almost film noir feeling about it, and I felt that the chase scene at the end was in fact reminiscent of moments in Dassin's Night and the City, and Welles' Touch of Evil. Corman's own Little Shop of Horrors certainly owes a great deal to this movie, but that film can be considered a genuine comedy, however bizarre.There's something truly creepy and unnerving about this film, especially Miller's portrayal. The satire and absurdity are certainly present, but the overall feeling for me is of something genuinely nightmarish.This movie may actually have been ahead of its time, in some ways. I'd be curious to know what viewers thought of it when it was first shown in theaters.</fullReview>

He launched the careers of martin Scorsese, Francie Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdonovich, to name a few. he is a wizard of the low-budget film.While this is a perfect example of that, it is still a fascinating work. It takes place in the land of beatniks. pretentious SOBs that think they are "hip." Walter (Dick Miller) was just a low functioning busboy. he wanted to be appreciated, but those around him were too busy loving themselves.He stumbles upon a "talent" while he was trying to create and becomes a star. One cannot talk about his talent without giving away secrets, but suffice it to say, it makes for interesting theater.An excellent example of Corman's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was made by the legendary Roger Corman shortly before his more famous Little Shop of Horrors. Many, including Dick Miller and Corman himself, saw LSOH as a remake of Bucket of Blood. There are indeed similarities, but this film is much darker in its tone and subject matter. Miller's main character here is a deliberate murderer and psychopath, whereas Seymour in LSOH never wanted to kill anyone. Consequently I feel that this film isn't as funny as LSOH, but is still enjoyable nonetheless.

		<fullReview>Dick Miller, one of the greatest cult actors of all time, here had a career high with his engaging portrayal of Walter Paisley. Walter is a meek busboy at a café dubbed The Yellow Door, a place frequented by goofy "beatnik" types. More than anything, he yearns to impress them and be part of their crowd. Alas, he's lacking in the department of artistic talent. However, his accidental killing of his landlady's cat sets off something inside of him. Soon, he's using clay to create amazingly accurate looking "sculptures" that finally make him a hit at his place of employment.Considered by some to be one of producer / director Roger Cormans' best pictures, "A Bucket of Blood" is deliciously macabre fun. Written by Charles B. Griffith, it's a very funny satire of the entire "beatnik" era, and of pretentious artistic types in general, while it also sends up the entire subgenre of "House of Wax" type features. The characters populating the story are frequently hilarious, especially pompous "poet" Maxwell H. Brock (Julian Burton), and the laid back duo Will (John Brinkley) &amp; Oscar (John Herman Shaner). The movie is also a very effective dark comedy which suggests some pretty nasty violence. It's beautifully shot in stark black &amp; white by Jacques R. Marquette. The sculptures themselves are really kind of creepy looking. The jazzy score by Fred Katz adds to the enjoyment.Miller is wonderful in the lead. Also doing good work are Barboura Morris as his leading lady Carla, and Antony Carbone as café owner Leonard de Santis. Turning up in nice supporting roles are Ed Nelson and Bert Convy as undercover detectives, Judy Bamber as stuck up model Alice, Myrtle Vail as landlady Mrs. Swickert, and Bruno VeSota as an art collector.The typically low Corman budget prevents the ultimate resolution from being that satisfying, but up until then, this is fine entertainment.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Movie tag-line) - "Inside Every Artist Lurks.... A Madman!" Now, here's a big bucket of ultra-cheap, 1950s, Horror that's so haywire, so laughable, and so bad that it's actually good (to the very last drop), that I think it quite rightfully deserves a 5-star rating for itself. Indeed! This off-beat, black comedy tells the tale of how a bungling, frustrated and totally talentless busboy named Walter Paisley achieves his 15-minutes-of-fame and suddenly becomes what he's always dreamed of being - The New Darling of the Art World.A Bucket Of Blood's story is set in the artsy-fartsy world of the 1950s Beatnik Culture where everything is just so cool and hip (ad nauseum). And reciting the most vacuous poetry imaginable is sure to win you raves of approval from all of the hep-cats and hep-gals without question.While at home in his squalid flat, struggling hopelessly to create something worthwhile out of some clay, Paisley accidentally kills the landlady's cat that's gotten itself stuck in between the wall in his room.Struck with the brainstorm of a dumb-bell, Paisley takes the cat, covers it with clay, and after seeing what a masterpiece he's "created", doesn't waste a minute to show it to all of his friends, passing it off as his own unique offering to the world of avant-garde art.Naturally, all of the cool dudes (and dude-ettes) down at the Yellow Door Cafe are totally blown away by Paisley's new-found talent as a gifted sculptor.But, of course, they want to see more.And, so, now, in a freshly-ignited, murderous frenzy, Paisley obligingly delivers.With its $50,000 budget and 5-day shooting schedule this "Roger Corman" quickie offers us a demented horror film with personality, where the shallowness of the Beatnik Generation (and the art world) is clearly mocked with a gleeful flair that cleverly melds itself into the very sarcastic roots of this picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beat Guy for the Beat Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dick Miller certainly deserves a drive-in Oscar for his hapless schlemiel Walter Paisley, serial sculptor and busboy extraordinaire. The movie's about beatniks, but no one looks more beat than poor Walter. He's so downcast, he resembles little more than a gravedigger on forced overtime. It's also a great performance that makes the movie, which may be the best movie on the short-lived beatnik craze that I've seen. The fad itself, centered in west coast coffee houses during the late 1950's, was supposed to be an artistic protest of the sterile conformity of the Eisenhower years. The scene with its wacky poetry and jazzy lingo reached into a lot of college towns, but disappeared quickly with the Kennedy election. Now it's mainly a nostalgia trip for some of us geezers. Despite its lowly origin, the movie manages to convey both the creativity and pretensions of the beat scene, at least as I recall it.I love the fact that this $50,000, five-day quickie is more remembered by movie buffs than so many of its big budget contemporaries. But then, Bucket is well acted, well staged (despite the shoestring budget), and really imaginative. Plus, the black humor comes through without force-feeding. Still, I wonder about the very last scene, which is much too literal to fit in with the rest. It's like a sudden lapse in imagination (Was it to please the censors). Anyhow, a tip of the proverbial hat to drive-in great Roger Corman for happy accidents like the mordantly amusing Bucket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Corman's A Bucket of Blood paints a nice picture of a social misfit. Walter Paisley is a busboy at the local coffee shop/hipster hangout. He'd do anything just to be accepted by the pseudo poets and faux artists who haunt the place. But he has no natural talent and is a bit on the slow side (he'd have to be slow to worship these people). So when he accidentally kills his landlord's cat he covers its body in clay and, to his surprise, creates art. His now colleagues praise his genius but wonder what he's going to do next. As you can imagine his sculptures get bigger and bigger as Paisley's reputation grows. The under-appreciated Dick Miller is fantastic as said misfit, Walter Paisley. If the movie had been terrible, he alone would have been worth the price of admission. But the movie is not terrible. It's actually quite clever. The Charles Griffith script hits all the right notes and director/producer Corman treats the material accordingly. And since there are no big effects or elaborate set pieces, this film is all about the story. It has an EC comics punchline at the end and it's quite fitting. I'd have to say that A Bucket of Blood is one of my top three Roger Corman films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Bucket, Not Much Blood, But Classic All the Same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) is a waiter at a pseudo-intellectual existentialist beatnik bar that features open microphone nights. He is not respected and seen as a moron (which, in many ways, he is). But when his hobby of sculpting becomes combined with murder on accident, Walter's true genius begins to shine.This is classic directing by Roger Corman, before the days of his friendship with Vincent Price. Also, this film was written by Charles B. Griffith, with whom Corman made some of his better horror comedies ("Creature From the Haunted Sea" and "Little Shop of Horrors" to name just two off the tip of my tongue). So as long as you don't mind the low budget picture and sound (you have to strain your ears at times -- why isn't this remastered?) you're in for a treat.The star is none other than Dick Miller, a name you ought to be familiar with. But if not, you'll recognize his face, because he went on to appear in a variety of horror films in supporting roles ("Chopping Mall" and "Gremlins" in the 1980s, for example, and most of Joe Dante's films). Miller gives us a strong performance here and has the trademark Corman acting going for him (compare Miller here to Jack Nicholson, a Corman protégé, in "Little Shop of Horrors").The story is not exactly new, especially since it is oddly similar to "House of Wax" that came out just prior (and perhaps not coincidentally starred Vincent Price). But still, there is a charm to this that couldn't have been pulled off by Price (who just doesn't do "silly") and makes it worth seeing. Just don't ask where the "bucket of blood" is, because you won't find it (a little blood, maybe, but no bucket).This is one classic worth your time (especially since it's only 65 minutes long) and I wish they had a remastered version so more people would be able to enjoy it. A remake was made (which I haven't sen), but I don't think anyone could re-capture the feel and style that Corman, Miller and Griffith achieved here. They created a film that ought to be referenced by other film-makers for generations to come, at least in horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really got a kick out of this. First of all, Corman pokes fun at the vapid artists that were part of the coffeehouse scene of the fifties. They are so full of themselves as to be caricatures. I knew some of these guys--all shadow and no substance. Walter, the main character, finds a way to turn dead bodies into sculptures, using clay, and is immediately embraced by this pompous crowd, showing they have no knowledge of anything. As it goes on, he has to begin killing more and more, just like Seymour in "Little Shop." His standing is based on decaying bodies. I suppose Corman just ignored this. Eventually, things would collapse, but that doesn't matter because it isn't a serious movie. My copy had a television quality to it. I wonder if it was a kine-scope. Anyway, see this for the characters. Suspend your disbelief and go from there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Roger Corman's 1959 movie about the 1950's Beatnik Generation and a guy who just didn't fit into that exclusive group of artists and intellectuals. Until he found a talent, that he didn't know that he had, that in no time at all made him world famous.Being a busboy at this beatnik café, The Yellow Door, in Greenwich Village shy and nerdy Walter Paisley, Dick Miller, could only hope to become part of the gang of free living loving and thinking beatniks who patronizes that establishment. Watching and listening to all the great ideas poems and music by the many great minds who spend their time at the hip and swinging Yellow Door Café Walter can only hope that their brilliance would one day rub off on him.Depressed at the thought that he just about reached his epitome in life as a busboy, and not being that good at it either, Walter finally hears his call one evening in hearing his landlady's cat stuck inside his wall. It's then that Walter in his confused state of mind tries to free the trapped cat with an icepick. The icepick eventually punchers and kills the cat, Frankie, but it also gives Walter, who's playing around with what looks like "Silly Puddy", an idea of hiding the animal's body. Covering it with clay Walter later tries to pawn off the dead and entombed, in clay, feline to his boss Leonard de Santis, Antony Carbone, as a sculpture that he created.The sight of the cat sculpture, with an icepick stuck in it, just drove de Santis and everyone else at the café wild. This has to be one of the greatest works of art since the the construction of the Eiffel Tower! Everyone including the café poet laureate Maxwell H. Block,Julian Burton, who wouldn't give poor Walter the time of day is now so enamored by his work and talent that he hold Walter, who thinks the world of Maxwell, up as an example of being the ultimate achievement in the long and bumpy road to human creativity and perfection.As one would expect Walter's blessing, as an artist, in the end turned out to be a curse in making him both swell headed as well as homicidal in creating future works of art. Being slipped an envelope of heroin by one of his now many admirers the goofy and incoherent Naolia, Jhean Burton, Walter is later confronted in his shabby apartment by the undercover cop who saw the transaction Officer Lou Raby, Bert Convy. About to arrest the totally innocent man, how the hell did he know what Naolia slipped him was dope, Raby is smashed over the head with a frying pan by an hysterical Walter killing him.Walter now uses his new found talent to not only cover up his crime but cover up the dead Officer Raby, with clay, as well. Going on a murder spree in creating more works of art, clay coated human cadavers, Walter plans to kill all those who used to kick him around when he was just a lowly busboy. Walter's next victim is the arrogant and sarcastic Alice,Judy Bamber, who still thinks that he a no-talent fraud. That low opinion of himself by Alice in the end not only hurt Walter's very sensitive feeling but ended up hurting her as well; she became Walters next artistic masterpiece.***SPOILER ALERT***The end for the by now maniacal, who was so sweet harmless and likable in the beginning, Walter Pailey came at his own hand. Even with all his talent and popularity Walter still couldn't get his fellow café worker the pretty waitress Carla, Barboura Morris,to both fall in love and marry him. It's not that Walter wasn't suffering from being rejected, as her husband and lover, by Carla it was that he felt that now being the big man that he is she rejected not only him but his work as an artist as well! That in effect demanded from him immediate and deadly payback. It was that now that Walter finally made a name for himself as a world renowned artist and sculptor he was treated by his love from afar Carla as the simple-minded adolescent, Carla looked down at Walter as if he were her kid or baby brother, that he really is! That in the end finally drove the very unstable Walter over the edge together with his both promising and murderous future in the world of Art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Beatnik murder comedy I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins in a beatnik coffee house where the customers love to listen to bad poetry and revel in their own senses of self-importance! In this locale, we have Dick Miller who is a somewhat simple-minded waiter who desperately wants to fit in but is mostly laughed at by the stupid customers. After accidentally committing a murder AND wanting to fit in, Miller becomes an artist by covering a hapless cat with clay. Well, these self-absorbed boobs were amazed at the sculpture and proclaimed Miller's genius--not knowing that a REAL cat resided within. But, needing to produce more "great works of art", he feels compelled to kill humans for the sake of art. Fortunately, as his first human victim he chooses Bert Convey--not a bad choice, really, as I never particularly liked this 1970s game-show regular and frequent guest on The Love Boat! While this is NOT a great film by any objective standard, I can see why due to its oddness and silliness that it's become a cult favorite. As you would expect from early Roger Corman films, the budget is negligible and the film was designed for drive-in crowds (i.e., 1950s teenagers), so you know it can't be especially deep. However, considering just how low the expectations should be for such a small film, it was a pleasant surprise--offering excellent writing, a great sense of humor and generally decent acting. While it isn't nearly as silly or as fun as the original LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (which co-starred Dick Miller), it does have some similarities and is well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dick Miller in a lead role: perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen Roger Corman's and Joe Dante's movies, then you probably recognize Dick Miller. That husky scowling guy with a heavy New York accent appeared in many of Corman's movies and has appeared in all of Dante's movies. In "A Bucket of Blood", he gets what may have been his only lead role. He plays Walter Paisley*, an envious-of-the-beatniks waiter who kills people, covers their bodies in clay, and presents it as art.Yep, that sounds like a Roger Corman movie, and he made a neat one here. It's hard to tell whether they were idealizing beatniks or mocking them, but the movie's enjoyable nonetheless. And there's one scene which I bet that all the teenage boys really liked when the movie first came out (you'll know it when you see it). A really cool flick.FYI: Dick Miller often plays characters named Walter Paisley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter is a strange, shy bus boy who lives an apartment with a cat in the wall. When his cat dies, it inspires him (in a strange way) to make a sculpture of a cat. You'll never guess what else inspires Walter's sculptures.When Leonard finds out about Walters sculptures, the look on his face is priceless. Leonard has to sit in a chair to keep from fainting while Carla raves about him.The movie has an excellent beat-nik theme to it with excellent music and poetry to match and another great thing about this movie is that it doesn't go on and on. It's short and it has the most perfect ending.So if you are looking for a really strange movie, go down and see this bucket of bloody madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Bucket of Blood" is first Black Comedy from Corman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before there was "The Little Shop of Horrors," there was "A Bucket of Blood" a year earlier. Dick Miller, the hungry flower-eater in the former film is the star of "A Bucket..." He plays Walter Paisley, an inept moronic busboy who works at a very hip beatnik coffee shop and dreams of becoming one of the artists who frequent the establishment. Through a quirk of fate, it doesn't take very long before Walter joins this select group of pretentious phonies. He accidentally kills his landlady's cat and then covers it with plaster to hide his boneheaded mistake. When this "masterpiece" somehow makes its way to the beatnik haunt, Walter is soon hailed as the next great sculptor of the 20th century. Carla (played by Barboura Morris) becomes his chief benefactor and enthusiastically encourages him to take up sculpture as a career. But for Walter to create more "great art," he needs more dead bodies. Future game-show host Burt Convy is unfortunately next on the list. The body count piles up until Walter is finally revealed for what he really is: not only a complete idiot, but a criminally insane one. "A Bucket of Blood" is played mostly for laughs by director Roger Corman, and with its shoestring budget, he really has no choice. Ed Nelson, later of "Peyton Place," shows up as a nosy cop investigating the demise of poor Mr. Convy. I don't think Ed ever wanted this one to pop up on his resume. Lead actor Dick Miller was assigned to mostly bit parts after this "classic" although he later appeared in the original "Terminator" as the fellow who sells firearms to the wrong guy. Ms. Morris, who had some potential as an actress, died relatively young. Of course, Corman went on to make a slew of biker movies and adapted a number of Edgar Allan Poe works that probably made that literary master roll over in his own grave. But longevity has a way of making one respectable. Corman is now hailed as a great innovator of the cinema and was recently featured on TCM. I guess if you can make a movie like "A Bucket of Blood" in less than a week and for $50,000, you deserve some notoriety. Yes, Corman was the king of the "B" movies in the 1960s. But he never made anything that came within a country mile of an "A" film. When all is said and done, Corman will probably be best remembered for being the first director to give Jack Nicholson a role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're cruising through the cable channel listings and see this title pop up, how can you give it a pass? Especially when the station presenting it is Turner Classics - they know an awful lot about movies, don't they? This turned out to be another Roger Corman directed, shoestring budget film that's just off-kilter enough to make it a minor cult classic.I thought Dick Miller was perfect for the role of Walter Paisley, trying hard but never succeeding in the beatnik art world until he produces an eye catching sculpture courtesy of his landlady's dead cat. It was pretty convenient that when feline Frankie was pulled out from behind the wall, rigormortis had already set in after only the couple of seconds it took to break through it. I'm pretty sure we're not supposed to wonder how the cat got in there in the first place.Well the Yellow Door Café got it's new artistic wunderkind and it wouldn't take long for the astute viewer to figure out how Walter would make an even bigger splash on the beat scene. If the murders weren't so gruesome, this story could have been an episode on any number of anthology shows of the era like 'The Twilight Zone', 'Thriller' or even 'Way Out', though the better venue might have been 'Tales From the Crypt' a few decades down the road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B film of comedy, crime and horror doesn't click</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dick Miller isn't exactly threatening as Walter Paisley in "A Bucket of Blood." And that is the only aspect of this film that makes it somewhat tolerable. Miller was a good actor for the types of characters he played over a long Hollywood career. Here, he underplays his role to perfection. The rest of the roles are so-so at best. The plot is OK but the screenplay isn't very good. And the direction is weak. The set and technical values of the film give it the appearance and feel of what the film was at the time. It was a "B" film then, and remains a poor one today. It takes superb talent to make a good movie that combines comedy, crime and horror. "A Bucket of Blood" missed the talent on all levels, except for Dick Miller in his role as Walter.</fullReview>

The cat was covered in plaster to cover up the evidence. It is considered "brilliant" art and highly praised... soon after people began to disappear and more "brilliant" works of art appear.This is a pretty good film to kick back and enjoy for a fun watch one boring afternoon.

		<fullReview>Cult favorite Dick Miller has his finest hour here as beatnik murderer Walter Paisley. Directed by Roger Corman with a script by Charles Griffith, it's a brilliant little dark comedy. Walter Paisley is a simple-minded busboy at a café frequented by beatniks who desperately wants to be an artist. Despite his seeming lack of talent, he soon finds acclaim as a sculptor. The problem is his sculptures are actually just dead bodies encased in plaster. The cast includes Ed Nelson, Bert Convy, Anthony Carbone, and beautiful Barboura Morris. Julian Burton's turn as a pompous beat poet is terrific. But the movie belongs to Dick Miller, who's such a treat to watch. Given that it's Corman, the whole thing was shot on the quick and cheap, which shows in the production (look at that obviously stuffed cat they used for the kitty death scene). A lot of the laughs come from the many jabs at the pretentious art-house types. It's a timeless bit of satire since, while the trends and styles may have changed, these types are still around today. This one is often spoken of as the warm-up before Corman and Griffith's classic Little Shop of Horrors (also featuring Dick Miller). But I think it's just as funny as that film, if maybe not as creative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corman's gem of a black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is often the case, when you sit through a whole number of cheesy, cheap and poor-quality movies, you'll generally find one diamond in the rough. One classic in the otherwise forgettables. A BUCKET OF BLOOD is such a film, which is miles above the earlier schlocky sci-fi/horror flicks that Corman either produced or directed in the late '50s, before colour and Edgar Allan Poe came along. The saving grace here is the great sense of humour in the production, from the often satirically witty script to the depictions of the most amusing "beatnik" culture. Even the murders and deaths which are a major part of the film have an element of black, macabre comedy to them and the film as a whole is a hoot.Dick Miller stars as Walter Paisley, a mild-manner and put-open waiter, immediately a type you feel sorry for. When he actually kills a cat which is stuck in his wall, he decides to cover its body in plaster and immediately wins the respect of his peers. It's not long before he becomes unhinged and human victims suffer for his art, and inevitably he is found out, hunted down and... well, I won't spoil the ending, other than to say it's totally expected but still exciting and done with style. Miller is a real strength as Paisley, and it's kind of a shame his career dwindled in the doldrums before Joe Dante found himself and gave him a new lease of life. You get the idea from this that Miller is a real nice guy, just like his character, and despite the many murders he commits you can't help loving him.A BUCKET OF BLOOD, despite the title, isn't really a horror film. It's a comedy with horrific overtones, for instance in the macabre statues that Paisley makes or the murders themselves, which whilst offscreen are still suitably gruesome. The film is also about a loner trying desperately to fit into society and being driven to extreme lengths in his desire to do so, and as such can be applied to many real-life situations. In this way it can also reach out and touch the audience. Although the black-and-white subtracts somewhat in a film desperately crying out for colour, this is a well-shot, well-directed movie, even if it was made on the cheap in however many days. Many "horror as art" style movies and unofficial remakes have followed, but so far none have equalled this short, straightforward cinematic gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bucket of Blood Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>his movie made by Roger Corman in 1959 starts off with a guy doing poetry in an old coffee shop. The main character is a busboy named Walter, played by Dick Miller. Also there's an undercover cop that hangs out out at the coffee shop, as a way to scope out criminals.Walter tries to do sculptures at but doesn't quite know what to do. Until he tries to get a cat out of his wall but ends up killing it. He decides to sculpt over the cat and tries to put it in the coffee shop. The people seem to like the sculpture even though it doesn't seem to stink. Also the cat would be heavy even with clay on it. Everyone at the coffee shop seems to like it but the undercover cop is suspicious about it.This woman at the coffee shop gives Walter a little tube of something and he takes it with him. A guy then follows him to his home and tells him he's an undercover cop. Also that he's under arrest for position of heroine since that's what was in the tube. Walter ends up killing him since he doesn't want to go so he kills him.The owner of the coffee shop finds out Walter's first sculpture was fake when it falls. He tries to call the cops but the buyer gives him a lot of money for it. Walter then shows the owner and this girl he likes his new sculpture. Which is the cop guy just sculpted over and the girl suggests a collection of his sculptures. Walter then is happy when he gets money for his sculptures and that he's an artist, even though he murdered someone.Walter then kills a woman at his home after a fight they had at the coffee shop then sculpts over her as well. All the coffee shop people like him and like more sculptures. So he ends up killing a random guy for another sculpture.Walter then one night asks the girl she likes to marry him but she refuses. He then asks to sculpt her after his collection exhibit show and she find out they're fake and people. After Walter chases the girl the people at the art show find out the sculptures are people as well. The undercover cop and some of the coffee shop people chase Walter and try to find him.At the end he hears the voices of the people he murders and at his home he still hears them. So he ends up hanging himself as his greatest work and to stop. This movie seems pretty good for a Roger Corman movie and it's mostly a black comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awkward and possibly mentally challenged, Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) is desperate for love and respect. He works at a hipster cafe frequented by impossibly pretentious people and yearns to fit in. He is rejected as staid and hopelessly straight by its patrons and is largely viewed with pity. One day, he stumbles across a devilish way to make realistic sculptures, something he can't do ordinarily and his work is a big hit at the cafe. Walter's never had adulation and regard like this before and he realizes this is his ticket to popularity. How fully he realizes this becomes dreadfully clear as the film goes on. This is a pitch black satire of the cluelessness of hipsters. The cafe's owner Leonard de Santis (Anthony Carbone, who looks remarkably like Humphrey Bogart) realizes what a monster Walter is but doesn't intervene right away. Walter is a remarkable mix of slow and lonely and this makes him ripe for the the depredations to which he increasingly succumbs. In this day and age a decent attorney would claim that Walter was not fully responsible for his actions because of his low IQ, but I don't imagine that claim would have held up as well in 1959.In any case, Walter's fame grows as he continues to lose it. The hipsters don't smell a rat. Corman obviously takes great glee in mocking this. The clueless hipster is most perfectly embodied by Maxwell (an excellent, stentorian Julian Brock), a beard-wearing, abstract poet who is so enchanted by Walter's "work" that he holds a party in his honor and writes a poem for him!The beautifully ironic thing about this film is that the one character who most sees through Walter's inability as a sculptor is the most cold-eyed and callous character, Alice (Judy Bamber). She questions Walter's ability and by that time he is so well-regarded that his adoring fans savage HER for her lack of sophistication! That she and the relatively cool- headed cafe owner Leonard are the only ones who see through Walter is hilarious. Corman apparently shot this film in 5 days and for $50,000 and it's only 66 minutes long, but what a punch it packs! A scabrously funny script, some excellent acting, and no happy ending. If you like your comedy dark, this is one for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dick Miller's Finest Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody in the film-making industry ever got more out of less than the legendary Roger Corman, and "A Bucket of Blood" is a prime example of his work. Granted, the movie was made in five days on a budget of $50,000. Yes, there are no big-name stars in the cast. Nevertheless, I have seen many, many movies produced on enormous budgets, and with "A- List" casts, that are far less entertaining than A.B.O.B. "A Bucket of Blood" was also unquestionably Dick Miller's finest hour. Miller plays Walter Paisley, a nebbish of a busboy working in a hip coffee shop frequented by the sort of arty "Beatnik" types well-known in the 1950s. Walter desperately wants to belong to the arty beat crowd, but he lacks both the intellect and the talent. Nevertheless, he manages to stumble upon a means of artistic expression that gains him acceptance, at lest for a while. Only the jaded café owner suspects what Walter has really been up to, but he is unwilling to let on because of the high prices he is getting for selling Walter's "art".This film works because everybody in it seemed to have been having as much fun making it as the viewer has seeing it. the movie also works because it is something most horror movies nowadays are not, it is clever and well-written. In fact, apart from anything else, A.B.O.B. is worth seeing for its' juicy satire of the 1950s "Beat" culture alone, something that was very current at the time the movie was made, but which has long disappeared today."A Bucket of Blood" was made during the same period, and featured many of the same cast members, as Roger Corman's more-famous movie, "The Little Shop of Horrors". Both include the same mix of horror and humor, and there is no doubt that fans of T.L.S.O.H. would enjoy A.B.O.B. equally much. The two would make a great double-feature, or a great double-release on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many of Roger Corman's movies were low budget, campy affairs and so this one could easily be written off if not for the champion performance by Dick Miller who really sells the character of Walter Paisley. Walter is a simple minded busboy who aspires to be one of the gang with the artists and beatniks who hang out at his diner. He brings home a lump of clay and an accident with his landlady's cat provides inspiration for a 'sculpture' that gains Walter acclaim among the local artists. It doesn't take long before Walter's boss, played by Antony Carbone, figures out Walter's secret and becomes very nervous when Walter unveils his newest statues, Murdered Man and Strangled Woman. A Bucket of Blood was filmed in five days on the same set that would become The Little Shop of Horrors. House of Usher is my favorite Corman film but this has become my new 2nd favorite. The performances are all solid, Dick Miller is brilliant, the quick pacing and genuinely creepy subject matter all combine to make a B movie masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Bucket of Blood" is a horror movie with a light touch, and it has some fine noirish photography toward the end. It has no blood in it and no bucket of blood in it. The title is a metaphor.The main plot device goes back to "Mystery of the Wax Museum" from 1933.The setting is a beatnik coffee house in which Dick Miller is a whining and irritating busboy. He works in clay in his sloppy rundown apartment, with no success, until he accidentally kills the landlady's cat and turns it into a sculpture a la Lionel Atwill. It's not long before he progresses to larger works and greater acclaim.Although death is passed over lightly and one cannot take the proceedings too seriously, still director Corman skillfully balances the movie so that it does not fall into parody nor rises into outright terror, that is, up to the final act which starts with something more gruesome.Looked upon as a mystery and as the tale of an obsessed and twisted sculptor, or a man whom people have looked down upon and wants acceptance and goes some lengths to get it, this is actually quite a nice film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightfully sly and amusing horror black comedy gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meek simpleton busboy Walter Paisley (a marvelous performance by the incomparable Dick Miller) wants to be just as hip and cool as the shallow and self-conscious regulars at the coffeehouse he works at. After accidentally killing his nosy landlady's cat, Walter covers the kitty's corpse with clay and passes it off as a sculpture. Hailed as a brilliant "realistic" artist by the beatnik crowd, Paisley alas finds out he has to start killing people in order to create new sculptures and retain his newfound celebrity status. Director Roger Corman works wonders on an extremely low budget: the pace moves along at a constant snappy clip, the tone is appropriately dark and sardonic, yet lighthearted and engaging, and the seedy production values actually add to the overall underlying sense of despair and desperation. Charles B. Griffith's wickedly witty script pokes spot-on scathing fun at such worthy topics as fame, success, wealth, and the incredibly superficial pretentiousness of the whole 50's beatnik scene (said scene is fiercely skewered with a deliciously malicious satirical glee that's a true savagely hilarious hoot to behold). Miller easily holds the entire picture with his inspired central portrayal: He not only succeeds in making Walter both funny and sympathetic, but also touching and ultimately quite tragic as the ultimate example of a man driven to ruthless extremes to achieve his aspirations. Kudos are also in order for the able acting by the rest of the cast, with especially stand-out work by Barboura Morris as the sweet Carla, Antony Carbone as suave, posturing coffeehouse owner Leonard de Santis, Julian Burton as pompous poet Maxwell H. Brook, Ed Nelson as snoopy undercover cop Art Lacroix, Judy Bamber as snippy, obnoxious model Alice, and Bert Convy as pesky narc Lou Raby. Bruno Ve Sota has a nice minor part as an art collector with money to burn. Fred Katz's groovy score does the right-on jazzy trick. Jacques R. Marquette's sharp cinematography makes nifty occasional use of snazzy fades and dissolves. Wholly deserving of its substantial cult classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stinging indictment of the culture of celebrity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It probably helped that I saw "The Bloody Brood", a snobby and rather pretentious film that takes itself and the Beatnik culture a little too seriously. "A Bucket of Blood" is Roger Corman's take on these faux "artists" and gets to the heart of what lengths some people will go to attain such temporary fame. Walter Paisley, played masterfully by long time character actor Dick Miller, is such a person as he works his way up from a busboy who is ridiculed by the hipsters at the Yellow Door where his boss Leonard constantly reprimands him for talking to the guests to an overnight sensation. Miller will continue to employ the moniker Walter Paisley in future films as well. When Walter accidentally kills his cat he encases it in clay which makes it appear to those not in the know that Walter in fact sculpted a life-like rendition. When Leonard agrees to put his sculpture on display at the cafe they both work at it becomes an instant hit winning the approval of windbag Maxwell Brock who is the local beat poet artiste. Soon Walter is tasked with finding his next model which comes in the form of undercover cop Lou Raby (actor and future game show host Burt Convy) who attempts to arrest Walter on a mistaken drug charge. Walter kills him thus making Lou the first of his human sculptures that merely titillates the masses even more. When Leonard finds out the truth he suppresses it in order to cash in on a tasteless art dealer who will pay handsomely for Walter's work. This provides the comic relief as every time Leonard sees Walter's latest project he has to keep himself upright so as not to keel over from the shock. It's not long before Walter begins looking and acting the part of a highbrow virtuoso who becomes just as desperate for attention as his need for more "inspiration". A rather well done dark comedy from Roger Corman who was producing mostly trash like "Attack of the Giant Leeches" during this same time period. The acting is solid throughout the cast especially Julian Burton who seemed to relish his performance as the pompous Maxwell. It's amazing how sophisticated we've become in society in the sixty years since this movie came out. Instead of killing people for fame you can just star in your own porno. Instant notoriety. We've come a long way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I watched and dug Roger Corman's A Bucket of Blood once again, man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this classic Roger Corman movie for the second time and it's even more funny and blackly entertaining than I remember it. Corman and screenwriter Charles B. Griffith waste no time getting to the good stuff as Walter Paisley (Dick Miller), a busboy at a beatnik café, finds ways to get accepted as part of a group that includes poet Maxwell H. Brock (Julian Burton), owner Leonard de Santis (Antony Carbone), and the woman he has a crush on-Carla (the stunningly exquisite Barboura Morris). Lots of funny lines concerning murder and art and how pretentious the whole art scene is. And just dig Fred Katz' jazzy score! So on that note, A Bucket of Blood comes highly recommended, man! P.S. I have to note that like supporting player Bruno Ve Sota (credited here as Ve Soto), Griffith was a native of my birthtown of Chicago, Ill. Also singer Alex Hassilev graduated from the University of Chicago. Ed Nelson was born in New Orleans, La., which is just a two-hour drive from my current hometown of Baton Rouge. And the landlady is played by Myrtle Vail (credited as Damerel), who's Griffith's grandmother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good cheesy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this 66 minute flick quite amusing. The acting isn't even that bad for a film like this. The effects in some places are so awful (like the dead cat) that it actually adds to it's charm. This is the only role I have ever seen Dick Miller play a real nerdy character. Miller plays Walter Paisley, a nerdy busboy who is jealous of the talent and popularity of its artistic regulars. But after accidentally killing his annoying landlady's cat and hiding it in clay, his life changes. He shows off his work at his job and is quickly declared a great sculptor. His female interest at work even notices him but soon she begs to see more of his work. Walter realizes he can't really sculpt and needs more "bodies" to cover with clay. This movie is very similar to "The Little Shop of Horrors" which received a lot more attention. Charles Griffith wrote both screenplays and it shows. I however find this little movie to be just as charming. A good Corman flick if you're into this kind of thing. As a fun little side note -- At the time of its original release there was a promotion in the newspaper that made the offer, "If You Bring In A Bucket Of Blood To Your Local Theater, You Will Be Given One Free Admission." I hope no one complied...lol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first scene with the beat poet declaiming away, this satirical horror film grabs ones' attention for the rest of its 60 minute running time. Made during the late 50's, the time of folk songs, beatniks and coffee houses this black and white Roger Corman film is a somewhat comedic "House of Wax". A bullied bus boy in a coffee house tries his hand at sculpture. By accident he kills the neighbor's cat. Next he turns up back at the coffee house with a perfect, life size sculpture of a dead cat. The artsy crowd pronounces it brilliant. A narc follows him home to his apartment. His next work is a life size dead man. You can see where all this is going. "Bucket of Blood" (bad title) works because Corman has hired a great cast and directs in his usual straightforward fashion. It contains a not-to- subtle ridiculing of the art scene where supposedly profound intelligentsia declares something "the next big thing" even though some may expect that they are exhibiting corpses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much in the way of buckets or blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Paisley, a simple busboy at at the local café hangout for Beatniks, aspires to join the group of pretentious free spirits. When he covers a dead cat in clay and presents it as 'art', his dreams of being a respected artist start to take shape. His new friends encourage him to create more, and his desire to be accepted drives him to murder in order to complete a whole exhibition of 'sculptures'. Inevitably Walter is eventually exposed for the murderer he is and comes to a sad and bitter end.The title is very misleading, there is not much in the way of buckets or blood to be found. Unfortunately, what this movie has in abundance is relentless free-form jazz which the film score defaults to at every opportunity! It may serve to increase viewing tension, but it mostly just irritates. Dick Miller gives the only performance worthy of mention, although some of the 'performances' in the café are amusing. As satirical as the portrayals of the various Beatnik types are, most are just tediously annoying. The script is not the best although some of the parodic Beatnik dialogue manages to raise the occasional dry smirk; mostly by the café's resident Beat poet. The story itself is entertaining in a rather clichéd way. It actually reminds me a lot of 'Colour Me Blood Red' which manages to be a bit more honest (at least it's title is more representative of what it is!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Bucket Of Blood is Roger Corman's ode to the beatnik scene of the late Fifties, the first outcropping of the counterculture. It's also laced with a little bit of Edgar Allan Poe.Dick Miller who is best remembered for owning the kid's favorite hangout in the TV series Fame plays young Walter who is a busboy in another favorite café, this one favored by the beatniks and their pretensions to art. Poor Miller wants to fit in really bad, probably in high school he would have given anything to fit in with the cool kids. The beatniks laugh at him.But when he accidentally kills his landlady's cat and then immortalizes it in plaster, the preserved pussy actually gets him noticed as an sculptor with a real eye for anatomy. What to do, but go with the flow and move on to human subjects. It's like he's invented a new art form.Corman certainly didn't have much of a budget and in his early days it was a hit or miss proposition with his films. Every now and then Corman did produce a classic, but A Bucket Of Blood isn't one of them.As for the ending it is really taken from The Tell Tale Heart. Crazy Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine for what it is, but not that spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Bucket of Blood" isn't all that terrible, but it's still watchable.**SPOILERS**Working as a busboy, Walter Paisley, (Dick Miller) finds that the local beatniks who inhabit the café offer him little respect. As he continues with his artistic endeavors, he finally makes a sculpture that Leonard de Santis, (Antony Carbone) the head of the café manages to approve of, and soon wins the admiration of Carla, (Barboura Morris) a local inhabitant. Soon enraptured with the attention and adulation heaped onto his work, he continues making sculptures, winning over even more fans of his work. When they start to notice that these resemble mysteriously vanished patrons and other nearby locals, they start to question what the sculptures really are, and when the horrible secret is revealed, they try to stop him what he's doing.The Good News: This one here wasn't that bad, and did have a few good moments. The fact that this one is short is quite nice, as it doesn't take a whole lot to really make for some great parts as it is over quite quickly rather than dragging itself out. That is a big plus, as it allows the film to get on to a new set-piece before any real harm can be done. There's also the film's rather fun set-pieces that inspire the works, which are pretty high for the time, as several of them are actively seen to have been murdered for the art. The best of these is the construction site one, which actually puts a little action into it and a couple of rather exciting shots that make it a little tenser than the others. The actual creation of the sculptures is really cool, as their shown to be covered in the plaster for the sculptures, which is what really improves this one. There's also the rather fun finale, which is rather fun and exciting as the film moves along into a somewhat lengthy piece about what's going to happen, and it ends on a macabre joke that sends out a good note. These here are it's good points.The Bad News: There's very little wrong here, but they are pretty big. The main one here is that there's very little given as to why it would matter why the acceptance of the group is a wanted ideal. There's never been any indication throughout that it was something that could've been obtained as they pretty much just ignore or belittle every single time he has something he wants to share, and then to make a singular sculpture and become a king to their clique doesn't hold up as nothing was said about why he wanted it. Working in the shop isn't enough explanation, and it is a really confusing touch. The other point that sticks out is why no one failed to notice all the rapidly increasing body count of the regulars, and for them to not be worrisome about it strikes as odd. The last flaw is that, outside of the ending, the film doesn't really have a whole lot that sticks out in it, meaning that the short running time may feel a little longer due to the fact that it's a very dialog-heavy film that isn't really filled with things that will appeal to those wanting a little more excitement from the film. Otherwise, this one here isn't that bad.The Final Verdict: A fun, harmless romp without a whole lot going for it or against it, leaving this one with a relatively neutral flavor that may or may not appeal to all out there. Give it a chance for the Corman fans, have an interest in the story or the lifestyle, while others won't have a whole lot for this one.Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a great admirer of Roger Corman ever since I first saw his brilliant Poe-cycle starring the great Vincent Price. These Poe-themed films have to be regarded as a true highlight of Gothic Horror cinema and the cycle's masterpieces "Pit And The Pendulum" (1961), "The Haunted Palace" (1963) and "The Masque Of The Red Death" (1964) rank high in my personal all-time favorite list. That being said, Corman's "A Bucket Of Blood" of 1958 is a great piece of satirical Horror, and another proof that Corman is a great director.Walter Paisley (greatly played by Dick Miller) is a clumsy and naive guy working as a busboy in an artist's café. Walter, who craves for becoming an artist and is unfortunately incredibly untalented, is constantly made fun of by the café's arrogant client?le. The only exception is arts enthusiast Carla (Barboura Morris), who treats Walter friendly, and whom he secretly loves. Walter has almost given up his dream of becoming a great artist, until one day, when he accidental kills his landlady's cat and has an idea...Horror lover's can't help but see resemblances to the Vincent Price classic "House Of Wax" of 1953. These resemblances are obvious, but nevertheless, "A Bucket Of Blood" has its very own style and is very original in all of its aspects. This is a movie with a great sense of humor and an amazing sense for the macabre. The way this movie ridicules the arrogance of some modern artists (without ridiculing modern art itself) is a true joy to see, and when this movie was made in 1958 it must have appeared incredibly macabre. Dick Miller's leading performance is excellent and no one could have fit better in the role of Walter Paisley than Miller did. A movie with an excellent sense of dark humor in its purest form, "A Bucket Of Blood" is a great film that should not be missed by fans of Horror and Black Comedy. Highly Recommended! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow I liked this film, it had a good plot which kept me in interest about a bar busboy that was a nobody and soon became a somebody by killing animals and people and making them into works of art displaying them for the bar patrons and anybody else with that interest to see. This movie had a "Twighlight Zone" feel to it and I kept thinking that for some reason this film may have once been an episode of "Twighlight Zone" and someone might have scrapped it off and made it into one movie. The movie was entertaining all except for the annoying jazz music playing in the background which reminded me of some of Hitchcocks episodes in some of his shows. It's worth a watch, it's not the greatest but it is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) is a dim-witted busboy at the beatnik café The Yellow Door. He tries to make a clay sculpture at home. He hears Frankie the cat in his wall. He tries to get him out using a knife and accidentally kills him. He covers the cat with clay and he becomes the toast of the club with his amazing cat 'sculpture'. This sets him off on a serious of killings and cover-ups using his clay.It has some hilarious stuff with the slow innocent Walter. Director Roger Corman is making fun of the beatnik culture. Actually I don't find the beatnik stuff that funny and the music rather annoying. I guess you have to experience it at the time to truly feel the jokes. Walter turning evil isn't scary but it is good solid old-fashion horror. This is relatively well made despite its low budget.</fullReview>

At home, Mr. Miller is frustrated in his attempts to be a sculptor when the landlady's cat "Frankie" gets caught in his wall and keeps meowing. In trying to free the cat, Miller accidentally stabs it to death. Inspired by director Roger Corman, Miller covers the animal in clay and brings the resulting sculpture "Dead Cat" to work. Miller is proclaimed a "real artist" for his "Dead Cat" art, and is finally accepted by the Bohemian crowd. His next completed "Murdered Man" is also a hit, but Miller finds sacrificing life for art to be increasingly difficult...****** A Bucket of Blood (10/21/59) Roger Corman ~ Dick Miller, Barboura Morris, Anthony Carbone, Julian Burton</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Corman's "A Bucket of Blood" is disputedly the first film in the black comedy genre. It's a supremely silly, but mindlessly entertaining diversion. Anyone who can't smile at some of this stuff has a heart of stone.The "plot", if you could call it that, revolves around a nebbish busboy (Dick Miller) who works at a beatnik cafe and longs for popularity. He is mostly abused. By accident, he kills the landlady's cat and covers the corpse in clay. He passes it off as his new sculpture "Dead Cat". Don't accuse me of spoiling the story; you were expecting a sweeping adventure epic? With a title like "A Bucket of Blood", you can pretty much know what to expect.But we don't watch movies like "A Bucket of Blood" for the plot. We watch it for its' offbeat qualities such as corny acting and its' mood (of overall silliness)This film is slick trash and if you can't recognize it as such, you shouldn't be watching this film. Those who can recognize great trash, you know who you are.*** out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just what is it exactly that makes a film a cult favourite? There are hundreds ? probably thousands ? of films listed on this site that are no better nor worse than this early Corman flick, but which have a rating hovering somewhere around the 2.5 to 3.0 mark while this enjoys a laughable 6.8. Make no mistake about it, this is a bad movie that offers little in the way of entertainment other than giving the viewer the opportunity to ridicule the beatnik culture it portrays. Miller is OK as Walter Paisley, the doormat of a busboy who accidentally launches twin careers of sculptor and serial-killer, but the rest of the acting is pretty miserable. And, while there is an element of humour there, I get the feeling that it isn't anywhere near as deliberate and self-knowing as some would have us believe. There's the basis of a good story but bad sets, bad lighting, bad direction, bad acting and a lightning quick shoot time means that any potential is squandered.Yeah, it might be fun for those twisted individuals who get a kick out of watching bad flicks but, at the end of the day, that's all this is: a very bad flick, rescued from the obscurity it deserves by the subsequent careers of its leading man and director...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meek and mild Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) is a busboy at a beatniks club. He desperately wants to be an artist but doesn't have the nerve...or talent. One night he accidentally kills a cat. He covers it with clay and presents it as his creation. Immediately he becomes famous...but has to make more statutes...This was pretty extreme for its time and considered pretty sick by most critics. Now it comes across as laughably tame and VERY dated (the beatnik talk sounds pretty stupid and pointless now). It was made on no budget (you can tell) and with the sole exception of Miller no one is good. Even at 66 minutes I was bored.Still, this is considered a classic and should be seen for Miller's acting alone and a few good moments here and there. Also Miller used his characters name here in many other films over the years. If you're into horror movies (like me) you might get a kick out of that. But it still doesn't make this a very good movie. I can truthfully only give it a 6.</fullReview>
