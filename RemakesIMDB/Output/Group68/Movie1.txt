		<shortDescription>In The Shadow Of A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to make as much sense to remake a great movie like Brian DePalma's 1976 horror/suspense masterpiece CARRIE for television as it did to make a sequel of it in the form of THE RAGE: CARRIE 2 three years before, but that's what has been done. A lot of bells and whistles have been added to this television remake, but in the end this CARRIE is still in the shadow of the DePalma original.Angela Bettis (GIRL INTERRUPTED) has the unenviable task of stepping into the shoes (and the prom dress) of Sissy Spacek in the title role of a New England teen tortured at school by cruel classmates (because she doesn't belong) and at home by her religiously fanatical mother (Patricia Clarkson, in the Piper Laurie role). Soon, she discovers she has telekinetic powers; and when the most gruesome of gags is played on her on prom night, all bets are off.Though looking much more glazed in the eyes than Spacek ever did, Bettis gives a fairly good performance as Carrie; and Clarkson's portrayal of her uprighteous mother is much more low-key, but no less threatening, than Laurie's portrayal. The special effects, however obvious they might be, are also quite good. But in the end, the reputation of the 1976 original, with its combination of psychological horror and teen-angst drama, still hovers over this remake. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the pig's blood scene. It doesn't have the same jarring emotional impact this time around--not so much because we've seen it before, but because here it looks slightly laughable when the blood gets poured onto Bettis. Because of DePalma's use of slow-motion in the original, the blood hits Spacek like a tidal wave.I give the CARRIE remake a '6' just for trying. I only regret that its shortcomings as a film have less to do with its execution as a film than the fact that the original movie still resonates much more fully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're all Gonna Laugh at You"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the book and seen the original 1976 movie, numerous times. When I saw this advertised and heard that it followed the book, I knew I had to see it! It was interesting to see the book brought to life in a film. Even though it was modernized with Carrie making references to the internet, Chris using a cell phone, etc. I really enjoyed watching it, even though I still have to say that the original 1976 movie is still a classic! For some strange reason, during the prom scene where the blood is poured on Carrie, I was actually waiting to hear the famous line, "They're all gonna laugh at you!" That was such a nice touch in the original, but very difficult to duplicate. I also noticed in the credits that Jasmine Guy was in this film, but I looked and was not able to see her anywhere. The only thing I did not like is the fact with it being on regular television, the commercial breaks interrupted some of the good parts. Just when I was really into watching it, a commercial appears! Overall this movie was enjoyable to watch and to see a classic book and film come back. I am not much on remakes, but this one was not that bad. Still, nothing can hold a candle to the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique take on the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think everyone knows the story of Carrie. The strange innocent misfit who's teased mercilessly and maliciously by a few of her school peers. and develops her telekinetic powers to protect herself after a particularly cruel and humiliating prank is pulled on her.Well, I think I enjoyed this because it put a different spin on the original story. That is, the story is told after the fact in a series of interviews conducted by the police.The movie has a good cast and the script is good. The special effects, while used to good effect, aren't particularly 'special', but the camera work, particularly in the ballroom scene when everyone is panicking, is deplorable. I've taken better home movies. Still, if you can ignore that....Overall I really enjoyed this telemovie and would recommend it to anyone who wants a bit of a scare and to be entertained, and notI'll probably be burned at the stake for this too, but I preferred Angela Bettis charactisation of Carrie to Sissy Spaceks in the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you read the book, you know the remake was better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not care how many of you read this and think "What a moron." Because I am not, I am right. Anybody can call themself a Stephen King fan because they've seen all his movies. Well, if you've never read his books then you're not a Stephen King fan, you're a horror movie fan. I read Carrie for the first time when I was 10 years old. It was the scariest, most f'ed up book I had read. (Remember I was 10, before Carrie I read Goosebumps and Freckle Juice) And my dad told me there was a movie. I had heard of it before, of course. So, I rented it. Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, and John Travolta were good, but the thing is they were the hottest stars at the time. Travolta was a teen hunk from Kotter and Sissy was your "girl next door" type. The original is a classic, I will never deny that. It's one of the best horror movies of the 20th century. Even though the acting was superb, Spacek wasn't the perfect Carrie, because she is pretty. Carrie was awkward and weird looking. Bettis is attractive, but in a creepy sort of way. Clarkson was a much better Mrs. White, because Laurie portrayed this wild, gospel radio type woman yelling out Christian nonsense. Mrs. White was described in the book as a insane woman with a sane face. Okay, let's be honest, Travolta sucked in Carrie. He was playing the role he ALWAYS did in the late 70s, a stupid, pretty boy. The guy that played Nolan in the remake portrayed him as a insane, extremely psychopathic. And Chris and Billy's relationship in the original wasn't as convincing. In the book, they were kind of a match made in heaven, they were both sadistic and cruel people. The only things I have to say about the original is Amy Irving was a better Sue, and the original Miss Desjardins was better too (the gym teacher). All in all I thought the remake of Carrie wasn't as classic as the original, but was more according to the book and they picked the characters well. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I expected, but no replacement for the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To state that this new version of Carrie doesn't remotely compare with the original horror classic is to belabor the obvious, so I will leave that issue aside.However, I expected this movie to be simply garbage, like the recent "Rose Red", or dull and mediocre, like the TV remake of The Shining, and surprisingly, it was better than that.Making a remake of a classic film is usually inadvisable, but under the circumstances, this was an honest and decent rendition of Carrie. TV movies tend to be endlessly drawn out, with low proudction values, and this was better than average. Most of the credit goes, however to the casting. Most of the cast were a very competent group of actors who I think really gave it their best shot in creating a new angle on the Carrie story. Particular mention should be made of Angela Bettis in the title role. She tackled the daunting task of taking a part made very famous by someone else, and making it her own. Her Carrie is less a neurotic mess than Sissy Spacek', repressed and unhappy but still strong and with some guts. She was very sweet and vulnerable, and was often very touching, as when she was suddenly, out of the blue, asked to the prom by such a handsome, nice boy.One big disappointment was Patricia Clarkson as Mrs. White. The part was really reduced in scope in this version, and the actress played her in a very restrained and bland fashion. I can well imagine that it was decided that to replicate Piper Laurie's over the top baroque performance was inadvisable. The idea here was to have a more low key sinister approach. But the result was completely dull and uninteresting character that had less relevance to the story than it should have. So for a TV remake of a horror classic, I give it A for effort, with some very good elements to it. However, this is still a movie you will probably watch only once. The real Carrie, Brian DePalma's 1976 classic, is one that is always fun to watch again and again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>re: TxMike's post-Why not just watch DePalma's adaptation?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why not just watch DePalma's 1976 adaptation? While this remake was made for TV, which sometimes can brand a film as belonging to a lower class, it is a more faithful adaptation of King's novel. Have you read the novel? Many of the complaints you have about the "changes" made for the TV adaptation are major occurrences in the novel. Even the way in which the main action is interrupted by interviews, follows the structure of the book. While I like to judge a film adaptation of a novel separate from the novel itself and not on how well it sticks to the story, I found the flow of the novel much more interesting than the almost slasher genre quality of DePalma's film, and subsequently found the remake just as interesting. Pick up a copy...it's a quick easy read and maybe you'll see the remake in a whole new light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrie's third time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carrie was originally a nerdy girl who was tormented over and over. Next, she was a goth who was videotaped having sex. This time, she's an epileptic girl struggling with life as a whole. Instead of doing a third one, the people decided to do something that people would rather see- remake the original loosely and transform it into a polished version of the book. While I do love the original, this one is closer to the book. There are a mere three things that I hated- the ending was stupid and Patricia Clarkson was too toned down for the role. They should have gone with a direct clone of Piper Laurie's flawless version of the character. Also, th pig blood dumping scene sucked this time. Ironically, all of the original's blonde characters are brunette here, and vice versa. The ending sort of copied the graveyard sequence at the end of the first one, but isn't as scary. But as a whole, this third in a blooming series was quite good and worth a few watches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Really Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High school is a horrible place. Everyone is really cruel. The popular kids, pick on the nerds, the nerds dump on the popular kids, and the kids left in the middle, they pick on and make fun of the nerds and the popular kids. But there is always that one kid. The kid who sits at lunch by himself, he never says a word and boy does he get dumped on the most.That's why the Stephen King's classic CARRIE will always appeal to mass audiences. She's the quiet kid who's always getting picked on. It prays on our irrational fear of the one who is a little odd, but it also gives us a glimpse into our own hurt psyche. We've all been put upon in our lives. We've all be humiliated by the people around us, and we all wish we could gat back at out enemies.As I sat through the recent television remake of CARRIE, all I could think of is how I am Carrie, but I'm also the one who has destroyed people like Carrie. It's the human condition, I guess? It's that ever-present darkness we all have in our hearts. No matter how we try to suppress it.Angela Bettis (May) plays Carrie White, a high school senior with a legalistic mother and the whole world against her. She's quiet, introspective, and really naive about what's going on the world. So of course all the girls in school pick on her, and tease her. They are downright cruel at some points.Little does anyone know, but quiet Carrie has begun to develop weird powers. She can make things move using her mind. But when another prank goes wrong, Carrie goes medieval and takes no prisoners.Angela Bettis was born to play Carrie and she is great. She has this innocent and yet dangerous look about her. She gives Carrie this poised quirkiness that the film desperately needs. You can see how each humiliation wears away at her façade, and without Bettis's small but subtle character changes, this simple and yet so complex character would fall apart at its seems.I especially liked the scene in which she's waiting for her prom date Tommy (Tobias Mehler, Disturbing Behavior) to arrive. He's late, and she thinks she going to be stood up and as the minute's progress the furniture slowly begins to rise off the floor. That is a great sequence.The supporting cast also does a great job Patricia Clarkson's (Far From Heaven) performance, as Carrie mom is one of true evil and even a little sympathy. She generally cares for Carrie, too bad she's so bad at showing it to her daughter. To bad she's been duped into the lie that legalism can save your soul. I like that it has more dimensions than Brian Deplama's characterization of Carrie's mom in the original film.Rena Sofer (TV's ED) is also very good as Carrie's tough as nails gym teacher, one of Carrie's only supporters. She walks that thin line between feminine and bitchy without turning her character into a farce. I liked how she handled her gym class, when they obviously deserved worse, and I loved the small conversation she has with Carrie at the prom. Sofer is one great actress.Director David Carson (Star Trek: Generations) visual style is also refreshing. Much of the film is shot with stylized steady cam and disjointed camera angels. While many times this technique can be distracting. It works really well for this film, and is never distracting.My only qualm with this movie is pretty trite. Since it is a TV movie some sequences are a little choppy because of commercial breaks. I wished they had fixed some of the editing at these points for the DVD. Because I found it distracting that they would go to black only to come back to the same shot. It's also a tad overlong, and some sequences drag on merely to stretch the running time. But they are few and far between, so forget I even mentioned them.This new CARRIE is really good. It has a great cast, a nice visual sense, and aspires to do something new and different. I would recommend you see Deplama's film before you see this one. But don't let that discourage you from giving the new CARRIE a look.This is one of the best Made-For-TV movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of carrie through a 100 scariest movies list. I heard only about the telekinesis stuff and the prom scene. I first saw the original classic with sissy spasick (can't spell) and the next day and I honestly wasn't disappointed. The only problem with this film is it falls in the trap of crappy 2000-2006 cgi effects. The original I admit is a great film but it falls in the trap of weird choices in music (for example when the gym teacher is making the girls exercise). And the remake has some illogical scenes in it like when carrie is being revived with CPR. But if that's the biggest flaw than that really shouldn't be a problem. It goes into a lot of depth with the characters and it gives tommy a better personality than just the nice guy who takes her to prom. In both films it's evident he cares but in the remake he seems to care more. I can't explain it. And billy Nolan he is also a problem. In the original he is just stupid and as bonehead a guy as you would ever see. Whilst in the remake, he is freaking insane and he seems to change the personality by a lot. It's like the Texas chainsaw remake and the original. Both are so different and great in their own way. So both films are great and don't trash this one for being the remake of a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant re-calculation of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Stephen King remakes go, I tend to deTEST them. They always want to bastardize the original works, especially the literary works on which these movies are based.I loved the original "Carrie," with Sissy Spaseck and John Travolta, having grown up in that era. And I rented this movie with the intention of hating it. But it actually grew on me. I was half-way through the movie, when I realized that it was, subtly, better.I also did not want to like Angela Bettis as Carrie White. But she, too...grew on me. The hesitations in her performance, are her CHARACTER's hesitations, not a lack of talent. Quite the contrary, in fact.The deviations this work takes from the original movie are constructive variations rather than the mindless drivel customary in the King remakes.Unfortunately, as with many of Mr. King's works, the dogmatic overtones hammer you in the head. They are nowhere near as "ignorable" in this made for TV movie, as they are in the novel, but that is to be expected. Mrs. White is still the insane pontificating zealot she is in the original literary work, but I found Carrie's faith uncharacteristically smarmy. It wasn't exactly out of character, considering who raised her, but it was distasteful, to say the least. The original Carrie was a head-strong girl who knew her mother was crazy. This Carrie was afraid of her own shadow, literally.The pig butchering scene was a delightful deviation, more like the novel and less like the original movie. Nice. It was compelling, disturbing and REAL.I also enjoyed David Carson's (Smallville, the 10th Kingdom, etc.) direction of Carrie, herself. Her experimentation with her powers was a nice touch. It added depth to her character instead of the shrieking plastic Carrie we got in the first movie. Added much to the depth of the movie, as well.The scene where Chris and Billy are in bed together discussing Carrie's fall, has a definite "Cruel Intentions" feeling. A likable, but sinister "Cruel Intentions" feeling. Niiiice. Except for the actors being in their mid-twenties portraying high school kids (also done in the original), the movie had a reality to it that the first one lacked.Rena Sofer as Miss Desjarden was a delight to behold. There should be real teachers out there like her. Law-suits not withstanding, ALL teachers should demonstrate her level of caring and compassion.The way the entire movie was based around the police interviews with the students was wonderfully done, creatively perpetrated and convincingly portrayed. Many various and diverse touches were added to make this a very memorable movie.All in all, a much better movie, than the original. It contains the well-thought-out remake of the original scenes we've come to love and expect from the movie, "Carrie," giving us both what we want and what the movie needed in order to best the original.As I said in the beginning, I had no intention whatsoever of liking this production, but it won its rewards by demonstrating superior direction, screenplay and performances. And, last but certainly not least, I found the ending to be even more dramatic in its portrayal than the original, by giving us less drama and more action. Very VERY nice! Extremely well-done Made-For-TV movie. Brilliant adaptation of King's work. Absolutely delightful.It gets a surprising 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really isn't as bad as history remembers it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the made-for-TV movie "Carrie," our young naive outcast (Angela Bettis) is tormented by her fellow high-school students. She learns of her telekinesis and begins using it as a tool for vengeance.The 2002 version of Stephen King's "Carrie" is a lot better than it could've been. It was already fighting an uphill battle trying to recapture the same tense and gloriously haunting magic the 1976 movie did. Weak performances and cheesy dialogue by many of the actors doesn't help the situation. However, Angela Bettis's incredible performance as the title character virtually redeems any weakness shown by the other cast members. The one thing that hinders this update is the TV-quality production and cinematography. That being said, the special effects are a lot better than they should've been for a TV-movie made in the early 2000s.Although 2002's "Carrie" is rated TV-14 and includes some questionable content for younger viewers. There's brief nudity, although nothing graphic is shown. The scenes are from the back or a profile of Carrie lying in the fetal position in the shower. There are adult situations, violence and gore, mild profanity, alcohol and smoking, and frightening and intense scenes.If you give the update a chance, you'll find that it really isn't as bad as history remembers it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truest Adaptation to King's Book We'll Ever Get!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love the 1976 Carrie film. I've loved it ever since I was a child. Recently there was a remake of it starring Chloe Moretz, and it's equally good. However, there is another remake of Carrie that was made for TV in 2002 that some people may not know about. I don't love it like I do the original and newest version, but it is a lot truer to the book. For example, this has the police conducting interviews and asking people about the conspiracy to dump the pig's blood, it has the rain of stones, but most importantly it has the destruction of the town. Angela Bettis plays Carrie White this time. She's a pretty woman, She's a great actress (watch 'May') but her performance of Carrie just came off as awkward. Maybe that's the way she wanted to portray the character, but I think Sissy and Chloe were better. Emilie De Ravin made a good Miss Desjardin. She was very conniving and vicious. I liked Rena Sofer's performance as Miss Desjardin. She was more strict and more authoritative than Judy Greer in the 2013 remake. Patricia Clarkson was kinda bland as Margaret White. She wasn't as crazy as Piper Laurie, nor psychotic as Julianne Moore. Carrie White is a very shy girl who has no friends and a crazy religious mom who constantly locks her in the closet. When she gets her first period during gym class, all the girls humiliate her. This starts a chain of events when Carrie finds out she has telekinesis; the power to move objects with her mind. When Sue Snell feels bad for mocking Carrie, she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom.When Carrie is crowned Prom Queen, the bucket of pig's blood is poured and all hell breaks loose. The story of Carrie is probably my absolute favorite by Stephen King. If you love the story, you may enjoy this interpretation of CARRIE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much to the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 points before I start.Firstly I would like to start this review by saying I really love the 1976 version of Carrie. I think it is one of the the best horror movies ever made. It is also one of the saddest horrors ever made.Secondly I don't see why people are bad mouthing this TV version from 2002. It may not be a classic but it is a very good remake that is more faithful to the source novel than the original film.In My opinion the 2002 version of Carrie is one of the best TV adaptations of a Stephen King novel, up there with IT and the 1979 version of Salems Lot. All the actors play there parts very well. Plus anyone who has read Carrie will realise how close to the novel this version is, well apart from the ending. This was changed due to the fact that this version was originally intended as a pilot for a series.The film starts with the survivors of prom giving evidence to the police. This comes directly from the novel and the story is told in flash back. Angela Bettis makes for an interesting Carrie White. Unlike Sissy Spacek Carrie who comes a cross as a deer in headlights, Bettis Carrie isn't as naive or scared of her tormentors and in a couple of scenes she actually verbally fights back,(Reminding Sue Schell that the only reason she speaking to her in a shop is that none of her friends are around to see). Carrie in this version is fully aware that Tommy was asked to take her to the prom by Sue.This In-fact this is the major difference between the two films. In many ways Carrie is more street wise than her 1976 counterpart. The original Carrie is purposely slick and overplayed, where as this version is subtler and more realistic.This really shows in the the way Carrie is bullied by the other girls and there general reactions to Carrie in general its very realistically played out, making they're nastiness all the more shocking.Patricia Clarkson interpretation of Margret White is one of quiet insanity. It actually makes her performance all the more unnerving.Rena Sofers ,Miss Desjarden is actually a lot better than the original Betty Buckleys, Miss Collins (the gym teacher). This mainly to do with the fact that the role is actually better written than in the original 1976 version. The scene at the prom where she reminds Carrie that High Schools isn't the be all and end all is brilliantly played out.She also shares a great scene where she and the headmaster are confronted by Chris Hargensen father.(This comes directly from Stephen Kings book). The rest of the cast are very good and many have gone on to bigger things. Emilie de Ravin went on to appear in LOST and Kandyse McClure became part of the cast of the New Battlestar Galactica not to mention the always excellent Katharine Isabelle (a real bitch in this version) who has become a cult star of indie horror movies. This adaptation of Carrie only really fails on 2 points. The first is that some of its digital Special Effects don't always work. This was mainly to do with budget restraints. The second is its look. It just looks too made for TV, Its flatly directed and has no real grandeur. This probably why some the reviews have been bad. Also i would like to point out that many of the negative reviews come from people who have never read the book. I really liked this adaptation of Carrie and have watched almost as many times as the original. I'm aware that I've compared the two films in this review but I hope people reading this will not be put off especially as a new version of Carrie is on its way. I hope this version will not be forgotten as its only real flaw was that it was a TV movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of Carrie was not totally horrible, but I wasen't totally impressed either. The worst part of the movie I thought was that it was very predictable. I understand that this movie is from a classic Steven King novel, but it was horror so I was hopeing to get atleast something out of it. Plus, most of the effects we're computerized. Like 90% of it, and you could tell. Living in an age of computers it was very dull. I also remember finishing the movie and going, thats it? I found the actress playing Carrie to be descent, as well as her teacher, but other then that, if you missed it when it came on tv, you didn't miss much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I prefer this one over the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Stephen King's novel and a TV remake of the 1976 original, Angela Bettis stars as Carrie, a shy high school girl who is a subject of bullying at her school and abuse by her religiously-fanatic mother Margaret White (Patricia Clarkson). Carrie later discovers she has telekinesis, and gets pushed to the edge on prom night by a humiliating prank, giving the perpetrators a lesson they will learn the hard way.Filmed with much suspense and horror, Angela really gave the Carrie character her own unique touch, giving her a even more fragile, vulnerable and timid personality than Sissy Spacek did in the original. Emilie de Ravin and Katherine Isabelle play mean girls Chris Hargensen and Tina Blake, giving them very snotty, cruel and condescending character takes. Jesse Cadotte gave a very sinister and sly portrayal of Billy Nolan; Tobias Mehler gave a more touching performance as Tommy Ross; and Rena Sofer gave a dramatic performance as Miss Desjarden. Patricia Clarkson didn't give as much as a wired and downright crazy portrayal of Margaret White as Piper Laurie did in the original, but she did portray her as someone who is disturbed and depressed.One element I like better in this movie is that the characters had more interaction and/or connection with Carrie, as you could sense more of Chris and Tina's tormenting of her and Miss Desjarden sticking-up for her and communicating with her more (as in the interaction scene during the prom night). You could also sense more of Sue Snell's (Kandyse McClure) remorse and understanding towards Carrie.Another element I like better in this movie is that the prom scene is much more longer and chaotic and has more carnage than the original. I also thought Carrie's revenge on her tormentors were much more explicit and forceful in this movie.Lastly, I like that this movie has more scenes that connect the course of events more closely and that made the plot were relevant, like the police investigation and interview scenes and the one-on-one scenes between Carrie and Chris, and Carrie and Sue. ***spoiler ahead*** I just wished some of the characters who were nicer towards Carrie at the end met a better fate during the prom scene*** Overall, it's an exciting horror story and one of the more tastefully done TV movies I've seen.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and explain why this was needed. Not a total waste of one's time, perhaps, but pretty darn close. I won't take up even more of your time here by re-hashing the whole works for you, I'm sure you know the score by now. Personally, the thing I missed most in this bland re-make was Piper Laurie. Yes, I like Patricia Clarkson, and I'm sure she did the best she could with the direction and script she was given. The fault here lies with the writers' failure to include the lewd sexual undertones that were a part of Margaret White's mania in the original film. We are given no clue in this "update" as to why Margaret is a Bible-thumping nutcase. All the background of how she became pregnant with Carrie, her "rape" by Carrie's boozy, horny father - that's all deleted. Go back and look at the '76 version, check out the scene where Margaret is crucified by Carrie's telekinetically-driven knives. Listen to Margaret's screams of orgasmic ecstasy as each wound is inflicted. Study her beatific smile as she dies in the same pose as the one traditionally used to portray Jesus on the cross. Now that's camp for you!! Not a single trace of that is present here - too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as good as the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based more on the book rather than the original version. In the book by Stephen King, the story was told like an ivestigation with fictitious reports from Susan Snell's autobiography, detectives, university professors and researchers. Which kind of threw most people off.The movie starts off with Sue Snell being questioned about Carrie White and what events that led up to prom night. Survivors, Norma Wattson and Rita Disjardan are questioned about events from the prom. This newer version was just as good as the original one. I liked the way the story was meant to be told. The movie had Carrie destroying parts of the town, unlike the original version which only had Carrie's rampage of her school and home. I was surprised in the part where Sue helped out Carrie at the drug store and toward the ending,where Sue helps Carrie (who was in disguise) flee from town after Sue lies to the detective on the whearbouts of Carrie White.This movie wasn't a rip off like The Rage; Carrie 2, the sequal to the original movie. The overall acting was very good, each of the actors and actress's really getting into their characters. Angela Bettis did a great job playing Carrie. Her actting skills were almost identical as Sissy Spacek did in the orignal version. I wish this movie would have came out in the movie theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ABC Family version--OR WAS IT?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the right editing, this could have been a really nice movie. And then Stephen King fans and probably Stephen King would have had a fit. There were several possible escapes that would have made it more 'Pygmalion' than 'Pygbloodian.' This Carrie was (except with her mother) sweeter and more attractive than the first, and you really want everything to go right for her when she has that special night. You see, I'm not a Stephen King fan. Had I turned it off at the right moment, I would have found it quite satisfying. It still was, but not in the way I would have wanted. Don't read any more if you didn't read the novel or see the original movie. This one starts with the investigation of something terrible that happened, though it takes a while for you to know just what is going on as the mystery slowly unfolds between flashbacks. Finally you know people died, possibly as a result of a prank. The climactic scene, in fact, was much more effective since it didn't happen as quickly or as neatly. There were sprinklers in the gym; that actually worked to Carrie's advantage. From there, picture Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdicts. The sweet girl from earlier in the movie has definitely disappeared. But the ending was a little different. A sequel seems more logical to this one; that's all I can say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Carrie" will forever remain one of the greatest horror films of all time, possessing two phenomenal performances and a talented director at the apex of his career, combining the stylistic flourishes of Hitchcock and Argento with amazing results. Yet expanding on the original might not sound like such a bad idea, particularly taking into account that the sequence, present in the novel, where Carrie destroys the whole town could not be filmed by De Palma for budgetary reasons. But it also begs the question, as did the made for TV remake of "The Shining", if it ain't broke why fix it? The director clearly wanted to make the film stylistically the antithesis of the original, shooting it on digital video to give it a realistic, but nevertheless low-budget, feel. This doesn't work, for despite the odd inspired visual touch that transcends the format, it simply looks ugly here. The cast do provide some justification for its remake, notably the superb performance from Bettis who, as anyone who saw the underrated "May" will attest to, was a perfect choice for the role. With her unusual looks and twitchy, nervy mannerisms, Bettis makes the film worth seeing. As does Clarkson, filling in a big pair of shoes from the monolithic characterization by Laurie in the original, but instead infuses the character with a more subdued nature, giving her a humanity that was never glimpsed previously. Elsewhere however, the cast let the film down, most disappointing of which being Isabelle, who was so impressive in "Ginger Snaps", giving a one-dimensional performance as one of Carrie's foes. What destroys the film however is the screenplay. Too faithful to the original film in its first half then too jarringly different in the last reel (I won't spoil it but the ending is a travesty), the script's biggest crime is its interrogation framework, so cliched a filmic device that as soon as David Keith appears on screen all credibility flies out the window. "Carrie" is not a terrible remake, but it isn't a particularly good one either, so unless you're a Bettis fan just rent the original again or even the sequel, which isn't looking all that bad right about now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I see this differently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe because I read the book before I saw the original, but this feels more like an expansion of the 76 film than a remake. It might have played a little better if had been made it 79 or something, if for no other reason than the fact some of the original cast could have been kept. (Neither Sissy Spacek orAmy Irving can play teens anymore.)Anybody that read the book will remember the special commission that was put together to investigate "the incident" on the last few pages, and that's where this one starts. The entire movie is in flashback mode, so it seems to me that it kind of dovetails with the original. The only blooper to the idea, is that in the original (as well as the book) Carrie dies, in fact the first page of the last chapter is her death certificate, so the ending would have to change for this method to play, but overall, I wasn't as diasappointed as I expected to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, although this isn't the best Carrie Adaption, I still did enjoy it. I do love how it added a lot more from the novel to this adaption, but it does have it flaws. For example the Special Effects. The Special Effects really ruin the movie quite a bit. They are quite awful for a film made in 2002. The 1976 version looked more realistic. But does that ruin it entirely for me? No. It is the story that gets me. Angela Bettis made a great Carrie, her acting was fantastic. She had played a shy, awkward and lonely girl and she was amazing. Although I do think she overacted at some points, I thought she shook too much and she does go cross eyed at times, although it was extremely effective after she got dumped in blood. Most of the other Actors did a pretty good job and it was a fun watch. I still do prefer the 2013 Adaption out of all of them, but I still love this version and all of the others as well. Not bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ask me which of the three Carrie adaptations are the best, I'll always stick by the side of the 1976 original (don't bother watching the 2013 remake or the 90's sequel The Rage, unless you want to induce vomiting or something). So what about this 2002 TV version of Carrie? Well, it is seriously lacking what the original had, but it beats the 2013 remake by a long shot! The plot is the classic Carrie legend by Stephen King; Carrie is a girl striving to be accepted in high school but hated and mocked by her peers, pitied by her teachers and abused by her crazy religious-nut mom. But Carrie unleashes her potential for destruction when the bullying goes too far.I liked the acting choices. No one can beat Sissy Spacek from the original but Angela Bettis did a much better job than that horrible Chole Moretz from the 2013 remake. Patricia Clarkson wasn't bad as Margaret White. The soundtrack wasn't very good at all (waaaaay too modern) but they did add an ending twist that differs from the original plot, one that caught me off-guard - Carrie survives and becomes a fugitive, with the help of her classmate, Sue! I wish they hadn't introduced Carrie to the internet, that was a dumb idea. Just because the internet exists now doesn't mean it needs to be in EVERY movie.Overall it's not the best adaptation, but certainly not the worst and kinda fun to watch if you're a Carrie fan or were unhappy with Carrie dying in the original.</fullReview>

It was supposed to lead to TV show and I am extremely bummed that TV show never happened. It would have been cool to see what direction it would have taken. I think Angela Bettis did a good job as Carrie White. Patricia Clarkson was good as her mother, but she just came across as too sweet to convincingly play a psychopath.

		<shortDescription>A Secret Rage Burning Inside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with remaking "Carrie" is two-fold. First off, the original Brian DePalma film is such a defining classic. Any additional version will be compared unflatteringly to that original. Secondly, the story follows a clear, well-known formula. Every version of "Carrie" has to end with the main character wreaking telekinetic havoc at the prom. The question of remaking "Carrie" becomes whether or not the performances justify telling a story everyone knows the ending to. This was the question facing the 2002 television version of "Carrie" and is the question currently facing the brand new, Chloe Moretz-starring remake.So, do the performances justify the film? Kind of. A screening of "May" is what convinced the producers that Angela Bettis was the perfect choice for the role of Carrie. No doubt, the two characters are similar, disenfranchised loners who strike back violently against their tormentors. However, Angela Bettis makes Carrie not only very different from May but different from Sissy Spacek's Carrie. Spacek played the character as a wounded animal. Bettis' Carrie, meanwhile, plays like a PTSD victim. She keeps her head down, taking abuse silently. She's more spastic, seemingly going into seizure like trances. Bettis' naturally nervous qualities are played up, her eyes and forehead twitching. However, this Carrie has a secret rage burning inside of her. She bottles up her anger at the world. A more bitter or even sarcastic side shows through during her interactions with mother or schoolmates. Spacek's Carrie was a poor girl who snaps suddenly, unexpectedly. Bettis' Carrie is a ticking time bomb. The differing interpretation allows Angela to make the part her own. It's a very good performance from a great actress.Patricia Clarkson also goes in a very different direction from what Piper Laurie did in the original. Laurie played the role as over-the-top, high opera. Clarkson goes in the opposite direction. Her Margaret White rarely raises her voice. Her threats are quiet and subtle. She doesn't have to yell and scream to make her point. She plays her religious fanaticism as a frightening truth, someone who believes unerringly. Clarkson is excellent, far more believable then Laurie's campy theatrics. It's the only true advantage the 2002 version has over the 1976 version.The 133-minute long film, originally aired in two halves over two nights, hews more closely to Stephen King's original novel. It reinstates the epistolary format, a police detective interviewing the surviving high school students about what happened that night, the events recalled in flashback. The narrative reshuffling does little to change the flow of the story. Carrie still gets her period in the girl's changing room, freaks out, discovers her powers, faces her religious fanatic mother, gets invited to the prom by Tommy Ross, has pig's blood dumped on her, goes nuts and kills a lot of people. Several missing scenes from the book are reinserted. Small meteorites fall from the sky when Carrie is born. When she's six years old, after an encounter with the neighbor's daughter, the same thing happens. After the massacre at the prom, Carrie walks through Chamberlain, Maine, destroying most of the town.I'm not sure how to feel about the extended run time. In some ways, it allows the material to breathe more. A few of the additional scenes add nice character development. Chris Hargensen has a scene where she interacts with Carrie alone, that shows Chris to have some depth as a character. When Kandyse McClure's Sue Snell talks to Carrie about make-up, it's humorous, expands on the two's relationship, and provides more insight in Carrie's opinions. The pre-massacre prom scenes are surprisingly good. Carrie and Tommy Ross talking in the car is unusually sweet. Miss Desjarden's monologue to Carrie about post-high school life is wonderful as well, especially Carrie's reaction to it. As Carrie and Tommy dance, Angela gets a great moment, expressing gratitude to the young man. The detective subplot doesn't add much but the cop looking through Carrie's completely empty, unsigned year book is rather heartbreaking. Then again, several scenes are unnecessarily extended. The pig bleeding scene goes on far too long. A moment of Carrie freaking out in class, shattering her desk, adds nothing. The principal talking with a lawyer has no effect on the rest of the film. Though Emilie de Raven's Chris is less blatantly psychotic then Nancy Allen's, her boyfriend Billy becomes a cold sociopath for no particular reasons.The biggest problem with 2002's "Carrie" is that it can't compete with the 1976's version thrills. The CGI-filled prom massacre lacks the visceral punch of the original. DePalma's unique style ramped up the intensity. David Carson's comparatively flat direction adds little. The rampage through town is well executed but seems superfluous. Carrie's powers are often overdone, with her cracking desk, throwing bikes through the air, or wrapping a truck around a tree. Considering Carrie's obvious anger, her not having any memory of the rampage is a cheat. Laura Karpman's score isn't bad, blatantly recalls Pino Dinaggio's work at times, but isn't as impressive.Of course, the ending is different. For some reason, producer Bryan Fuller decided "Carrie" would make a great set-up for a series. Carrie White survives and goes on the road with Sue Snell. The series would have been "The Fugitive," with a telekinetic teenage girl as the protagonist. This, of course, was a terrible idea. If 2002's "Carrie" maintained the book's ending, it perhaps would have been a stronger film. As it is, it's not a bad effort. It can't compare to DePalma's version and is frequently mediocre. Still, the two lead actresses lend what otherwise would have been a forgettable product some elegance.</fullReview>

Bad enough to have an extremely powerful psychokinetic on a killing spree, but worse when that person suddenly snaps out of it and claim complete ignorance of anything he/she did...The unique twist ending with Sue Snell helping Carrie and Carrie getting a chance to live and start over again was a highly original take.Patricia Clarkson TOTALLY nails the role of the crazy, religious zealot mother.

		<fullReview>I know that others has complained about this film, and thinking of the circumstances, it's not that weird. Of course, compared to the original (you saw this coming, right?), this one is more of an "easy come, easy go". It's like Hellraiser without Doug Bradley, or Elm Street without Robert Englund. Even if the movie itself doesn't suck, we have the original, with its own trademarks, to compare it with.However! If you decide to watch this, please make sure to forget everything you remembered from the original movie. If you've read the book, you know that Carrie isn't as cute as in the 70's version, her mother is way more crazy ... The characters doesn't have the substance from the characters in the book. This one does. When I read the book, I pictured Carrie as a shy, somewhat ... I wouldn't say ugly, but not a real beauty, or cute. A bit odd girl, sneaking around in the corridors trying not to be seen and always on edge, never quite dry in her eyes. The actress delivers the character of Carrie superb, and sometimes better than Sissy Spacek (I am going to get so much sh*t from "real" horror fans for saying that). The only thing I have to complain about is the choreography of the picture. The picture is a bit corny on occasions, has got too many closeups and almost always filmed with a shaky hand camera. Makes me wounder - why? It really brings down the over all grade of the movie, and gives a feeling to the movie as a "high school project" rather than a remake/interpretation of the book.On the whole, an excellent movie with excellent acting. I give it 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigger is NOT Better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2002 remake of "Carrie" is proof that bigger is not better. Over the past few years we have been inundated by remakes of classic movies. I don't know if the creative people in Hollywood have run out of ideas, or if they are just lazy. The original movie of Stephen King's first published novel was a modest but effective chiller. In 2002, a remake was filmed using more technically advanced methods of creating bigger, more explosive special effects to wow and impress the viewers. This doesn't make a movie "better".Another perfect example of how Hollywood is wrong with the "bigger is better" theory is the two different versions of the classic thriller "Psycho". In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock released a low budget movie nobody in Hollywood would finance, so he invested his own money to film this modest production in black and white, using a lot of his staff from his weekly television show. The movie was a first in breaking a lot of Hollywood taboos and was held-over for a long run at the theaters.In 1998 Gus Van Sant directed a remake of "Psycho" using the same script and music (brilliantly composed by Bernard Hermann). With all the advances in photographic technology, a better version of Hitchcoks' classic was attempted, with dismal results. The movie flopped with critics and at the box office.So, bigger does not necessarily mean better. Too many remakes are coming out of Hollywood. I hope they never make another version of "Gone With the Wind" or "Wizard of Oz".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak adaptation of Stephen King novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Stephen King's book and I couldn't get through this movie in one sitting. It seems long and the directing shows a flawed vision. Such as the child Carrie bringing fireballs down on her house. It would seem to me that people in the town would never, ever forget an incident like that. Scientists would be investigating it. Or when students have a prank planned for Carrie, why she doesn't notice the crowd gathered around like they're getting ready for a surprise party? One problem is almost all the actors look too old for their parts and the gym teacher (Rena Sofer)--who is older--looks younger than some of the purported high schoolers. Sue Snell's part was totally ruined for me because the actress Kandyse McClure couldn't convince me at any point that she was high school age. That character is so important in this movie. If can't believe her, it's hard to buy the rest of the story.The few that do get over the hurdle of looking like teens turn in above average performances: Emile de Ravin as Carrie's arch-enemy Chris, Meghan Black as Norma, Chelan Simmons as Helen, and Katharine Isabelle as Tina. Katharine Isabelle is a standout in this film. She's beautiful and she steals every scene she's in. Except for her death scene, where bad CGI ruined it for her. It also ruined the rest of the prom scene. I'm not against CGI, either, except when it is done this poorly.Nevertheless, this version does a few things I wish the two other versions would have done. Angela Bettis isn't as good as either Chloe Grace Moretz in the recent (2013) version or Sissy Spacek in the original (1976 version). She looks too old for the part (she's 12 years older than her character). However, they made her up and costumed her perfectly to look like a real harassed, depressed, high school outcast. I wish they had done that with the other two actresses. This version spends a lot more time with the secondary characters, so you get to know them much better. It takes its time setting up the prom scene for the famous "bucket of blood" prank. The movie unfolds as a police investigation, and so everything is a retrospective on events. They show Carrie suffering multiple pranks and incidences, letting you know bullying's a constant her life. All of this is good if the movie does seem a little long.However, I mentioned something in the directing is off. They overplay Carrie's powers at the beginning. There's no way a desk could move across a room and slam into a wall, as opposed to an ashtray falling off the desk, without people suspecting Carrie having a power. What should be unmistakable to people in the movie becomes laughable when the CGI is done so badly.They also implied that Carrie had something like a multiple personality, and after she's soaked in blood, she snaps and her unconscious takes over the power without her remembering what she does. I don't like that interpretation. It makes the rest of her character moot, also her unconscious appears to have some knowledge of electricity and water. In this one, she does wreck the town, as I always thought she should, but the CGI is so cheesy it looks like an early '90s music video.I'm not sure how much of it is the direction and how much is Bettis' performance, but Carrie spends a lot of her screen time rolling her eyes, squinting, and fluttering her eyelids. Other characters mention Carrie having had a seizure in the past. I can accept her being epileptic, the problem is, as they show this so much that you don't see much else about her character. Carrie's character shouldn't be reduced to a neurological dysfunction. They also have her having hid teen magazines in her prayer closet. That does not make sense for this character.Patricia Clarkson as Margaret White, Carrie's mother, is suppose to be a hyper-religious fanatic. She's supposed to be extreme even for a fundamentalist (which she isn't. She's a psychotic.) This must have some fire and brimstone to it. I hate to say, Clarkson is just boring in the part. The director seemed to be shooting for an "American Gothic" look to her, but to me she just looks and acts tired. She doesn't seem like the kind of person who could bully Carrie worse than her schoolmates do, and that's more what Margaret White is. Carrie as a character only makes sense if her mother is that way.If the special effects are a throwback to the 90s, the music is standard '70s TV-movie garbage.Read the book. See the other two version. If you like the story, you can miss this adaptation without any great loss. Except for Katharine Isabelle's parts. Find those on Youtube if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most horrifying shot is the tableau at the end of the first bathtub scene near the end of the movie. (The second bathtub scene near the movie's end has more to do with turning this TV movie into a TV series--the plan that never came to fruition.) The three hour length of this TV version is well suited to amplify the drama and extend the finale rampage. The disaster effects are good. The different take on Margaret, Carrie's mother, is problematic. On one hand, she becomes more realistic and sympathetic, but on the other, nobody really wants to tone down a human monster whom we would rather not see as so human. Most cast members give fine performances including, but hardly limited to, the actors in the roles of Carrie, Sue, Billy, Tommy and Chris. Although Billy is surprisingly the one who seems to be possessed by evil; so where did that come from? I think this version is as good as the original in some ways, not as good in others and yet better in still others. A second crack at turning Stephen King's story into a film developed some of the story line more fully, which is to be expected with three hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so before you go out and rent the 2002 remake, take it from someone who is in LOVE with the 1976 original...... i am a HUGE fan of the 1976 Carrie movie and i think its the coolest movie ever so i was excited to see the remake. so i went to my local movie store and rented it only to find that the remake was the absolute worst! i hated it! Margaret White was not played like the original and the remake didnt capture the devil in Margaret that was captured in the original. and to top it all of, Carrie doesnt die in the end and escapes with Sue Snell.also,when she began to realize she had powers, she tipped over an office desk instead of a simple ash tray like in the original. totally unreal.also, the gym coach was played terrible and she was way too mean.and what REALLY got me where it lives is the fact that Carrie brunt down the ENTIRE TOWN instead of a simple gym. the movie tried way too hard. i suggest you stay away from this 2002 remake and go rent the 1976 original because the original is much more believable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NBC's "CARRIE" remake was a pretty good modernization of the Stephen King story. The cast is great. Angela Bettis, Emilie De Ravin, and Jesse Cadotte all deserve Emmy Nominations (but if this movie gets any, it will only be for Bettis). The annoying parts were Norma Watson and the mentions of Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Roberts (at the prom, Norma was wearing Roberts's Oscar dress). Over all this film certainly isn't the original, but it is worth watching for the next generation of "CARRIE" fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I have read the book, and there were some issues that were handled more "true to book" here, but honestly, why did Sue have to be a black girl with green eyes and an Amy Irving hairdo? I'm sure that Stephen King's book didn't deal with interracial relationships in high school, and not that it isn't ok, but I don't think that adding politically correctness to this "movie" afterwards adds anything at all to the original's message. And the ending was absolutely unbelievable and totally against the grain of what the book was about. Also, too many survivors for my taste. And the mother was just about as interesting as a jello pudding. For me, Piper Laurie was the ultimate Mrs. White, and I don't care how many times this movie is remade, she gets my vote, hands down.One more note -- this Carrie didn't win any sympathy votes with me, but Sissy Spacek sure did.See the original, and forget that this one was ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis overstuffed made-for-TV movie wanted everybody in the show to be nicey-nice. The a-hole English teacher in the Brian DePalma movie is replaced by a sympathetic biology teacher. The a-hole principal in the 1976 version now still gets Carrie's name wrong, but he intercedes on Carrie's behalf in a confrontation with Chris Hartigen's father. Even Chris Hartigen, Carrie's enemy, has an attack of conscience when she's about to dump the pig blood -- what's up with that? Only the supporting characters (Chris's father, her boy friend Billy, her best friend, and the best friend's boyfriend) are truly evil. When Carrie got the pig blood dumped on her, only Chris's snobby friends laughed. Even Carrie is supposed to be entirely sympathetic -- she killed 234 promgoers, plus numberless people in the town as she blew it up, but this all happened during a stress-induced seizure.The scenes between Margaret and Carrie White didn't convince me at all. It's as if the actresses filmed their scenes separately, and a film editor tried to magick them into the same scene.There is rampant sexism in the ending. Had Carietta White been nerd Mortimer White, who had responded to the pig-blood humiliation by whipping out an Uzi, such a character would have been seen as evil as Hannibal Lecter. But this movie makes Carrie a heroine, and lets her live to escape the consequences of her rampage. King's novel was essentially a classical tragedy in modern setting; he understood that Carrie overreacted to the pig blood and so she deserved to die. Brian DePalma got that, but NBC is clueless.The only way in which the 2002 version improves over the 1976 movie is in the special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS*As remakes of great originals go, this wasn't as bad as it could have been. Usually when people in Hollywood feel the need to make a newer version of a classic they do it so badly one can't see it through to the end. That wasn't quite the case here, but almost.I thought the casting was alright overall, although Patricia Clarkeson, who I do like and think is a good actor, fell flat as Margaret White. But then, in all fairness to Ms. Clarkeson, she did have some BIG shoes to fill, as Piper Laurie was the bomb in the original with her `over-the-top' portrayal of the irrational religious zealot.I agree with what others have said regarding the character of Sue Snell and the actor who played her. Sue was FAR too well adjusted to the tragedy of the deaths of all her classmates, not to mention her boyfriend, only two weeks prior to her police interrogation. And although I liked that they made her African American, very new millennium-particularly with a white boyfriend, she did look like a black version of Amy Irving with that kinked hair.I too was confused by the meteor storm, what the hell was that anyway? A flashback or fantasy on Carrie's part? I liked Rena Sofer in the role of the gym teacher, way less `butch' than Betty Buckley's character. But I'm still not sure how she survived the prom massacre. And how about that annoying senior class president, do you wish she'd perished as much as I do?I also felt the scene at the slaughterhouse was more graphic than it needed to be. We all know they killed a pig to get the blood, but did we have to hear the poor animal in agony? Although the look on Billy's face just before he does it is very demonic and evil looking. I guess you'd have to be pretty evil to kill an innocent, defenseless animal. But I won't get onto that track here. One thing that really bugs me, as it did in the original, is wouldn't the blood coagulate overnight in a bucket? It seemed, in both movies, to be a little TOO liquefied to be realistic.The police station scenes were ridiculous and not necessary, not to mention sleep inducing. I like David Keith, but his part should have hit the cutting room floor. I did however thoroughly enjoy the scene with Chris's dad when he threatens to sue the school if his little princess can't attend the prom. The way the principal turned the tables on him was awesome!Lastly, (MAJOR SPOILER!), the fact that Carrie is still alive at the end is, quite frankly, bull ca-ca! I hated the fact that the house was still standing too. For me, probably *the* best scene in the original is the nightmare Sue has when she's visiting the site where the house stood and Carrie reaches up from the grave to pull her down to hell with her. To see them change that to a *very* comfortable Sue driving her to Florida was very disappointing!Overall, not TOO bad for a remake, but not something I'll ever watch again. It just wasn't as creepy as the first one and lacked the eerie music and lighting as well. I must say I was tickled pink that the original was on TNT last night, gave me a chance to cleanse my pallet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSI'm usually not aggravated when it comes to movies, especially when the reviews are really bad. I usually like the ones that are hated. This movie was a big disappointment. I found myself saying, "How stupid!" First of all, what's with the meteor shower? I know the movie was highly sci-fi, but they could have kept it a little bit more realistic especially at the beginning of the movie. The actors were horrible to me. Some people are natural actors and good with really feeling the part. I found Rena Sofer's performance less than fulfilling. That portrayer of Sue was just out in space somewhere. Everyone just seemed so inexperienced. Nothing can compare to the Original version.My apologies Mr. Stephen King. You probably just shook your head in embarrassment. It will be okay. Let's just hope this never happens again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first learned that they were making a remake of one of my favorite horror films I cringed. I hate remakes and to try to capture De Palma's essence into a made for TV film seemed absurd to me. Plus, who could they ever find to work roles as well as Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, and Amy Irving? Then I remembered the TV remake of The Shining, and though I did not love it, I was impressed at the way it followed the novel so much closer than Kubrick's original masterpiece (as a Stephen King fan I could not look fondly on the original film version because it was so different, but as a Kubrick and Nicholson fan, I loved it). So, I then assumed that while this remake would not be better, it would hopefully capture more of the novel than the original. I was wrong.Now, to be fair, I missed the first 25 minutes of the film. But I don't think I missed too much. Carrie was the first Stephen King novel I ever read, and I have been a fan since. I have also read the book more than once, since the first time I read it I was in sixth grade, and I figured there was some stuff I missed being that age. I was excited to see the book acted out before me. It was not. It was like watching a modern version of the '76 film, with a couple scenes loosely drawn from the book. The acting was mediocre, and it seemed as if the actors were trying to be their predecessors rather than making the role their own.To be more specific (this may contain SPOILERS): in the novel, the cross that is in Carrie's closet is full size and in the living room, I have always thought that that would be more, well, creepy. When Carrie first gets the blood dumped on her, she initially runs out of the room, falls, then comes back, looks through the windows and thinks that she wants to "make them all look funny", here, like in the original, she stayed on the stage. Norma's character was supposed to be friends with Chris, and she was supposedly the first to laugh, and they do laugh in the book, not all of them, but I think it's Norma who said, "we didn't know whether to laugh or cry, so we laughed". I liked that they showed Carrie doing more damage around town, that was true to the novel, but when she returns home, Margaret should have stabbed her in the shoulder, and she should have told her mother when she was giving her a heart attack: "I see your hear going slower and slower momma". Her mother's speech about getting pregnant with Carrie was totally gone, even though it was in the novel and in the original. I didn't like Carrie still being alive at the end, I though it was, honestly, lame. There was no mention of the stones. No mention of Sue being pregnant. And the principal was nice as opposed to being an A** as he was in the novel and the original.I hated the characters blasé attitude towards their classmates all being killed, even 2 weeks after the fact that was highly unrealistic. I don't know if the director was trying to mimic De Palma with some of the camera work, but instead of getting any effect, it was more annoying and jerky. I did like the flashback perspective, that was true to the novel, though I wish it would have included interviews with bystanders who saw Carrie walk by and just new "it was Carrie White" even though they had never seen Carrie before, that always gave the book a creepy aspect.I know it doesn't sound like it, but I would recommend this movie, just for curiosity sake. It is interesting. Not good, but interesting. I would not watch it again, but it was worth my 2 1/2 hours. And I will give some of the actors credit, they were not all bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Have A Taste For Mediocrity, Take This Film To The Prom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Stephen King Fan and a fan of the 1976 film "Carrie," I am glad that I found out (several hours prior) that a remake was being shown on TV. I will admit, I saw the trailer from the web site and was not highly impressed but, I gave it a viewing anyway. After seeing it, it was above average for a TV Film but in no way outshined or masked the brilliant DePalma Film from 1976. *SPOILER*I had a severe problem with the character of Carrie who was constantly shaking as if she had a condition whenever she was about to make something move or when she became "upset." I also was not impressed by the "Gay" jokes that were used at the prom nor by the fact that Tommy had to pick Carrie up in a stretch limo. All these things may seem "hip and fashionable amongst some" but, it had nothing to do with the movement of the story. I also was not fond of the way Chris was portrayed nor with the way Billy seemed as though he needed to be admitted to an insane asylum. For some reason, I felt very uncomfortable with the character of Sue and also with the weak portrayal of Margaret White. What I did like is how the film included some scenes that were more faithful to the book but, this did not make the film a masterpiece. I will say that if you have the time and loved the book or the DePalma film, check this out but, if you want good chemistry, good acting and a touching film, stick with the DePalma Film. Now, if they would only remake the musical "The Wiz" so it would be faithful to the stage show, that would be worth it.&gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original version of Carrie was a great movie. the prom scene was very scary, the actors were more convincing, and the mother was more insane. A big problem with this remake was how LONG and dragged on it was. there was no need for this movie to be 3 hours long. the end was simply horrific. Carrie does stuff that NEVER happens in the book or the original movie. the very end is simply a disaster..and the interviews with all the teens was simply unnessesary. if anything, it decreased the mood. hopefully this movie will never be shown again. its an insult to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some remakes are said to be better than their originals.Sometimes thats true. This is one of them.Carrie 2002 may not have the same flair that Depalma used in the equally effective 76 movie but its a TV movie so thats to be expected. However, this newer version delivers more development, more intense sequences, especially the prom climax, and also a better ending in my own opinion but ill let you be the judge of that if you watch it. Angela Bettis is a mixture of mousiness, beauty, and shyness and she was definitely born to play the role of Carrie White. Her journey from class doormat to vengeful prom queen is definitely a sight to see. Also, the whole police investigation into the case is really unique as well cause its already happened so it gives more detail into why it happened and the truth is gradually uncovered.All in all, The newer version delivers more than its share of chills and thrills. it takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions and shows a pretty accurate portrayal of school life. Worth a watch or two definitely.</fullReview>

Also this Carrie, as scenes in it that are not in the original, but in the book, as well as making the death of the mother less symbolic, and more what Stephen King himself wrote. As far as casting, Sissy in my opinion was much better, seeing as how there often is no substitutes for originals. This other chick, had the look of a crazy woman (due partially to being extremely pale, and dark haired), but not the feeling of one. She, unlike Sissy, just doesn't cut it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very few merits in this unnecessary version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In defense of those who have called this a "remake" of the DePalma film -- it follows DePalma's version far closer than it followed King's novel. As a matter of fact, there are several scenes where they even swiped the dialogue from the original film. Case in point: the line uttered by Mrs White about Carrie's dress ("I should have known it would be red") was lifted from the other version, not the book... I'd certainly call it a remake before I said it was another variation on the story. That being said...These characters lack the charm of the '76 cast and are actually a little nastier than the originals. Travolta was wickedly fun as the mischievous Billy Nolan, however, Cadotte plays the character as just plain wicked. De Raven is equally evil and charmless as Chris Hargenson. Clarkson can't match Laurie's chillingly tongue-in-cheek performance as Mrs. White. While Bettis gives an alright performance as Carrie, she's not portrayed as the complete and total outcast that Spacek was. After all, this Carrie actually has a little interaction with people, where as reclusive Spacek was shunned by all except their gym coach. I like Bettis in some of her other work, so I can't hate her here, but she's certainly not the actress that Spacek is. The direction was a little flat and lacked the suspense of the DePalma version (particularly the bucket of blood scene). There are only a few merits to this film. Rena Sofer was, as always, fantastic. Out of the whole cast, Sofer is the only actor who comes close to being on the same level of greatness as the '76 cast. Kandyse McClure also gave a solid performance as Sue Snell, and it was great to see the character developed a little more than she was in the other version (which was because a lot of Irving's scenes were left on the cutting room floor). The other major merits of this film were seeing the police interviews, the rain of stones and destruction of the town, which were all taken from King's novel (the rain of stones was filmed for the other version but also omitted). But these few merits can't save this telefilm from being totally unnecessary. And as for "Carrie: The Series," all I can say is I'm grateful it's not gonna happen. 13 weeks of Bettis unleashing her telekinetic powers on an unsuspecting public would be real overkill... Worth a look for fans of the book and teenagers who lack the attention span to get the FX-deprived '76 version, but all others should avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect reason to avoid remakes of classic movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director of this travesty really should study the ideas of Hitchcock and all the great horror producers, directors and writers. The essence of terror lies in the unseen and surprising. David Carson added a wasted 92 minutes of fluff to the length of the original Classic 1976 movie. The nearly pornographic attention to minor details and the insertion of scenes never written by King ruined the plot flow and gave the climax away -- just in case someone from Outer Mongolia was seeing the story for the first time. The ideal experience for anyone who found this movie less than entertaining would be to read Stephen King's excellent novel and then watch the 1976 movie starring Sissy Spacek. For those who can't handle reading the book, at least see the original movie to find out how horror was (and should always be) created on film when there were competent directors in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by mentioning the good things I noticed. Angela Bettis did a good job portraying Carrie, per what I can only assume was her direction.This movie is filled with special effects, and while they weren't of the highest quality, they were good.I also liked that they clarified that not everyone who went to prom that night died in the gymnasium, as well as showing that the destruction went beyond the highschool.The rest of the movie, however, is a mixture of waste and rehash. To start, it's 180 minutes long. That's a bit much for a story that most people already know. I realize they attempted to follow the book a little more than the 1976 original, but even still.In the novel, Carrie makes rocks/boulders fall from the sky. Rocks. Not meteors.MUCH of the dialogue in this movie, during crucial scenes makes you feel Deja Vu; lines that were lifted from the book are understandable, but much of it just feels like you're watching a modernized version of the movie, most notably during Miss Desjardin's speaking to the girls about whether or not "any of them ever stop to think?" The bit about the color of Carrie's prom dress ("I might've known it would be red") in the original movie was a mistake, where the dress used was pink, and the script called for red. Carrie responding by saying "It's pink" was added, so that was definitely lifted straight out of the 1976 film. This happens lots of times throughout the movie.During the prom scene, Carrie misunderstands much of the slang and jargon of 2002, because she's sheltered, which worked nicely, only I don't think it was handled properly. I think if Carrie was truly not understanding, she wouldn't have been so willing to accept Tommy Ross saying "It's a complement."While I praise Angela Bettis for stepping into some very well-known shoes, and for doing a good job performing her role, I felt it difficult to sympathize with Carrie. Her initial telepathic acts seem almost like she KNEW she was making them, and making them out of anger, rather than the frustration I think she would've felt.I did enjoy the nonchalance with Margaret White (Patricia Clarkson) assaults her daughter, but for the most part she just came off to me as generally very weak and that made Carrie feeling threatened by her harder to swallow.Emilie de Ravin was cast as Chris Hargensen because Julia Stiles either wasn't available or knew better than to take the role. She wasn't enough of a bitch for me, either. And Billy Nolan needed to be locked up, he was far FAR too involved in the plan, in my opinion.Kandyse McClure does a fair enough job as Sue Snell, but I felt, during the scenes with the detective, that she simply wasn't upset enough. Regardless of whether or not "It's been two weeks, all the funerals are over," She lost all of her friends, her boyfriend..that'd shake a person up, and I think they'd need longer than two weeks to fully recuperate. Anyone who's lost someone knows it's easy to go out and continue living your life, but when the issue is being addressed in such detail, it's hard to maintain composure.Miss Desjardin (Rena Sofer) did the well, I think, but I had fleeting thoughts of Demi Moore when I watched her perform, and her performance as a whole was dripping with Betty Buckley's "Miss Collins." If you looked away from the screen and just listened to her voice, you'd probably think it WAS Betty Buckley. However, I think she did the best she could under the circumstances, and I liked the exchange between Miss Desjardin, Principle Morton, and Mr. Hargensen.The special effects during the prom scene are good, and the "delay" on the climax was cute, but everything else felt like a waste of time -- not to mention the movie's 180 minute running time. The use of the detective interviews from the book work, but some of them were unnecessary and drawn out. The biggest let-down was the ending. Not only the changing of the prayer, but the fact that Carrie lives at the end of the story. Thats ridiculous. There were better ways to go about the ending..in fact, Stephen King, if you've heard of him, wrote a great one in the book this movie is based on.So, two stars out of five, I guess. I'd suggest reading the book or watching the original movie, assuming this one will ever be shown again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lets pretend that this isn't a remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..and take it on its own. It's inevitable to think of Brian DePalma's original scarefest with the Oscar nominated Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie; but if we take this made for TV movie on its own merits and try not to compare it, we may find it's a pretty good movie. Angela Bettis is mesmerizing as Carrie White, the daughter of a religious fanatic, who made it rain rocks when she was born and also when she got angry as a child. We obviously know this little girl is something out of the ordinary. But Stephen King's CARRIE really focuses on the loneliness of being different; of being mocked because you aren't like everyone else; the joy of being accepted at a prom with the handsome hunk Tommy; and ultimately, the irony of revenge on everyone whether they deserved it or not. The production values for a TV movie are very good, even if some of the CGI effects look a little forced, but director David Carson gives us the portrait of a lonely girl who just wants to fit in, and whose retaliation on a sad bunch of spoiled brats is carried to the extreme. Patricia Clarkson's understated performance as Margaret White is just as chilling as the over the top fanaticism of Piper Laurie; Tobias Mehler is a likable and hunky Tommy; Rena Sofer brings a lot of punch to her role as the gym teacher; Katherine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps) is a bitchy Tina, and the young lady who plays Chris (didn't catch her name, but she's currently on the hit series LOST) is also effectively sinister. Kandyce McClure seems slightly out of place as Sue Snell, and I'm not sure the addition of the police investigation (led by the sturdy David Keith) is necessary. I also felt the ending paled in comparison to the original (Mama being impaled by knives in a mock effigy of the horrible crucifix she had). Seems like the writer wanted to shy away from doing the same ending, but didn't come up with one as memorable. All in all, though, Bettis is magnificent as Carrie, and Sissy Spacek should be proud of her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angela Does Her Best In This Bloated Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Dawn of the Dead", the original "Carrie" story is so good that generally faithful remakes like this are still entertaining even if they are not equal to the original De Palma film. And "film" is an important word in this particular case because this Canadian remake was shot on digital video instead of film. Each year video technology gets closer to reproducing the look of film but in 2002 it still had a long way to go. Video has a sharper more realistic look than film and a much lower contrast ratio, making it appropriate for documentary and historical films but not so good for expressionistic stuff or stylistic horror films in the Hitchcock and Argento tradition. This could have been a fatal flaw had the remake of "Carrie" been a theatrical release or even if it had been introduced to a world of high definition big screen televisions. But most 2002 viewers watched this thing on 19-inch standard definition televisions where these differences are barely detectable.Both the original and the remake stay "generally" faithful to the Stephen King novel so long-time fans will have little to cringe about. On the plus side, the remake does a good job of creating some destruction in the town, something that De Palma could not do for budgetary reasons. On the minus side, the original ending is altered (extended) in a totally contrived way to keep things open for a future television series (maybe Carrie finds her "Tru Calling") for which the producers ultimately could not find adequate financing.Angela Bettis' "Carrie" is virtually identical to the Sissy Spacek version. Her performance is at least as good and probably better but the entire supporting cast is so much weaker that it is hard to judge. Bettis is clearly too old for the role but so is everyone playing her high school classmates so it is not a glaring problem. As Carrie's mother, Patricia Clarkson is a poor substitute for Piper Laurie. This is no surprise since Laurie's performance was the best thing about the original but Clarkson's repressed version of the character takes away from the sympathy factor Bettis is going for. The two of them, however, are responsible for one nice moment as Carrie mentally slides her mother out of the bedroom and slams the door after her, but not before she warns her to be careful about keeping her fingers away from the slamming the door.It is a matter of personal choice about whether it is best to watch Bettis' incredible performance in "May" before or after viewing "Carrie". She plays a similar character in "May" (including the sewing skills) but the supporting cast and the directing is much better, making May a more believable, sympathetic, and terrifying character. But Bettis has one truly extraordinary scene in "Carrie", watch for the cosmetics scene in the drug store midway into the film. The camera stays tight on her face for several minutes and the emotional range she cycles through renders any dialogue unnecessary. She turns a very ordinary sequence into something truly special. The DVD release of the Carrie remake would have benefited from some serious trimming. They needed a lot of padding to get up to a 2 Hour 12 Minute running length (for a three hour television broadcast) and the DVD authors did not even bother to edit out the fades in and out for the many commercials. There are several useless sequences like ten minutes at the local pig farm. Better to have used the time to put some dimensionality into the main villains; in real life the really popular kids do not have the time or interest to harass classmates at the absolute bottom of the pecking order. King's weakness has traditionally been a failure to adequately explain the motivations driving his villains and the remake had time to address this issue.The main device for upping the running time was the addition of a post-prom police investigation headed by David Keith in a rather nothing performance. This serves to introduce the real story in a series of linearly told flashbacks and therefore could not be carved out of a re-cut version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much closer to the King novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For fans of the '76 Brian DePalma film, I expect to get kicked in the head for suggesting that this made-for-TV remake was superior to that big-screen version. However, it's closer to King's novel than that '76 film was, and one has to take into account the limitations of film-making in '76.'Carrie', as anyone who has read the book or seen the original knows, is the story of Carrie White (Bettis), a teen girl with telekinetic powers. Unfortunately Carrie's life is nowhere near perfect; her mother (Clarkson) is an ultra-conservative Christian fundamentalist with a touch of paranoia; her schoolmates either ignore or harass her; and she is not allowed/invited to take part in ANY of the usual things that teenagers do. As graduation approaches, Carrie is subjected to a humiliating event when she has her first period in the shower after gym class. Because her fanatical mother has never told her about this, Carrie thinks she is bleeding to death, and her classmates corner her and hurl insults at her. The gym teacher (Sofer) quickly puts a stop to the taunting, but it does not end there. When Carrie goes to her locker to get her books, she notices a nasty message scrawled on the door by the ultra-popular cheerleader type, Chris Hargensen (de Ravin). As the door is opened hundreds upon hundreds of tampons spill out, to the mocking laughter of Chris &amp; her girlfriends. When Carrie gets home she is subjected to additional verbal, physical and mental abuse by her psychopathic mother. The next week, the girls who taunted Carrie in the shower &amp; filled her locker up with tampons are assigned a week's detention in the gym, in lieu of 3 days suspension &amp; refusal of their prom tickets. However, Chris defiantly decides to skip detention, and is suspended and barred from the prom. Her father's desperate attempts to get her reinstated to the prom fall flat when he discovers that Chris has been assigned 74 detentions - 20 of those for harassment - and that any attempts at a lawsuit will result in a countersuit being filed against him &amp; his daughter. Enraged by her dad's dropping of the lawsuit, Chris decides to get revenge on Carrie by humiliating her - and her chance comes when football player Tommy Ross, at the urging of his girlfriend, Sue Snell (Kandyse McClure), invites Carrie to the prom as his date. Through some inside help from her friend, Tina, Chris &amp; Billy manage to rig the results of the election for prom King &amp; Queen. Once Carrie &amp; Tommy are on stage, Chris pours a huge bucket of blood directly on Carrie's head, and then flees. Chris's friends start to laugh mockingly, making pig noises, but the laughing stops when the doors to the gym suddenly slam shut &amp; lock. Within seconds the gym is shaking as if in an earthquake, and a light fixture drops to the floor and touches off a fire on a tabletop. The fire spreads quickly, and Carrie exacts angry, bloody revenge on her classmates who have tortured her for so long. Most of the students are killed by electrocution when a water pipe supplying the sprinklers bursts, sending water all over the floor, and a scoreboard crashes to the floor in the middle of the water. Only Carrie's gym teacher and a handful of students manage to escape. Tommy is carried unconscious from the building by Helen Shyres &amp; Roy Evans, two of Carrie's classmates. In the wake of the school fire, Carrie leaves for home, leaving a trail of destruction behind. Chris &amp; Billy, after hearing what happened at the school, go into town to see. They encounter Carrie on a dark road, and Billy guns his truck's engine, hoping to run down Carrie. But Carrie exacts revenge on them by sending the truck crashing against a tree, then bending the frame around the trunk. Billy &amp; Chris die instantly, and Carrie continues on to her home, where her mother attempts to kill Carrie by drowning. Carrie finally breaks free of her mother's horrific grip - by inducing a fatal heart attack. Carrie is believed dead, but is last seen having changed her appearance, heading south for Florida.The introduction of the detective (David Keith), while not in the book or the original film, made for an interesting take on the novel. Most of the characters &amp; dialogue were far closer to the novel than the 1976 film. Patricia Clarkson (The Dead Pool, The Untouchables) gives a compelling performance as Carrie's psychopathic, fanatical mother, and Angela Bettis, while not quite as good as Sissy Spacek's portrayal, still creates a character that is believable and close to the one King's book portrayed. Newcomer Emilie de Ravin gives a convincing portrayal as the arrogant, defiant lawyer's daughter Chris Hargensen. She is more convincing in this role than Nancy Allen in the original, who only seemed to have a small role. Tommy Ross's character was more likable than William Katt's portryal in the original.For a remake of a Stephen King classic, this one is pretty good, considering it was made-for-TV. It surpasses 'The Rage' sequel by a long shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some Spoilers herein...Carrie marks yet another horrid TV movie based on a Stephen King Novel following other garbage such as The Shining and Rose Red. My first complaint (of many) is that, like The Shining, Carrie did not need to have another adaptation. The film was great. But, for whatever reason they decided to make it anyway. It stays pretty faithful to both the book and the movie at first but in the last hour or so it gets mind-numbingly bad. It doesn't exactly have subtlety going for it. Even the simplest thing like the bucket of blood falling is way to overblown.As for the film's special effects, well, they suck. They're completely cheesy and fake-looking. There's one shot of a car hurling towards the screen that looks completely ridulous. I've seen more realistic-looking cars in video games. It just gets worse from there. The ending was so stupid I wanted to vomit, and still do just thinking about it. Instead of the classic ending where Carrie uses knifes to kill her mother and then destroys the whole house, killing herself too, Carrie just uses her powers to make her mother's heart stop. Wow. But wait, there's more! Knowing that Carrie is in trouble with the police, Sue helps Carrie hide out, and 2 completely illogical fakeout scares later, the movie ends with her driving carrie to Florida. Here comes that vomit again...Now, I know that there is a possible series that will be sprouting from this movie but I still find the ending stupid. Besides, with a movie this bad how good could the series possibly be? I usually try to give some constructive criticism when I review a movie, but this is such a bad movie that it's just a rant. This movie actually causes me physical pain to watch it. That's how bad it is! I'm only glad that I saw it on TV and didn't buy or rent it on video. I urge anyone reading this to not spend any money on it. Even if it's for free, you still waste time on this movie. Life is short, and I just wasted 3 hours of my life watching Carrie. I can only devote more of my time by writing this review in an attempt to prevent anyone else from wasting their time and money on this complete load of trash. THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS.My rating: 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no good reason for this remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carrie White (Angela Bettis) is an outcast in school with an overly religious mother Margaret White (Patricia Clarkson). Only Miss Desjarden (Rena Sofer) and Tommy Ross (Tobias Mehler) try to defend her. When Carrie is visited by Anut Flow, Chris Hargensen (Emilie de Ravin) and Tina Blake (Katharine Isabelle) are relentless in picking on her. Their friend Sue Snell (Kandyse McClure) starts to take pity on Carrie. Chris refuses detention with Desjarden, and is suspended and banned from the prom with Billy Nolan. Meanwhile Carrie is gaining in her telekinetic powers. Detective John Mulchaey (David Keith) is investigating the prom incident during flashforward scenes.The production is weak. It's a lot of poor looking practical effects and the CGI is bad even for its time. The question for this movie is why attempt this if it has no chance of adding anything new or be better than the original. Angela Bettis is alright as Carrie but she doesn't have the thing that makes her pop on the screen. Generally, I have no problems with any of the actors in this. It's really the pointlessness of this remake if the production is so poor. Also the change in ending strips it of poetry and finality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Adaption of the Stephen King Novel From Bryan Fuller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bryan (Hannibal, Pushing Daisies) Fuller adapted the Stephen King novel into this effective television movie which served as a pilot film for a series that never sold. No, it's not as good as Brian de Palma's 1976 classic or the recent retelling by Kimberly Pierce but like the plays of Shakespeare is a story that can be told and retold with only varying degrees of success. Fuller tried to stick more closely to the novel than paying homage to the earlier version which was deeply ingrained in popular culture. Carrie's flaw lays in it's format. As a television movie it pauses for commercial breaks then resumes from a dramatic fade to black. This leaves Carrie with a segmented feel whereas the theatrical versions could build momentum without interruption. In addition to some fascinating pieces of backstory explaining the troubled history between the telepathic child and her abusive mother Carrie rewards fans with additional carnage following the prom as the town is devastated by the fury Carrie unleashes. The special effects and acting are spot on and should appeal to anyone who loves the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Carrie remake... It's still not that good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1976 Carrie is one of my favourite movies, period. i recently watched the remake with Chloe Moretz but I had a lot of issues with that, namely that they simply got the script of the original and did a technology update with it. I watched this movie and... While I can't praise it as a good movie this is not without some benefits.Based on the knowledge I'll assume you have of the DePalma film, this one is not a complete rehash. I prefer remakes when they are like this because they can offer a different interpretation on a story that has been told already. This one actually does a decent job of it in some areas while in others it fails miserably.To explain in detail, Carrie's telekinesis when she was a child brought down a dozen meteorites on her house in this version. It's over the top and it only gets uttered ONCE after that. You would think that even one meteorite would interest the authorities, a dozen on the exact same few square feet of land at the exact same time would arouse a lot of interest because I see that as nigh on impossible and I know f#ck all about astronomy. You have a few scenes like that which really dampens the movie.Another big problem is that none of the supposed High School kids look like High School kids. They look like College kids if they're a part of any schooling system. Don't get me wrong some of them do throw in a decent performance now and then while others do go a little bit over the top.Now with that said they do a few things better than the 2013 remake. For example, Angela Bettis looks and acts just like someone going through a lot of abuse. She isn't anything on Sissy Spacek but she is miles above Chloe Moretz. With that said She doesn't look all that threatening in the prom massacre scene.One interesting touch to this movie is the fact that it's all told out like a series of police interrogations. That could actually work and it does bring this movie a certain style to it. If there was any complaint with this it's that some of what they say they can't possibly know.I also liked the ending of this (well not like, more find it interesting), the point of Carrie in my eyes is that a monster is created in an abused girl by the environment that she lives in only to die with her mother out of regret. Here I kind of like the idea of Carrie surviving. Usually something like this would have me flip tables but here, I kind of wanted to see where they were going with it.With some of the scene re-enactments in this version... They're weird, that's all I can say. The shower scene where Carrie starts menstruating in the other 2 versions kind of made sense as to why they were bullying her about it, because she thought she was dying and at age 17, that kind of seems ridiculous. Here? They just bully her because she's menstruating. ??? ...So out of the Carrie remakes I have seen is this finally one worth watching? Maybe. I like that it was trying to be it's own thing, I liked the idea of the changed ending and the people handling the way Carrie looked did a marvelous job to name a few complimentary things. But it drags, a lot. The over-the-top scenes are far in-between to watch for a laugh, some of the scene re-enactments are weird and the High Schoolers look old enough to be in College. If you want to see how someone handles the project of adapting Stephen King's novel differently (the key word being differently), check it out of curiosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Carrie' is a movie that didn't need to be remade, but if it were to be, I had hopes that it would be a decent entry at least. This 2002 version was disappointing for a few reasons. But anyways, the plot basically follows the same wave as the first film. Carrie White is a shy girl who gets bullied by all the other girls at school. While dealing with that, she also has a religious fanatic for a mother who abuses her both physically and mentally. A popular boy at school asks her to prom, and it's all nice and magical...until a catty girl play a horrific prank on Carrie at the prom which involves dropping pig's blood all over her after she's voted prom queen.I didn't like this one, and I'd rate it worse than the sequel they made in 1999 'The Rage: Carrie 2'. That one gets a lot of flack, but it was inventive and creative. This remake switches a few things up, but pretty much stays with the original - yet fails to surpass it. The acting was not there in this remake sad to say. Angela Bettis is no Sissy Spacek. Her performance in this was REALLY off. Carrie White is supposed to be a shy and severely introverted character. Bettis plays Carrie as a shy but bitchy kind of Carrie. Just the way Carrie White came off in this film made me not feel that sorry for her, and didn't give her the vulnerability that Spacek added in the original 'Carrie'. I wasn't feeling this performance at all.In scenes when some of the actors were good, I found myself comparing them to the originals. Wonderful actress Emilie De Raven(Kris) is no Nancy Allen. Kandyse McClure (Sue) was no Amy Irving. And Lena Sofer, while putting in a good effort as the concerned teacher, was no Betty Buckley. There were also some really "off" scenes surrounding when Carrie had her period in the showers. The gym teach is basically joking with the principal afterwards about what was a sensitive subject for Carrie. And some flashbacks to Carrie as a child seeing developed breasts for the first time. Just unnecessary filler.It has it's moments for sure (like almost every film does), but this 'Carrie' remake falls flat. The acting wasn't as good as it was in the original, the story is tweaked in ways that hurt this movie not help it, and it feels like a "Made for T.V" movie at times.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, there's a sad desperation in the reviews that praise this remake because it's more faithful to the book. That is not always a virtue, and I found the flashback sequences annoying, simply because there was no tension; there was nothing these characters could reveal (except for Sue, which goes to the absurd ending). Similarly, there is no need to be truer to the pig-killing scene. It's awful enough done briefly. As for other elements...Clarkson is a better Mama, for sure. The Carrie, not so much. The evil Chris, great, and there's not much you can do with the gym teacher beyond what any actress will do (although I missed Betty Buckley's kind of creepy reminiscence at the prom, indicating an ugly duckling agenda of her own). BUT. The prom inferno was terribly done. Sloppy, and not in a realistically good way. Worst of all is both Sue Snell character and actress. This lone, sympathetic character came across as annoying and not all that nice, and there is then even less basis for the rescue ending: I understand you have extraordinary powers and are deeply troubled, so let's get you to Florida? All in all, not worth watching. While the original is flawed, it was De Palma's territory, and it works as glorious camp/horror.</fullReview>

The part which really pisses me off is that after Carrie kills her fellow classmates with some shameful CGI, the movie turns into Carriezilla as she goes around Maine destroying Stephan King's favorite place to write about. yeah, remember that from the original? they took a really great movie and wiped it's fat ass on it just to make a quick buck. i fell in love with the original because of how well it was done. i felt bad for Carrie because of how well she was played by Sissy Spacek. Yes, the original wasn't a perfect movie and it had its flaws, but this movie is so poorly done, I cried for twenty minutes thinking how could they do this to such an influential movie. but hey this remake was made just 3 years after the sequel (which the sequel took 26 years after the original, but that is a different story)All in all, it's a half assed movie that takes an intelligent character study and breaks it into a million tiny pieces. the 1 and only good thing about it is that it follows the book more than the original movie. However the bad far out way the good in this movie. if you want to watch any reincarnation of "Carrie", watch the 1976 movie or read the book. you won't be disappointed. unlike this stain of pigs blood and tampons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film's got pig's blood smeared all over it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I can say is that this 2002 TV remake of the Brian De Palma classic is not a true remake but more or less a passable one in my books. Carrie (2002) is not such a bad take on. It has a few fresh take ons, some same scenes which create tension but not much suspense and then many different twists and plots to possibly hype the film up. I'll talk about pros and cons in this review about the average remake.Pros: - As mentioned above, I think the film does well with some new take on and cover, so that this film not completely copying it's original (thank gosh).- Also mentioned, I think there were many new twists. Some work and some don't fail but they don't really give us the right connection.- I liked the dark tone this remake had like other horror remakes we've seen over the past decades (naming some like the new fright night, chainsaw remake and dawn of the dead).- I also thought the acting, cinematography and characters were achievable enough. Also quite surprising i might add.Now the cons: - There wasn't enough suspense to keep this film going and it only borough tension.- Some moments that could have been amazing sort of sunk at times.- The music was average at best but i feel it didn't do much in bringing us that disturbing feel like the 1976 film did.- Most moments from the original which were shown here were a nice touch and they weren't the same but they weren't shocking which was a disappointment.- The whole back story with the detectives could have been played out more well but it just gets repetitive. I reckon that if they had done just a beginning or just ending sequence with them, it would have not made the detective parts so annoying.All in all, I didn't hate this remake (Like 2005 remake of The Fog) at all but it certainly comes far from perfect or even been an excellent remake (Like the 2011 remake of Fright Night). I know many people might not agree with me but this is my opinion. It was averagely decent, that's all.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, I haven't seen the original. I would have preferred to be able to watch it instead, as part of my reviewing of horror and Halloween-themed shows this October, but the 2002 remake was the best I could find. I imagine the original is better, but this made-for-TV remake isn't bad.Although I haven't read the Stephen King novel or seen its 1976 adaptation, Carrie is famous enough that I knew the basic outline of the story, and you probably do too. Carrie is an outcast girl in high school, the daughter of a fanatically religious woman. Carrie can move things with her mind. When she's humiliated at the prom, she uses her special abilities to kill everyone.Like some other TV movies, Carrie has some bland direction at times, but the story is colourful enough that it makes it worth watching. It notes that high school kids can be very cruel, and we see Carrie pushed over the edge. In a way it's hard to blame her. Her mother is oppressive- she tells Carrie she's evil for things that are quite natural, and that Jesus won't love her anymore. Carrie points out that that's a dubious statement- isn't Jesus supposed to love everyone? Like Medea, I see Carrie more as a tragic character than an evil one. So I find it strange that this movie lets Carrie live (I've heard she doesn't in the novel and original film). It seems inhumane to let her live after such trauma, with all her guilt and suffering. It leaves the tragedy feeling incomplete. It generally feels like a big misstep to me.Beyond this I found some interest in other bits of the movie, like the mystery about Sue- is she good or bad? I also thought the female teacher was crazy for pushing students around. In short, this movie wasn't as bad as I feared it would be, although I imagine some die-hard fans of the novel and/or the first movie may disagree.Happy Halloween.</fullReview>

The fact they had those police interviews to help tell the story was part of it, but I think an even bigger part of it was the fact that this movie sort of added a new depth to the characters, because, to be honest, there were some times in the original that everyone BUT Carrie and Miss Collins seemed so two dimensional. In this one, we see just how evil Chris and Mrs. White really are (I was really glad they kept the "insane woman with a sane face" aspect of Mrs. White in this film) and people who always found the interaction with Tommy, Sue and Carrie moving in the book finally get more than we were able to get in the original film.As for the added scenes, while I don't think that the conversation between the principal and Mr. Hargesen was necessary, I felt rather satisfied with it, if only because it was nice to see the principal that I usually hate in this story actually do something right. Then there was the lipstick scene with Sue and Carrie, one of my favorite scenes, actually. It's about time we saw at least a glimmer of the friendship that sort of came about in the story on film. And the one liners that were added onto the script, most of them spoken by Carrie, were absolutely brilliant. "If they run away together, I'll dance with you." Now here's where I go on my acting comments; I actually adored the cast in this film. Even Angela Bettis; I started watching this expecting to hate her compared to Sissy, but she turned out to do a pretty decent job, especially toward the middle of the film. Kandyse McClure was definitely the best Sue Snell, in my opinion. There were times when Emilie de Ravin was just as laughable as Nancy Allen, but then there were the scenes where you wanted to strangle Chris for being such a terrible person. It takes a good actress to achieve that. I loved Rena Sofer as Miss Desjarden; she was essentially the polar opposite of Betty's Miss Collins, but still just as enjoyable to watch.As for the Prom scene, I definitely preferred how they handled it in this film to DePalma's. I felt that it was much better now that everything wasn't so rushed by split screen clips. And the fact that tehy kept the part where Carrie wreaks havoc on the rest of the town was very satisfying.Now here's where I tell you why this didn't get higher than a seven; the ending. Why couldn't the Carrie movies just stick to how it's supposed to end? In the original, they COMPLETELY ruin the bittersweet ending between Carrie and Sue that I loved in the novel. In this one, they take away from the tragedy of it all. Sure, I wish that Carrie could have survived this ordeal every time I read the book or see the original, but the fact that this movie had the gall to ruin the entire mood of this story just for the sake of making it a pilot for a TV show that never came to be was deplorable. Not to mention all the false endings they gave. I would have preferred it if they had at least stopped it at where Carrie's mother grabs her shoulder and says, "Sin never dies". That, at least, would have been forgivable. But to have two false endings was completely unnecessary and a pathetic attempt to copy the effect of the ending that everyone adores from the original. Quit while you're ahead, filmmakers. If you had, people probably wouldn't hate this movie as much as they do.All in all, this wasn't terrible as remakes go. It was actually pretty decent and could have been great, but the filmmakers ruined it with the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call me dumb or call me unaware. I, while watching it at first, thought it was the original. I haven't seen much of the old film ( only a paltry few) and I haven't seen Sissy's face nor have I had much about the movie except that it was fantastic, because in India, especially in Gujarat,there aren't many people who actually watch English movies. I therefore didn't realize at first that it was the remake. Well, after a while, I did.Still, I feel that this is one of the best and thoroughly watchable television remakes I have seen. I felt that it looked a bit old due to the somewhat bad video quality. For a 2002 film, I felt that the CGI quality could've been better. But very good acting from everyone makes the movie a worthwhile watch.The lead actress puts all her efforts and succeeds in conveying her feelings. The only low point was the last twenty minutes where she didn't show the rage that she should have. Fine performances were given from almost all the cast. But the pig slaughter scene was too cheap and looked utterly silly.The flow of the movie is really good and that's what makes it watchable. It is of proper length and isn't extended for too long. The ending was horrible though.I truly recommend this movie for all the couch potatoes. Please don't compare it with the original (Thank God I couldn't as I hadn't seen the original). 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Better Than The Original!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who hate the 2002 version of Carrie: Please! I watched most of the new version on YouTube, and I have decided that it is tons better than the 1976 version of Carrie (for those of you that agree, please read my comment on the old movie). For one thing, although (spoiler warning!) there is some skin shown in the scene where Carrie gets her period, not everything, so to speak, is shown (probably because it is a TV movie). Carrie's mom, Margaret (more spoilers!) is still psycho, but even though she tries to drown her own daughter after she comes home from prom, she is not nearly as bad as she was in the original movie. Chris, although she is still a snob, is not as, well, filthy as she was in the 1976 version. Carrie's prettier and Tommy is cuter in this version too. Another thing (spoilers again!): Carrie does not die, unlike in the old one when the house falls on her. When she is attacked by her mom, she causes her mom to have a heart attack, then Sue Snell (her sort-of-new-friend, the one who set Carrie up with her own boyfriend, Tommy, for prom) saves her. Carrie is believed to have died like her mother, but she has really changed her appearance and Sue is driving her to Florida. For those who like the original, like it all you want. For those who like the 2002 movie: I totally agree that this one is a whole lot better than the original. If you like the cleaner versions of scary movies, such as Psycho and Carrie, and you can't find them out on VHS/DVD, then I recommend (if you have easy access to the Internet) you check them out on YouTube!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, something good from USA Network</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually better than the original Brian De Palma "Carrie". Of course, we all know the Stephen King story of Carrie White, the outcast who wreaks havoc at her high school senior prom. But this time, the story's changed a little. Carrie (Angela Bettis) is still the same outcast with telekinesis (the power to move things with the mind) and the religious freak mom (Patricia Clarkson), she doesn't have any friends, and is daily ridiculed by Chris Hargensen (Emilie de Ravin) and her band of Ultras (the original film was Mortimer Snerds). The story opens as the girls get out of PE and Carrie discovers she's bleeding (menstruation) and she's never had her period before. The other girls, led by Chris, begin to chant "Period!" and Miss Desjarden (Rena Sofer), the PE teacher comes in to stop it. Sue (Kandyse McClure), one of the girls and feeling guilty for picking on Carrie, asks her boyfriend Tommy (Tobias Mehler) to take Carrie to the prom. At first she refuses, believing it's a joke set up by the girls, but happily accepts after being told it's not a joke. If you want to know the ending of this version, which ends a lot differently from the book and original film, watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the reason why someone might say "Whatever happened to real scary TV movies..." Is because they watched these "really scary movies" back when they were children. You've grown up some, your fear factor has been numbed by years of watching horror movies, real life horror, tragedies and now you're nothing but a husk of numbed emotions without the ability to feel real fear unless someone literally puts a gun to your head or find the jet engine of your plane on fire during mid-flight (slight exaggeration of course). I think looking for a made for TV movie to give you the same fear you experienced as a CHILD is being a tad ridiculous. Try to watch this movie without any preconceived notions how it should be made and just enjoy the ride (sorta like when you were a CHILD and not pseudo-critic?).I saw this movie and was very impressed, I love the new Carrie, the only word that comes up for her performance is INTENSE! I loved it and I wish her a great future and I will be watching Taken just to see more of her performance. I have to say, I wished in the original that she lived and so this version of the movie sits well with me. The original of course will always be my favorite, I would recommend both movies.</fullReview>

I know this sounds crazy, but the original was "Believable", and this was just typical of Hollywood, bigger is better, which is not always the case. What a waste of talent and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent. The acting is top notch. They also did a really good job of making it feel modern. I thought Carrie's mother was particularly good at being evil. While Angela (Carrie) did a great job of acting pitiful without over killing the part. The only bad thing about this movie is that IT IS Extremely HARD TO FIND (at least for me)! I had to go to over a dozen video stores before I found it at my local Blockbuster. I think this movie is a classic that everyone should see (as long as you are old enough to see an R rated movie lol). Because it was at TV movie it wasn't rated but I would say that it shouldn't be watched unless you have seen other R rated movies. I have never seen the original so I can't comment as to whether or not this is better but I will say it is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The only other thing that bothered me about this movie (actually nothing to do with the movie its self ) was the fact of how people treat someone like Carrie. For instance when the principal can't even remember Carrie's name. But again this is not a problem with the movie per say it is just a problem with society but that of course is a whole other issue. In closing I will say go to your local video store or favorite online video store and BUY THIS MOVIE!My only hope is that the Blu-Ray version isn't far off.</fullReview>

While I admit this version does follow King's novel more closely at times than De Palma's 1976 film, it also differs badly from it too (I'm mainly referring to that lame ending). This is one of those remakes that tries too hard to be cool and instead only ends up loosing all the heart that the original film possessed. The special FX are weak, the characterizations cold, and the whole movie is quite inferior.The only real highlights come from star Angela Bettis (who was so good in the film May 2003) and supporting actors David Keith and Rena Sofer.Definitely one of the lesser horror remakes of late.* 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

In some ways, Angela Bettis' portrait of Carrie which although may never surpass Sissy Spacek's is more realistic in this day and age. The character was able to express her frustration without the use of her powers and be blunt about her treatment when she explained herself to Sue and her Mother. Maybe in the sequel Carrie can start a new life and have real friends for a time wherever she ended up at 'til the past catches up with her.Probably in ten years or so.</fullReview>

One of the things about this movie that made me feel bad was that Carrie (Angela Bettis) got picked on. You poor thing. I felt good when Miss Desjarden (Rena Sofer) practically manhandled Chris (Emilie de Ravin). I really didn't like Chris. This was because she treated Carrie like dirt and acted snobby, especially every time she picked on Carrie. My favorite character, of course, was Carrie. The prom was one of my favorite parts of this movie. I thought that Carrie looked very beautiful in the prom dress she wore. In conclusion, I recommend this excellent, touching, and scary remake of a classic thriller to all you Sissy Spacek fans who have not seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this remake recently on TNT, and I didn't think it was as good as the original. But I have a question. Weren't certain lines (that are not in the book) lifted directly from the 1976 De Palma version? In fact, it seemed to me at times it was going shot for shot with the original version. I looked to see if the original screenwriter or DePalma were listed in the credits, and they are not. Obviously, this movie expands on the original film, there are more scenes and more dialouge, but at times it seemed a carbon copy. Am I right? Someone let me know.Having said all this, this version is OK, but it ain't close to the classic original. I find the DVD box from MGM to be deceptive-- they obscure the girl's face so you cannot see that it isn't Sissy Spacek. By the way, I was one of the lucky few to see the 1987 Broadway musical version of CARRIE (with Betty Buckley playing Carrie's mother) and LeRoy from FAME playing the Travolta part. Not good. I wish they have video taped it. Carrie singing a love song while using her powers to brush her hair has to be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

I loved Nancy Allen's performance in the original Carrie, she set the standard for the teen blonde bitches, but I thought the actress Emilie De Ravin who played Chris in this one had alittle more depth and made you hate her even more and feel more sorry for Carrie, the same goes for the actor who plays her boyfriend Tommy.The actress who played Carrie in this one (I can't remember her name off the top of my head) did a good job. Not really better than Sissy, but not worse either.

		<fullReview>Carrie (2002)***Contains Spoilers***I have to say, Angela Bettis deserves an Oscar! She's a wonderful actress and is very believable. This version of Carrie follows the book more than the original, like the scene where young Carrie goes next door and the rocks fall through her house. This movie was updated, the shower scene had individual showers for each person, but the shots were basically the same. The acting in this movie was good, and Angela Bettis made it excellent. She deserves an Oscar for her previous horror film "May". She's a wonderful actress, I can't wait to see what movies she'll be in next. Also, this movie had the scene where Carrie walks down the street after destroying the prom, and is throwing cars, breaking houses, starting fires, etc. The prom scene was a bit different, because Carrie notices the bucket of blood seconds before it's spilled on her, and the whole massacre seemed to be extended. I have to say, to serious fans of the 1976 version will be appalled, but others will love it! I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

I had forgotten how great the original movie was until I saw this lame, anemic remake, for which Stephen King should pronounce a truly earth-shattering curse. The wrong people died in this gym fire. They should have stoked the flames with the NBC producers who are responsible for this large, lumpy toad, and then thrown on most of the pathetic cast and, for certain, the alleged director. If there really was one. Most of this played out like a first dress rehearsal for a high school play, and to call it "wooden" would only insult a fine building material with things this production sadly lacked: texture, strength, beauty, etc.Apparently the amateurs who put this together could think of nothing better than to follow the original script with lesser performances, add a few computer-aided crash scenes, and then come up with the stupidest ending one could imagine. It's worth watching only for a laugh, and to make you appreciate the Brian DePalma classic all the more. Remakes do not absolutely HAVE to suck; sometimes new technology and the added freedom that comes with working in a less-Puritanical era can make a remake truly great. Sadly, this was not the case here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night. At first I was going to watch it because I thought it was the original, but when I found out that it was a re-make, I watched it out of curiosity. I wish I could say that it was an improvement, but, except for a few points, I can't. First of all, the acting was disappointing, and the jerky camerawork got on my nerves. I noticed that early on in the movie, Carrie walked pigeon-toed, but later, in her prom gown, she walked like royalty. I also think that Carrie was made to look more retarded than just a little odd, and her hair was way too messy. I kept wanting to brush it out of her eyes. *SPOILER* I was impressed with the attention that was given to the events that took place after the prom, i.e. the objects flying through the air, and things catching on fire. There were 2 moments I found truly creepy; 1) when Billy and Chris see the shape of Carrie standing at the top of the road, and 2) when Carrie goes home and the objects on the floor blocking her path move out of her way by themselves. I did not appreciate the changes to the story, particularly the ending. It was overdone and underdone, at the same time, and I will always feel that the original ending simply cannot be improved upon. And why, oh, why did they make it seem as if Carrie had no control over her powers? Revenge was the whole purpose of this story, and that was completely lost. I will say, however, that the prom destruction scene was very well done. In the final analysis, I have to give this movie a 3, and I stick with my original assessment-don't mess with a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the book "Carrie" and see the 1976 movie and I would like to say that this remake is appalling.The acting itself was mediocre, and the rewriting of the story was just awful.Carrie's telekinetics were blown out of proportion at certain points in the story. For example at the beginning when Carrie is in the office after gym class, she moves the table across the room when the principle keeps calling her 'Cassie'. This is a ridiculous move. The point of the original setting ( an ash tray falling off the desk) is to show Carrie's power slowly coming to surface; not to be totally obvious that anyone sitting in that room could have known Carrie did it.The remake seemed to try to be remaking the movie as well as the book. It should have stuck to one or the other. (Maybe it would have been interesting)The ending was just plain wrong (SPOILER) Carrie is meant to die. I'm sorry. I love the character of Carrie but the point of King's story was the tragic hero. Carrie dies because of her guilt and backlash of her power use.The remake should have made her either die like the original movie or in the book. Not make a totally different ending.This movie was a disappointment in so many ways. It is not worth seeing. If you want to watch something interesting, watch the original "Carrie" or read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My thoughts on the reamke of "Carrie" were as follows. First of all, Angela Bettis was excellent portraying Carrie, not to take anything away from the woman who made the role famous, Sissy Spacek, but the movie was missing an element that could have equaled to the original. Also, Rena Sofer, who played Ms. Desjarden took the role to another level with her aggressive style of discipline. Finally, The other stars that stole the show were the people who played Billy Nolan and Christine Hargensen. They both showed the more evil side of their characters than in the original. ***SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT*** Even in the updated version, the best scenes in the movie is at the Prom. Of course, the scene that I will never forget, just like in the original is when the bucket of pig's blood is dropped over Carrie to everyone's shock while Tina, Kenny, and some of the other guests laugh at the prank. The one part I don't understand is why Sue drove Carrie to Florida. I credit NBC for at least trying to update the movie for the modern times. It was a good remake, but not like the 1976 classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have one question that is even sort of worth asking(time restraints). Why remake this? The original Carrie was superb. It had the right mood, right acting, and right direction. This has nothing. A few decent looking girls, but the main girls were not goodlooking. It has a really goofy guy playing John Travolta's part. It was pathetic when he tried to act like he was crazy. Travolta was likeable while acting sick and insane. The only thing they did that the original did was cast people who look too old to be in highschool. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(*SPOILERS*)Why, I wonder, did they settle for such a rote, by-the-numbers retelling of the original movie? Knowing that the Carrie name on the movie will attract fans of both Stephen King and the De Palma version, couldn't the producers of this remake have had a little fun? Why not set the story in a private school, or make Carrie, say, a Latina with an overly strict but well-meaning Catholic mother from the olde country?And since the writers of this version had an extra hour to work with, why couldn't they have fleshed out the characters more? Margaret White, though memorably portrayed by Piper Laurie in the original, was little more than a crazy religious zealot stereotype. How and why did she become so irrational and weird? Ms. Laurie brings me to another problem with this remake: the cast and their unlikable performances. Angela Bettis' Carrie was a one-note job with no insight or feeling; Bettis' apparently believed she could convey Carrie's thoughts by trembling meekly in close-up, which wore out its welcome by the first commercial break. Yes, Sissy Spacek's interpretation of the character was equally introverted, but she brought something intangible to the role - a quality that endears her to the audience.Maybe that's the fundamental problem with this version: Nobody cast is a familiar face or possesses screen presence. The "Dawson's Creek" rejects populating the TV version can't compare to Spacek, John Travolta, Nancy Allen and William Katt - actors who went on to bigger and better things after De Palma's '76 classic. I'll be surprised if we hear from Angela Bettis again outside late-night Cinemax.But I can't blame everything on the actors. The teleplay is a complete mess, rife with clichés and plot holes (how did two survivors make it out of the air shaft when the building is crumpling around them?). The police-interrogation structure is unnecessary and distracting. And then there's the meteor-rain sequence: Was it a dream, fantasy, or flashback? If it did happen, don't you think it would have gained some notoriety? Wouldn't teams of psychiatrists, meteorologists and parapsychologists have been studying Carrie and the event for years? And, while I'm thinking about it, did this movie even define her telekinetic powers? Were the writers so lazy or absentminded to just assume that the viewer knows what's up?And the less said about the special effects, the better. Don't the latest Playstation titles sport more convincing depictions of destruction? (I won't get into questioning the taste of destroying miles of American soil and murdering hundreds of innocents, or the bloodshed in a school.) The action sequences are edited from seemingly random angles without rhythm or style; even the brief moment with the kid on the bike sneering "Creepy Carrie!" is cut together so haphazardly that what exactly happens would be a mystery if we didn't remember the same scene from the original movie.Finally, the movie's conclusion felt like an awful attempt to be an open-ended pilot for some misbegotten new series. I'm not complaining that it's different than the book (well, I did, but I'm not here), but let's note its problems. So Carrie is drowned in her bathtub until Sue Snell, a petite teenager, revives her with, what, two CPR breaths? Carrie is immediately in decent health with no apparent side effects from being submerged in water for who knows how long. (Sue, meanwhile, looks surprisingly calm after learning that her school was burned to the ground along with most of her classmates.) Later, Carrie visits a rather large tombstone for her mother and her, which leads to two questions: 1) Who paid for such an ornate marble tombstone (and how did Mrs. White make a living?), and 2) Who is in Carrie's grave?Sue later tells Carrie that she will drive her "to Florida, but no further." What's further than Florida? I guess she's promising to not send them both into the Gulf of Mexico, but we've seen Carrie survive one drowning already with nary a problem, so maybe she can start a new life in Tampa at Sea World communicating with Shamu.CARRIE 2002 is poorly acted, written and directed - a waste of three hours.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Remake of carrie was at some moments startling and interesting, at other times, trite and lacking some focus. The best scenes in the film were between Carrie's Mom (Patricia Clarkson) and Carrie herself. These scenes really seemed to have some gusto to them. You felt compelled to see the relationship between mother and daughter here. Clarkson gave a stellar performance as always which is probably what held this film together so well.  I like David Keith a lot, but i really found the detective interview scenes kind of boring. All in all, it wasnt bad, it wasnt grand. Perhaps if they had kept the rest of it as intriguing as the mother/daughter sequences it would have propelled it into a higher level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TRULY AWFUL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** SPOILERS AHEAD!!!I was at first horrified to hear there would be a TV remake of "Carrie" since it is one of my all time favorite movies. Then I was excited when I saw the promos and realized that it was going to be a more faithful adaptation of the book. Then I saw it and was horrified all over again. What a mess! The opening credit sequence (and I use the term "sequence" very loosely) established right off the bat how choppy and incompetent this movie would be. First, a shot of Margaret White right after giving birth to Carrie, then a shot of the flaming stones falling from the sky, then we're in a police station. I tried to let that go and keep an open mind but little things started cluing me in to how lame this version would be. When Ms.Desjardin was recounting to the principal how she'd had her first period when she was ten and that she was "wearing these white pants" another warning bell went off. Having your period while wearing white pants-what a cliche.The scene from Carrie's childhood when she brought the rain of stones down on the house was very poorly done. First of all, since this was something that Carrie was remembering it should have been shown completely from Carrie's point of view. When the stones starting raining on the house we see the incident from the neighbors' point of view rather than from inside the house where Carrie was. And her mother's reaction to these events was not as extreme as you would think. Simply repeating, "Stop it! Stop it!" and finally, "Go to your closet and pray!" hardly conveys the since of horror and bewilderment one would feel if stones were raining from the sky. And ONLY on your house. I missed Piper Laurie's "over the top" performance. In the TV version it seemed that half of Patricia Clarkson's lines were,"Go to your closet and pray."The makers of this version also made so many nods to the original that they might as well have bowed down in humility and forsaken the whole project. Even though this version takes place in the present time the film makers still tried to capture a bit of the look of the original. The actress who plays Sue Snell was simply a black version of Amy Irving right down to the hairdo and they managed to find a tree-lined street that looked remarkably similar to the one in the scene where Carrie knocks over the kid's bike. These are just a couple examples.But the worst thing of all is that the digital effects are excruciatingly obvious. Even the fire at the prom looks fake. The aerial view of the town burning looked especially fake since there are no people running around in panic as there would be in such a disaster. We see exactly ONE police car in this scene-an entire town on fire and there wasn't one fire truck in the entire movie.The acting throughout was spotty at best. Angela Bettis was ok but looked as though she was freezing throughout the entire movie. And whoever that guy was who played Billy Nolan he was awful. There's a scene where a fire hydrant flys into the air and lands on the hood of his car and neither he nor the actress who plays Chris H. flinch. Missing details like that can rob a scene of resonance.And the ENDING!!! Good God!!! Why bother making a version of Carrie that's more "faithful" to the book if in the end you're going to go for a lame-o ending where Carrie's alive and well and living in Florida?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally am a HUGE fan of Stephen King. I own every book he's ever written or had anything to do with. For the most part, I'm not a "fan" of his movies, I'd rather read the books and use my own imagination to play the movie in my head, so to speak. The whole reason I even started to read SK books was because I saw "Carrie" 1976 on tv and it scared the crap out of me and my mom said, you know that's a book...that's all it took and since then - HUGE SK fan right here! I watched this with an open mind, trying not to do the "well that's not how it was in the original" thing. For the most part, that worked...however!!! There are certain things you just can't ignore, can you say CHEESY Special FX!? They were HORRIBLE, not to mention the ending - what was that??? And I'm sorry, but NO ONE can do Billy Nolan like John Travolta did. AND Piper Laurie was MUCH better as the psycho religious mother. I was very disappointed and upset for missing other, better shows to watch this piece of crap remake! There are just some things that are better left alone: Carrie, Psycho, Vertigo, A Nightmare On Elm St., Friday the 13th...Nothing! can beat the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm a Stephen King fan, I recognize that film and TV adaptations of his work have been, ah, uneven at best. That said, this is one of the best adaptations of a King novel to date ... I rank it as somewhere below "Stand By Me" and "Shawshank Redemption," but making a respectable attempt to reach that high. "Carrie" is, by far, THE best TV adaptation of any of King's work. (Note that it is not entirely faithful to the novel, but that the divergence is believable and satisfying. To say more would be too much of a spoiler.)The acting was uniformly good, with all characters less cartoonish (and hence more believable) than in the theatrical version. In particular, Sue, Chris, Billy, and Carrie's mother were far superior. Direction and special effects were both good ... I found the prom and apres-prom scenes much scarier than in the theatrical version.I was, for the reasons mentioned in the first paragraph, skeptical about a remake of "Carrie," but the risk paid off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the re-make of the film Carrie last night. I must say, before watching it, I had my doubts. Few remakes come close to surpassing their predecessor, or being in their league for that matter. Alot of the lines were similar, but a few new aspects were added. One, in particular, is the interrogation of the survivors, which I thought added an interesting dimension to the story. The outcome is similar, with more survivors. There is more given to the backstory of Carrie's childhood and the fact that her telekinetic ability was not something that just appeared, but was something that had been with her when she was young, with no way to really control it. Rena Sofer did an outstanding job as Phys. Ed. teacher Rita Desjarden, Kandyse McClure re-invented a colored version of Amy Irving's original Sue Snell character and Angela Bettis, though she is no Sissy Spacek, brought a very unique version of the Carrie White character to life. I thought David Carson did a great job as director as he made this film his own and did not do much stepping on Brian DePalma's toes. I would definitely watch this again, it compliments the original much more than the lame "Rage: Carrie 2" did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're all going to laugh at this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers inside**At first I was angry that I missed the beginning of the film, I had no idea it was on TV until I caught it in the middle. It is utterly horrible. While they kept the original name of the high school (Ewen), the town (Chamberlain), even remembered to use the original name of the gym teacher (Desjarden), they even remembered the Black Forrest clock. But that is where the similarities end. I don't get why most everyone says this film is so faithful to King's original novel. While it got some details right, it got some others very wrong. It is one thing to have your own version, but if you making a true remake, then make it so. I finally saw the the beginning when this was aired on the Sci-Fi channel. The girls don't throw feminine products at her in the gym, they just pound on the glass window and make comments, but not the famous "plug it up." That shows up on the unbeknownst to Carrie tampon filled locker. This scene was misguided because it implied that the guys were in on it. If you read the novel, while the boys picked on Carrie they did so in different ways than the girls did. (Only Nolan and his pack of idiots, who didn't know what the pigs blood was for, were in on it.) Angela Bettis who played "Carrie" looked like she was having an epileptic fit half the time. I love the original film from 1976, although Brian DePalma failed with making changes to Stephen King's original novel, at least that film was 100 times better than this dreck.Carrie never suffered from amnesia. While she did move furniture waiting for Tommy Ross to take her to the prom she did not crash the ceiling, Margaret White did not go out to hide in the bushes, The Norma character was on the scheme to "get Carrie" at the prom, not the overly nice character you see in this remake.Billy was also a fifties throwback and abusive towards to Christine.I don't understand why they made the character of Sue Snell black. That's all fine and good, but they kept Tommy Ross white. Chamberlain as described in Stephen King's novel was a repressed town as far as mixed dating was concerned, their families would never have allowed it. Also this Sue Snell had a sarcastic modern side to her that the goody-goody version in the original film (and in King's novel) did not. Mrs. White was NEVER understated. She was a scream in your face Jesus freak.And quite possibly the worst scene was the "feel-good/possiblity for a sequel ending"....Carrie DOES NOT die. Stephen King was angry when he saw what Stanley Kubrick did to The Shining. I cannot imagine what he thinks of this mess. Sue Snell drives her to Florida. The whole point of Carrie, was here is this a girl a victim of her religious fanatic of a mother, taunted by her classmates, esp. the girls. When she gets her monthly cycle for the first time they ridicule her in the girls gym dressing room. One girl feels bad for the taunting (Sue Snell) one girl does not (Christine Hargensen)....When Sue decides to let Carrie have her date for the prom. Tommy grows to actually like Carrie (as stated in the book.)--THEY NEVER GET TO DANCE after they are crowned King and Queen of the prom.But for Sue to find Carrie in the bathtub was utterly silly. Margaret White tried to kill Carrie by stabbing her in the shoulder, she falls down the steps, She kills her mother (at least they had her picturing her heart slowing down) and goes to Caviliar bar where Margaret and Carrie's father conceived her. That's where she kills Billy and Chris.The whole point of Carrie was here was this girl that all her of life felt pain, no one heard her scream, and just when she felt that she could LIVE,she died. Her dreams never materialized. Stay away from this film! Watch the 1976 original with the brilliant Sissy Spacek, and please READ the book.1/10</fullReview>

Angela Bettis is perfectly cast as the tormented and put upon Carrie,as is the lovely Emilie de Ravin,who portrays bad girl Chris,Carrie's nemisis. As expected,the modern special effects are great. What sets this version apart,and in some ways makes it better than the original 1976 movie,is it's presentation. The story is revealed very effectively via flashbacks.

		<fullReview>Pretty much everyone knows the storyline, but for those who are sticklers about this sort of thing, ***SPOILERS*** I was all set to hate this new adaptation of my favorite Stephen King novel, but i have to say that I was actually very impressed with the new film. There is so much of the novel that Brian de Palma omits in his film that is covered in this new version, such as the hail of stones that happened when Carrie was a little girl, and the destructive walk Carrie takes through town, before stopping her mother's heart. In de Palma's film, Carrie telekinetically "crucifies" her mother (if you look at the crucifix in Carrie's closet, you will see that the Christ figure is in the same position that Piper Laurie is in at the end of the film), while the new film retains Carrie's stopping of her mother's heart. The only problem I have the new film is that in the novel, Carrie's mother delivers one final monologue prior to stabbing her daughter &amp; having her heart stopped, then Carrie bleeds to death. In de Palma's film, Carrie's mother delivers (more-or-less) the same monologue, stabs her daughter &amp; then is skewered by practically every knife in the kitchen.In this new version, the monologue is concpicuous in its absence, and Margaret White drowns Carrie in the bathtub. I wonder why the new director opted to eliminate this very important monologue. Did he feel Patricia Clarkson couldn't deliver it? But I digress. The new film ends with Sue Snell reviving Carrie &amp; driving her to Florida. HUH? The new ending has obviously been tacked on to appease TV viewers. Though I personally think the world is a scarier place with Carrie in it, I don't feel it is appropriate to the story. And now a word about the acting: Good to Excellent, across the board. Kandyse McClure brings depth to Sue Snell, a character that was just too sweet to be true as portrayed by Amy Irving. This was a surprising piece of non-traditional casting. Rena Sofer played the Rita Desjardin that I read in the novel, not the "Miss Collins" that sweetness &amp; light Betty Buckley portrayed. I loved it when Miss Desjardin cornered Tommy Ross at the Prom and told him to show Carrie nothing less than the time of her life, not to mention when she throws a bag full of tampons at those nasty girls in the locker room.Emilie de Ravin's Chris Hargensen is even more venomous than Nancy Allen, yet somehow more human. She actually hesitates and has to be convinced to go through with her horrific joke. The actor who played Billy Nolan is not listed on IMDB (oddly, Jasmine Guy is credited as "Ruby Moore" and I never saw her once in the film), but he was truly chilling. John Travolta's Billy gives no hint of how evil the character is in the book. Tobias Mehler is much cuter than William Katt. That's about all I can say there. Patricia Clarkson's performance as Margaret White is quite good, although the character is written differently. Where Piper Laurie was positively fanatical, Clarkson seems almost nice in comparison. One thing de Palma kept from the novel that the new version omits is Margaret's tendency to scourge herself. Perhaps today's audiences wouldn't understand it, but I feel that sort of behavior is key to understanding Margaret. Angela Bettis is no Sissy Spacek, but today's Carrie is not yesterday's Carrie. Bettis' seizure-like "episodes" go a long way toward explaining why Carrie is (and always has been) an outcast. Bettis' shaking, her crossed eyes, etc. are a far cry from the wide-eyed Carrie that Spacek gave us.Overall, I give this movie 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

If the movie was good in the first place, then leave it alone. I feel the same way with Planet of the Apes, but that is a different story.

		<fullReview>I literally just finished watching this remake of the 1976 classic (well, I think it's a classic) about ten minutes ago. We all basically know the plot and what happens at the end, so I'll skip straight to my take. I'll warn you, mostly I'm going to compare it to the old movie. Just to be on the safe side, I'll also warn you of a few potential spoilers.Angela Bettis and Sissy Spacek are very different, but both portrayed Carrie brilliantly in different ways. Spacek looked more mousy and innocent, while Bettis looked angry and disturbed. But all of these things were part of the actual character Carrie; they just don't surface at the same time.Most will say Piper Laurie was scarier than Patricia Clarkson as Margaret White, but I disagree. Yes, Laurie was meaner at first glance and didn't seem to care about her daughter at all, and Clarkson looked nice and only did a few mean things to her daughter. But think about it: Every single time Clarkson lashed out at Carrie--when she smacked her, poured tea on her, dragged her off to the closet, and pushed her underwater--it was sudden and made you jump. She was unpredictable. In my opinion, this is what makes her scary.The gym teacher in the original version was definitely friendlier, while the one here was a little bit of a psycho bitch. Also, Sue was sassier to the police in this one than the squeaky-clean Sue in the original. However, one thing that separates this from the original is Billy. The Billy in the remake will give me nightmares. The way he killed that pig, and threatened Chris--aah! And John Travolta's character in the last one was just a smartass. But other than this, and the considerably changed ending that I won't give away, the remake isn't much different than the original. This made-for-TV movie is definitely worth checking out, and so is the original with Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.</fullReview>

Personally, no one will ever top Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Nancy Allen, and Amy Irving as Carrie &amp; Margaret White, Chris Hargison, &amp; Sue Snell respectively. Spacek brought the right mixture of innocence &amp; madness to the role, as did Laurie the twisted sense of faith-based duty. Allen was wonderfully evil and Irving the perfect girl-next-door. The best thing about Irving/Snell's look-alike update in the current film is that she is a pretty black girl, a much-needed injection of color into King's originally all-white story. The special effects are superior to the original as well, altho I wish it was as fleshed-out as King's original vision; more parental units could be on hand than Clarkson's spinsterish Margaret, a tougher &amp; heftier character who would have been much better played by King stalwart Kathy Bates. The boy playing Tommy in the current version is even less charming than Billy Katt's original. The only actor I enjoyed in this new version was Rena Sofer as a lovely Rita DesJardines; she was the only person who seemed real to me, especially in her early scenes with those rotten schoolgirls.There are a couple of scenes which are total fabrications not in the book. Fellow "Carrie" fans will spot them immediately, including the heroine's fate, which was much more moving in the original. The film simply has one ending too many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth checking out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I literally just finished watching this remake of the 1976 classic (well, I think it's a classic) about ten minutes ago. We all basically know the plot and what happens at the end, so I'll skip straight to my take. I'll warn you, mostly I'm going to compare it to the old movie. Just to be on the safe side, I'll also warn you of a few potential spoilers.Angela Bettis and Sissy Spacek are very different, but both portrayed Carrie brilliantly in different ways. Spacek looked more mousy and innocent, while Bettis looked angry and disturbed. But all of these things were part of the actual character Carrie; they just don't surface at the same time.Most will say Piper Laurie was scarier than Patricia Clarkson as Margaret White, but I disagree. Yes, Laurie was meaner at first glance and didn't seem to care about her daughter at all, and Clarkson looked nice and only did a few mean things to her daughter. But think about it: Every single time Clarkson lashed out at Carrie--when she smacked her, poured tea on her, dragged her off to the closet, and pushed her underwater--it was sudden and made you jump. She was unpredictable. In my opinion, this is what makes her scary.The gym teacher in the original version was definitely friendlier, while the one here was a little bit of a psycho bitch. Also, Sue was sassier to the police in this one than the squeaky-clean Sue in the original. However, one thing that separates this from the original is Billy. The Billy in the remake will give me nightmares. The way he killed that pig, and threatened Chris--aah! And John Travolta's character in the last one was just a smartass. But other than this, and the considerably changed ending that I won't give away, the remake isn't much different than the original. This made-for-TV movie is definitely worth checking out, and so is the original with Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much much better treatment than the original theatrical release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the theatrical release after it was recommended quite highly - and frankly didn't know what the fuss was all about. I had not read the original novel by Stephen King and was told that the movie would appeal to me more if only I took the time to read the book. Many years later, I have still not read the book (sorry!) but watched the 2002 version of the story .... and was pleasantly surprised. The characters were better drawn out and notably, the character of Carrie was less freak and more troubled teen. The mother's character was also better portrayed. All in all, this production just goes to show that not all remakes are a waste of time.....or effort. I would recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** It was pretty good and some aspects were better than the original but nothing could beat Piper Laurie in the original. Clarkson wasn't that good, I would had gotten Kathy Baker for the mother. ***SPOILER*****The part when Carrie doesn't remember what happened at the prom, I liked that. It shows that Carrie isn't a bad person; she isn't evil. Chris, her boyfriend, and half of the high school were evil. And also when the teacher does a total 180 and developed a thirst for vengence for Carrie, I also liked that. For people that don't know yet, this isn't just a made-for-tv movie, it is a pilot and I hope it gets picked up because I would love to see what happens after the movie ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the remake of 'Carrie' advertised I was dismayed. "Why" I yelled. "Do something new! Remakes of existing films for TV are never good!" I couldn't have been more mistaken. David Carson's direction was excellent. The entire cast and crew deserve major recognition for this piece of work. Bryan Fuller knows how to weave a tale, for another wonderful tale by Mr. Fuller, watch Star Trek Voyager episode 7.21 "Friendship One" Angela Bettis was not only shockingly creepy when required, but absolutely beautiful when heading to the prom. The supporting cast was exceptional. I felt absolute disdain for those who were to be hated, and compassion or suspicion for those who were sympathetic to Carrie's situation. If you're out for gore, this is not the movie for you. It is the best Made for TV movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, first off, There was NO need for this film. The original was a CLASSIC. Sissy Spacek was a much more believable Carrie. Angela Bettis -wel, let's just say, she wasn't even fit to play the wall. The kids in this movie seem so FAKE! They look like they fell out of a magazine! Nancy Allen, Sissy Spacek, Amy Irving, and William Katt were amazing! The characters they formed were exactly like the book! I'm a HUGE Stephen King fan, and having read the book many times, the 1976 CLASSIC was 100% perfect.And, most specifically, the prom scene. *spoilers* After they dumped the blood on her, Sissy pulled of a telekenetic trance. Angela Bettis looked like she had been mummified.And the role of Tommy Ross was a HORRIBLE choice I don't know what the director was thinking, but he should have asked Brian DePalma for some advice. I give this film a negative 50</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. I watched this tonight. I think it has killed me. Hopefully, before the tumor that watching it implanted in my brain spreads and extinguishes my life, I can write this as a final warning to never see this movie.First of all: Made for TV. That should throw up about a million automatic red flags in your head.Second. Jesus Christ this movie makes me livid beyond the capacity for rational thought. First of all, the whole thing is just over-saturated in white. Its like the white leaps out of the screen and punches you right in the face with its whiteness. You may think I'm kidding, but I'm not.The narrative is horrible. Like, forty minutes in, it randomly does a flashback where some meteors fall. And you think that might just be fantasy, but it turns out MUCH LATER IN THE MOVIE that the meteors did, in fact, fall. Just no one decided to mention it. Oh, the movie is OVER TWO HOURS LONG. Hardly ANY movie, much less the WORST MOVIE EVER should be that long. And oh, it is just so bad. The characters are stilted and zero-dimensional. I don't even remember any of their names, beyond Carrie. There's one dude, he's "Psycho Teenager", and thats all he is. He's skinny, and he constantly keeps his chin tucked down so he's supposed to look intimidating, but its all so LAUGHABLE. In one scene, he kills a pig, but he sings the "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin", and the whole thing is so ridiculous.Oh, and all the girls in this film were white. Even the black girl. And they were all ugly, but supposed to be pretty. Probably because they couldn't actually afford pretty girls. And there was no gore, because it was made for TV.And when the bucket of pig's blood fell on her, it fell for like, a year. Seriously. A million jillion gallons of blood must have been in that some sort of extra-dimensional bucket.And the ending. Jesus Christ THE ENDING. So like, Carrie survives in this one, with the help of Whitefriend Blackgirl. And they're in a graveyard, and her dead mother shows up. But it turns out to be a dream. She's in the car with Whitefriend. And then Whitefriend turns into chief female antagonist, and attacks Carrie. BUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE ANOTHER DREAM. And then it shows Carrie's face, and pans down to the car door, where the film abruptly turns to credits.This film is unsaveable. Like, if the last 10 minutes suddenly turned into Ninjas and Vikings and Bikers and Pirates having a brawl while a chorus line of monkeys in tuxedos danced and sang, while Bruce Campbell emcee'd the whole thing, it would still been terrible. No, wait, it could have been saved, but if, and only if a time machine made of guns, drugs, and money popped out of the screen during the credits, and it was piloted by a robot who took you back in time to before you saw the movie and said "Instead of seeing this movie, lets go on an adventure using the component parts of this time machine!", and off you go to Tijuana for a drug and booze soaked time, with running gun battles with the Mexican Mafia or something. And then you sell the robot for BILLIONS of dollars so you become rich beyond your wildest dreams. That is the only thing that could have saved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Remake, Closer to the Novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never did see this "Carrie" remake while it had it's television run, but I rented it on DVD and found it to be a worthy remake of the 1976 horror classic. The plot is basically the same as the original film. Carrie White is a shy, mousy high school teenager who lives a strict and isolated life with her overbearing religious mother. She is harassed at school by classmates, and suffers physical and emotional abuse by her mother. Carrie begins to learn that she has some strange powers - if she concentrates enough, she can move objects with her mind. As her powers begin to grow, Carrie is invited to prom by Tommy, the boyfriend of a girl named Sue who asked him to take her out as an apology after playing a prank on Carrie in the locker room. But when Carrie is doused with pig's blood at the prom by Chris Hargensen and her boyfriend Billy, her telekinetic powers are released, and all hell breaks loose.It'd be nearly impossible to raise this remake to the level of the original, especially since it was originally a television mini-series, but it was much better than expected. Having read the novel, one sure thing I can say about this film is that it was much closer to Stephen King's book. The 1976 version didn't include a lot from the novel and left some holes here and there, and this film pretty much covered it all. Some of the special effects were a little cheap looking, but weren't bad for a TV movie. Angela Bettis plays Carrie this time around, and I absolutely loved her work in "May" and Tobe Hooper's horror remake "The Toolbox Murders", she has talent. Patricia Clarkson, while not nearly as scary as Piper Laurie was in the original, plays her role quite well. Emilie DeRavin ("The Hills Have Eyes" remake) was also very good in her role as the bitchy Chris, who torments Carrie. While they hardly resemble the actors in the original film, the cast did a good job.The prom scene was much longer and dragged on a bit if you ask me, but there were some neat things that took place and it was overall interesting to watch. The whole film is constructed around the actual police investigation into the disaster caused by Carrie's telekinesis, and the events are recalled by witnesses in rather long flashback sequences, which was a somewhat creative way to tell the story. The only major bad thing I can say about the film is the lackluster conclusion, that completely changed the whole film around from what it should have been. Turns out Carrie doesn't die after the prom, and Sue has been hiding her out during the investigation. This revelation of course eliminates the classic hand-from-the-grave scene with Sue, which was a bit disappointing. This bizarre ending to the story was apparently written with the intent of a "Carrie" television series, but the idea was dropped because of the low rating. Kind of a lame idea if you ask me.To sum things up, "Carrie" is a pretty good remake of a classic. While it isn't nearly as good as the original film was, it sticks closer to the novel that it's based on and gives a little more explanation, and I was entertained by it. It's not quite as bad as many people here are saying it is. 7/10</fullReview>

Carrie gets bullied in school which makes her angrier everyday.I haven't seen the original from 1976 but the death scenes in this one were kinda bad but bloody enough. I don't think that you will regret watching it. I think one of the movie goals was to show how offensive some kids can be now a days and that you need to respect all your school mates.Just watch it yourself and build your own opinion.</fullReview>

Patricia Clarkson's portrayal of the abusive ,over religious mother was poor. Personally,I think Piper Laurie's Portrayal of Margaret was superb and so powerful. The prom scene was good but the pig blood looked unrealistic. The special effects are OK and are way better than the original's. A few things have changed though. For example: the name of the school is Ewin high, not bates high, Ms. Collins is now called Ms. Desjardin, And watch out for that twist ending! I think this movie is worth viewing and is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another take on Carrie. It is well made, but this does not distract from the fact that it is entirely superfluous. Make up your own mind though, there are worse time wasters out there.There are good points about this 2002 version of Carrie. It is quite true to the book and generally solid in terms of the plot and the characters. If you have not seen a version of Carrie yet and have not read the book or prefer a true adaptation, this might be the one for you. It is a very up to date movie. Nice special effects, shaky camera and personalized style, everything everyone else does nowadays.When Brian DePalma made his version of Carrie it was also quite well situated in its time and style. It is far more stylish and relied more upon the talents of the actors, which were at least were Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek are concerned fantastic. In my opinion Brian De Palma's film has more soul, is more entertaining. However, De Palma's film was not as true to the book as the film by David Carson. Than again, Stephen King liked the 1976 version quite well. He understood that good books do not automatically make good cinema and need adaptation.Overall this does not explain why I gave this movie only a 5 out of 10. The reason for this is waste, a waste of resources and a waste of my time. Carrie 2002 does not bring forward anything new. Anything seen in this film you have probably seen before. It is bland and inconsequential. Aren't there any new scripts out there? Was it really necessary that the makers of this movie had to produce yet another remake? And here we hit the point where the 2002 Carrie looses, originality, which is something that Brian De Palma's Carrie still has, even after nearly 30 years. I would call the 2002 version of Carrie uninspiring and uninspired.My recommendation is: If you like stylish movie and fantastic acting go for Brian De Palma's version of Carrie. If you prefer a true adaptation and like reality TV, this here, the 2002 version of Carrie by David Carson might be the better one for you.In the end I wish that some of the production costs squandered on this unnecessary remake would have been used to realize something new and original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this remake necessary? Not really, but it is well-done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose my summary speaks for itself. Brian De Palma's "Carrie" was a good yet often emotionally icy adaptation of Stephen King's novel of high school hell (and too often surrendered itself to style over substance, from the obnoxiously 'symbolic' kitchen-utensil crucifixion of Piper Laurie to the long tracking shots of the rope attached to the bucket of pig's blood, etc.); in 1999, a sequel (but really just a thinly disguised remake in and of itself) was released, that updated the situations and characters to a self-absorbed teen culture, with its emphasis on style and discrimination. This TV version of "Carrie" is better than the sequel, and unlike De Palma's 1976 original, its focus is on emotional depth and characterization. The young cast (headed by Angela Bettis, who is easily Sissy Spacek's equal, homeley and despaired, yet sympathetic) offers capable performances, above average for a TV production, and the writing is keenly in tune with King's work. The prom scene, lacking De Palma's split screen and explicit violence, manages to be just as--if not more--horrifying and humiliating; it's less stylistic and more emotional. Granted, near the end some heavy CGI begins to take over, but it doesn't diminish the overall impact of this update of "Carrie."6/10</fullReview>

She is very good at playing misfits who are sweet, innocent and DEADLY!!!And I'd heard a lot of people criticize this TV remake of the Sissy Spacek film.

I figured that would be just about ALL I'd like about this version of Carrie. After all, everyone knows that TV movies are never as good as theatrical ones, right???But as I watched this movie, I was very impressed. The performances of Bettis and Patricia Clarkson as Carrie's holy roller mom were outstanding and chilling. But the writer of this TV script also deserves a nod. I've never been more impressed with TV writing before. It was just clever, with humor, and unpredictable.The special effects were not perfect, but they were impressive for TV. The guy who played Carrie's date was TOO OLD to be a high school kid. The girls who were mean to her were well acted, and the guy who slaughtered the pig was a real psycho. His eyes looked crazy even.Good movie. I give it an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst adaption ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just sat through this diabolical version of 'Carrie' and I have never been so disappointed with a remake in my life...attempts at rehashing the classics are usually pretty awful but this is by far the winner. I highly do not recommend it if you are a fan of the original, the reasons being that all the humour, shocks and charisma of it are not present.The new (and unimproved) roles are filled by cardboard people, all shaped from the same mould. Everyone is cocky, self-serving, aggressive and sarcastic, unlike the original, where everyone seemed like everyday people. Angela Battis didn't have the same tortured effect as Sissy Spacek, I wasn't moved by her performance at all. Piper laurie was fantastic and frightening in the role of Mrs White, this one was drab and not menacing in the least.The new Billy Nolan was certainly not as appealing as the young Travolta. Even the new suave Tommy Ross looked the same as every other young male in the school, so what was it that Carrie was drawn too? As for the sports teacher, she was the worst of the lot and would probably be more at home on the set of 'Baywatch'.This is a weak, boring film with a happier ending than the original, of which left me open-mouth with shock, sadness and wonder...this versions nice ending left me feeling a bit p***ed off and angry that I had wasted my time watching it. Special effects don't make for a great movie, other aspects are needed to, like characters and situations you can identify with. My mum quit watching half way through, I wish I had followed suit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a remake, just another take on the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saying this is a remake of the '77 film is like saying the Odd Couple tv show was a remake of the movie (It was based on the play). I have never read the book before, but I have read enough books based on movies. There is always a different spin on a film based from a book. That is what this basically is: A different take, NOT A REMAKE. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, here is what I think of the film. I rather liked it. I know this would be something different from the '77 film, so I decided to judge it separate from the first version. Angela Bettis is game for the lead role of Carrie White. She makes it her own and does not try to copy Sissy Spacek's style. I could feel her emotion searing through the TV. Patricia Clarkson is good as her mother, and is far different from Piper Laurie's rendition. Clarkson basically plays it down, but she is still as scary. Another really good performance is David Keith as the cop trying to come to the bottom of what happened. Rene Sofer is worth mentioning as Coach Dejarden. Her performance is basically updated as a 21st-century woman, rather than a woman just doing a job. I found most of the other kids (aside from the girl who played Sue Snell) more like cardboard cutouts. They basically act like one-dimensional stereotypes of what kinds of cliques are found in a high school. Aside from the negatives of this film, I still liked it. Just remember when you watch this that its another take, not a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TELLING A GREAT STORY WELL... FINALLY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1976, a classic psycho-horror film was released that began or enhanced a number of Hollywood stars' careers. But the film hasn't aged all that well over the years.Now, don't get me wrong. All the actors do a great job; all the film work and production design is firstrate. But this is a story about the daughter of a religious zealot who has almost occult powers of telekinesis, and that from the day she's born. In 1976, without the help of computers, the filmmakers had to do the best they could to give the illusion of fidelity to Stephen King's book without really being able to be truthful to the supernatural (for lack of a better term) happenings within that story.Now, finally, technology has caught up to this great story exploring kids' inhumanity to kids. We can become fully immersed in this girl's world, and in her special abilities. We get to see all of them instead of just the most basic ones at the climax. And they're done incredibly well; you really believe this girl is doing all this with her mind.That's one other problem with the original - as great as it is, none of the actors portraying these high school kids were anywhere near high school age when the film was made. This longer version is more true to the original intent of the story for many reasons; one of the most important is by having the kids portrayed by teenage actors.And you get a much more complex perspective of the mother and the relationship between Carrie and Margaret. And the updating of the story works beautifully; it's all much more believable and true-to-life. Just watch the scene at the pig farm. That Billy Nolan is damned scary. You would not want to be caught up in a fight with this guy.All this to say that there's nothing more refreshing than telling a great story well; telling it with as much respect for the source materials as possible while still making the story work for the particular medium and the particular time. Personally, I always thought it was an old-fashioned, cliched cop-out to have Carrie have to die at the end. It's much more realistic and interesting if she has to find some way to go on living with all that she's done - that's a much worse punishment than simply being executed by the storytellers. All in all, a great new version of this terrific, scary story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on its premiere on NBC in November. I was facsenated. When it was over, it left me breathless. I was just stunned. The cast was trully amazing. The script, superb. Makeup was WONDERFUL! I was left stunned by Carrie's journey, I guess you could say. I, like so many others, am not popular in High School. Some people still tease me and I could really see through Carrie's eyes, the torment and suffering she went through. And when the pig's blood was spilled on her, she looked so happy before it happened. It was so sad. She was HAPPY, for once. She had such a terrible life and those ******* pulled that prank. She was smiling, and that happened to her... I was near tears when I was laying in bed that night reviewing the movie. SERIOUSLY. I was. The whole movie was soo soo according to the book. Until the VERY, VERY end. But that doesn't bring down the greatness of the rest of the movie. Don't miss it! I seriously reccomend! 9.8/10</fullReview>

This only serves to remind you just how great the original movie and even "The Rage" are. Just about everybody is miscast, the acting is weak, the stars have no chemistry, and the special effects are terrible. There is no touching coming of age story. There's no suspense or terror this time around. Instead, this is a bloated mess. The makers take and expand the material by 30 to 40minutes. They add scenes that have no merit. They do nothing to enhance or add meaning to the film. This is easily the most disappointing horror film of the new decade. Why this was even made is beyond me.</fullReview>

A girl is tortured by her high school mates and made afraid and foolish by her psychopath religious mother, and puts up with it until she discovers she has telekinetic powers. Personally, it wasn't AS good as the original 1976 De Palma film, but was very close to capturing the atmosphere and tension of the original. I really enjoyed this miniseries and I think most King fans and horror fans will too, even fans who refuse to like a new version of a classic film better, as some people have who've reviewed this. 4/5Rated R for violence, profanity and thematic elements</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carrie White is a lonely, shy teenage girl with unbelievable telekinetic powers, and is slowly being pushed to the edge of insanity by frequent bullying from classmates at her school, and her own mother. Soon, she discovers she has these telekinetic powers; and when the most gruesome of gags is played on her on prom night, rage takes over....Obviously as the film is made for TV, and it's back 11 years, it looks very cheap, and the special effects are tragic, like something you'd expect to see on the SyFy channel.But overlook all of this, and you have a very, very faithful adaptation of the classic story, which doesn't taint the original, makes the remake look even more pointless than what it is, and has the inclusion of a police enquiry.Bettis makes this movie. Her portrayal of Carrie is one of total desolation, and you cannot help but empathise with her. She makes you realise that the story isn't just about about a woman who can move things with her mind, its about a girl who has everything against her from day one.She gets no reprieve at school, or at work, and when she fights back, she ends up having to vanish (in this telling anyway). This version, along with De Palmas masterpiece, show you how much of a depressing and sad story Carrie actually is.Its a little too long in places, and it could have easily been trimmed to the 100 minute mark, but its watchable, and Bettis is wonderful.Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and any other movie. There is not another piece of drama that so correctly portrays the teen bully. They're not just mean. They're also stupid, annoying, exasperating, reminiscent of a spoiled toddler. The attention to detail when portraying them, alone, makes this movie an award-worthy work of art. This particular Carrie has the misfortune of being smarter than them. Smart enough to know that they'd all trip and fall on their faces if they spent a day in her shoes. This is where our TV Carrie out-does her 70s counterpart. She's not just "shy" and "nice", she's noticeably annoyed, right from the start. She's got it all figured out, and is waiting for everyone else to catch up. She actually comes right out and tells one of them that they are not better than her. Unlike those who fall back on nostalgia to give the original a higher rating, I will give facts to demonstrate how this one outshines: 1. Sorry all you sexists out there, Miss Desjarden actually has authority over Tommy Ross in this one... and he knows it. 2. Miss Desjarden doesn't just sit down and tell Carrie "I remember back when I was Chris and Sue in high school." No, her sympathy roots from similar experiences, even humorous ones, explaining a prom ruined for her by a huge maturity difference between her and her prom date. She didn't date the basketball star! 3. The speech Miss Desjarden gives to Carrie at that prom is one every picked-on high school kid needs to hear, not only to help them survive high school, but because it's true. Uh... yeah... it's just a dance, and high school sure ain't the world. 4. I'd be willing to bet every high school has a Kenny smirking every time you see him, and a Norma befriending you to your face but so shallowly slamming you after she thinks you're dead, and a Tina who about wets her pants when she discovers you're on the ballot list for a recognition. But I think this guy must have caught it on camera as it happened, cause they do it so perfectly. Oh, and a jock kid in the library who asks some girl "so are you saying it's mine or what?" (referring to a baby?), to get her to respond, "whatever" and get off his back so he can turn his attention to more important matters, like bullying shy girls.This movie, with it's perfect mix of humor, drama, and a lawsuit-wielding father who doesn't even care that his bratty daughter wasn't even slapped in this rendition, is a masterpiece. It will one day be a classic. I was disappointed, afterwards, to finally see the original. I love that Carrie "doesn't care" that this boy is just like the rest of them, and that Miss Desjarden proudly marches into the locker room and carelessly tosses around comments that might imply she's gay, and that the teen neighbor advises a 4-year-old to "do yourself a favor and run away from home" to protect herself from abuse, and that nobody in our list of smarter characters really seems to care at all what the average high school teen thinks, because that truly is the best way to survive it. This movie had a much more positive message than the original. No suggestions from Desjarden that Carrie fix her own problems with make-up and hair care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An accurate transfer from novel to film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The guy who wrote the last comment must not read...Unlike the 70s version, this movie follows the classic Steven King Novel to the letter. Save for being set in the present decade (The book was set in the 70s) The Made for TV Carrie eliminates all the inaccuracies with the classic film. The acting wasn't bad in my opinion, but it wasn't phenomenal either. There was some great talent in the film, mostly unknowns. I was especially pleased that the actor who plays Billy Nolan made up for Travolta's pathetic performance in that role. Nolan is Malevolent, and Cruel. Travolta basically took his performance in Greece over to Carrie, that stereotypical 50s Greeser Happy days bull. Carrie White was played well I thought, again better than the 70s version. Carrie wasn't stupid, she was submissive and ignorant of social norms. The dumb country bumpkin routine of the 70s was replaced by a nervous, gullible, but Intelligent Carrie White. I do admit the 70s Carrie fit the role better in appearance, but aesthetics never phases me. In the realm of the setting, the modernized setting did add some new perspective. I would have preferred it to stay set in the 70s however, but I'm not complaining, 8 stars for a good but not great mini-series, that stays true to the source.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in all, very respectable version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first caught this made-for-TV remake when it originally aired and was impressed with several elements.First off: The acting. I thought that Angela Bettis did a fine job, as did the supporting players - particularly the actor (sorry, not sure of his name) who played Billy Nolan in this version as much more menacing than Travolta. (He was so scary-looking in the pig-slaughtering scene that it didn't matter that you could see none of the gore; it was all in his face, along with the faces of the other actors who COULD supposedly see what he was doing.) Also, Patricia Clarkson as Carrie's mother was so low-key and soft-spoken that when she did become violent with her daughter it seemed to come from nowhere, even given all the outrageous things she was saying.Next: Screenplay. What I liked most was the inclusion of two of my favorite scenes from the book - the flashback to Carrie's childhood that shows what happened when her mother tried to punish her for talking to the sunbathing teenage girl next door, and the confrontation between the principal of the school and Chris Hargensen's father, who threatens a lawsuit unless they fire the gym teacher and let his spoiled princess of a daughter go to the Prom. He expects to walk all over the principal, but it doesn't quite work out that way.All in all, "8" out of "10". Impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, HELL NO what did they DO??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My all-time favorite film is definitely Carrie, yes, but NOT THIS Carrie.Oh, i waited so long to get this DVD for so many months after aired on TV in the US and Canada. But hell, The first 10 minutes you see how bad the acting was by the girls and especially Tommy Ross, my god how bad. Then all the time while going through the movie you see survivors talking with a detective 2 weeks after the prom, that's so so so annoying, you really can't imagine.The MUSIC, HELL, could this woman please make no music at all anymore, for not any production, it was totally screwed-up, it really didn't fit in the scenes that were played. Like, Carrie get it's bucket with pig blood all over her, and she takes revenge, what happens? a catchy nice melody is playing, like on someones birthday, it really wasn't excited AT ALL.The scenes and the ending of the movie were also totally different from the Stephen King novel, people say it's more like the novel, well, i can't see which scenes exactly, besides the stones falling from the sky. Then this what's on the DVD "featuring eye-popping special effects and a shocking, all-new twist ending!" No No NO, this can't be happening, the CGI effects were SO bad, i was shaking NO with my head while watching it, terrible. Ending is Horrible, twist ending?, yeah, i wanted to turn off the DVD immediatly.Then another thing which is STUPID in this movie, Carrie don't know what menstruation is, BUT she does know what internet is, and you know what, she even talks about BOTOX injections, GOD! The only thing i give it a FAIR rating is because Angela Bettis plays Carrie very well, she performs almost like Sissy Spacek did. The voice "IT'S CARRIE" looks the same, and she's also very weird acting, thumbs up for Angela.People, stick with the old Carrie, deny the split screen and then watch Carrie 2 after, because this, A masterpiece of the baddest taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POSSIBLE SPOILERS -- Good, but take more ideas from the book please -- POSSIBLE SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!As any good movie based on a novel should do, the TV remake of "Carrie" inspired me to get ahold of Stephen King's original 1974 novel about this misfit teen-aged girl who has telekinetic powers.The main elements from the novel re-appear here in the new movie: Girl from a small town in Maine (Chamberlin, to be exact) emotionally abused by her devoutly religious mother (who practiced a very base, hateful form of Christianity, if it can be called that); ridiculed at school by most of her classmates (e.g., the period incident in the shower); the nice boy asks her to the junior-senior prom, not knowing that he is a pawn in a game that will lead her into a humiliating experience; her telekinetic powers are revealed and leads to a night of terror for everyone involved and not involved with the prom incident.I really enjoyed the special effects in the final 45 minutes or so. The police interviews were alright, but here's where we get into possibly more ideas for how "Carrie" could really have been an outstanding movie, and here's where we mention King's original novel. Softening Miss Desjarden's character when interacting with Carrie (sympathetic and helping break her out of her shell) was also a good touch; she's someone who roots for Carrie. And yes, it was fairly well acted, too.Yup, it'd be the springboard for a number of ideas, which might include:? Witness depositions from the police investigation (as per the book) ? Material taken from the magazine and newspaper articles. One of the articles, said to be written four months after Prom Night focusing on the after-effects, was very sad.New ideas might have included:? CNN/Fox News Network-style live update on the Prom Night disaster to start the film, and interspersed news reports after the disaster unfolds. ? The inclusion of characters from the "Law and Order" family of TV shows. I'm sure Jerry Orbach would do a fine job in his Lennie Briscoe character, as would Sam Waterston in his role as Assistant D.A. Jack McCoy. ? Focus on the innocent (and not-so-innocent) teen-agers and others who died in the Prom Night disaster at the school and elsewhere in Chamberlin. The ideas would make one emotional, so I won't go into them here, but they could be endless.I might have even deviated a little from the book, just to make it a little more interesting. Example: Tommy Ross (Carrie's date for that fateful night) dies from a head injury when the pigs' blood buckets hit him. I might have had him regain consciousness outside the school (the people carrying him out would have also escaped), and then demand answers from Billy and Chris at Mr. Nolan's apartment. After Tommy and Billy get into a big fight, Chris sneaks away only to end up killed when she tries to confront Carrie. Mr. Nolan's would end up arrested by the "Law and Order" cops and having to pay big time.The final idea: After months of despair in Chamberlin, show it on the rebound. You showed us the base, hateful form of Christianity in the character of Margaret White; now present the good side with people wanting to rebuild their burned out town.But those are just my ideas. Again, a good movie, but you always can improve upon it. 7.5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kudos to Bettis in a dissapointing remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give Kudos to NBC just for trying to remake this movie and including scenes from the book missing from the Theatrical release.I also commend Angela Bettis for her take on Carrie, which though wasn't as believable, or sympathetic as Sissy Spacek's, deserves recognition as a bold and creative approach.My problem with this version is pretty simple...I found myself not caring. Most of the actors brought no energy to their role. I find this particularly unforgivable for the characters of Mrs. White, Mrs. Desjarden, Chris and Billy (Kenny?).The theatrical release was/is still popular because of the characters. We are intrigued by the ugliness that lurks behind the "normal characters" such as Chris, Mrs. Desjarden &amp; Sue's mom, who are as unsettling as Carries. Please watch the theatrical version to see for yourself.Also, the tension between Carrie and her mom in the theatrical version is more nerve racking to me than the actual prom scenes. A TV version that is restricted on the amount of blood and gore that can be shown should have spent more of its efforts on the character side of the story. Unfortunately we get horrible cgi effects.Another fatal error for the TV version (which may not have been avoidable on broadcast TV) is the placement of commercials throughout the prom scenes. The movie never had a chance to build tension or mood because the most intended tense moments in the movie are interrupted for political ads for the elections the next day (though I admit some of these were certainly scary.).Finally, I am appalled that Carrie lives. I read a newspaper review suggesting that perhaps this is an unofficial pilot for Carrie the TV series (remind anyone of the Bates Motel series debacle?).Overall, though I was pleased that NBC gave it a try and took some interesting choices, was very disappointed with the final product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrie: 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When will major T.V. networks relize that they don't need to remake every book by Stephen King that was made into a movie? They're all horrible (especially The Shining), but Carrie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.This time, Carrie White is played by Angela Bettis, a 27-year-old going on 17 (wait-so was Sissy Spacek in the original. Oh well). Basically, it's the same plotline as the original, so check it out there.This version has almost no thrills (two jumps in the last half-hour) and tries to be faithful to the book (just like The Shining tried to do), but can't even succeed in doing that sucessfully. The ending is different, and I don't like it as much as the book and original.(Possible spoilers coming up)The visualition of Mrs. White was actually somewhat gruesome, and I actually commend the makers of this new version for having the guts (and the special effects) to do this. Bettis was not the Carrie I know. The makers tried to make her look too mousy and too unliked. The actors were all good, but nothing else really stood out. To me, all the actors were unknown.If a movie is loved by a lot (yet again, I'm also talking about The Shining), don't remake it. And worse, don't remake it with different actors who don't look like the original's. Billy Nolan (who was John Travolta's part in the original), even though his role was small, did not look right in this new remake.However, like the original, there were a couple gripes in here too. Although I didn't say it in the other review, the side characters were too numerous and under-defined, but they were even worse in this version. Who was that fat kid?I didn't really like that police interrogation side-plot, where they were talking to survivors, because it doused out the already slow-moving pace. And when I say slow, I mean slow! For example, when Carrie was trying on makeup took about ten minutes and wasn't necessary. NBC must have relized that a two-hour time slot wasn't enought and two-and-a-half hours isn't right also.That mayhem-filled half hour ending was unrealistic, even if it was from the book. The book made it seem more real, while this was just madcap mayhem. The makers tried to put a whole lot of telekinetic powers into it (I got somewhat of a Matilda vibe), and even in the book it wasn't like that. They knew that to attract another demographic they needed more "action" so they put in a lot more unecessary telekinetic powers.This isn't a complaint about the movie itself, but about NBC. After each fifteen minute segment was done and it was time for a commercial, they showed a clip of the movie. Sounds good, right? Wrong. They showed the climax of the prom night, which is best left to be a surprise.(more spoilers)When Carrie is visiting her mother's grave, I kept my fingers in my ears and the volume turned low because I knew that it would probably be like the original. Nope. Instead, there was another mini-jump, but I wished that the makers wouldn't do that to faithful followers of Stephen King and his book-to-movies.My rating: 4/10Rated TV-14 for violence, blood, mayhem, language, and cruelness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Forgettable, Failed Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carrie is a poor DV effort by veteran director David Carson. The film was originally made as a TV pilot for a series that, unsurprisingly, never materialized. Angela Bettis saves what little value the film has as Carrie.What makes the film so poor isn't the acting, which was passable (if uninspired) throughout, but pretty much everything else misses the mark; story, pacing, dialog, casting, and cinematography for example.The story differs from the original somewhat and not in ways that would've improved the film. Without giving anything away, some of Carrie's perspective on life should've been changed. The film feels disjointed with dated material shoehorned into a modern setting.The pacing of the film ambles along without any discernible suspense. The film also manages to jerk unevenly from scene to scene and suffers from poor editing. It also goes on half an hour longer than it should.The dialog is horrible, even for television, and is grating to the nerves to watch. The actors struggle with an ailing script and manage to do a passable job.Most of the cast is sufficient in their roles with the exception of Jesse Cadotte as Billy Nolan and Angela Bettis as Carrie.Jesse Cadotte was over-the-top bad in the role of the villain Billy Nolan. Every time he came on the screen I had to suppress a groan. I am not surprised he doesn't get much work.Angela Bettis is an under-appreciated brilliant actress who also happens to have quiet beauty and grace. If this film is to be viewed at all, it is only to watch Bettis steal the show. She is the one thing that shines as equal to or better than the original. She is an actress to watch in the future. (See May for an awesome hidden popcorn flick.)The cinematography is unarguably dreadful. Poor camera angles and framing, amateurish shifting wipes, really bad (even for TV) CGI, cheap looking sets, and comically bad lighting make Carrie almost unwatchable at times.Additionally, the soundtrack is an awful mix of classical scoring and grunge-like generic tunes. The score is so bad that it hampers the production even further.In short, Carrie (2002) is a forgettable, failed effort to recreate a memorable 70's horror movie. It comes across as a badly executed cheap made-for-TV knockoff. The only saving grace is Angela Bettis as Carrie, who manages to outshine Sissy Spacek in the original. Even so, I cannot recommend anyone watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, this movie is an instant classic so if you haven't already, go and rent it now! There is not much gore or guts (although of whole lot of blood) but the film is as equally shocking to the mind as it is to the eye.However, Carrie has a secret: she possesses the power of the mind, telekinesis. Her troubled childhood and cruel taunts by all those around her as well as the stress of a Bible-bashing deluded mother (played by the awesome Piper Laurie) Carrie exerts the stress of her lonely and painful life using her mind to move or break things. Might not sound very convincing as a great movie however it is and is one of the eeriest and most shocking pieces of cinema to come out of the seventies.But hey whatever, I is a mix and something worth your opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much of this new "Carrie" follows the classic original with Sissy Spacek. One of the additions are police interviewing students and teachers after the prom, and the film even starts that way. As the story unfolds they cut frequently to these interviews. The erotic shower scene is shot much the same, except no frontal nudity is revealed, and the shower room is updated so that each girl has a private shower stall, instead of a "community" shower that most of us who grew up in the 50s and 60s will remember. Also, since this remake takes place in 2002, schools have computers, kids have cell phones.some SPOILERS FOLLOW - The rest of the changes I found to be bad, and took away from the enjoyment of "Carrie." Much of the last half had more of a "Very Bad Things" tone to it. Where the students were mischievous in the original, here they are plain evil. Plus, the sex talk is not proper. As one girl says, "Ever since I started having frequent sex with him he's been very cooperative." In another scene we see a high school couple (boy/girl) in bed, sheets partially covering them. However, the biggest problem is that they didn't let the film finish with the destruction of the gymnasium at the prom. Although everyone died who was suppose to, Carrie went into the town and much more havoc ensued. Gasoline station explosions, cars being flipped in the air, things that took the attention away from the heart of the story and went too much for action and explosions, and over did it.Then, at the end, Carrie was still alive, being driven somewhere by her one surviving classmate. Maybe they were trrying to sell this as a TV series?? Anyway, not a very good moie, stretched to allow it to be shown in a 3-hour slot, with commercials.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This telefilm remake of Brian DePalma's classic horror film is nothing short of pathetic. What were they thinking? From David Carson's limp direction to mediocre and overdone special effects, it's a total bore. The greatest crime is Bryan Fuller's screenplay, which "supposedly" was closer to the book than the original film...it's atrocious. Angela Bettis tries hard in the lead role, but pales in comparison to Sissy Spacek. Patricia Richardson's "Margaret White" displays none of Piper Laurie's scary-yet-humorous religious fanaticism. Rena Sofer's gym teacher fares better as the sympathetic gym teacher, but Kandyse McClure's "Sue Snell" (Carrie's fellow student who farms her boyfriend out for a prom date) has a mysterious agenda throughout the movie (which is told as a flashback), missing out on DePalma's luminous Amy Irving, whose shame, guilt and compassion fueled the sad tale. About the only positive thing this version brings is Carrie's destruction of her hometown walking home from the prom- but unfortunately, this doesn't justify this horror...If I was Stephen King, I would sue!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this remake quite a bit. Overall, I feel it lacks the creepiness of the 1976 original. Something about that film, the split-screen technique, the spinning camera on Carrie and Tommy as they dance, and of course the '70s fashions, made it very disturbing. This one seems tamed down quite a bit. I really thought Angela Bettis was impressive in the title role, as a girl who wants to fit in, but has been raised not to, and decides to rebel against her strict upbringing by going to prom. She "cleans up" nicely for the prom, too! Patricia Clarkson is okay as the mother, although I felt she could have played it up more. The actresses playing Sue Snell and Chris Hargenson were quite good. There were a few moments in this film that would fit in the category of "I'm so sure!" One of them was the casual attitude of Sue and of Norma in the police station after the disaster had happened. Norma especially seemed mighty chipper for someone who had just witnessed the deaths of most of her classmates, and narrowly escaped herself. The ending was rather cheesy. I guess they wanted to set it up for a sequel (which has already been made!). Overall, pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to bother with a book-to-film comparison. Since when is a pre-reading of the "Book" a requirement to fully appreciate the "movie"?? Many times one gets caught up in book-to-film comparisons without realizing that a movie is a separate work that can stand on its own merits! (A film will rarely, if ever, reach the level of character development that you can get from a novel/book!) I never read the 'Carrie' book and I think I'm glad that I never did; because I just love the original film.This made for TV re-make is NOT in any way, shape or form or by any stretch of the imagination, BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL (Which apparently is not as good as the Stephen King book to begin with!) But... IF you haven't seen the dePalma original, You will totally enjoy this movie!! I did.If you haven't seen either, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and watch the original Carrie instead!!You WILL LIKE this re-make but BELIEVE ME. if you haven't seen the dePalma film (this one will totally ruin it for you) The original doesn't take itself as serious and There's camp factor there, but it doesn't weigh down the story. Brian dePalma's direction, with a heavy Hitchcock influence, creates a more dramatic dreamlike atmosphere that is well puncuated by the Donaggio score (derivative of a Bernard Hermann score).The original Carrie played by Spacek is more "real" an a bit less animated and not "creepy" like the new Bettis portrayal. Also Piper Laurie as carrie's mom is absolutely eery! (I love this movie just for Piper's performance alone!) Yeah its over the top, just like all the other characters (Travolta, Amy Irving, nancy allen) But this is the world as seen through carries eyes...an absolute nightmare!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Books are always open to interoperation, see, many people had this pegged as a remake of the original movie. But in my opinion, Carrie is a book that could be told in a different way. However this is actually a decent look at the story, only flaw being that it was made for TV and the ending was lame. I liked that they took a deeper look into Carrie, she knew she was hated and you felt her wanting to be normal. You also see that the pranks pulled on her are inching at her which you don't feel with the original movie. The cast was pretty decent for a TV movie, I liked who they picked for Sue, Chris and Billy. I also liked some of the things that were written in the book but not put into the original film like seeing how Carrie was abused her whole life and Chris's dad threatening the school after her being kicked out. However, the film did not have the same chills as the '70's version with Spacek. Angela Bettis did a great job as Carrie, but I didn't find her as disturbed, I didn't like that they put her in a "trance" as if she couldn't control her powers and that she would go into a seizure, I like the idea better as she has control and her anger and pain is what controls the objects she moves. Also the effects were just horrible, again I know this was TV, but it seemed a bit silly at times. But if you have read the book, this definitely did stay more true to the story.Carrie White is the most hated and unpopular girl at her school, being known as a "creepy religious girl with the strange house" Carrie has her first period in the gym showers and panics. A girl sees it flow down the drain, and notifies all the other girls. They all surround Carrie's shower stall and tease Carrie, tormenting her. Hearing this, the gym teacher, Ms. Desjardin, comes into the shower, and finds Carrie lying by the drain. As she comforts Carrie, Carrie asks her if she is dying. Carrie had no idea about menstruation and thought she was bleeding to death. Later, the school principal determines that Carrie should go home to calm down after the incident. When the principal repeatedly mispronounces her name, Carrie snaps and screams out her name. Suddenly, the principal's desk moves 5 inches in the opposite direction. As she leaves the principal's office, all the kids gather around as she finds the words "Plug It Up" written on her locker door. Once she opens her locker door, tampons fall all over her. Ms. Desjardin notifies the girls during class that they are to have detention in the gym everyday. Chris claims that she will skip the detention, but Ms. Desjardin explains that the penalty for skipping detention is three days suspension and refusal of the prom tickets. Chris storms out, claiming that "this isn't over." Sue, feeling the guilt for her bullying, asks her popular jock boyfriend Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom instead of her. Chris hears about this and is determined to give Carrie the prom from Hell, little does she know that the tables are about to be turned on her and the other students.Like I said, there are flaws with this film. Another thing that I forgot to mention that I didn't like is the character changes with Chris, it seemed like she was more victim while I pictured her more cold hearted like the original movie. But I liked that Carrie's mom was somewhat more believable, not that I didn't love Piper Laurie in the original film, but Carrie's mom in this film seemed more calm like someone who you have to worry about because the quiet people are the one's who freak you out more. I also know that this film was meant to spark a possible series with Carrie, but come on, how could you make a TV series out of this story? The ending copped out and could have been great, but chose a more safer route that I felt was stupid. Over all, I would recommend the movie though, it added some good elements and wasn't insulting. Just keeping in mind that this was made for TV, it's pretty strong.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PURE KING ADAPTION</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few remakes that are better than the original.Now to remake a King it has to be a reason.The original CARRIE was a new brand of horror,but it didn't have everything from the book,which you would except,yet it's still was good.Now this is what a Stephen King fan was waiting for....CARRIE.This is the book, but a live action pop up version. Now we know the story,a girl name CARRIE,who's picked on at school and suffers abuse from her religious mother.Then finds out she has telekinesis,and when kids pull a prank too far... it's payback time.But not only does this delever more information than the original,but also copies everything from the book.Now fans of the book will love this version.People who haven't read the book and loved the original.Should read the book and give a second judgement. Angela Bettis turn as CARRIE was amazing and brilliant,she also looked beautiful.Patrica Clarkson turn as the mother was more sick and abusive than Piper Laurie.Rena Sofer took the role of Sue and made it her own.Both her and Amy Irving played Sue good in each version.Kandyse McClure made Miss Collins a badass and I loved it.And she kinda looks like Demi Moore.Emilie de Ravin made Chris more of a bitch than evil.Katharine Isabelle played Norma a bitch and look like one,but a hot one at that.Tobias Mehler didn't have the sex appeal as John Travolta have,but made Billy's role more creepy and bad boyish,just like in the book.David Keith might be new to the film,not in the book,and made the film more interesting,like the book. All in all a great Stephen King Adaption for fans of the book and might be for the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more entertaining than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Carrie" is a much more enjoyable sequel than it should've been.**SPOILERS**Having survived the disaster, Sue Snell, (Kandyse McClure) recalls for Det. John Mulchaey, (David Keith) the history of Carrie White, (Angela Bettis) a local girl at school that everyone picks on. When the other girls Chris Hargensen, (Emilie de Raven) Tina Blake, (Katharine Isabelle) and Norma Watson, (Meghan Black) begin to torment her unmercifully for a series of incredibly personal issues, she buries herself even more into her outcast persona, and when she tries to get accepted by her peers, she finds herself going to the Prom. Finally arriving there, she is the victim of an utterly humiliating prank in front of everyone, but what no one knew was that it awakened a deadly secret within her, and she uses it to lash out at those who have tormented her in the past.The Good News: This one wasn't that bad at times, and has some good points at times. One of the best features is that the film is set-up as a police query, investigating after-the-fact and questioning individuals about the incidents which are then played out as the recollections described. This is quite ingenious for several reasons, first being that it allows the film a lot of leeway in keeping things moving, since it can switch out perspectives when needed to keep the film on-pace and different perspectives are a good way around that. Also, it has a fresh feel to it that differs so much from the original and helps to distinguish it even more. Plus, this adds a level of realism to the film, as the way it's conducted, using questions about what's happened to prompt the flashbacks, follows real-life quite closely and makes the film somewhat enjoyable, even so much as the slow-realization comes in that he was wrong all along and is then forced into trying to get the truth about the matter, which can be quite fun at times. Another good plus is the fact that the film decides to keep in the key sequence from the original, the dawning of the feminine changes that are brought about by pure accident and played for purely traumatic effect, as it's done here with the extra bit of the incident being caught by the entire locker room which brings up the trauma even more, and the follow-ups are just as good or even better. The main thing with this one, though, is that the experiences at the prom at a lot of fun, and they are here, making up most of what makes it so good. The prank itself is handled well, with the pure, full-on humiliation of the incident coming across as needed and makes for appropriate retaliation, as well as giving some striking visuals at times. The deaths and destruction come about during the chaos, and these are quite fun seeing all the tables flying everywhere and debris littering the floor, along with the internal damage caused that makes for some really good times throughout when it puts them into action, all capped off with the spectacular shot of the entire structure collapsing whilst still in flames. The deaths are also quite fun, from watching them fall into gigantic balls of fire to having closing doors slice off limbs to being electrocuted when standing in water and much more, making for some fun times. The last plus to this one is the fact that there's a really good action-packed finale, where she's on the loose and rampaging through town, overturning cars, shorting out electrical systems, setting stuff on fire and generally causing havoc in a never-ending series of spectacular scenes that are just all-out fun to watch. These here are the film's good points.The Bad News: There was some flaws to this one. One of the biggest ones is the fact that there's just way too much religious touches in here. The fact that it's included might be enough for some to grow tired of it, but the fact that it's still shoved down our throats at the beginning is quite tiring, especially with the quoting of the scripture, the constant invoking of prayer and the pushing of the morals and values that are clearly not going to be followed just aren't that interesting. Even worse, rather than trying to sympathize with her, it makes us want to wish the film got going a little more since it does make the film drag, which is another slight problem. This one certainly does feel it's length, even though there's a rather nice idea of the detective premise, but the fact that this one is well-over two hours is certainly obvious to some out there, and it falls short because of that. A lot of this could be due to the finale, which is somewhat problematic and the film's last big flaw. Frankly, as much fun as the rampage through town is in actuality, the fact is that the destruction of the gym makes for a much more satisfying conclusion, as the revenge is carried out and she is still lose on the world, with them unsure of what to make of the situation. That makes for a much-more satisfying conclusion, and what's worse, they also manage to include the final confrontation with the mother that no one could know for sure how it went down since none of the key principles recall the experience and the one who does discovers it after-the-fact, messing around the whole situation even further. These here are the film's problems.The Final Verdict: While it's not as significant as the original, this is a rather fun sequel that manages to really entertain when it tries, despite some flaws. Give it a shot if you're interested in these kinds of films or can put thoughts of the original aside, while those that aren't big or can't should heed caution.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and mild animal violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better scripted but not as scary (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is an intelligent rethinking of the original film and corrects most of the faults in its script by developing the secondary characters, in particular the other high school girls. Only the coach seems more shallow, and it appears that this was deliberate. But there is a trade-off. The best and scariest parts of the first film, because the most Gothic, were those having to do with Carrie, her mother, and their "Psycho" house. They were over the top (or, more politely, operatic or baroque), like all de Palma's horror films, but the actresses and the designer elevated them almost to the status of fairy tale. In the rethinking the characters have been made less sentimentally outre and more understandable (although the relationship between the two is slighted in favor of the school story), but this robs the film of what would have been its most frightening aspect. In contrast, though, the prom is more effective than before because it is better built up to and makes better sense emotionally. The biggest surprise is that this version changes the meaning of the story. Someone called the first film "the adolescent as 'King Kong'"--nice girl provoked to violence; her coach and her mother were the two warring influences on her, and in the end her mother triumphed (it was her voice Carrie heard last before wreaking destruction), leading to a tragic end. Here Carrie acts while in some sort of fugue state; she's out from under her mother's sway at the outset but chooses not to fight her because she desperately needs her help (it's her last plea to her mother) in understanding what's happening to her, first physically, then psychically. In the absence of that understanding, what happens at the prom is an inevitable repetition of the shower scene, in fortissimo terms, and directed outward. Everyone has let Carrie down--except, in a surprise twist, Sue the do-gooder, who brings her back to life, in a very dubiously happy ending. Sue's motives and judgment have been called into question; although well-meaning, she's also been shown as smug and sure of herself; and her good deed in setting Carrie at liberty elsewhere, with no more self-knowledge or self-control than before, is probably unwise, and certainly dangerous. Carrie has hallucinations, and in one of them sees Sue as one of her enemies for a moment--a moment that passes, but what about next time? The point of the first film was that Carrie couldn't escape her mother's influence, she was already lost; the point of this one, seemingly, is that she has escaped, figuratively and literally, but into limbo, with no source of deliverance inside or outside herself. She's Carrie a generation on.Btw, the villainess in the film is the villainess from the "Roswell" series, playing the same part--the Bizarro Charlene Tilton--and provoking the same strong desire to stick around to the end of the story just to see her get hers. It's a talent, of a type.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young girl named CARRIE WHITE is the target for humiliation day in &amp; day thanks in part to her cruel classmates &amp; then living a terrible home life with her insanely religious mother. However messing with sweet &amp; very quiet Carrie White is like asking for a death wish, which is exactly what all her tormentors get at the high school prom when Carrie, humiliated on stage after being dosed in pigs blood, unleashes her terrifying supernatural powers that she has kept to herself all this time, to exact a terrifying revenge unlike anyone has ever seen. A few years ago I seen THE RAGE CARRIE 2 which despite the title didn't have the character of Carrie White in it. Rather than seeing a fresh take on the original, I instead wound up viewing a complete scene for scene remake of the original &amp; not a very good one at that, in fact if you never seen THE RAGE, I advise you skip it &amp; see CARRIE 02' why? because it's so much better than the RAGE, at least this one said it was a remake &amp; did not trick fans into believing it's a sequel, which is something the producers of the RAGE told everybody. The acting was really good, each actor made their characters believable, funny, hateful, sympathetic when they were supposed. The direction was also well done &amp; despite the overlong running time, the film never bores you as it moves at a fast pace &amp; is helped by it's strong acting &amp; directing (which is something one cannot say about most made for TV movies) all in all, CARRIE 02' comes close to matching the 1976 original, but falls short in many ways, most notably is the films terrible last ten minutes that was originally to lead into a TV series (which never happened) such a shame they didn't change the ending for the DVD release since the first couple hours are such fun. Definitely recommended!***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was alright,but the original was better.The ending was stupid.The part on the original when Carrie grabs Sue's arm after she dies was a claver twist.In the remake Sue drives Carrie to Florida and she has a nightmare about her mother.Even though the remake was more like the book the original was WAY better The original cast of Carrie was better looking than the remake cast too the original Sue was white(Amy Irving) the remake Sue was black (Kandyse McClure) What's up with that! Carrie's mother's death was more elaborate in the original Plus the prom scene was better too. Sissy Spacek was a way better actress than Angela Bettis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not that bad!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the original so I could compare it with this one. This newer version isn't that bad. I don't know why people say it is. I guess they don't like change...oh well. I respect their opinion.I like this updated version because the story is stretched out, whereas in the original, the movie went by way too fast and it didn't focus on the telekinesis like the TV movie did. I thought Angela Bettis did an awesome job in the role of "Carrie White". I felt so sorry for her and not as much in the original. I thought the gym teacher in the original, "Mrs. Collins" wasn't convincing as a tough teacher like the Rena Sofer role.I can't wait until the TV movie comes out on DVD, or at least I hope it does. Don't be prejudiced by the original.If the movie of 1976 was released today, face it, it would not fly!! That's why they have an updated version in 2002, to fit into the times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fail to understand why someone would want to re-make a classic movie like Carrie. It almost always ends in a failure. This is no exception as we see a rather lame attempt. There are 40,000 new screenplays written each year; some of them very good, and only a few hundred get made. Why cant producers and directors give some of these original stories a chance instead of wasting our time butchering stories that have already been done well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carrie (2002) * 1/2 (out of 4) TV remake of Brian DePalma's masterpiece has Angela Bettis playing the role of Carrie, a tortured teen who after years of abuse gets invited to the prom. I could sit here and scream that you shouldn't remake a classic but I'm not going to do that for several reasons. The biggest being that even the DePalma film left out a lot of stuff from the book so I looked forward to this remake to see what they did but nothing done here can equal the original and to make matters worse we get a new ending here, which is just downright horrid. The biggest problem with the film is the screenplay and direction as neither appear to know what they're trying to do. Director Carson never handles any of the material very well as everything from the performances to the character actions are either over the top or so low that you just have to scratch your head. Another majority problem is that this film runs nearly forty-minutes longer than the original yet none of the characters here go through any development and you can't help but feel as if you don't know them or simply don't care. With the added running time you'd think there would be stronger characters but that's not the case and that includes Carrie and her mother (Patricia Clarkson). The majority of the added running time involves David Keith (An Officer and a Gentleman) playing a Detective trying to figure out what happened at the prom. The one good scene that was added from the book is after the gym teacher pushes Chris against the locker and her lawyer father comes to school trying to get her tickets to the prom. This was a good part of the book and it was nice to see it added her. Outside of that this movie is pretty much a bust from start to finish, which is a real shame because there was so much they could have done. Remaking this for television is another problem as the "PG" rated stuff just doesn't fit this story, which is full of adult situations. The performances range from bland to poor with Bettis doing okay work but her character, believe it or not, just never sticks out. Clarkson is rather bland of her mother and Kandyse McClure doesn't do much as Sue Snell. Add in the poor CGI effects and we've got a pretty bad movie, although some, myself included, might get some entertainment out of just seeing what they tried. I still think a remake could be done correctly but this here isn't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I`ve never read Stephen King`s CARRIE ( If truth be told NEEDFUL THINGS is the only King novel I`ve read ) so I`ve no idea how well this miniseries adapatation holds up compared to the source novel . For the most part it`s adaquate enough for the viewer but what brings it crashing down is the climax at the school prom . In Brian De Palma`s film version this is a classic cinema scene with its split screen technique . Alas in this version it`s laughably bad as CGI chairs and tables spin through the air in a cartoonish manner while people either stand around like showroom dummies or fall over in the same sort of style as a European soccer player . This ruined the whole show for me , and I don`t know if it`s in the novel but ends in a ridiculous upbeat way leading me to believe the producers are going to make a spin off series . If they do I won`t be watching it</fullReview>
