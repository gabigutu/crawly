		<shortDescription>Lots To Like In This Updated Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's odd to like an original film and then like the re-make equally so, if not more, but that's the case with this film. I have viewed both versions of this film at least three times apiece and thoroughly enjoy both. Almost 55 years ago, this was a film noir called "The Narrow Margin" and in 1990, this re-make took off the "The" on the title. However, as is sometimes the case with remakes, some of the twists and turns of this thriller were also changed from the first film.They didn't spoil it. I have no objection to the changes made here because the bottom line is entertainment, and that's where this movie excels. Plausible? No, but neither was the original, for that matter, and neither are a lot of suspense/ crime films.What makes this re-run good, in addition to the great suspense, are several other things: 1 - Gene Hackman, one of the best actors of his generation and often overlooked in discussions of great actors; 2 - nice photography featuring some great train shots and the scenic Canadian Rockies; 3 - an interesting assortment of characters, some of which keep you guessing whether they are the good guys or the bad guys; 4 - a dash of humor thrown in here and there to break the tension.In addition to Hackman, we see the sexy Anne Archer, who gives a nice film noir feel to the movie and we get some good supporting performances including two from guys with the same last name: J.T. and Emmet Walsh and one from a guy who plays one of the hit men: James Sikking. That's a name I'm not familiar with, but he has a scene talking to Hackman that is riveting.The main fault of the movie at least to me, was the "Rambo" mentality in which I mean the villains have the good guy in point-blank, can't-miss range several times and....you guessed it: they miss. The action scenes in here are great but lack credibility, or this would be almost as good as it could ever get for a "thriller." I'm still tempted to rate it a "10" for the entertainment value alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense for the Discriminating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film pops up frequently on the tube, and with good reason -- it's lean, smart, and superbly acted. Director Hyams makes the most of the claustrophobic train interior contrasting with the wide open Canadian wilderness. Gene Hackman has never been better. Tension is built through a series of one-on-one confrontations, each with electric undercurrents. The best by far is the gentlemanly chat between Hackman and James Sikking in the dining car. The standard "action-packed" ending is a bit disappointing. But don't let this stop you if you're into suspense films for the thinking person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, straightforward action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific action thriller with great actors. Unfortunately, they don't have much to say because the action takes over. There isn't much time to develop a character when you're being chased up and down a mountain. Still, this is a great example of the genre. I can't help but think that it would have been a lot more successful financially with younger, hipper stars. I also think that would have ruined it.The direction is very matter-of-fact. Some movies like this reel you in with a definite "atmosphere", stylized to death. I'm tempted to say this movie has no style at all, but that would be a disservice to Hackman and Archer, who give it all the style it needs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Remake of the 1952 Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Los Angeles, the editor of a publishing house Carol Hunnicut (Anne Archer) goes to a blind date with the lawyer Michael Tarlow (J.T. Walsh), who has embezzled the powerful mobster Leo Watts (Harris Yulin). Carol accidentally witnesses the murder of Michel by Leo's hit-man. The scared Carol sneaks out of Michael's room and hides in an isolated cabin in Canada.Meanwhile the Deputy District Attorney Robert Caulfield (Gene Hackman) and Sgt. Dominick Benti (M. Emmett Walsh) discover that Carol is a witness of the murder and they report the information to Caulfield's chief Martin Larner (J.A. Preston) and they head by helicopter to Canada to convince Carol to testify against Leo. However they are followed and the pilot and Benti are murdered by the Mafia. Caulfield and Carol flees and they take a train to Vancouver. Caulfield hides Carol in his cabin and he discloses that there are three hit-man in the train trying to find Carol and kill her. But they do not know her and Caulfield does not know who might be the third killer from the Mafia and who has betrayed him in his office."Narrow Margin" is a great remake of the 1952 "The Narrow Margin" by Richard Fleischer. When I saw this remake in the early 90's for the first time, I did not know the original movie. The story is well written and this remake is breathtaking with the action scenes on the roof of the train. Further, the lead actor is the Gene Hackman, one of the best actors of the American cinema. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "De Frente para o Perigo" ("In Front of the Peril")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1990's Narrow Margin made a poor showing at the box-office, which is a pity because this is a thriller that really thrills. All too quickly dismissed by many critics for committing the cardinal sin of being a remake (in this case of Richard Fleischer's classic 1952 B-movie), it's a superbly paced example of pure commercial film-making at its most satisfying.Intelligently scripted by director Peter Hyams (Capricorn One, Outland) with an admirable use of Scope that emphasises the claustrophobic nature of the game of cat-and-mouse, there are at least two genuinely breath-taking moments even before the inevitable train-top finale. Yet the film is always careful to maintain a semblance of credibility. As a result, it derives as much of its suspense from our involvement with the characters as from its bravura action sequences.True, these are stereotypes - idealistic DA, frightened-but-honest witness, pragmatic killer - but they are believable stereotypes who behave logically, relying on their wits. If the watchword of Hyams' Outland was professionalism, in Narrow Margin it is self-reliance. Both sides have to make the most of what is to hand in a restrictive environment that works against them equally.If this enclosed environment had been a spaceship and the killers aliens, Narrow Margin might have wowed them at the box-office. As it is, without an easily exploitable angle, it proved one of the most mystifying of Hyams' frequent financial disappointments: Hyams at his peak was the consummate commercial film-maker, yet paradoxically his films were never very commercially successful. With impressive performances from Hackman, Archer and Hyams' regular James B. Sikking as the businessman-like killer who prefers negotiation to coercion, Narrow Margin deserved much, much better. It's a good movie, and one you won't just watch once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable suspenser remake that could have been better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie succeeds on the talent of Gene Hackman and his co-stars especially Anne Archer and James Sikking. The story is as follows Carol Hunnicutt (Archer) is a witness to a mob killing, so she hides in a remote part of Canada. los Angeles Deputy D.A Robert Caulfield (Hackman)is given the task of finding her to bring her back to L.A to testify at a Mob trial, but he accidently tells the Hit-men out to silence her - her whereabouts, so when he arrives at her remote cabin, there a helicopter full of bad guys waiting for them - so begins a enjoyably suspense chase through remote Canada, they decide to get on a Cross-Country train.. but the bad guys are also on board, so theyt spend the night trying to avoid a bullet. If it sounds familiar it's because the movie's a remake of the 1950'S RKO Picture of the same name starring Charles McGraw and Marie Windsor. Double crosses,dirty cops and tension throughout but the script could have been better and the movie (just over 90 mins) could have been longer and the climax is slightly disappointingotherwise it's a good early 1990's movie from Peter Hyams who's had a bit of a hit and miss career since,HIT:- Timecop (1994) and The Relic (1997) and Sudden Death (1995) - MISS:- Stay Tuned (1992) and End of days (1999)My rating 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Hackman makes a good picture even better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Hackman and Anne Archer star in a good thriller that has tense moments and wonderful Canadian scenery. The story is of a frightened woman who sees a man killed and takes flight to avoid having to appear as a witness to a murder. Hackman is the resourceful district attorney who convinces Archer to return to Los Angeles and testify against the killers. The rest of the picture details a game of cat and mouse between Hackman, Archer and their pursuers who see Archer as a loose end and are determined to keep her from the courtroom. The scenes of pursuit atop the moving passenger train have been done in other films but is expertly done here without becoming a cliché. The picture does have its flaws but is a diverting film and any movie starring Hackman is certainly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very suspenseful movie for someone who has moved beyond Steven Segal and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Requires a certain number of neurons to be firing at the same time to really enjoy it. Gene Hackman's performance has been under appreciated. It exceeds his portrayal of Popeye Doyle in The French Connection and its sequel. This character is tough, but a lot more likable. The repartee between his character and the assassin is excellent, but as I said previously, does require some finesse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent remake, though still no match for the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Narrow Margin (1990) is a remake of a fondly remembered B-movie that became a real sleeper hit. It does not match the original for suspense or excitement, but it does boast a truly towering performance by Gene Hackman who takes the Charles MacGraw role and gives it everything he's got.The story is about a DA from L.A, who travels to a mountain cabin in Canada to pick up a female murder witness. Some baddies follow him (because they want to kill the witness), but he manages to escape with her as far as the local railway station. They board an overnight train, bound for Vancouver, and spend the next day or so evading the killers on the train.Hackman is quite brilliant, whether delivering panicky dialogue in a whisper or indulging in some violent action atop the speeding express. James B. Sikking makes a chilling assassin. Anne Archer is convincing as the vulnerable and terrified witness who would rather be anywhere other than where she is. Director Peter Hyams packs in some solid action sequences, such as a nerve-jangling car chase through a forest, and a savage fight on the roof of the train.Where this film falls short is in the suspense department and the pacing. There are moments where Hackman and Archer are allowed to relax too much. One scene in particular involves Hackman and Sikking having a lengthy conversation at a dinner table; when Hackman leaves, you'd expect them to follow him to her, but they don't. There's another bit where the action jumps from about 1 a.m. to the next morning, without any indication of what kind of events have taken place during the night. There's also a lot of long shots of the lovely scenery, but to get the claustrophobic atmosphere the maker's needed to emphasise the inside of the train, not the outside landscapes. It's a pretty good film, but there are just a few things about it which drag it down a peg or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atmospheric thriller quickie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Hyams' remake of Richard Fleisher's 1952 The Narrow Margin focuses more on atmosphere and scenery than it does film noir. It does make for a cool, if a bit too short, movie.Gene Hackman is the loudmouth Deputy DA desperate to get a big daddy mob boss behind bars. And when a shy book editor witnesses a mob assassination he treks out to Middleofnowhere, Canada to drag her into court to testify. Problem's arise when the bad guys show up in the wilderness and blow the crap out of her cabin.A brilliant, rustic car/chopper chase down the sheer slopes of a mountain forest follows. It's a great scene with some cool shots and sharp editing. Once they reach the bottom of the mountain they find a train station and board the train for a private cabin. The bad guys follow, only they still don't know what their witness looks like. Many scenes of hiding and seeking make up the rest of the movie. It doesn't sound like much but Peter Hyams' widescreen photography is used to the max to promote a sense of claustrophobia and even the quieter scenes are dominated by the sound of the train charging through the dark Canadian wilderness. One particular scene at Monashee Station really does take advantage of the 'middle of nowhere' feeling. Bruce Broughton's score is kind of okay, but nothing as loud and exciting as the score he originally created. Peter Hyams disagreed (as he often does with his composers) and chopped up Broughton's work in post-production. Thus, the music in the movie is more of an underscore with much of the more action-based cues missing. I wish it did last longer and with more scenes on the train (coz trains are cool) but, for what it is, Narrow Margin is a slightly wrought thriller with Gene Hackman on top form as always and having fun playing the older guy in the suit who can still get into fights and car chases as if it were his everyday job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the "Edge" of suspense, but you can see it from here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a completely redundant and pointless idea to do a remake of Richard Fleischer's superb and still perfectly undated film-noir masterpiece "The Narrow Margin"? But hey, bad ideas got turned into highly entertaining movies before and particularly the cast &amp; crew involved in this early 90's production should make you more confident. Peter Hyams is a gifted director (and an even better cinematographer), Gene Hackman is his good old reliable self and, since the script pretty much follows the same trail ? or should I say 'rail' ? as the '52 original, you already know that'll be good as well. Carol Hunnicut witnesses the cold-blooded murder of a mafia attorney at the end of their blind date and promptly becomes the only key witness ever to testify against well-protected crime lord Leo Watts. When the dedicated prosecutor Robert Caulfield travels out her secluded hideout place in order to convince the reluctant woman to do the right thing, this triggers a virulent deadly cat and mouse game with a duo of professional killers. The chase largely takes place on the night train to Vancouver (the ideal inescapable location) and the good guys' only advantage is that their opponents don't know what Carol looks like. One of the taglines proudly claims that "Narrow Margin" will take you to the edge of suspense. That is perhaps a slightly too optimistic promise, but it's definitely one of the better suspense-thrillers of its time. A lot of little elements and twists in the plot seem rushed and don't make a whole lot of sense, but who cares when there's stuff to enjoy like a spectacular helicopter Vs. Jeep chase through the Canadian forests or an exhilarating battle of train's rooftop? Bruce Broughton's divinely unsettling score most definitely increases the tension level even more. Gene Hackman clearly enjoyed starring in this light-headed action thriller and particularly his speech to the killers ? about why he prefers working on the right side of the law ? is truly priceless. There are some great names in the supportive cast as well (J.T. Walsh, M. Emmet Walsh?) but sadly their roles are too brief. Overall recommended as long as you don't anticipate a flawless masterpiece but, if it ever comes down to choosing just one, go for the superior 50's original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller can't get better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For once, the remake is better than the original. Richard Fleischer's black and white movie has many fans, and rightly so, but the 1990 version really has something to it that makes me watch it again and again. The story and the characters have largely improved, and someone really had a lucky hand with the casting here. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as the loudmouth police detective who finds out that he is not as smart as he had thought. He is on his own, he is scared and he also has a bad conscience. Along with numerous action scenes he shows all these sentiments, the viewers can really feel with him. The same can be said for Anne Archer, together with Hackman she makes a formidable team. She is really perfect for the part of an upper middle class businesswoman who is looking for some romance and suddenly finds herself on the hit list of the mob. A formidable opening scene with a short but really great performance by J.T. Walsh sets the tone, and the tension never loosens.A very important part is also played by the landscape, a remote, idyllic part of Western Canada, I believe. The director successfully succeeded in putting a romantic scenery opposite to the harrowing plot, the hectic action which has nothing to do with its immediate surroundings. Nature is depicted in its friendliest forms of appearance as an innocent bystander. Everything is so normal, so lovely, except ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kind of remake nobody does any more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of a 1952, Narrow Margin manages to evoke not only an old way of life but a nearly vanished breed of filmmaking. This is an "R" rated action-thriller for actual grown ups. It's got some excitement, suspense and a few expletives, which back in 1990 guaranteed this thing an "R" but today might slip past as "PG-13", but the star of the movie is a spry 60, his leading lady is 42 and the storytelling is meant to appeal to viewers of that age without insulting their intelligence or taste. Outside of maybe the James Bond franchise, nobody really makes action-thrillers for an adult audience anymore. You basically just have to watch whatever cartoonish crap the kids are into.While on a blind date, Carol Hunnicut (Anne Archer) witnesses a murder. She flees to Canada to hide but because she's the only one who can connect a menacing mobster (Harris Yulin) to the killing, an insolent assistant DA named Caulfield (Gene Hackman) sets out to bring her back to Los Angeles to testify. After a deadly helicopter attack, Carol and Caulfield wind up trapped on a train as it chugs through the Canadian wilderness with two mob killers on board. With nowhere to run and only a few places to hide, the reluctant witness and the defiant prosecutor have to work together if they hope to survive.Made in a world before omnipresent cell phones and by a film industry that didn't turn every knob up to 11 for every second of screen time, Narrow Margin looks, feels and acts like a period piece. The setting is only slightly more familiar than the 1890s and the filmmaking has more in common with the 1940s than it does with today. So your reaction to this motion picture will depend on the diversity and leniency of you cinema palate. As put off as you are by the circumstance and the styling of the film, that's how much you'll be bothered by little plot holes and clunky sub plots. For example, Caulfield has several encounters with another woman on the train and they're such a blatant digression from the main story, you can't help but suspect they're leading to something, deflating the surprise when they do.If you keep an open mind, however, there's something to enjoy about a thriller that's more than an assembly line moving characters from one stunt extravaganza to another. Indeed, it's the personal dynamic between Carol and Caulfield that fills up most of the story, giving it a more honestly dramatic tone than usual. There's a good scene where Anne Archer gets to strut her stuff as Carol finally opens up and unloads on Caulfield and another when Caulfield gets tired of indulging his witness' reluctance and lays this blunt guilt trip on her. And when Caulfield finally gets a face-to-face meeting with the killers, it's a nice bit of business where James B. Sikking carries the action as the lead hit-man until Hackman steps in with his always surprising power to both end the discussion and propel the film forward into its final act.I wouldn't say Narrow Margin is a great film, though it does have a great cast. J.T. Walsh, M. Emmett Walsh and Harris Yulin are the sort of character actors that you can almost put them in any role, in any sort of tale, and they'll make it better through their presence. Seeing the aforementioned Sikking was enough to make me want to go watch some old episodes of Hill Street Blues and Nigel Bennet as the 2nd hit-man on the train almost makes me want to do the same with Forever Knight. When you've got someone like Hackman leading the way, it's essential that the other performers are able to keep up with him.Director Peter Hyams also makes good use of his train setting, both for thrills and other aspects of storytelling. I t's an inherently more interesting way to travel and offers up far more opportunities for physical movement than either flying or driving. The rooftop climax used here may somewhat pale when compared to the wire-fu, jump cut, CGI-frenzy of modern action sequences, but that's a bothersome bit of bar raising which is going to plague Hollywood for a very long time.Though dated, Narrow Margin is still worth seeing, especially when measured against the never ending torrent of misfires, failures and nigh-unwatchable garbage with which the movie industry assaults us. I prefer seeing an old film that's okay to a new one that sucks. Your mileage may vary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Nail-Biting, No-Nonsense Action Thriller Aboard A Canadian Night Train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carol Hunnicut inadvertently witnesses a mob hit, and her testimony can convict a very powerful gangster. Deputy district attorney Robert Caulfield is determined to put her on the stand and flies to a remote location in Canada where she is hiding out, but it's not long before the mob are on their trail. Frantically, they board a large passenger train going to Vancouver, but will they ever get off the train alive ?This is a taut, dependable thriller; nothing special, but there isn't a dull scene anywhere and crucially Hyams has real gift for the rhythm of his movies - scenes flow effortlessly together and the atmosphere of tension is sustained from start to finish. The material is familiar but the execution is first rate, and reliable Hackman is the perfect anchor around which the film is built, an action hero without macho posturing or moralistic superiority. The film is as interesting when he's quietly negotiating with the bad guys as when they're chasing him in a helicopter, and that's the way it should be. There's also a terrific score by Bruce Broughton with a creepy four note piano motif, and fabulous stuntwork by Glenn Wilder - the finale atop the train is one of those rare scenes where the actors really look like they are in danger. A remake of the classic 1952 Richard Fleischer/Earl Felton film noir The Narrow Margin, this script isn't quite as clever (in the original the woman is the mobster's widow and there's a clever identity twist), but still has some surprises in store. Produced by Carolco Pictures (They Live, Shocker), with exteriors shot in beautiful British Columbia, this is a bad movie to be in if you're an actor called Walsh - both of them get killed in the first twenty minutes !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite well-done train movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinematographers have loved trains since their very beginning (in 1896, L'arrivée d'un train ? La Ciotat.. 1903, The Great Train Robbery, ...) I love movies, I love trains, so I'm of course very fond of movies that feature trains prominently: Keaton's General, La b?te humaine, Murder on the Orient Express, Silver Streak, Under Siege 2, Train de vie, and a number of lesser ones.Narrow Margin is a nice addition to this collection. It presents views of West Canadian railroading, in good style, even though it doesn't offer spectacular stunts, like people or vehicles falling from high bridges, or crashing into some Union Station :^) The classic elements of running on cars' roofs, ducking before tunnels are included though. An off-train prelude builds up the situation, just to put all major players on the train, into the claustrophobic atmosphere, contrasted with wide landscape shots.Of course there's more plot etc., and nice details, like the water-pistol and the (too) tall bad lady. Nothing spectacular, but a pleasing experience all in all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SUMMARY Narrow Margin DVD is an exciting film and one I would recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few weeks ago my Aunt (a very nice woman) gave me a copy of Narrow Margin DVD, which was free with the Daily Mail. I had not heard of this film before but was pleased to see that Gene Hackman was in it so I thought I would give it a go in the machine and I must say I'm glad I did.NARROW MARGIN DVD Narrow Margin (1990) is basically about Carol Hunnicut (Anne Archer) who witnesses a mob killing of her blind date and goes on the run,hiding in a remote part of Canada. L.A. District Attorney Robert Caulfield (Gene Hackman) is informed of her whereabouts by a close friend who then tracks her down to testify but it's not to long before the Mob (bad guys) find out where she is too. Both the cop and the witness are chased through the Canadian Rockies, where their only hope is to take refuge on a claustrophobic Vancouver-bound train. Caulfield (Hackman) is then double crossed by a bent cop and so the killers know there every movement on board the train.The talented Gene Hackman plays his part extremely well as so does the reluctant witness Anne Archer,who both help make this a compelling and an enthralling film to watch. The chase whilst there on the train is very exciting with great scenic mountain views in the background. Here is a link from IMDb showing a clip of the chase on the roof of the train which is well worth watching in my opinion. http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi1083965721/I must say I did enjoy watching Narrow Margin, although I noticed some of the shots/special effects of the speeding Vancouver-bound train looked like plastic scaled models (I'm sure I'm right). The story is fair perhaps a bit simple but I suppose most films revolving around a train chase are. As I said if Gene Hackman was not in this film or someone to match his caliber this film would spell out a big MISS. Yes you could say this is yet another chase film/movie but may I say it's certainly fun to watch.SUMMARY Narrow Margin DVD is an exciting film and one I would recommend watching first before you go out and buy it full price. Gene Hackman's performance is top notch and with the help of Peter Hyams (Director) they successfully succeeded in making this a very compelling film to watch and appreciate,especially the gripping chase on the train. I am pretty sure most of you will enjoy the fast pace through out the film and at 94 mins there's never a dull moment. 6.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Fashion Wins Sometimes !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's good as average thriller from the 1980s, but it allowed some nasty questions to hang around in your brain such as : what could've happened to such a picture with another director who wasn't once a respected director of photography like (Peter Hyams) ?!, or if the same script had been given to (James Cameron) or (John McTiernan) ? Actually they might've exploded everything to reach the most extreme limit by making one critical climax after another !Maybe what allowed those questions is the style of the movie itself altogether. Yes, it's a low tune, low budget kind of movie. But, it's nice one. In fact, the problem is mainly in us. We want all the movies to be just one movie (the most successful one in our time) and it's impossible not because the history doesn't repeat itself only, but because that would distort all the movies also ! Here it's fair without any crazy Action or CGI's companionship, and It's great to see (Gene Hackman) in anything. True that this rule has some exceptions, but this movie is not one of them. I think this time I have just the screenwriter to blame not to utilize some parts to make it more hot and perhaps that's the reason why this movie seemed more like a TV production or as one had been made by the 1950s' standards. It's not big, not loud, though not bad. So try to think of it as a clever intermission between (Rambo) and (Die Hard), or as a peaceful version of (The Gauntlet) however in a train, or as a solid old fashion kind of thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Decent Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr Hackman is well into his mature phase by the time of this movie. Gone is the brashness of Popeye Doyle that set his career alight in 'The French Connection'. By now he has perfected his singular technique of a nervous, self-conscious snigger, followed immediately by a forlorn, introspective expression. A little 'business' from the 'method' school of acting that has now become his trade mark. See him in 'The Firm' and you will know what I mean. In each movie he plays a lawyer - one good, one bad - but both acted identically. He is basically playing the same character in each. It works - but it's cheap.Coming back to this movie, there are the formulaic elements. A fat, cynical detective (ably played by the reliable Emmet Walsh) you just know is going to come unstuck. Baddies with machine guns who can't knock the skin off a rice pudding, a quick blast of pyrotechnics, a car chase, and an inevitable finale on the train roof. How many times have we seen that? There is an encounter with a femme fatale (another baddie) that is so amateurish, even a child could tell it was a set-up. Mr Goodman adds a little tragic humour. The scenery through which the train is passing creates a wonderfully photogenic set. It's a director's delight - which is probably why we see trouble on trains so often at the movies. There is a short but extremely spectacular railway ride over the White Pass of Alaska and down to Skagway on its coast. I guess movie moguls don't get up that way very often, otherwise it would have featured in a dozen dramas by now. Hackman's nervous anti-hero gradually forced into serious action is what keeps this movie up to speed with the train. Again, it's formulaic, but it's good. Well worth a watch. Replace Hackman with Steven Segal and you have 'Under Siege 2'. You're also down to 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The same old story, but still entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Narrow Margin is a redundant story--a person witnesses a mafia slaying and then, once they find out that there is a suspect, that innocent person becomes their next target. And it is usually a long, drawn out chase, while some cop decides to take it upon himself to risk his life to get this person to testify. This is the same thing.Anne Archer plays Carol Hunnicut, a woman who witnessed the mafia slaying of her blind date (of all things), Michael Tarlow, which, unfortunately, is a very brief part played by the excellent, J.T. Walsh. As a defense lawyer for mob boss, Leo Watts (Harris Yulin), Tarlow was playing with fire when he decided to circumvent some of Watt's money to pay for his own endeavors. And Watts figured it out before Michael Tarlow could repay him. In the boss's eyes, Tarlow's crimes are tantamount to execution. And that's exactly what happens. This is unfortunate for Carol Hunnicut who witnessed the shooting. Some Los Angeles Deputies get information that Carol was in the apartment and that she witnessed the crime. Now, they have to convince her to testify. Carol is no idiot of course. From the night she saw the shooting and realized that she could be next, she covered up her tracks, and absconded to a Canadian ranch to hide out. She broke ties with her young son and husband because she knew that they, too, would be in danger. And despite the urgings of Robert Caufield (Gene Hackmen), who is to be her Deputy escort on the Canadian train that is to return her to Los Angeles, Carol doesn't want to testify. Aside from a reluctant witness, Robert Caufield has to deal with crooked cops in his own department and two hitmen on the very train they are traveling, but he is nonetheless honorably determined to save Carol.Despite the typical story of a witness trying to escape the grips of unrelentless mafia hitmen, it is an entertaining story nonetheless. Anne Archer's character is not stupid, she's quite aware of the risks that lie ahead, and doubts whether one Deputy (Hackman) is enough to save her. And despite the tired finales of fights between antogonist and protagonist while on top of a train, there are some good action and thriller ploys here and there that make it an entertaining story. I think the lead characters, Hunnicut and Caufield, add something good to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent remake of a cat-and-mouse chase aboard a speeding train...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your memory is good, you'll recall that this is a remake of the B&amp;W sleeper classic starring Charles McGraw and Marie Windsor called "The Narrow Margin," with most of the action taking place aboard the confinement of a speeding train. Their tough chemistry throughout made it very watchable indeed.The remake has made a few minor changes in the story and expanded the scenery to include some lush images of Canadian forests and countryside to give credit to some photogenic Canadian wilderness from various angles. The expansions mean the film isn't quite as taut as the '52 thriller with occasional dull stretches of talk, but the performances are so good that it doesn't matter too much. It still contains a spellbinding climax aboard the top of the train that includes some dangerous stunt work and a nice twist, as well as spectacular moments involving a helicopter.Not bad at all, passes the time quickly and once the suspense aboard the train starts there's no turning away.Perhaps not as good as the original, but still worth watching. Gene Hackman and Anne Archer do fine work at the head of a competent cast.</fullReview>

Gene Hackman is splendid as two-fisted deputy prosecutor who is in charge of transporting a widow and he must attempt to keep her safe from the murderous who would kill her to testify against a mobster played by Harris Yulin. Relieable Anne Archer is first rate as reluctant and long-suffering witness . Lavishly produced cost 20 millions of dollar by today disappeared Carolco created by the famous producers, Mario Kassar and Andrew G Vajna. Moving and stirring musical score by Bruce Broughton, fitting perfectly to action. This thrilling motion picture is finely photographed and stunningly directed by Peter Hyams . However it results to be an inferior remake of its predecessor, a noir classic directed by Richard Fleischer with Mary Windsor and Charles McGraw, one of the best films of the 50s and one of the most successful in the story of RKO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was almost constantly annoying. The main character, supposedly an ex-Marine, manages to get his hands on actual guns several times, which might well have evened up the odds a little in his attempts to escape the assassins sent to kill his charge, so of course the screenwriter inserted bits of business each time to let the "hero" screw it up. He loses one gun whilst he stops to preen himself in a mirror, t'other whilst he tosses off a quip evidently meant to display the screenwriter's facility with Bondish repartee, and is so stuck on himself that he fails to notice when the obvious decoy on the train makes goo-goo eyes at him, ignoring countless real hunks in the process, and so sets up the mandatory denouement in which the decoy (quelle surprise!) acts out the perfect "villain taunting the hero" scene and is vanquished mid-taunt, whilst Bond... pardon... one or another of the Marx Brothers, utters the perfect quip, which in real life would have allowed the decoy to escape and kill both witness and the main character, but of course it doesn't, since the screenwriter couldn't let that happen, so it didn't, but only through brute force, wrestling a happy ending out of a bloody mash-up.I don't mind a little suspension of disbelief, but I prefer honest slapstick to whatever the heck this was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director and writer Peter Hyams took the bold decision to reimage one of the best film noir crime pictures of the 1950s, and all things considered it's not half bad. Without getting close to the greatness of Richard Fleischer's 1952 claustrophobic suspenser that is.Having Gene Hackman and Anne Archer heading up your two principal characters is a good foundation. As the district attorney employee and witness to a mob killing respectively, both actors come up trumps for their director as they are thrust into a game of cat and mouse aboard a speeding train. As the Canadian wilderness outside the train's windows soothes the eyes, the cramped interiors make for good suspense as Hackman plays the calm to Archer's panic.There's nothing new here in terms of thriller conventions, and the pitfalls and familiarity of the plot's ideas keep it from hitting better heights: people still do dumb things ? important details are all too quickly swept aside ? laws of gravity non existent and etc. But refreshingly Hyams resists the chance to insert a cloying romance, while his staging of suspense scenes are very well handled. But of course he's got Hackman being as cool as a cucumber... 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfunctory, apart from the reliable Hackman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcockian is a word that could describe this 1990 thriller, itself a remake of a '50s suspense movie. NARROW MARGIN has all the ingredients that we recognise from the master's movies: a train setting; two killers in endless pursuit; a tough-talking heroine and an ordinary man turned hero. Unfortunately, another word I could use to describe this movie is "bland". "Soulless" would be a third.It's not that it's bad ? it isn't. It's well made, certainly, and technically proficient, let down by only a few lacklustre special effects (such as the superimposed woman in the 'tunnel' scene at the film's climax). Director Peter Hyams was by this stage an old hand at this sort of movie, and he'd already delivered a successful film with a very similar plot, albeit with a sci-fi setting, in 1981's OUTLAND. Another positive is Gene Hackman playing the male lead. Hackman is, like Sean Connery before him, very good at playing an every man hero relying on his wits and abilities to keep himself alive. Without Hackman, this film would have been a lot less entertaining. He's not enthralling here as he has been elsewhere, but his subdued, mannered performance is spot on and he makes his dialogue come alive.It's what the film's lacking that works against it. Although it's a suspense movie, there's little suspense built up here. I can't blame the photography, which makes full usage of claustrophobic inter-train settings and the Canadian wilderness; I can't blame the plot here, which moves nicely along with just the right number of twists and action scenes. The supporting cast isn't half bad, either; M. Emmet Walsh is always a pleasure, even in a truncated turn like his one here; and James B. Sikking is unmissable too. I suppose one of my problems lies with Anne Archer, whose hard heroine is far from likable; she bitches and moans almost the entire running time, even though she's the one the plot hinges around.Even now I can't put my figure on what I don't like about this film ? it just wasn't anything I could get worked up over. I love the premise, have enjoyed its execution in such varied fare as BREAKHEART PASS and UNDER SIEGE 2, but I could work up no excitement over this. I just feel that the director's heart wasn't in it ? and what's left is a perfunctory outing in which everyone's just picking up the pay cheque.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The minute Gene Hackman entered the picture, this was a totally different movie. The murder had to take place, and we had to see the setup that led to it. But this turned into what seemed like an episode of a humorous TV murder mystery. Hackman did a great job and gave us plenty of laughs, even though this wasn't a comedy. Once he and Anne Archer's reluctant witness got together, it was almost a romantic comedy with two mismatched partners. And the action just kept on coming. Along with the two fine performances of the leads, we had plenty of memorable characters. J.A. Preston's demanding district attorney, Emmet Walsh's edgy detective (who didn't stay around long, which was a shame), and an older man who gave up his suite so Caulfield and his "pregnant" wife could have their privacy. Doogie Howser's father did a great job as the main bad guy. And the woman whose name I don't remember who hoped for a romantic relationship with Caulfield.We were always on edge as we wondered what would happen next. And there was the real excitement of action on top of the train cars. And beautiful scenery in western Canada.I mentioned Hackman's comic abilities, but he did an amazing dramatic performance in one scene as he made it clear why he was going to so much trouble to make sure the bad guys got justice, if they could. There are so many moral dilemmas.It was a worthy effort.</fullReview>

He is an everyman kind of actor. Putting him in an action movie sometimes work. There are a few unbelievable moments. The action starts with a helicopter unable to stop a pick-up truck going through the woods. I expect those kinds of scenes from Schwarzenegger or Sly. It's a little odd in a Gene Hackman movie. I really wish the bad guys were in a truck and the truck crashed chasing them down the mountain. That would keep the action in realm of reality. This is an OK straight forward action movie on a train.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Fleischer's "The Narrow Margin" was a great little B-Movie and a classic suspense picture. Peter Hyams' remake is hardly in the same class but it's no disgrace either. It's glossier and done on an altogether larger scale and it makes superb use of some spectacular Canadian scenery. This time it's Anne Archer who is the witness to a killing and Gene Hackman is the Deputy District Attorney trying to keep her alive so she can testify against Mafia boss Harris Yulin. It keeps its train board setting and Hyams builds suspense very nicely in this reasonably claustrophobic locale. Those fine character actors J.T. and M Emmett Walsh are also on hand though they are dispatched much too early for my liking. Not a classic, then, but very enjoyable nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Hyams' 1990 remake of "The Narrow Margin" (1952) is full of suspense, high-speed thrills and exciting action sequences. Visually, many of the film noir characteristics are retained but this production is also considerably glossier and more colourful than its predecessor. Good use is made of some stunning locations in Canada and the cinematography is impressive throughout. The grittiness and sharp dialogue of the original are dispensed with and the main characters are noticeably much more sophisticated and well-mannered than they were in the Richard Fleischer version.Recent divorcée, Carol Hunnicut (Anne Archer) goes on a blind date to a Los Angeles hotel where she meets successful lawyer Michael Tarlow (J.T. Walsh). Before they have a meal, Tarlow receives a note and has to make an important telephone call, so the couple go up to his suite where Carol immediately goes into the bathroom. When she comes out again, she sees two men talking to Tarlow and then witnesses one of them shooting and killing him before leaving. Shocked and panicked by what she's seen Carol furtively leaves the suite and goes into hiding.L.A. Deputy D.A. Robert Caulfield (Gene Hackman) learns that evidence has been found that a witness was present when Tarlow was murdered and also that the identity of the witness has been established. Excited by this information and the possibility it offers of bringing top crime boss, Leo Watts (Harris Yulin) to justice, he then ignores the lack of support that he receives from the D.A. and together with Police Sergeant Dominick Benti (M. Emmett Walsh) heads to the Canadian Rockies where the men visit the log cabin where Carol Hunnicut is hiding out. She's uncooperative and refuses to return to L.A. to testify, but as the men try to change her mind, a mob helicopter arrives overhead and the cabin is immediately engulfed in a storm of machine-gun bullets. Benti is killed in the attack and Caulfield and Hunnicut escape from the cabin in a pick-up truck hotly pursued by the helicopter.After a desperate chase down a steep forestry road, the couple arrive at a nearby station and take a train to Vancouver. The journey that follows proves to be extremely dangerous as there are two hit-men on board and also some other characters such as a fat man and a blonde woman who they don't know if they can trust.Gene Hackman brings a great deal of charm, energy and humour to his role as a guy who's out of his depth doing all the action-hero stunts and sums up his character's incorruptibility when he refuses a huge bribe by saying "I like my side of the courtroom, the pay's not so good but the air's a lot better". Anne Archer is also good in her role and makes her fear palpable as she tries desperately to escape the attentions of all her pursuers."Narrow Margin" features a number of well-executed stunts, some well directed action sequences and a very strong cast. Its Hitchcockian influences add some extra interest but overall it's uncomplicated, fast-moving and extremely enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Narrow Margin" (1990) is a thriller. It uses plot elements from the 1952 noir by the same title and fashions a non-noir thriller. The story is added to and altered in some significant ways, such as to add modern thrills, such as machine gunning from a helicopter and escaping to the top of a moving train. The opening of the film is entirely new. This is not an imitative remake but its own kind of film. The tone of the film is lightened by Gene Hackman's character.Judged on its own merits, it is more or less an average or typical Hollywood thriller. Director Peter Hyams has made some quite entertaining thrillers, like Capricorn One, Outland and The Star Chamber. This movie is another one.What detracts most from this film and prevents it from being a high-grade thriller are the implausibilities. I lost count of them after awhile and just gave up. When too many characters do too many dumb things or fail to do what they should be able to do, illogical and implausible action leads any thriller into fantasy, and that loses the grip on our involvement or at least my involvement. Undiscerning movie fans, however, may simply go with the action flow and not question it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eager deputy assistant district attorney Robert Caulfield (marvelously played by Gene Hackman) has to get reluctant murder witness Carol Hunnicut (a fine and sympathetic performance by the lovely Anne Archer) to testify against a powerful mobster in court. The pair are forced to board a train headed to Vancouver, Canada after narrowly avoiding being killed by two hit men. However, said hit men follow Caulfield and Hunnicut onto the train. Writer/director Peter Hyams treats the terse material with his trademark efficient, economical, and straightforward style, relates the gripping story at a brisk pace, ably crafts plenty of suspense, milks the claustrophobic train setting for all its worth, lace the film with amusing touches of sharp cynical wit, and stages the exciting climax with genuine stirring gusto. The ace acting by the strong cast keeps the movie humming: Hackman and Archer do sterling work in their roles (Hackman in particular brings real depth and a winning wry humor to his character), James Sikking contributes a stand-out turn as shrewd and smooth hit-man Nelson, Nigel Bennett seethes with oily menace as Nelson's cold-blooded partner Jack Woottan, and Susan Hogans brings a sweet charm to her part as the alluring Kathryn Weller, plus there are neat bits by J.T. Walsh as weaselly lawyer Michael Tarlow, M. Emmet Walsh as the sarcastic Sgt. Dominick Benti, Harris Yulin as fearsome gangster Leo Watts, and J.A. Preston as by the book district attorney Martin Larner. The crisp widescreen cinematography by Hyams provides a pleasing polished look. Bruce Broughton's rousing score does the hair-raising trick.

		<fullReview>I just happened to be watching this movie when it came on late night on TBS and I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into, but after reading about the plot, I figured 'what the hey' and just give it a shot. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed at all.After some ominous music, followed by very creative opening credits, we join the story of Carol Honeycutt who is an editor for a publishing company on a blind date with Michael Tarlow, a defense attorney. Michael is obviously a man with lots of secrets but Carol gets to know him quite well and they seem like an even match. However, after getting a phone call in his hotel suite, they adjourn to his room together and Carol decides to get a glass of water from the next room. Unbenowst to her and Tarlow, they have a surprise visitor: Leo Watts, a reputed crime boss with ties to organized crime. After some chit-chat, Leo reveals that he knows that Michael has been 'skimming' from him and Michael 'breaks down' and confesses that he did it and he intended to pay him back. Leo seems like an understanding fellow at first when he tells Michael that he's to return every penny that he took from him and then ties will be severed. But as they near the door, Leo says, 'Michael, I lied' and Leo's associate Jack Wooten pulls out a gun and viciously executes Tarlow, much to Carol's horror. Knowing that her life is on the line because she's a witness, Carol high-tails it out of there, making sure to cover her tracks the best she could.Enter Robert Caufield, a Deputy DA who has been after Watts for years and when he learns that Carol was a witness to the slaying of Michael Tarlow, he jumps at the chance to bring her back to testify (but is met with resistance from his superiors who for some reason, don't want him getting involved). None the less, he and Detective Benti head up to her cabin in Canada and do their best to persuade her to come back and assist them with putting a notorious crime lord behind bars, but to no avail, Carol refuses to cooperate. What was suppose to be a simple 'search and retrieval' assignment soon falls to pieces though when high-tech professional assassins show up and start gunning the cabin to pieces. After Benti is killed and their chopper destroyed, Caufield and Honeycutt flee the cabin in a Bronco pick-up truck down the mountain and to a train station where they will board the first train headed to Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the killers board the train too and are intending to earn what their boss has paid them to do: to eliminate any loose threads. For the next several hours, Caufield and Honeycutt will have to put each other's lives in their hands as they try to outrun, outmaneuver and outwit their adversaries in a lethal game of 'step on or get stepped on'.I was completely blown away and amazed at this film and many people are saying that the first version is better than this remake. I saw the first one and in comparison, the remake has a lot more going for it. Not only do we have nail-biting suspense, but we've got action and great performances by Gene Hackman and Anne Archer. The interesting part is the internal struggle that these two have to go through: besides the killers on the train, Hackman's character must try and convince Archer's character to do the right thing because even if they escape the killers today, Watts would just send more hitters until Honeycutt was dead. Anne Archer did a swell job playing the sharp-tongued Carol Honeycutt who won't cooperate out of fear that she'll be killed but decides to do the right thing when the killers begin to close in on them. The atmosphere of being in a train with no means of escape and no way to tell friend from foe created a claustrophobic setting for the film. It was very impressive and you spend a lot of time rooting for Caufield and Honeycutt to come out on top. They have no weapons, no cellular communication, no backup...they are totally on their own and must rely on each other in order to stay alive.Narrow Margin is a terrific film with an excellent cast...if you haven't seen this one yet, you don't know what you're missing! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So what if some critics say that Peter Hyams' Narrow Margin is filled with improbable coincidences, train-hunt clichés, characters who obviously may not be good guys, and the strenuous activities of a 60-year-old star which would lead to heart attacks for the rest of us. With all that I still think that the film is a lot of fun, a satisfying adventure that relies successfully on two things: First, the proved attractiveness of a murderous, extended hunt in the confines of a moving train; and second, the skill and personality of Gene Hackman. The movie is based on 1952's The Narrow Margin. It shares the title and the basic plot idea with the earlier film, but in tone and style it's as different as a Chicago hot dog is from a Beverly Hills steak. A wise man can enjoy both. Carol Hunnicut (Anne Archer) witnessed a mob hit where Mr. Big, Leo Watts, was present. She wasn't noticed, but she knows that if anyone discovers what she saw she'll become a target for killing. She flees to an isolated cabin in the Canadian Rockies. Unknown to her, she left a fingerprint on a glass, and now L. A. Assistant District Attorney Robert Caulfield (Hackman) not only knows what she saw, he has been able to learn where she's hiding. But when he shows up to convince her to testify, a hail of bullets tears through her cabin. They flee in a truck and barely make it to a small town just as a train is pulling up. Caulfield finagles a private compartment and off they go...followed by the two hit men who had originally followed Caulfield to the cabin. For the rest of the movie we're up to our necks in a polite and lethal cat-and-mouse game as the hit men attempt to locate Hunnicut, whom they've never seen, through Caulfield. At the climax, after a strenuous battle on top of the moving train as it roars over high passes and through tunnels, Caulfield has the chance to say these memorable lines, "You know what I like about you? You're tall." Sure, the movie wouldn't amount to much without Hackman...but with Hackman the movie becomes an exciting duel between Caulfield and the obstacles he has to overcome to save Hunnicut. Hackman has probably made more B movies seem like candidates for A status than any other Hollywood actor. Three fine character actors also add a lot of interest to the film, even though their roles are brief. M. Emmet Walsh plays a good-guy detective sergeant with gum-chewing, wise-mouth quality. J. T. Walsh plays a mob numbers man who made the mistake of skimming off the top. Harris Yulin plays Leo Watts, the mob boss, with cold ruthlessness and a fine disdain. As an added incentive to see the movie, it's a good advertisement for one of the world's great train rides, VIA Rail Canada's rail journey on the Canadian from Toronto to Vancouver (or the other way). With a private compartment, you can't beat the scenery, the service or the cuisine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The total lack of intelligence and direction of the "professional" hit men takes away too much of the drama. Makes one think W. E. Coyote could have done a better job. In order for a thriller to function optimally, there has to be a real sense of danger. No suspense for me, cause the killers looked like they would end up tripping over their own shoelaces from the get-go.Apart from that and the concept of a car chase on a train, not too shabby. The camera angles aren't always stunning, but what CAN you accomplish on a train (apart from maybe building sets to take over some scenes). Solid acting all round I feel. Archers character is a bit lacking in initiative, but maybe that was what she was directed into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie held me in more suspense than I had anticipated, and therefore I greatly enjoyed watching it. The plot has a few hooks in it, that make it a bit overdone, but also unexpected and fun in certain cases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen both the 1952 and the 1990 version lately. I like the new one better because there is much more action and tension than the old one. I agree that the old one as far as being a B movie in black and white is a darn good one, but the new one in widescreen and color is superior. The old one is mostly all talk very similar to live TV shows of the fifties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assistant D.A. in Los Angeles (Gene `Popeye' Hackman) must escort a witness (Ann Archer) of a mob-related murder to the D.A.; sooner do they both know that the people responsible are eager to burn the loose ends. Most of the movie is a chase taking place in the corridors and rooms of a moving train. Suspenseful, often funny, lush scenery of the British Columbian wilderness, a potential see if the latest action movies are checked out at the rental store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie if you are willing to suspend a bit of disbelief for 2 hours. James Sikking and his goons are out to off Anne Archer; Gene Hackman's job is to protect her. Your standard action/thriller with just enough explosions, fights, and twists to keep things interesting. Worth renting or watching on TV at least once. I rate it 6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A team of professional killers attempt to silence a witness who can i.d. their boss in a murder case. On a long train ride across Canada, a D.A. and the witness must evade the hitmen long enough to reach a large city and safety. High voltage tension all the way with enough stress to raise anybody's blood pressure 10 points or more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>abominably silly...but I kept watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, for those who love to count stupid moments in movies, look no further. Unfortunately, in revealing the goofs I'll be giving away a bunch of scenes, but there's no other way to review the film. First things first; everything begins with a blind date. Archer is on one with barely glimpsed Walsh. He needs to respond to a phone call up in his hotel room. He invites her along, and as he's getting his message, she's in the bathroom. There's a knock at the door, and it's one of Walsh's clients, and another man. After a teary-eyed talk, Walsh comes clean that he's stolen from his client. The client tells Walsh he is to pay back everything he stole and then ties will be severed. But just as the guy reaches the door, his goon pulls out a silencered gun and pops Walsh, as Archer watches thru the crack in a door. After the coast is clear she bolts, then leaves town. Enter Hackman, a D.A. A detective has brought to him that Archer's fingerprints were left at the scene. So they both trek up to the Canadian Rockies (the film at least has the guts to admit it was shot in Canada) to retrieve her so she can testify that a mob bad guy is who was in the hotel room. Here's where you can get your pencils ready. How do they know, but not the mob, where the woman has been hiding? How is it that the woman so conveniently has a mountain retreat at her disposal up in Canada (especially after it's revealed that she is a proofreader for publishing company)? Then after surprise machine gun fire, how is it that Hackman and his cohort, along with the pilot, did not see another chopper following them? After a chase thru the woods to a train station, they luck their way into a sleeper car, where more silliness (and more of my questions) can occur. Such as: why does Hackman, when given the oppurtunity to just dump one of the bad guys off the train, instead pull him in(!), grunt "End of the line, a**hole!", and then show-off to the guy that he's using a toy gun!! Or when he realizes that he's talking to a couple of the killers posing at cops, he makes the dumb excuse that his tummy hurts and he needs to use the toilet before handing Archer over to them. Well, enough of that. But even with it said, my interest was still held the whole way cuz the film does supply some actual smart moments. Throw in a pretty good action filled ending (you knew it would end up on top of the train sometime) and you've got a passable 2 hours. But look out for Archer, totally unlikable, constantly bitching at Hackman. Ok, her life's in danger, but she just doesn't quit. Hackman is what you expect of him, always great, but is too smart to be making movies like this with all the moments of dumbness that are found. Have fun with it, the good and sometimes very bad moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off The Rails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made here of the fact that this is yet another remake of a film widely considered to be a classic. On the whole I am not sympathetic to remakes of even non-classics simply because most of the films that inspire fond memories reflected that period in which they were made - how would Laura or Ninotchka for example look if remade today - and it is totally impossible to replicate 'feel'. On the face of it this remake is absurd: The black-and-white original made a virtue of necessity; it was a 'B' picture with a 'B' budget so Fleisher shot it all in a confined space and juggled the camera angles to great effect. The woman (Marie Windsor) was the wife of the gangster and hard as nails, not, as here, a more or less innocent bystander who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. By opening it out, creating a whole new exposition about the blind date we just lose valuable time that could have been concentrated - as in the original version - on the claustrophobic laced with danger train journey. The remake is not without the odd thrill but if both versions are freely available I can't see anyone settling for the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Narrowly on the margin between good and rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I'm a big fan of light-weight throwaway entertainment that I can enjoy for ninety minutes or more and then forget...but unfortunately, Narrow Margin isn't all that good, even in that limited capacity. The plot is completely generic, and unfortunately doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. We follow a woman who went on a blind date, only to have the mafia break in and blow him away! Enter deputy district attorney Robert Caulfield - a man who decides to protect her from the mob when the pair are chased onto a train travelling through Canada. I wasn't expecting anything too good from this film anyway because of the fact that it stars Gene Hackman. Not that I have anything against Hackman - I just find him annoying and overrated. The film is directed by experienced director Peter Hyams, and doesn't have anything in terms of ingenuity from the direction. I'm guessing that Hyams was simply hired to direct this film rather than having any actual ties to it. The plot moves sluggishly for a lot of the film, but things do perk up a bit once we reach the train. The final twist feels completely tacked on, although the final fight scene has its moments. Overall, this might do something for someone - but it didn't for me, and therefore I cannot recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXTREMELY average thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is extremely average in many ways. The story is done about an hundred times before and the movie doesn't really come up with something interesting or unique.(MINOR SPOILER)The movie began quite well but after J.T. Walsh got killed right in the beginning, the movie went downhill extremely fast and I lost my interest more and more.(END OF MINOR SPOILER)But the absolute worst thing about the movie was the extremely simple almost amateur like editing. It didn't made the movie flow very well and it even made some of the scene's laughable while they were intended to be exciting. The scene at the ending with Kathryn Weller is a great example of a laughable scene thanks to the poor editing.The story is filled with flaws but it is also due to the poor editing that the story seems flawed at times.(MINOR SPOILER)Like for example M. Emmet Walsh's death sequences. I didn't realized and/or saw he was death until Gene Hackman and Anne Archer got in the car alone.(END OF MINOR SPOILER)No, you can better skip this movie. If you want to see a thriller then there are better movies out there to watch.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>
