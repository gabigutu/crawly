		<shortDescription>It's so bad it's an insult to all involved- blame the director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To venture a remake of Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" (1955) -- a film that needed no remake in the first place -- only one thing was crucial: a very creative filmmaker with a very personal style, so as to put away comparisons with the classic French film. Someone like Kubrick, Von Trier, Amenábar, Chabrol, Jeunet...Instead we have Chechik's ludicrous, inept direction, making the experienced crew's efforts simply bomb: the cinematography is flat, the music is predictable, the script is stale, the pace is sloooow, and he manages to withdraw bad performances from EVERYONE in the cast, including the usually reliable Kathy Bates, besides achieving the incredible feat of making Isabelle Adjani look like she's just escaped from Madame Tussaud's, and cruelly exposing the unmistakably limited talents of Sharon Stone (who manages to look like a dominatrix in the role of a Catholic school teacher!!) and Chazz Palminteri.When a film is THIS bad, considering the names involved and the amount of money spent, it's really an insult to everyone, most of all to the audience (of course). After this bomb, you'd think Hollywood directors would just leave classic thrillers alone -- but Gus Van Sant went on to commit the catastrophic remake of "Psycho".... Don't waste your time - just don't watch it, especially if you are a fan of the original film or of the stars!!! My vote: since IMDb doesn't allow zeroes, 1/10 is more than it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar Wilde was one of the great wits of his age, but he was allegedly not averse to appropriating other people's bons mots. It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said "I wish I had said that!". Whistler's reply was "You will, Oscar, you will". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says "We wish we had made that!" You will, Hollywood, you will!Recent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of "Sommersby" may have been blatantly lifted from "Le Retour de Martin Guerre", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's "Nikita" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle "The Assassin". Sometimes, however, Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Diabolique" is a case in point.Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties, as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original, but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school, a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistress,tired of his mistreatment, plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool, but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original, there is a sudden, surprise twist at the end. Chechik also, however,introduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife, Mia, here becomes a former nun, who has renounced her vows after losing her faith, but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress, Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character, in the form of a female detective, with no equivalent in the original film."Diabolique" has come in for some sharp criticism, largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one, and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with, it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless, I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original, and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And, compared with Clouzot's, Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense, with the result that his film is slow-moving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.I was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language, as she showed in "La Reine Margot", but I have not been impressed with her in English-language films, and here her character never came to life. Sharon Stone was slightly better as the hard-bitten, sluttish Nicole, but this was not really one of her better performances and did nothing to alter my view that she has not always chosen the best vehicles in which to show off her talents. Chazz Palminteri's headmaster was almost too unpleasant to be believable, and Kathy Bates seemed wasted as the detective. Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end; watching Chechik's, my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isabelle Adjani, please fire your agent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor Isabelle Adjani. She is one of the most beautiful women in the world and one of the finest actresses alive.(See "The Story of Adele H" for proof of both of these claims.) Yet somehow her agent (or whoever is responsible for these horrible decisions) keeps casting her in the worst American films he can possibly find. Did somebody say "Ishtar?"The American version of "Diabolique" is a perfect example of how Hollywood can ruin a classic film. The original 1955 French film is a subtle, fun, nail-biting mystery that builds to a wonderful ending. In this silly remake, director Jeremiah Chechik takes out the fun and subtlety, throws in some nudity, then "builds" to that same, tired "bad guy trying to kill the good guy" ending we have seen a million times before. Please!If and when Isabelle Adjani is cast in a decent American movie, she will become the biggest star in the world. Until then, our loss is France's gain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Known primarily for light Comedy Features Jeremiah Chechik thought of a change-of-pace and adapted for his third entry into directing the famous novel "Celle Qui N'etait Pas" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, which also served as model for the French Crime-Classic LES DIABOLIQUES from 1955 by Henri-Georges Clouzot. With an interesting cast of four fine character actors in the leading roles and a budget of 30 million dollars in his hands Chechik came up with a uneven, slow-moving, pale and glossy Thriller about a tyrannical school-master who is drowned by his long-suffering wife and mistress and thrown into the School Pool, but strangely disappears. Before the film's release there were much rumours about creative differences between the director and Miss Sharon Stone, the latter one aiming for a black comedy and Chechik shaping a crime movie on his own. Well, both failed.You can hardly judge a movie by its trailer, because sometimes the latter one can be much better than the movie it is promoting. Take for example DIABOLIQUE: The first moving pictures I saw from it were very stylish and appealing, like the drunken Palminteri, the Whiskey-Glass falling down in slow-motion, the out-of-the-water-perspective-shot of Palminteri looking at the two women who pull his head into the water etc. etc. etc.But finally watching the film was hugely disappointing. I think I wouldn't have been that dissatisfied hadn't I seen the perfectly structured original just a couple of months ago on TV. Jeremiah Chechik &amp; Co. turned the brilliantly structured and genuinely haunting thriller into a stupid, below-average Hollywood thriller that relies too much on its star power.Hey, our teacher is lying naked on the floor! The film begins with a little boy (Adam Hann-Byrd) looking one rainy night through his bedroom window into the opposite bathroom window of his naked teacher Miss Mia (Isabelle Adjani) who suddenly has a heart attack and fells on the floor. Shocked he runs out of his accommodation into the other to save her (or maybe to see the chick naked... yeah!). Meanwhile Mias husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri), the principal of the boarding-school, comes into the bathroom looking at her without any reaction. Then his mistress and her colleague Nicole (Sharon Stone) shows off and gives her the medicaments to stop the pains. Okay, that's the situation. Guy is an emotionless, sadistic bad guy of the highest order, who to the viewer's surprise can keep his wife and mistress under control. But the sensible, heart-troubled Mia is fed up with him and so is her cool, cynical friend, colleague and rival in one named Nicole. They both decide to kill him and make it appear like he drowned himself.Hey, our teacher is killing her husband! Mia and Nicole leave for the school holidays and move into a apartment, where Guy shows off depressed about Mias decision of getting divorced. She gives him something to drink with narcotics in it. After Guy is drowned by both women they put the dead body into a big case, drive it back to school and throw it into the school pool. But the next day, when the pool is cleaned the body's missing...Jeremiah's Genre Vacation. Chechik was already a acclaimed and award-winning director of commercials and music clips when he entered the film business making his way through the Chevy-Chase-Comedy NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION (1989), the audience-friendly Romantic Comedy BENNY &amp; JOON (1993) starring Johnny Depp and Mary Stuart Masterson and the Fantasy-Comedy TALL TALE (1995) with Patrick Swayze. So far, so... acceptable, but how could he think of helming the US remake of a French classic that was almost perfect in its own rights and couldn't be topped or even reached. So the comparison between Clouzots and Chechiks interpretations of the same story is inevitable. Chechik focuses very much on the stylish visuals and atmosphere of his film pushing it sometimes to a kind of gothic nightmare placed in a old, shadow-filled, dark boarding-school, cool-as-ice-light filter on the actors, especially dead-cold Sharon Stone, and good art direction, made even more accessible by unsubtle slow-motion scenes and unusual camera angles. But these things don't make the already highly suspenseful story any better or worse. Surprisingly Clouzots tight creation of the not-so-wealthy-boarding-school with its dark gaits is far more effective. Clouzots visuals don't harm the story nor the excellent cast, so that every detail of the clever plot and the intriguing characters could be fleshed out. That's focused storytelling at its best with every single frame fitting into the story. But Chechik doesn't seem do care about pacing or character development and focuses on stupid plot details to make it logical for "stupid" American audiences, which weighs down the whole film, especially in the unbelievably bad third act. Add to that a mediocre mystery-score by Edelman and you will fall asleep halfway through. In the end Chechik is in the wrong genre, whether it is a black comedy or a thriller.Catherine Tramell without a ice-pick and Queen Margot without a crone. The teaming of Sex symbol Sharon Stone, who just had turned through her excellent work in Martin Scorseses epic gangster movie CASINO into a Oscar-nominated, serious actress, and internationally popular Isabelle Adjani, a versatile and talented performer, looks attracting on the paper, but not onscreen. Miss Stone does her Catherine-Tramell-routine from her most famous film BASIC INSTINCT (1991) in the role of Nicole, who in the original was played by the beautiful Simone Signoret. Stone is cool, cynical, calculating, clever and bitchy, but doesn't appear nude. So Isabelle Adjani has to do that job. While Stone's performance as bitch dressed in tasteless clothes and smoking lady-like is so broad that it's almost great fun, Adjani is a huge disappointment looking as ugly as she never looked before with her black hair hanging down in front of her face like big curtains and her face incredibly pale and in terms of acting disastrous. What a waste of beauty and talent! But she should be used to this kind of treatment by Hollywood after forget-about-appearances in Walter Hills THE DRIVER (1978) and Elaine Mays flop ISHTAR (1987). In the original Clouzots real-life-wife Vera excels as sensible beauty who slowly gets crazy and frightened. Add to this unhappy pairing of good actresses some other wasted performers like Chazz Palminteri, who after doing the intense-as-usual a**hole-routine turns into a stupid Michael-Myers-copy, and Kathy Bates, who is to a certain degree solid fun, and useless appearances by Adam Hann-Byrd (LITTLE MAN TATE, 1991), Spading Gray (SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA, 1987) and Allen Garfield (THE STATE OF THE THINGS, 1982).Adaptation equals creative death. Don Roos who scripted the race-relation-drama LOVE FIELD (1992) starring Michelle Pfeiffer and the sexy thriller SINGLE WHITE FEMALE (1992) took on the task of updating Clouzots flawless and tight script. The best thing he could have done was to note some costume, setting and dialect changes into the original script and hand it over to the director, but that - sadly - isn't the way Hollywood does its adaptations of European movies. So what we get here are too many subplots weighing down the actual plot, like for example a filmmaker-couple who are ordered to make a commercial for the school, some fine ideas like turning the Columbo-lookalike-detective from the original into a clever, ironical heavy-set Ex-Detective suffering from breast cancer, and finally one of the worst finales to be found in any film of the decade. It's neither thrilling nor funny, just increasingly stupid.</fullReview>

The two women plot to kill him, but after the murder their plan starts to fall through. The body disappears, then more and more signs become apparent to prove: he is alive.The real mystery is why anyone had to remake a classic French thriller that was imitated so many times before, why it had to be done so terribly, cast so wrongly and acted in such unsubtle way - and why anyone on earth should care the whole stuff.</fullReview>

The credits do not include the fact that it is based on the wonderful earlier version, from 1954, or the book it was based on- and maybe it's just for the best. A terrible movie; the most unsubtle movie I ever saw. And somehow, the beautiful Isabel Adjani doesn't look so good in English. The plot in this version isn't realistic, the ending is pathetic, the twists are shallow. This movie deserves all the bad words in the English language. I gave it a 1, which it deserves only for Adjani's clothes. One of the worst movies of 1996, perhaps of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DIABOLIQUE a diabolical debacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diabolique (1996) Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, Chazz Palminteri, Kathy Bates, Spalding Gray, Shirley Knight, D: Jeremiah S. Chechik. Revamped version of the 1955 French thriller, with Palimenteri as a tyrannical boys-school headmaster done in by the joined forces of his mousy wife (Adjani) and icy blonde mistress (Stone) in a murder plot they wrongfully assume is foolproof. First-rate performers can't serve justice to this diabolical debacle, which doesn't start off too bad, then goes astray. This unspeakably bad rip-off trashes the classic original with too many `oh, come on' moments, ridiculous red herrings and twists of its own, and a finale right out of a slasher flick. Bates is even gone to waste as a retired detective who's investigating the case `for something to do'. Running Time: 107 minutes and rated R for nudity and sexual content, violence, and some language. * ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic French thriller Diabolique has a sturdy story, which is one reason why it is a target for remakes. The film was remade for American television twice - first as Reflections of Murder (featuring Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston) and later as House of Secrets (with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner). To be honest, both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch, if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent, while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original, the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated.The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name, story and setting would seem a step in the right direction, but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices.The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school, Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani - who suffers from a weak heart - to assorted cruelties. In his spare time, he engages in S&amp;M with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women - tired of his abuse - decide to murder him, drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan.The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress, it would be Stone. Unfortunately, the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way.The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original, it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does, particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh, but the shaggy dog pseudo-feminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire.If Stone was an inspired choice, the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani, looking puffy and listless, is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laid-back "frightened" performance one has ever seen on celluloid.Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor, she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the "we're all sisters under the skin" meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately, her character and performance belongs in a completely different (and one would argue better) film.And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri, providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes, is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off, Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that, but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri, resembling a large trout, and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda, seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him (much less two) and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen.Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious, which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and double-crosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is - something that the original (as well as its TV remakes) never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand, but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer.The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks - with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight, one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk. One is sternly advised to locate either the original French classic or one of its TV counterparts before descending to this entry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suckered by an American remake of 'Diabolique' (not that I'm bitter)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw that 'Diabolique' was showing on a cable movie channel, and I had heard great things about it, and so I was prepared to be impressed and intrigued, and to improve my 'cultural literacy' in the process.Instead, what I got was a draggy, lifeless 'film noir' remake with Sharon Stone and Chazz Palmintieri. The frustrating thing about the movie was that it was JUST GOOD ENOUGH and kept JUST ENOUGH of the elements of the original plot to make me hope that things would improve somehow. So I kept watching it. But it never did.I am not Sharon Stone's biggest fan, but I acknowledge that she gave a compelling performance in "Casino", and that very few actresses past or present could have played her role better. (Joan Crawford or Betty Davis, maybe). And she's a black hole of bitterness and anger here -somehow sexually inviting and repellent at the same time. That doesn't make for comfortable viewing. There's the same problem with the lesbian undercurrents between the wife and the mistress - it ought to be titillating or erotic, but it's just stale and nasty. And Chazz Palmintieri is a great character actor( see 'The Usual Suspects' or "Bullets Over Broadway"), but the character he plays is such a flat-out son-of-a-bitch that you really don't want to watch him.But the real the problem with the film is that they were going for dread and suspense, but the pacing and rhythms of each of the individual scenes was way off - empty and interminable. So the viewer wound up feeling dread and BOREDOM instead. That doesn't make for 'recommended film viewing'.I still hope to seek out the original one of these days, so at least the remake didn't spoil anything. And some one else might like this version just fine on its own merits, depending on how big a Stone fan they are (it is really her movie - her character drives the events in the plot).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guy Baran (Chazz Palminteri) is the dean of an old school inherited by his wife, the teacher Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani) that has heart disease. Guy is an abusive husband and has a love affair with his mistress Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone), who is a school teacher in the same school. One day, Nicole and Mia plot a scheme to murder Guy and Mia spikes his whiskey and he faints. Then Nicole and Mia drown him in the bathtub and dump his body in the swimming school. Then Nicole dumps her keys in the swimming pool expecting that the school janitor finds him when he drains the pool. However there is no body in the pool and Nicole and Mia believe that someone knows the truth. When the snoopy retired Detective Shirley Vogel (Kathy Bates) investigates the disappearance, Mia freaks out and is near to destroy their alibi. What might have happened to the body of Guy Baran?"Diabolique" is a poor and unnecessary American remake of a 1955 French classic directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. The director Jeremiah S. Chechik succeeds not only in destroying the story and the atmosphere of the original film with clichés and a boring slow pace, but also in wasting a great cast with names such as Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, Chazz Palminteri and Kathy Bates. Isabelle Adjani, for example, looks like a moron and not a fragile wife. The conclusion is a mess. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Diabolique"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame The Director-Not the Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With some of Hollywood's worst trash on his resume, Director Jeremiah Chechik gives us something slightly better than his worst ("The Avengers") and much worse than his best ("Benny and Joon").This oddly unsatisfying 1996 remake of the classic 1955 French thriller illustrates Hollywood's ham handed ability to turn a classic suspense tale into a weak atmosphere piece. I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of well-played scenes by fine actresses, but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation. Which could be caused by a lot of things but is most likely the result of trimming in post-production, in which important unifying elements were left on the cutting room floor. Or it could be that the director and production designer just failed to translate the writer's vision onto the screen.Since this ultimately this is a story about an evil character who develops a sentimental side, it is absolutely critical that this process is communicated to the audience. The audience should not just be surprised by the ending but should be able to think back and see all the motivational pieces click into place. In this regard the movie is a complete failure.Then there is the issue of cheating. Because we only know what he wants to tell us, a director has a variety of legit ways to introduce misdirection and surprise into a film. But occasionally a director lacks the integrity and vision to play by the rules. Such is the case here as only the audience sees the underwater shot of a clearly drowned Guy (Chazz Palminteri). It is shown to convince us that he is dead but this then makes his reanimation impossible. Plus it is fairly useless because you know that he has to come back for there to be much of a story. That is cheating and there is more cheating in the unintentionally comical climatic scene. The beauty of the original movie was the absence of cheating and the macabre irony of the ending. All that is missing.Whatever, it means that the only reason to watch this version of "Diabolique" is for the acting of Adjani and Stone. Although Adjani was 40-41 years old when she made this film, she has lost little of her beauty. While she was probably the world's most beautiful actress in her twenties, there is simply no debate that she was the most beautiful 40 year-old in cinema history. Stone pretty much plays her hard-as-nails self but she is given some great lines and her character is a great contrast to the ethereal take Adjani gives to her own character.If you are looking for a better but less obvious remake of the original "Diabolique", track down 1971's "Let's Scare Jessica To Death". This almost forgotten horror classic is truly scary. It has much better production design than 1996's "Diabolique", with creepy whispering and images that stay with you and creep you out even weeks later. Jessica is a woman recently released from a mental "institution" who goes to a farm in a quiet rural area. The odd locals and their local legends begin to mess with Jessica's head as her husband and his secret girlfriend attempt to scare her to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>C'mon, camp-ers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I just adore this little flop of a movie. The look, the acting (especialy Stone, Bates and Knight) and the screenplay all converge toward a distinctly campy second degree, sometimes close to comedy. Make it black comedy.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Clouzot fan; Le Corbeau is one of my all time favorite, and his original Diaboliques, based on Boileau and Narcejac short story, ranks prominently in my list, too. And frankly, I was quite ambivalent about it being remade. And then I heard of the casting (Stone/Adjani), which is a once in a lifetime kinda thing and the choice of giving direction to then newcomer Jeremiah Chechick, still fresh from his well received debut Benny and Joon.So I told to myself, "Hey, could be worse". But I wasn't entirely convinced. Of course, I didn't know then that Don Roos had penned the laced in acid screenplay with the tongue firmly in cheek.Stone's Nicole: "You're dead, this is heaven and I'm the Vigin Mary. Can you swallow?" This is one of my favorite line, ever. That Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe homage with Shirley Knight is also priceless.To appreciate this movie, I think you must be a camp addict, or a gay, or both. One way or the other, the audience for this kind of sophisticated junk seems to be timid, or easily convinced to doubt of its own tastes. Maybe that's why Basic Instinct 2, a very similar outing, flopped. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two beautiful women in a misguided remake of a great French classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard some really bad things about this remake of the classic French film 'Les Diaboliques', and I would never have expected it to be a patch on the brilliant original anyway; the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it happened to be on TV, and there happened to be nothing else on. However, after the first half hour or so; while the film indeed is nothing on the original, it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start; the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film; here they're extremely boring, and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress; neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea, and promptly do it. However, after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied; the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive...It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot, but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone, who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good, which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting, and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads, though nothing really comes of it; definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original, the ending came as no surprise; but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall, I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long; but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely incomprehensible remake does its best to thoroughly trash the memory of the classic original. Tall, blonde Sharon Stone actually was a good choice to play the Simone Signoret role, but Stone totally camps it up, making it very difficult to take anything even remotely seriously about her. Isabelle Adjani, one of France's most beautiful and talented actresses, does well in the Vera Clouzot role, but Chazz Palminteri comes across as too much of a pompous jerk that one couldn't care less what happens to him. As if Stone and Palminteri weren't enough to insure this project's failure, the screenwriter completely changed the ending! I would vote this one as the all-time worst remake, but there's always Gus Van Sant's rendition of PSYCHO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diabolique is set in Pennsylvania at the St. Anselm's boarding school for boys which is owned by Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), however her husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri) who runs the school treats her like dirt &amp; cheats on her. Mia &amp; a teacher named Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone) whom is one of Guy's many lovers devise a plan to kill him &amp; make it look like an accident, the plan is to drown him &amp; then throw him in the school pool where he will be found &amp; to the police his death will seem like a simple drowning. However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it, once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead? Did someone find out there plan? Who knows...Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques (1955) which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau &amp; Thomas Narcejac &amp; I thought was a fairly lazy &amp; plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless &amp; slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to, to show someone committing the so-called perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it &amp; seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst, most predictable &amp; frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware, anyway I hate the fact that Mia &amp; Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood &amp; Nicole was prepared to trick Mia &amp; ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also, if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also, what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die, be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged, it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film, it's horribly acted &amp; it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes &amp; I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending, one to avoid.Director Chechik has made some really, really awful films &amp; after this mess &amp; his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers (1998) which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting, especially by the two female leads Stone &amp; Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's, I hated their acting &amp; thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning no-one under that age can watch it, I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning, no nudity or sex &amp; it's devoid of any action or excitement.Technically the film is alright but it's flat, dull &amp; blandly filmed. There's no real style here &amp; it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful.Diaboliques is a slow moving, utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feeding the male libido</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This is a sexploitation thriller but not all that bad, mainly because it is played somewhat tongue-in-cheek so that the plot absurdities might be overlooked in the interest of high camp, or at least in the interest of a mild diversion, and also because the women are diabolically diverting each in her own way.Especially effective in a satirical performance is Sharon Stone as Nicole Horner, a duplicitous siren teaching math at a boy's boarding school. (Just the thought conjures up visions of a vampish Mary Kay Letoureau, although director Jeremiah Chechik studiously avoids that angle.) Her partner in crime is French actress Isabelle Adjani who plays Mia Baran, an ex-nun who is the owner of the school unhappily married to (after being seduced by, it appears) the school's sadistic task master Guy Baran played with a steady macho malevolence by Chazz Palminteri. Adjani, whom I recall (vividly) from Truffaut's L'Histoire d'Adele H. (1975) in which she played Victor Hugo's daughter Adele who was obsessively in love with an English army lieutenant who didn't want her. The masochistic persona employed there is revisited here as Mia is used by both her husband and Nicole Horner, who is also Guy's mistress.Coming lately onto the scene is Kathy Bates as a man-despising, middle-aged, slightly butch Nancy Drew who doesn't let a partial mastectomy slow her down as she sleuths about looking for clues. She has some fine one-liners, but perhaps the best in the film comes from Sharon Stone. Two of the school's middle-aged bores have just come upon Stone and Adjani in the courtyard. Stone's ever-present cigarette inspires this from one of the men: "Don't you know that second-hand smoke kills?" Sharon Stone maneuvers past him, blows smoke in his face, and replies, "Not reliably."This is a remake of Les Diaboliques (1955) starring Simone Signoret which I have not seen. My guess is that the French version played it straight and made the ending at least plausible. Here we have not only a ridiculous ending but a plot in dire need of a plot doctor. I have also not seen the TV version, Reflections of Murder, starring that quintessential sex-kitten (and personal favorite) Tuesday Weld. Anybody got a copy?Bottom line: see this for Isabelle Adjani, whose over the top performance is garnished with an au naturale glimpse, and for Sharon Stone who is at her diabolical best. Be aware however that if sexual exploitation of the male libido is not your cup of tea, you will not like this movie, and even if it is, you may find the story more than a bit silly.</fullReview>

If you are interested in narrative structure, you'll be interested in remakes of films and how they change. (I think these are changes to the original.)First, in true folding style, they added a film within the film. The film within is a recruiting film, but that hardly matters.Second, they changed the dynamic of the detective by making him a her. This allows for the third change but along the way the possibilities exist for the three types of women: the virgin, the whore and the shrew. It isn't played up well enough to matter, but its clear that someone's intuition was tuned.Third, there is a final twist that I think is quite different than the original's. It bonds the three women, already hinted in a lesbian tendency between the first two. But amazingly, the film didn't work well for me, probably because of pacing problems at various levels. Not that any level was off by the interplay of levels wasn't syncopated according to what engages. Its an intuitive process, I think, but quite rigid in its rules.Isabelle Adjani was cast perfectly, and introduced very skillfully. Beginnings are hard.This in its original incarnation was the first double con movie, I think. Adding a third was inevitable, I suppose.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Diabolique" (1996) (rated 5.3) is a neo-noir remake of the noir "Les Diaboliques" (1955), rated over 8 by IMDb voters. These assessments are correctly ordered, in my opinion. The new version drains the story of all suspense. The story's plot points have almost no emotional impact. The movie is sleepwalking. The able cast under evidently bad direction cannot salvage the movie. It's all they can do to prevent themselves from looking bad. Sharon Stone is worth seeing in her hard and tough persona. Ms. Adjani is too wide-eyed too much of the time. Kathy Bates is suitably annoying. The story itself doesn't really add up logically. Also, after a point, it's easy to figure out. Everyone goes through the motions but the result is bland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake but leaves a lot to be desired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diabolique is the the third remake of the infamous 1955 classic French film 'Diabolique'. That itself was an adaptation by author Pierre Boileau. The previous 1993 TV movie is better off forgotten, due to it's shallow atmosphere. Comparisons with the original is not something somebody would want to dwell too much on. But the question that does arise is 'Does it remain faithful to the original?. To a large extent yes this movie is much closer to the original source, but there are slight differences. Them being the ending and little detail to a few minor sub plots. The ending in the 1955 film was quiet ambiguous. And it was not certain as to whether the protagonist survived or not. So the makers decided to change it a little and make it seem like a grand finale. I feel viewers and critics were unhappy with this because it defied logic.The film has decent pacing and there is never a dull moment. However I would not deny that there is a lot that could have been changed and improved on. The editing is poor and I wonder if the screen play writer had even revised the scenes after production for errors. I could not recall when Mia had even discovered that her husband was cheating on her. And it was not revealed who had taken those photos. Sharon Stone gets under the skin of the role as usual is very convincing as the femme fatale. Kathy Bates is funny in the serious manner. Unfortunately Isabelle Adjani doesn't manage to seem much interested in her role. Perhaps this could be because she is not used to acting in English. Her anxiety moments do provoke some laughter. The films scores well as a genuine remake. Despite the flaws, it is worth a watch. But there are far worse ones out there. Need I mention 'Psycho'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I should described this movie in one sentence - Watchable, but completely unnecessary. I decided to watch this remake, because original movie is one of my favorites. I expected a lot more. Let's concentrate on acting - in original movie Vera Clouzot was the one that bought me, her terrified look on face and tension through whole movie. In the other hand - Isabelle Adjani - very, very bad acting, not convincing at all. Sharon Stone - very good copy of Simone Signoret, but that's it - just a copy. When you are making a remake of a great movie I think you should make a few changes, to add some special touch to whole movie, but changes in this movie were complete fail. Especially the ending (someone was obviously disappointed that in original movie two women weren't such good friends after all), which became ridiculous farce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diabolique (1996): Dir: Jeremiah Chechik / Cast: Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, Chazz Palminteri, Kathy Bates, Spalding Gray: Remake of 1955 French classic about limitations of mind and body before madness sets in. Reduced to dull slasher clichés and slow pacing. Chazz Palminteri stars as a school headmaster who is involved with two women. He abuses them until they sum up the urge to kill him. They dump the body in the pool outside but he survives and seeks revenge. Story relies on formula but director Jeremiah Chechik uses style to execute it. This is an odd choice of material for a director who made National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and Benny and June. Sharon Stone is reciting her Basic Instinct territory as a teacher with an icy personality, while Isabelle Adjani plays a fragile mistress whom Stone will become involved with. Palminteri's role is that of questionable fate when his body goes missing. Kathy Bates appears as an inspector in a role that is both standard and corrupt. The original is thrilling entertainment at its best and scary at that. It was haunting and suspenseful while this remake is well crafted yet reduced to a sexed up slasher film with a climax bent on violence. It sucks that modern audiences cannot view a film like this without manipulative crap thrown in. This version is stylish but an outright peep show with its grim images but the original is still head of the class. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The kind of needless remake (of the Henri-Georges Clouzot French classic) that gives all remakes a bad name. The wife &amp; mistress of a nasty school headmaster plot to kill him. Director Jeremiah S. Chechik assembles a colorful cast then wastes them all. Isabelle Adjani is blank faced throughout &amp; Sharon Stone's performance is embarrassingly bad. Stone, in a role played in the 1955 original by Simone Signoret is a lot like Signoret...if Signoret had zero talent and no charisma. Whatever sex appeal and moxie Stone built up via BASIC INSTINCT &amp; CASINO is stripped away here. She's like a mannequin who smokes a lot of cigarettes. She's not helped by a lame-brained script that has her spout some very silly one-liners. In a role reportedly (and wisely) nixed by Jack Nicholson, Chazz Palminteri plays the headmaster. Kathy Bates is a cop on the case. This film's idea of character development is to reveal that Bates suffered from breast cancer! Spalding Gray &amp; Shirely Knight are in it too. Sole highlight: some very good cinematography by Peter James, who shot several Bruce Beresford films including DRIVING MISS DAISY. Chechik, a talented director who'd previously helmed the under-rated BENNY &amp; JOON and TALL TALES, saw his career evaporate shortly after working on this debacle and then on another dog, a movie version of the classic '60s TV show THE AVENGERS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone recently said "Hollywood hates originality". This is the unfortunate evidence. I can only guess that the few favorable reviews came from people who never experienced the original film or were just too lazy to watch a film in a foreign language. Clouzot's effort was magnificent way back in the '50's. This was just a sad attempt at some fast bucks with no talent in front of or behind the camera. In the original film, the background of the school was seedy and cheap, the characters were unattractive in general and the surroundings were oppressive. This "sanitized" version misses the original point entirely. There was little or no suspense and no "atmosphere" at all. What a stupid waste.

Tired of both being physically and emotionally abused, Nicole and Mia decide to murder Guy and drown him in a bathtub before dumping his body in the school pool. However the body goes missing and it appears that someone is pretending that Guy is still alive. Meanwhile a private investigator begins to suspect something is amiss.With a solid cast I had reasonable hopes for this film. It all looks classy enough with good direction, however the plot is a pretty basic thriller plot that will remind many viewers of something else that they have seen. The film has several twists that will be apparent before they happen and it does sadly lack thrills and tension for much of the film.The cast try hard but are hampered by a plot that works nicely on a storyboard but doesn't really engage onscreen. The characters are also a bit too flat and never really give the actors a chance to show off. Stone is stuck in another tough vamp role that she just goes with without putting bones onto it. Adjani is a good actress but she can't really deliver here, likewise Palminteri is simply mugging it as a monstrous wife beater. Bates is given a very small role, why she has to be a survivor from breast cancer is beyond me - it just seems to be mentioned a lot for no clear reason. The relationships between the characters are not really worked out, they are as thin as the characters are. Particularly, Mia and Nicole's relationship could have been stronger, instead it is very middle of the road and didn't interest me - despite some lesbian teasing from Stone.Although it all looks good and has a strong list of names in the cast the film fails to really inspire. I wasn't really engaged that much, part of the mystery kept me interested but I felt that the twists and final payoff weren't really that surprising. Worth seeing but really not very different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diabolique (1996) D: Jeremiah S. Chechik. Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, Chazz Palminteri, Kathy Bates, Spalding Gray, Shirley Knight, Allen Garfield, Adam Hann-Byrd, Diana Bellamy. The wife (Adjani) and mistress (Stone) of a cruel, despicable schoolmaster (Palminteri) decide enough is enough and murder him. But when his dead body turns up missing after they dump it, it all becomes a cat-and-mouse game between them and a police detective (Bates), who resembles a female Lt. Columbo. The acting is decent considering the talent involved here and the suspense holds up for the most part (especially when it leads up to a completely unexpected twist towards the end), however the ending is so ludicrous that the film loses two points. Two out of three main characters completely change their traits and characteristics just so they can tack on this dumb ending. Decent, if unspectacular, thriller. RATING: 6 out of 10. Rated R for violence, profanity, and sexual situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently this movie is a remake of a fifties French horror classic. If I had known this before watching the movie, I probably wouldn't have started watching it in the first place. I don't like remakes, they are almost never as good as the original one and this one isn't an exception to that rule I guess. Diabolique is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is just too easy to forget. There is really nothing special about this movie. Everything you see has already been done in a dozen other movies and it just misses any tension and blood chilling moments to make this a good movie. The cast must have tried hard to make this movie work, but the characters are too flat and never ask the best of the actors' talents.The story is about a tyrannical headmaster of a boarding school for boys. He's married to an ex-non, but has several mistresses next to her. One day, his wife and one of his mistresses decide to kill him, because they can't stand the man and his behavior no longer. But the man isn't so easy to kill as they expected... I'm sure the original feature must be very good, but this one isn't. As I already said, it isn't the worst movie that I've ever seen, but I will soon forget about it. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diabolique is a pretty interesting and gripping story about two women who kill a man. Then they try to hide the corpse in a school pool, the school where they tutor people; nevertheless it seems to have vanished itself after a while. This story is mysterious and once you follow the story, it will hook you from beginning to end. I really enjoyed seeing this movie, but it was somewhat disappointing at the end. I was expecting for much more. Another reason why I saw this movie was because the beautiful and stylish Isabelle Adjani was playing in it. She's really one of the most beautiful and talented women I have ever seen in my whole life. Her performance in "La reine Margot" was amazing. This woman really knows how to act. Just after I discovered that she was portraying Mia in this movie, I saw it at once. She made it worthwhile even though the ending was disappointing. As for Sharon Stone, What can I say? I consider she was plausible and interesting as Nicole; she envelops herself into the role very well. However I don't understand why she got a razzie award nomination, her performance wasn't that bad. Anyway I can't do anything about it. Some parts of `Diabolique' just miss the point. It really doesn't make a clear story. I have to warn you ahead of time that there are some possible spoilers: How could Nicole (Sharon Stone) find out that Mia's husband was alive? I know it was unexpected, but I really didn't understand it. As for the ending, I consider it was quite simple, they just killed the man again in the pool, it's not exciting; I was expecting for much more from the acting and the plot. Anyway I really liked the first hour of this movie, that's why I rate a 7 out of a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fascinating example of glossy Hollywood film-making. No, it's not good. But the movie is shot gorgeously, the score is sumptuous and oddly touching, and the movie is often hilariously campy. Some lame stabs are taken at making the material more relevant and serious (Kathy Bates character is a cancer survivor; lesbian overtones are rampant) but these just make it more absurd. Even if you haven't seen the original, you'll figure out the "surprise" ending a mile away. And a thriller could not possibly be plotted more carelessly. But you've got to give points to a movie that dares to make Sharon Stone a math teacher (at an all-boys school, no less!). Watch and marvel at how Stone gleefully tramples over doormat Isabella Adjani in every scene as if she's a drag-queen version of herself. Many will find this movie boring, but if you go in expecting a campy, silly good time, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Picked this up in a remainder bin for a couple of dollars and figured I had loved the French original from the fifties so how bad could the remake be? Might be a curiosity item and the cast was pretty stellar - for one the magnificent and rarely misplaced Kathy Bates was in it.Was I in for a shock. Nothing, absolutely nothing, worked in this movie. The plot, the minescule amount that was there of it, was drivel. There was no character development AT ALL.Some awful special effects (get those white eyes on the corpse, folks)and a supposedly creepy atmosphere that makes one chortle every time the usually lovely Isabelle gapes in a mirror at herself. Doesn't everyone look in a mirror when they're frightened? I know it's the first thing I think of, as I climb out of bed after a nightmare - I look in a mirror to make myself feel better.More threads going nowhere than you could count in a ragged old sweater. The lesbian sub-plot that never quite makes it. And it should. It is a key element in this woeful adaptation. Sharon Stone mincing around in an oddly wired looking walk with trampy tight clothes and really high heels and the strangest lipstick that doesn't leave a mark on her frequently lit cigarettes (she's a school teacher in a private school, Catholic, yeah that's believable). And on and on. How does one get funding for such a travesty, thirty million dollars, I believe??? And the overacting of Chazz and Isabelle... I could write a book on that alone. There should be a law against this kind of thing. 1 out of 10 for what I don't know, only that there isn't a zero rating on IMDb. And as I said, we need these movies, just to make us appreciate even the mediocre ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly stupid, despite Stone's panache...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout a string of post-"Basic Instinct" duds ("Sliver", "Intersection", "Sphere", and this one), Sharon Stone has managed to retain her dignity on-screen and hold onto her celebrity allure off-screen. Even in the terrible "Diabolique", she is wickedly funny, dry as a poisoned martini, and sexy in her '50s movie-magazine way. The picture, about two female teachers who bump off one's abusive husband, is full of holes, bad writing and a limp direction, but Stone kept me watching. Red herrings abound as the two women find they are being watched, and are later dogged by a woman detective (Kathy Bates, doing her best with a sour role). Nothing quite fits together plot-wise at the conclusion of "Diabolique". It is one messed up jigsaw. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chechik's Diabolique diabolically useless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood version of the french masterpiece 'Les Diaboliques' is a disaster. Both actors and production are awful, the movie is full of cliches and Chechik tries to save something from the wreckage by a useless bloody end. There is no suspense or psychological tension in it, Clouzot's version was built on a subtle climate of anxiety and terror. Here there is only a bad mixing between buffoons characters (like the female inspector) and sentimental situations that could fit into a Reader's Digest dramatic story. This movie (can we really call it like that ?) is representative of the Hollywood (Holy-money) remake industry trying to make money on classics masterpieces (the remake of Psycho is another example). Don't even waste your time to see it, go directly to the original version of Henri-Georges Clouzot. 'Ce film est un vrai navet !'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Decent remake of the French 1955 film noir classic of the same title about two women, wife and mistress, planning the murder of their both sleazy and ape-like husband and lover that ends up boomeranging on both of them.In this modernized version of "Diabolique" the story takes place in Pennsylvania not France with headmistress and owner of an all boys private school Mia Baran, Isabelle Adjani, having her fill of taking all the abuse she can from her caveman like husband Guy, Chezz Palminteri. Mia gets together with Guy's also abused mistress, who got her left eye blackened by him, Nicole Horner played by an ultra sexy looking Sharon Stone who's also a teacher at the boys school. The two abused women plan to finally do away with the creep and make his death look like a drowning accident. It takes a while for the very Catholic observing Mia to agree to Nicole's plan to murder Guy but the way he treats her,like dirt, pushes her over the edge in willing to do him in.Luring Guy away from the boys school where he resides both Nicoel and Mia have him secretly travel to a friends home, the Danzingers, in Pittsburgh where they plan to murder him. It's there that Mia got the brutish Guy drunk, which wasn't that hard top do, on booze that was spiked with a number of strong sleeping pills. With Guy out cold the two dumped him into the bathtub and with the help of what looked like a ten gallon bottle filled with water,to keep him from floating to the surface, ended up drowning him. It's when back at the boys school when Nicole &amp; Mia dumped the boozed and drugged up as well as dead Guy into the school swimming pool that strange things started to happen! Guy not only didn't go to the bottom he didn't even go to the top of the pool? In fact he just plumb disappeared from sight over or under the water line!The rest of the movie has Mia, the weaker of the two murderesses, slowly going to pieces in not only what she did in murdering her husband but far worse in not knowing where his body is in order to give it a decent Catholic burial! Going to the local police to have them track down her missing husband Mia is spotted by retired lady detective Shirley Vogel, Kathy Bates, who smells a big story and takes over the investigation in the missing Guy Barnan.***SPOILERS*** It doesn't take long for Vogel to realized that something isn't exactly kosher in Guy's mysterious disappearance. Checking out all the facts Vogel finds out that Guy was embezzling the funds for the boys school and planning to bankrupt it in order to throw off suspicion on himself by the local police. What's even more interesting is that Guy's partner in crime was non other then Nicoe Horner! His mistress whom, as Vogel soon suspects, was very possibly his murderer as well!The unexpected and shocking final in the film in fact outdoes the original, the 1955 French version, with the truth coming to the surface in what was the real reason in murdering Guy and who were the one's who cooked it up in the first place! This was enough to give you, like one of the principle characters in the movie, an almost fatal heart attack! The fact that the intended victim of this elaborately planned scheme didn't end up dropping dead from fright turned out to be disastrous for those who planned it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why Diabolique (1996) received the poor reviews it did; the acting by the principal cast members is certainly excellent, the plot line is intriguing, and the suspense is maddening.This movie, however, is actually a remake of a 1955 French film titled "Les Diaboliques" (literally "the fiends"), and while the 1996 version tells the same story updated for modern life, the 1955 original is the better of the two.The 1955 version left a bit more to the viewer's imagination, and it incorporated more subtlety. It was in black-and-white - perfect for this kind of taut suspense thriller. In the 1996 version, however, Kathy Bates' character adds a greater dimension to the entire story that was not prevalent in the original.So - my recommendation? If you've not seen either of the versions, see them both (check out the 1955 version first!). What is most interesting is watching two very talented actresses (Simone Signoret from the 1955 film and Sharon Stone from the 1996 film) handling the same role with their own unique skills and interpretations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives up to its name.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read through many perspectives on this film, and one that seems to crop up time and again is the word 'camp.' Unfortunately, the film never establishes itself as camp, or indeed anything. It's pointless. There being little to add to the dissection of this film's problems, let's concentrate for a second on how a script this revolting gets made into a film this unsatisfying.Firstly, you have to have a screenwriter who really wants to make a point about how he understands the original. But another trait he has to have is that he doesn't think many other people understand the original. Then, you have to have him working with a culture he doesn't understand. How Sharon Stone got a job in a Catholic boarding school is amazing! Let alone how Palmintieri could stand over his dying wife, or how a boy could break through into the headmaster's quarters, witness the entire scene, and not be sent away. I had nine years in boarding school, and not once, thankfully, did I get to see my headmaster bare-chested. I can understand the chap's fascination with his naked language teacher, and it's very plausible he might find his way to a window to watch from a distance, but he must be the most intuitive, caring boy in the world to have grasped that something was very wrong - and then, if he had done so, he would have gone straight for that adult that Palmintieri has to tell him to go and find. Perhaps he is desperately in love with Miss Adjani. Whatever.Then you have two other awful, awful pieces of writing/casting. (a) the video team - straight out of the 'Titanic' school of cheeky-chappy enthusiasts who say dude all the time and really don't give a fiddler's toss about anything other than the geeky enjoyment their jobs bring them. This kind of embarrasiing stereotyping wiped at least a star off my rating of 'Lock, Stock' (the scousers) and it's just insulting to camera technicians everywhere. Hollywood's presentation of enthusiasts has often been has often been unkind in a 'let's laugh at them' kind of way; here,it's unwatchable. And (b) the other members of staff. You kind of wish the two girls could have chosen their victims more wisely. That would have made the ending much more acceptable. While they were about it, they could also have knocked off that bug-eyed monster whom someone has come back later on in order to introduce a "mystery" element with the sunglasses.Then, you MUST have a director who wants to refer back to the original with as many 'atmosphere shots' as he can find. Probably in homage to it, but again, with no real point. In the original, the dripping tap serves a purpose of heightening the atmosphere of tension. In this film, there IS no tension until right near the end, when KB is wandering through the garage. But why is she wandering through the garage? So the director can 'explain' where Palmintieri has been hiding all this time.By trying to do the original film homage while making his own point about what a great scriptwriter he is (is he?) or what a great director he is (is he?), the person or persons most responsible for this film, clearly told to cut down on the length of the original, never pauses long enough to let anything sink in. Thus the rhythm of the piece goes sideways. And I found myself thinking there must have been a moment during production when some studio heads said, "But, you see, we MUST have some violence, and a chase, some nudity and a sex scene." What began life as a vicious rape of his wife in the 50s classic becomes a ludicrous idea in this, effortlessly summarised by another reviewer here (thank you sir) as words to the effect of, "He terrorises and humiliates her so much that she has to shag him." I must say, though, Stone and Bates give class performances where and when they can - it's just Stone belongs in another film entirely, and Bates is given some classic quips but becomes a pawn in the filmmakers' race for the perfect, satisfying ending. Indeed, as other commentators have noted, halfway through they decide she is Columbo. "Just one more thing," she says, and I kid you not. Anyway, dears, the perfect, satisfying ending would have been for Bates to have locked everyone else in the school, including the scriptwriter and the director, and set fire to it.This film does nothing that you can't find in the French and Saunders videos on Youtube (try the classic "House of Idiot" or "Whatever Happened to Baby Dawn". Except embarrass you, appal you, and make you sick. But you know, there is a plus-side. The film ended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorrowfully This Movie Made Me? !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Character uses another to kill third one. Then the used character (always the less vicious and the more emotional) discovered the ugly truth of being used to serve hidden purposes for the first character and its hidden associate. Sometimes that associate could be the murdered party, sometimes the deceived could be a man or a woman, and many times it's from that deceived one's point of view.Since (Double Indemnity - 1944) this very formula in the Noir or the crime movies is so popular. Although there are endless ways to recycle and create through this old story, but most of the products along the years aren't excellent or even unpredictable.Based on a French movie or not, (Diabolique) isn't original or that good. It's even not convincing at places and rather idiot at others !Since the whole thing is about killing the sick kind wife then why not to use less complicated ways? And if the husband is that sadistic deceitful why not to divorce him easily? And how oh how this husband brooked this amount of water for all of this time ? He must be Aquaman for god's sake !Just like the gratuitous nudity here, the need for a lesbian relationship between the 2 women seemed for pure commercial purposes more than a dramatic motive (as a sexual tension between the 2 leads to make the audience hungry for love scene !). Yet, it's more powerful to watch (Stone) rescues (Adjani) at the end because she lastly felt the bound between them as 2 aggrieved women, not a "loving couple" where in this case the rescue becomes ordinary deed ?!Some of the situations looked so forced; such as the compulsory bad launch. Some of characters' reactions were so horribly bad; (Adjani) outrageously smiling among the professors at the lunch's table while she's supposed to be so sad and confused because of her husband's disappearance ! The intentions of (Kathy Bates)'s character were vague. There was no need for the character of the boy who peeks at his teacher nude ! Plus I didn't hear about a commercial that took this long to be filmed (clearly the 2 camera guys were living in the school for more than a week !??).The performance was truly laughable from (Isabelle Adjani)'s side. Along with being strangely not pretty sight this time, she dumbly was astounded, absentminded, sad, or scared all by the same goggled eyes ! Though she gave me so-provocative-it's-attractive acting to an extent that made the movie worth watching for a second time just for that ! I can't blame (Palmentieri) since the script dealt with him as a prototype scumbag. (Sharon Stone) did some fair acting; I think she was the only winner here. With a sluggish pace, and a story got no depth (for instance why it's a school, not a hotel ? a hospital ? or a company ??) you've got to ask yourself eventually why they didn't call it (scare your wife to death)?!, but Ah.. that could've ruined it. However with that ending it deserves a title like (treat women well otherwise they'll kill you) although it fits this story right but that could've ruined it too !In fact the movie's finale makes it an explicit manifesto about how women, all the different kinds of women, CAN unite to kill one vile man and get away with it. So be aware of their anger because It's Woman Power baby ! A very sly notice : this movie came out one year after TV shows like Xena Warrior Princess (1995), and one year before another one : Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).. I'll leave it to your intelligence to figure out the connections and what it could say about America of the mid-90s. However, in its core, all what the movie wanted is being a thriller with a different frame this time, to end up as one which's between average and poor despite the glow of it, especially with grand music, well cinematography, and interesting direction. To sum it all up I must tell : while it's a thrilling mystery this movie made me fall asleep in front of it. Sorry? not that diabolic !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion this film doesn't deserve all the negative comments. You can see Sharon Stone in one of her best-acted roles and also Isabelle Adjani played a good part. Chazz Palminteri as sadistic husband was very convincing and Kathy Bates as detective with her own thoughts about killing husbands was good to. The story had some surprising moments and turns.But what I really liked was the chemistry between Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani. Mia (Adjani) kills her sadistic husband to brake free of her role as devote wife. But she then behaves slightly devotedly to Nicole, as if she can't brake free of her role. And Nicole alternated between pity, affection and contempt, between to be there for Mia and to dominate her. All this overshadowed by a slight erotic tension.The film is defiantly worth watching.</fullReview>

I wasn't particularly a fan of Sharon Stone at the time this came out on video for that matter. I might as well have passed on this.There's a funny line by one of the minor characters when she finds Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf on television, saying she's going to wait to watch it "when it's in color." A comment on the movie itself, I suppose.I say it's not bad, but truthfully the events of the last ten minutes or so don't really follow very well from the rest of the movie. There are definite plot problems.Kathy Bates plays a Nicorette-chewing ex-police detective who had a mastectomy who is now working as a private investigator. She eventually lights up and smokes a cigarette: what's the point of that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diabolique is a movie that is so forgettable one may forget they've seen it. Although, I have yet to see the original, which I've been told is absolutely amazing, this version is completely the opposite. It is not terrible at all, not unwatchable in the slightest, just not all that good. The plot is dark and sinister but for some reason limps along and has no tension to it. This is a movie that one can easily watch with their friends and a good pizza and beer and talk while it's on, confident they won't get to confused. That's the type of movie it is.If the original is really that good maybe that's the problem. Sometimes remakes just can't hold a candle to the original. I wouldn't Rate this higher then a 5 at most.There's nothing awful to say about it but there's just not a lot of edge of your seat excitement and drama. There's also this dark slow moving quality to it that like I said may make for a good light summer's night viewing with friends but does not approach anything unforgettable.The casting may have been part of the problem as well because I didn't buy into that aspect all that much and thought there were some miscasts. Still, if one wants a movie where they don't have to concentrate to hard or get to deeply involved it makes for a decent viewing. But all in all, this is not a movie I'd probably see again. My vote is average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well first of all I haven 't seen the original . Even so I hardly dispute the ones who bash this film simply because it is a remake . It is a successfully atmospheric thriller which counts on suspense and psychological terror . OK , so it has a few plot holes . Do you know ANY thriller that hasn 't ? HONESTLY ? Then check the "goofs" section of IMD . Apart the script 's occasional faults , the tension is built carefully . As for the surprise ending there is nothing that can betray it (and I have seen the movie twice). Anyway the cinematography and the music give the eerie atmosphere of doubt quite well . As for the acting ? Although noone gives a standout performance they were all successful choises for the parts . They all gave decent performances : the blonde and fatal Nicole(Sharon Stone) who looks like the mistress of Satan , scheming and deadpan (you killed your husband , you didn 't burn the toast) , the timid and disorientated Mia (Isabelle Adsani)with the permanent fragile look on her eyes , the scumbag husband (Chaz Palminderi) who is tyrannical to his wife and cheats on her . Even Cathy Bates who has the worst written and most one - dimensional role of the detective , manages to survive . One major pro is that you really can 't sympathise on any of the characters because then it would be a kind of stalker horror film. Now that all the characters are dark , the devilish plot that the title insignuates is apparent and the psychological horror of " God 's wrath upon our sins " is effective . Oh , and another thing : the murder in the bathtub in the beginning of the film is marvellous . It surpasses the similar one in" Fatal Attraction " . It 's a blast baby !!!! Overall a very entertaining film . I believe that anyone who votes less than 6 for this film is simply prejeudised and has no taste.DIABOLIQUE 8 / 10</fullReview>

Isabelle Adjani plays a nun who quits because she has no faith anymore. She, Sharon Stone and Chazz Palminteri all run a Catholic boys school and bash Christianity themselves. Other teachers at the school are also shown in a bad light. There is not one positive Christian in the Christian school! Well, that's way too much bias for me.

		<fullReview>"Diabolique", a remake of the 1955 French horror/thriller "Les Diaboliques", centers on Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), a devout Catholic woman who is married to an abusive headmaster, Guy (Chazz Palminteri), with whom she runs an all boy's school. She is fairly close to his mistress, Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone), who is a teacher at the school, and the two conspire a plot to murder him. After the deed is done, they dispose of his body in the school's filthy swimming pool... but when the pool is drained, his body is gone, and strange things begin to haunt them, while a nosy detective (Kathy Bates) begins to catch onto the elaborate plot.To start off with, I consider the original "Les Diaboliques" one of the best horror movies of all time - it's painfully suspenseful, genuinely creepy, and has one of the best twist-endings I've ever seen. So, I went into this remake with fairly low expectations, and that may have been why I didn't mind it so much. I knew there was no possible way this re-imagining could out- do the original. So, with that said, I found this film to be a fairly entertaining thriller, even though I knew all the twists and turns of the plot ahead of time. The film takes place in modern day, but maintains a very 1950s feel, with the wardrobe and the old-fashioned architecture of the school. It's surprisingly pretty faithful to the original movie, too, with a few changes scattered about, some for the better and some for the worst. I thought the update of the murder scene was well executed, as was the climax of the film (again, even though I was aware of what to expect). However, as expected, we do have a very "Hollywood" ending - the movie follows the original closely until the last ten minutes, where the conclusion becomes what most American movie-goers would expect. I can't say it's necessarily that awful, and I wasn't expecting the writers to follow the cold, ambiguous conclusion the original had. I suppose I was a tad bit disappointed they didn't stick with the original ending, but what they did do with the new ending was clever.I'd say my biggest complaint here was the absence of ambiguity and suspense the original film upheld. The suspense was fairly secondhand in comparison, and I'd like to have seen improvement there. Acting-wise, I have mixed feelings. Sharon Stone, I felt, was fairly poor at times in her delivery and overall performance, while at other times she did quite well. Her performance was a bit topsy-turvy, but she was good enough, and does have the right 'look' for the part. Isabelle Adjani was great, she made her character very lovable, and her melancholy facial expressions were priceless. Chazz Palminteri was also good in the abusive, jerk-of-a-husband role. I also enjoyed Kathy Bates in the role of the detective, which was played by a male in the original. She's a great actress and played her quirky, offbeat role excellently. Overall, "Diabolique" is a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed it mainly because I found the re- imagining of the story an interesting idea, and the re-construction of some of those classic scenes was neat to watch. The problem with this film is if you see it before you see the 1955 version, you probably will enjoy it because the story and plot twists are really clever. However, if you've already seen the original, the story is essentially spoiled. I personally enjoyed watching the re-construction of it though, even with it's faults. I'd say this 1996 version of the story is a decent companion piece to the original - it's fairly entertaining, but can't hold a candle to the film it was based upon. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average thriller; good performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diabolique is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is certainly an example of a film which did not reach its full potential. It suffered from a complete lack of character development and motivation. We can blame this on the mediocre script, although the script is still entertaining on a camp level. It provides the star, Sharon Stone, with some great lines, such as when the detective (Kathy Bates) asks her if she has any exes. Stone quips, "Nothing official." After a man informs her that second hand smoke from cigarettes kills, Stone, smoking, blows the smoke in his face and says, "Not reliably." The direction by Jeremiah Chechik is brisk and over-all decent, but lacks distinction. The film never rises above mediocrity. The film does have a few things going for it, mainly the ominous, string-laden score. The actors are all capable, but Stone and Kathy Bates are the standouts. Sharon Stone is the best femme fatale in the business, and her performance is about a 9.5 on the vamp scale (only slightly behind Theda Bara in A Fool There Was and Stone's own Catherine Trammel).Kathy Bates provides fine support as a detective trying to solve the murder (I won't reveal the plot, which you can read about in detail elsewhere), but again her character is underdeveloped. The lack of character development makes it hard for us to care about the characters. We never really learn why the wife stopped being a nun and believing in God. We never learn why the detective hates men or even the motivation behind many of the situations in the story. This is a serious flaw.If you can overlook the flaws, the story does have something to offer. The plot is, of course, clever and fun to watch unfold. After all, it is based on a very famous 1956 film. The score, cinematography, and performances are all good. However, the direction is only decent and the screenplay lacks character development and contains a lot of campy dialogue.Definitely see Diabolique if you are a Sharon Stone or Kathy Bates fan, but otherwise you may want to skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that tries so hard to be Basic Instinct or The Postman Always Rings Twice but does not even get close. What Kathy Bates is doing in the film is a mystery, so is the question of who took the pictures of Nicole and Mia carrying the basket out to the car.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as sinister as "Basic Instinct"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharon Stone is at it again! In "Diabolique" she helps a murder. Mia Baran(Isabelle Adjani) and Nicole Horner(Stone) conspire to rid a school of a headmaster, Guy Baran(Chazz Palminteri). They drown him in a bathtub, then weigh him down with a keg. A bathtub? They could do better than that. That death-look was pretty real to me, until he removed the contacts. And Sharon look really good wearing the leopard print bra. Black, red or blue would be nice, but they wouldn't be "wild" enough for the movie. Mia had a bad heart, and her heart was giving out in a few scenes. Of course Guy and Nicole would be the real conspirators until Guy got to greedy for his own good. And he met his end to a pitchfork. Not just his right eye died, the fake drowning should have been planned better to me I think. This movie didn't reach the standards in the box office like "Basic Instinct" did. To me, it was just a toner version without all the blood. And it was still good to me. Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film. Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is as entertaining as any juxta-campy film I've seen. This film is stylish and sexy. Deletions needed: 1. The overt sex scene between Guy and Nicole.Only one deletion necessary. I found this film to be MUCH more entertaining than the original. Roos' writing really brings this film into the period without taking ANYTHING from the value and integrity of the original screenplay. In my opinion, steer clear of the original.Stone and Adjani are great here. Bates is comedic and full of wit. Palminterri is a great villain.This film has it all. Ignore the bad reviews if you'd like to be entertained and not baffled with brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty good movie, definitely worth the time to watch. The plot twists and turns and the suspense is very good throughout the movie, right to the very end. I would recommend the movie. Sharon Stone does well and so does Kathy Bates. If you like either one of them that makes it worth seeing, but the plot twists are really the best part. Just when you think you know what is going on, the situation changes in a way you would not have anticipated. Notice how Sharon Stone is the only person wearing bright colors in the movie. I disagree with the people who didn't like it. So I thought I would let you know that I really did enjoy it and register my disagreement. I hope you like it too.</fullReview>
