		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A light movie that is a lot of fun to watch, 'Kiss Me Goodbye' is also not the first movie you think of when doing a filmography for Sally Field, Jeff Bridges or James Caan. But they are all perfectly cast in this comedy that has a lot going for it. James Caan plays Jolly, the Bob Fosse-like (well, without the cigarettes and open heart surgery) and deceased husband of Sally Field, who reappears the week Field is marrying a 'nerd', Jeff Bridges. Only Sally can see or hear James Caan so it sets up a lot of comedy, most of which is hilarious. Everyone liked Jolly, alot, including Sally, and Jeff is less likable. He's like Cary Grant in 'Bringing Up Baby', down to the research job at the museum doing what Claire Trevor calls 'digging up dead people.'Stand-out scene - the three of them going to the country for a relaxing weekend, and all hell breaking loose. Claire Trevor is funny as Sally's domineering mother, Paul Dooley is his usual dependable self as a former priest who gets involved when Bridges decides to 'exorcise' the ghost of Jolly, and Mildred Natwick is the owner of the country bed-and-breakfast. Touching at the end, funny most of the way through...8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten Comic Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this film in the theatre the whole audience was laughing out loud. The humor was intelligent and witty, unlike today's market-researched and audience-tailored bombs. It's a film made for adults about adult sensibilities, and important issues we all face sooner or later.It's not a film that's funny from one moment to the next, but is a poignant tale about a woman (played by Sally Field) dealing with some profound changes in her life. The moments of humor (good, funny, smart moments) are sprinkled in here and there to lighten the tale, and told in a way that will be appreciated by veteran movie goers.I wish I had more to say about it, but it's been so long since I saw it last that I can't add too much more to the other positive comments, other than to say that I want to see it again :-)A top notch cast delivers good funny performances for a film making style that's been long forgotten, and wrongfully shelved. One can only hope that a DVD of this film will be forthcoming: A good one from the original negative, letterboxed, and in 5.1 Dolby, and not some low-cost quick-to-market, full-screen, hack cine-transfer job.DVD RE-SCREENED; "There is no Monica you dumb...*%&amp;$@!!!" I bought the DVD when it came out, and enjoyed reviewing this American remake of a racy Brazilian "sex comedy". Again, I don't have too much more to add to my review or anyone else's other than it was a film made at a different time for a different audience. Today's romantic comedy's geared for adult teenagers are, by comparison, embarrassing. But that's just me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cute Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I may have been one of the few people who saw this film in the theaters, but I really enjoyed KISS ME GOODBYE, a lighthearted comedy about a widow (Sally Field)preparing to remarry, who, days before her wedding, is visited by the ghost of her deceased first husband (James Caan), who was a Broadway director and choreographer. The story goes to all the familiar places that you would expect it to, but it is played with such an exuberant energy that you can't help but start to care for these people. Field and Caan are in top form and Jeff Bridges is at his adorably nerdy best as Field's new fiancée (a precursor to his performance in THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES). There's also a brief, but memorable turn by the late Claire Trevor as Field's mother. A charming romantic fantasy that will grow on you upon repeated viewings.</fullReview>

Robert Mulligan's touch of genius is at work one more time. The story may be a bit strained at times, but the results are satisfactory altogether in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in my family love this movie! It is truly a family favorite. There are enough comments from others that describe the movie, so I will not repeat. It is one of a few movies that all of us (myself, spouse, and daughter) can watch over and over. It is light, entertaining, sweet, and funny! There are so many lines that we quote over and over -- they have become part of our family. ("You are starting to annoy Jolly!" and many others.) We also LOVE the scene when Rupert goes to the lawyer. The reactions of the lawyer and his secretary are hilarious! And the scenes previously mentioned by others: in bed with Rupert when Jolly is there, the trip to the country, the restaurant scene on the trip to the country. The movie is perfectly cast and is my favorite for many of these actors, just for the joy it has brought to all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving on is hard to do!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy gives the meaning to move on with your life. Oscar winner Sally Field plays a widow who moves back into the house that she and her late husband(James Caan) lived in. She has a fiancé that Jolly doesn't like, and she is the only one that sees him. Everywhere she goes, Jolly follows. Jeff Bridges plays the fiancé who thinks Kay is a total nut case. He himself isn't quite all there. He sees quite a few things that will make Kay question his sanity. There were quite a few scenes that are total classic. Like where the electricity when haywire and the guy fixing it get locked in. Or when the dog started to act funny, and the fiancé just wanted to go all the way nuts. Then there's the part where the priest left his empty booze bottle and the fiancé slips on it. The cast of the movie are great, including celebrity chef Alan Haufrect. Not many people remember this movie, but I do remember the preview and premiere. You would have a ghost of a chance to miss this classic! 3 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possible spoiler alert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie several times and I don't understand why people pan it so mercilessly. It's a funny movie done in a stylish fashion with an appealing cast. The scenes at the wedding rehearsal (do I dare mention exorcism?) and at the country inn are a howl. There is no real violence, no lengthy nude scenes, and the characters don't use the "F" word in every sentence; more than you can say for many of the films being made today. I recommend KISS ME GOODBYE highly. It may not be the best movie you've ever seen, but it's pleasant and diverting and it isn't supposed to be Shakespeare, folks!By the way, has it occurred to anyone that this movie basically reworks the plot of Noel Coward's BLITHE SPIRIT, makes minor changes, and reverses the genders?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet little comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture went nowhere when it was released in 1982, going almost immediately to cable, mostly because it didn't match the Brazilian movie on which it's based. But seen on its own now, after more than twenty years, it's a well made, well written and played comedy for adults, especially when compared to the stupidly vulgar and juvenile "comedies" produced now. It does descend to the "sitcom" level now and again (underlined by Ralph Burns' incidental score, which "mickey mouses" every move, in the manner of 40s comedies) but still, it has many sweet and touching moments.The cast is exceptional, with everyone well-cast for their roles. The choice that I've only recently "gotten" is Claire Trevor as Sally Field's character's mother. Trevor made a career of playing "dames" (as in her brilliant showing as Edward G. Robinson's alcoholic moll in "Key Largo"), and I never got why SHE was chosen to play the society-matron mother in this, a "comeback" role for her. And why should she "adore" the character Kay's first husband so much, a womanizing dancer/choreographer, more than the stalwart, upper middle class WASP-Y scientist, played with quiet amusement by Jeff Bridges, whom Kay has chosen as her second husband, perhaps a more "appropriate" choice? But one telling line hints at something: Bridges character's comment about a hat the mother is wearing in one scene: "Are batteries included?" Perhaps the mother isn't quite what she seems, not from a "society" family but an actress who married into money? Someone who ALMOST "gets" it, the way to dress and talk and behave, but not quite... Now THAT makes sense for the choice of Trevor for the role. But this is the only hint in the writing. To me this is an intriguing explanation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "pastiche" of Noel Coward's BLITHE SPIRIT fails on all counts but one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would be better advised to seek out a tape of BLITHE SPIRIT before wasting your time on this "pastiche". O.K., the sexes are reversed here, but it just barely falls short of being a scene-for-scene "remake" of BLITHE SPIRIT. Note, though, that no credit is given to Noel Coward. Some South American tale "Dona Flor and her two Husbands" gets cited. If you are familiar with BLITHE SPIRIT, the similarity leaps at you. There is even the comic "exorcism" episode, again with the sexes reversed.The question is: why does it fail? It must be the direction, because the cast work is quite good. Perhaps, too good. Too serious. There is no lightness about it. The director simply didn't understand that a ghost story that is supposed to be a light comedy, has to be light. Here, everyone and everything is so intense. They are taking this ghost business seriously, one way or another, so presumably the viewer is supposed to do so too. But when you do, the humour evaporates.The story is fairly simple, though complexities arise. Sally Field is a widow of three years who plans to wed again and open her closed house. The former spouse was something of a rake-hell dancer/choreographer; the new one is a dead serious archaeologist. Alas, the nuptials are only in the rehearsal stage when the ghost of Numero Uno appears and wreaks havoc. Now, here, we must pause a bit. Does the director want us to believe the ghost is real, or is he the product of Sally's own indecision as to whether she is still in love with the former spouse? That's what I mean about introducing seriousness. Well, finally we are about to get to the nuptials, when the spouse to be falls down the stairs, just as Numero Uno had done at a drunken bash three years previously. Again KISS ME GOODBYE is emulating BLITHE SPIRIT, because the new wife there was killed at the end, leaving two ghosts to haunt the widower. Is this a repeat? If you must know, see this film to find out. Sally Field is always worth a watch. That's the one point on which KISS ME GOODBYE doesn't fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising premise and cast---lackluster results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American reworking of Brazil's "Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands" manages to drain all the vitality (and sex) out of the original recipe, replacing it with sitcom bickering. A seemingly normal, happy woman on the verge of getting married a second time is visited by the ghost of her late first husband, who then decides to stick around. Whereas the original found its impetus in the joy of the situation (and Dona Flor's embarrassment of riches), this glossily-produced but static, juvenile film just sees the central situation as something to argue over. In the leads, Sally Field, a surprisingly relaxed James Caan as Jolly the Ghost, and Jeff Bridges all try hard, but the screenplay refuses to drop the psychological ramifications; the picture is a comedy but it doesn't remember to have fun. Perhaps Robert Mulligan was the wrong director for a modern farce. Indeed, the movie is uptight and sexless, and Field is put in the unenviable position of constantly defending herself. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely adored this movie! I thought the acting was first rate as was the script. Sally Field is adorable as a widow who's about to remarry. No one but James Caan could have pulled off the role of Jolly as he did. He's entertaining, light-hearted, and gets his point across in a rather different way. This movie is one of my all time favorites. I especially love the way Jolly helps Kay to get hold of her life and move on. Very entertaining! Worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kay (Sally Field) lost her charmer husband Broadway choreographer Jolly (James Caan) when he fell down the staircase at home. Three years later, she is finally ready to move back home. She wants to marry stiff Egypt archaeologist Rupert (Jeff Bridges). He is concerned about her past with Jolly and then his ghost shows up. Only Kay can see him and he's not satisfied with Rupert.Sally is adorably flustered. She works really hard to sell this. Jeff Bridges is in a tougher position. He has to stay adorable despite disbelieving Kay. James Caan is perfectly good as the charming cad. It does get a bit sitcom-like at times. The movie is basically sold on the three legged acting foundation. This is a remake of a Brazilian film which I have not seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwballs Torture This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually pity Sally Field here. First they script her a a widow whose husband Jolly has been dead for 3 years. Second, the dead one is James Caan who no woman has lasted with anyhow with 4 ex wives none of which have lasted except the latest one more than 5 years. What an insult that she has to pretend she loved him. She should get an award for just acting like she cares here.This film is stocked with a lot of veteran supporting cast even going back to Claire Trevor and Mildred Natwick who were both veteran performers for a long time when this one was made. When I watched it, it WA funny in a screwball comedy type of way. That is just the trouble with it. This type of comedy was not doing well in the theaters in 1982. Instead movies were either more mature or more for kids - ET and An Officer and a Gentleman for example. This was not a world where this film would work, though in the 1950's it would have.Field does a good job getting tortured by Caan and Jeff Bridges. There is little else about this one but if your a fan of screwball comedies, this one fills the bill. It is screwy, for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this was on a long air trip. Jeff Bridges and Sally Field did a fine job with the material But James Caan walked away with the show...I really never tire of watching this movie again. The Dusty Springfield song and music by Peter Allen at the opening and closing are one of my favorites they are two people whose talent are greatly missed in the industry. I think the performances by the supporting cast were great too. I think it was likely one of the last roles for Mildred Natwick and Claire Trevor. It was fun to see some of the NYC locations used as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrific comedy where Sally Field, a widow, contemplates marriage with a supposedly dull Jeff Bridges, a Ph.D., who soon proves that he is not all that dull at all. The thrust of this film is that deceased husband, flamboyant Broadway choreographer shows up at the house she plans to move back in and though she is the only one who can see him, he soon wreaks havoc.The film really gets funny when Bridges decides to counter-act the situation by inventing a former girlfriend.Claire Trevor is wonderful as Field's mother, a brash woman, who loved Caan, but has her doubts about the Bridges character. Mildred Natwick is perfect in her usual pace, a flustered lady running an inn.A story of relationships, admissions and ultimate love conquering all best describe this wonderful picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster unofficial remake of Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sally Field is a widower who finally consents to move back into her old home with her staid fiancé Jeff Bridges, only to be hounded by the ghost of her free-wheeling, philandering former husband James Caan trying to throw a wrench into her upcoming nuptials.There is not a person in the industry, film fanatic or film critic alive who was not aware that this film was an unofficial American remake of the Brazilian classic Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands. Given that there are probably not an abundance of Americans who have seen the Brazilian film, it was not necessarily an unwise move to remake this, but it becomes apparent fairly quickly why the filmmakers would want to avoid comparisons. The original film was a ribald, yet insightful sex comedy headlined by the multi-talented and sultry Sonia Braga, and in that sentence you have a list of descriptions that do not apply to this remake.A huge problem is that the filmmakers want to sanitize the source material for PG-rated consumption, so much of the frankness of the original is abandoned (not to mention its decidedly off-beat conclusion). They also want to substitute sloppy sentiment for anything especially insightful or original. For a film that bills itself as a romantic comedy, there is very little romance and precious little comedy. I counted two minor chuckles in the whole endeavor: once when Field is trying to carry on a conversation in bed with both Bridges and the unseen-to-him Caan, and later when Bridges and Field manage to antagonize a honeymooning couple into fighting.Field is a very good actress, but she is not given enough to work with here. The material does not provide her with enough for her to run with as a comedic actress and the dramatic notes are so predictable and muted that she seems trapped in the part. It also does not help that she shares no chemistry with Caan. Caan (in a part originally played by Jose Wilker) is supposed to represent the exciting sexuality that she misses in her current life with the dull Bridges, but Caan portrays the part with all of the rampant sexuality of a grilled eggplant (perhaps less). In the original film, Wilker's ghost spent the majority of the film nude to reinforce the excitement of sex missing in the heroine's life. Given this film's staid PG-rating, such a decision would be frowned upon, so instead we get Caan garbed as Gene Kelly becoming increasingly irritating with each appearance. It seems improbable that Field's widow would miss his "excitement level", much less that her female friends were also so smitten that they would toss friendship by the wayside to philander with him.Strangely, Field does have some degree of chemistry with Bridges, even though his character is supposed to be a likable, but boring nebbish. Even more puzzling, while the filmmakers (and Caan) have virtually de-sexed the role of the first husband, Bridges is often filmed in his underwear, sporting a male model's physique and is so physically attractive as to defy belief here, but yet his is the character whose dullness gives Field pause? This is just one more strange creative decision from behind the scenes.The remainder of the cast is fairly irrelevant. Screen legends Claire Trevor and Mildred Natwick are truly wasted. It seems inconceivable that the director, Robert Mulligan, is the same man behind To Kill a Mockingbird. Caan purportedly despised this film so much that he took a hiatus from acting for several years, but honestly his crummy performance is just as responsible for the end result as some of the other ill-conceived elements. A real misfire!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The screenplay is the kiss of death for the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Hollywood remake of the popular Brazilian movie "Dona Flor And Her Two Husbands" has all but been forgotten since it was first released thirty years ago. Watching it, it's easy to see why it hasn't built much of an audience, if any. Certainly, Sally Field, James Caan, and Jeff Bridges bring some charm to the movie, enough so that the movie is almost endurable at times. But the movie sinks because of a screenplay that is very lacking. The characters of all three leads are poorly written. Sally Field's character never asks obvious questions like why her deceased husband returned, what the afterlife is like, and other questions a normal person would ask in the same situation. James Caan's character doesn't come across as someone who loves his former wife, interfering in her life repeatedly so that her life is turned upside down. And Jeff Bridges' character acts like a complete idiot at times. If you see a copy of this movie in some thrift store, don't pick it up as I did - say goodbye and move to something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KISS ME GOODBYE (Robert Mulligan, 1982) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an Americanization of the popular Brazilian film DONA FLOR AND HER TWO HUSBANDS (1976), which I own in a rather dismal print recorded off French Cable TV but haven't yet watched. Though a minor effort by this director, as a romantic comedy/fantasy ? especially for a title emanating from the 1980s ? it's fair, aided in no small measure by a good cast: Sally Field as the woman torn between two loves; James Caan as ghostly husband No. 1, a star Broadway choreographer; Jeff Bridges as her current "boring" intended, an Egyptologist (ironically, he gets the best lines); Claire Trevor as Fields' outspoken mum, who adores Caan but can't stomach Bridges; and Paul Dooley as Bridges' assistant, who also happens to be an ex-priest. The film is a pleasant enough trifle but, obviously, a long way behind the Noel Coward/David Lean BLITHE SPIRIT (1945) ? which had one husband and two 'sparring' wives ? or, for that matter, the innumerable screwball comedy classics (usually featuring Cary Grant as the husband who won't give up his bride and eventually gets her back) of the late 1930s and early 40s. To get back to the highlights: Bridges embarrasses Field at an isolated resort (to which Caan is also 'invited') by pretending to see himself a former acquaintance; when another vacationer witnessing the scene helpfully admits that she can barely make her out too, Bridges blows his top and insults her in front of the woman's perplexed husband! During the wedding rehearsal, Bridges brings Dooley along to drive away Caan's ghost once and for all: asking him to remain inconspicuous throughout, the would-be exorcist immediately begins loudly spouting Latin chants, with Bridges snapping: "You call that being nonchalant?!" Finally, during this same climactic sequence, Trevor's amateur electrician husband gets locked in the attic, the door to which is guarded by their pet dog; believing the man's pleas for help to be coming from the latter, Dooley alerts Bridges that Caan's ghost has possessed the canine?with the result that the Egyptologist then has a hard time explaining to the guests his attempt to strangle it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kiss Me Goodbye: Entertaining but not quite memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize this movie is a remake of the 1978 Brazilian classic 'Dona Flor and Her Husbands' with the stunning Sonia Braga..but some things should be left alone. While I adore Sally Field, she seems majorly miscast as Kay Villano, widow of philandering choreographer Jolly Villano, played by James Caan, who also seems woefully miscast. Jeff Bridges is delightful as Rupert, the befuddled Egyptologist in love with Kay, and a hilarious standout, especially during the scenes in the diner, and at the inn. Claire Trevor is smashing as Kay's mother, an acid tongued woman who still holds her late son in law in high regard. The dialogue seems stilted at times, and some of the humor forced, with a silly subplot about exorcism. There is a basic sweetness about the movie, and the thought of a ghost of a husband wanting his wife to move on irresistible (which 'Ghost' did so much better 8 years later). But Robert Mulligan (who helmed 'Summer of '42 and 'The Man in the Moon'..two classics if you've never seen them) lacks that light touch that would have made this a classic. This is like a fine meal, elegantly prepared, but after you've had a bite..it leaves an unpleasant taste on your palate.</fullReview>

You may notice that the writer given credit on the film, Bruno Barreto is the writer/director of Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands; a film that should be seen, if only to catch Sonia Braga's sensuous performance.</fullReview>

Maybeyou have to be a woman to understand how well it fits the movie,Kate and Jolly are both sorry that it went so fast; that he died andshe still hasn't gotten over it; that she will marry a man who lovesher and try get on with life in the home where Jolly lived, died and,apparently, still lives. There is no scene which misses the hilaritymark. I had to search all over to find this movie, but I watch it fromtime to time and 20 years later, I am still laughing and singing thatsong.

		<fullReview>kiss me goodbye is a pleasantly funny romantic comedy, that manages to be romantic without getting into the mush that most movies of this genre fall into. the movie, naturally credits from the solid performances of sally fields, james caan &amp; jeff bridges.the plot premise is an oft-used one, but the creditable performances with a lot of charm and verve makes it a treat to watch. while the movie isnt laugh out funny for a long part, it definitely keeps the corners of your mouth in an upward curve for the most part.a leave your worries at the door and park your brains and watch movie.a very pleasantly funny 8!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This light comedy brings together an interesting group of actors, young and old, for an off-beat story about a widow (Sally Field) who finds herself haunted by her late husband (James Caan), just as she is about to marry a new love interest (Jeff Bridges). The movie has a series of gags in which the dead husband keeps dropping by to surprise and annoy his surviving wife. Confusion follows for her and her new love interest, who seems somewhat possessive and thus all the more alarmed by the turn of events. The movie has the added talents of Claire Trevor as Sally Field's mother, Paul Dooley as her father, and Mildred Natwick as the owner of a bed-and-breakfast in the country where the three parties head off for a weekend encounter. The movie, directed by Robert Mulligan (Love with a Proper Stranger), is entertaining enough to pass the time on a quiet afternoon. It was great to see Claire Trevor, who won an Academy Award for Key Largo in the 1940's. I didn't know she was making films this late in her career. As it turns out, the late husband was no paragon of virtue but in the end, he helps his wife make the transition to a new life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kiss This One Goodbye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a frothy, sexy Brazilian comedy, flatten it, neuter it, remove the laughs and you've got Kiss Me Goodbye a retro adaptation of Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands directed by Robert Mulligan, fondly remembered for To Kill a Mockingbird(1962) and Summer of '42(1971), but who is merely marking time with this film, and wasting ours. Kiss Me Goodbye is actually less sophisticated and amusing than Topper(1937) and less entertaining than The Ghost and Mr Chicken(1966). It's Casper the Friendly Ghost meets Blithe Spirit. As a ghost, James Caan's performance consists of a smirk and a fedora while chemistry-free couple Sally Feild and Jeff Bridges are frantic rather than funny in that tired tradition of having characters talk to a someone only they, and the audience, can see. It's all pretty pointless and completely unfunny. Kiss it goodbye!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite romantic comedies about a widow who has to come to terms with her future husband as well as her previously deceased husband who has contacted her beyond the grave.I did not originally see this movie in the theaters, but caught it on TV a few years back. I now have it on DVD. Sally Field's character, Jay Villano, is humorous and sensitive in the role as a young widow, and Jeff Bridges is absolutely gorgeous even though he is portraying a nerd. James Caan is an excellent as the character, Jolly Villano, Sally Field's whimsical and carefree dead husband. Claire Trevor, Kay Villano's mother, is excellent as a strong willed upper-class socialite. I have watched this movie several times and it never gets old. It is definitely a treat, so I guess it should be considered a classic. I don't know why this was not a big hit at the box office, but it has smart language, and has a terrific cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dona Kay and her two husbands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Brazilian film "Dona Flor and her Two Husbands" was the model for this Sally Field vehicle. As directed by Robert Mulligan, it's mildly funny, but nothing to brag about when compared with the original movie directed by Bruno Barreto. Better yet, why not pick up the immensely funny Jorge Amado novel? If memory serves me right, it was translated from the Portuguese by Harriet de Onis and it's a delight to read.In this version, young Kay, now happily engaged to Rupert, wants to fix the townhouse where she lived with Jolly, her late husband, in which this theater genius has died. Well, little prepares her for the sudden appearance of the dead man.Jolly comes at the most inappropriate times; when she's in the sack, especially. It's enough to drive the would-be-hunk husband to think twice about what he's going to get into. Ruppert loves Kay, but he would like her to exorcise the impish Jolly.Sally Field is at her perkiest in the film. James Caan does a fantastic job as the dead Jolly. Jeff Bridges is perfectly befuddled as Rupert, the man who can't comprehend what's going on. Claire Trevor makes an elegant Charlotte, who is Kay's mother and can't seem to see eye to eye to her future son-in-law. Paul Dooley, Mildred Natwick, William Prince, contribute to make the movie better than what it is.On the other hand, the much superior Brazilian film had an edge and an underlying naughtiness that this Hollywood product doesn't have. The American version is a pale reminder of what happens when a better film is remade without the wit, elegance and humor of the movie it's trying to imitate. Also, Bruno Barreto's film had the advantage of having the sultry Sonia Braga in the title role and great star turns by Jose Wilker and Mauro Mendonca. See the video or the DVD version of this film and you'll be amazed of what this film should have looked like.</fullReview>
