		<fullReview>I would consider myself a film fan with somewhat intellectual preferences and I have a passion for European art house pretentious stuff, so when Fright Night was recommended to me I dismissed it in a snobby "80s special effects vampire horror movie? A title that rhymes? No, thank you!" kind of way.HOWEVER, I have a feeling it may be the single best film I have ever seen, of any genre or time period. It has a witty script, fabulous special effects and some of the best acting I have seen, particularly Evil Ed later on in the film. There are moments of suspense, hilarity, tenderness (for example with Peter Vincent and the dying wolf) and believable every day life. This film didn't actually scare me but it did make me laugh very very hard.A special mention must be made of Chris Sarandon as I think his performance really stood out. Evil is not as easy to portray in stories as people think, but Sarandon does the most believable evilness I think I have ever seen, coupled irresistibly with the sexiest seduction scene ever (is it wrong that I wanted him to win in the end because he was so gorgeous?). If vampires really did exist, I think they would be exactly like Jerry Dandridge, except maybe without the same scary 80s vampire mask and claws.My advice is SEE THIS FILM, and don't have any preconceptions about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something about FRIGHT NIGHT that everybody seems to love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it the 80's cheesiness (fashion, clich?©s, music)? It's impressive F/X? The story? Who knows. Time made justice to "Fright Night", one of the best vampire movies ever and probably the best of the 80's. When it came out in 1985 the Slasher genre was on it's highest peak and as Peter Vincent said to Charlie, "his generation prefers movies where a masked looney kills virgin innocents" (or something like that). When nobody cared about Vampires "Fright Night" came out with a tremendous potential on it's story, actors, and make up; the basic elements that a Slasher movie needs. The result is an entertaining, chilling, and very well done horror movie better than expected.*SPOILERS* Charlie Brewster an average boy finds out that his neighbor is a vampire. He has doubts until Jerry Dandridge his vampire neighbor appears on his bedroom and threatens him to death. Nobody believes Charlie and after a series of events not only his life is in danger but also his girlfriend's. Charlie finds in Peter Vincent, t.v.'s popular "Vampire Killer" character his only hope to save his girlfriend. In order to accomplish what he wants, Charlie and Peter Vincent will face the deadly Jerry Dandridge, his guardian Billy Cole, and their attacks.ACTING. You can't go wrong when a great actor like Mr. Chris Sarandon carries the entire movie on his back with his performance. His character, Jerry Dandridge completely steals the show. Sarandon made the character. Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent is a pleasure to watch. His character has an admirable quick evolution in the movie. First he's the vampire killer t.v. character that after meeting a REAL vampire knows what fear is like. Then after dealing with fear, he recovers faith and that makes him stronger in every aspect. William Ragsdale is good as Charlie Brewster, the teen main character in the movie. The boy that discovers that his neighbor is a real vampire but nobody believes him. Good character. Special mention to Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed for being one of the weirdest but likable characters ever to appear in a horror movie. His performance is truly evil and humorist. A nice touch. Amanda Bearse (from Married with Children fame) is also a good addition to the cast, she delivers an o.k. performance. Jonathan Stark as Billie Cole, Jerry's guardian, delivers a solid performance. This is one of the best casts that you can get from an 80's horror movie.DIRECTION. The 80's craziness was never this creepy. Tom Holland makes a terrific job this time. This man is behind key horror movies from the 80's like "Child's Play" and the surprisingly good "Psycho II" among others. His camera work in "Fright Night" is great. He knew how to combine perfectly the 80's feeling (something that nobody has ever described for it's madness) with the Vampire movies basic rules.The idea of watching a Vampire movie from the 80's could make you think the worst but luckily it's a great idea. Excellent job Mr. Holland.F/X/SCORE/CINEMATOGRAPHY. The f/x and make-up are very ahead of it's time. You can't get better gore effects! The scene of Evil Ed's death (when he's a werewolf) is amazing. On it's time I'm sure that it shocked more than once. Also, Billy Cole's death and the ending are great scenes that will please the horror audience's eyes. Great use of gore and f/x. Enough said. The score is great. The 80's pop metal and club music fits perfect with the feeling of the movie. The club scene is something you haven't seen. In the tense and thrilling scenes the music works perfect. The cinematography is pretty good. The use of lightning on dark settings is very good. Watch the DVD version for a different experience. I love the lines from the movie. I can assure that "Fright Night" is something you haven't seen. Don't get fooled by the 80's big hair, laughable fashion, and clich?©s. The movie stands alone. Be prepared for a real FRIGHT NIGHT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>offbeat, cool, sexy and very 80s vampire tale (my favourite yet)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I first watched Fright Night, I admit I was unsure about what to think about it. All I knew about it was from what I had been told from my Dad (though his likes/dislikes are generally on par with mine, they sometimes border on plain stupid). But when I saw it to the end, I was almost totally converted.Although the beginning is a bit cheesy and reminiscent of stereotypical horror B-movies, it soon becomes clear that this is part of what makes Fright Night so original. All the typical horror film genres are there: horror, romance, comedy (well maybe comedy isn't a typical horror element); but what makes this horror flick stand out a mile-and-a-half from the rest is that it's a very offbeat tale. It's creepily cheesy but gets away with it because it's atmosphere is so good.All this and I haven't mentioned the acting or special effects yet. Sarandon seems to give such an effortless performance as the vampire and as a result is almost perfect. I had thought of what a modern day vampire would be like before I saw Fright Night; but Jerry Dandridge just blew all these ideas away and has to be the coolest (and I don't often use that word) and sexiest vampire ever, and is one of my favourite movie villains. Roddy McDowall can't hold a candle to Sarandon but is still very good, and Stephen Geoffreys is one of the funniest and memorable movie characters ever to grace a film screen too.The special effects are good for 1985 and unlike where in modern films the SFX are the main point in the movie, here they add to the already present chilling atmosphere. And although on the one hand, Fright Night is quite dated, it also captures the atmosphere and the essence of the 80s. The soundtrack is excellent for the film, but paradoxically not very memorable (apart from one or two good songs).[I wish I'd been born before 1981 (maybe 1961) so that I could have lived in the late-70s and 80s, and would have memories of the best music from that time, and not the boybands/Beatles clones/dance ditties (not decent tunes mind) we have now.]All in all an (almost) perfect film: watch it and you'll (most likely) enjoy it and watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Fright Night!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start off by saying that I am a gigantic fan of Fright Night. It all started when the film made its premiere on HBO. The one part that stuck in my head (besides Sarandon's looks) was "Evil Ed's" transformation from wolf to human. Scared the crap out of me. Well, a couple years later, hitting sixth grade, I found the video at a video store and fell in love with it all over again. A friend and I began huge fans, buying Fangoria magazines and collecting the comic series. I remembering making my parents rent the movie for me so I could watch from evening till seven in the morning! Phew! Now, some girls would have crushes on things like, New Kids On the Block. Not me! I was infatuated with Chris Sarandon's seductive performance as Jerry Dandridge. Hey, any woman would be nuts not to find this man hot. Definition of tall, dark, and handsome. He could of bit me in a neck and I would of never cared.As I am at the age of 27, I still have my first and only copy of the film that was boughten for me on my 12th birthday, a tad worn but still plays. I have more of a appreciation for the movie. For all the actors and actresses.I have the movie memorized, word for ward, even if I go like a year without watching it again. But recently I began to realize that the 20th anniversary for this great horror classic is coming around the bend. I had started a script myself, which I know will fail to be noticed, for such a special occasion. Bringing back all the characters from part one and two, except Peter Vicent since no one but Roddy MacDowall could do the part.I just want everyone to know that Fright Night is the definition of the perfect eighties Horror film. It is original with it's characters, setting, and the all around story itself. But it also shows the hard work that had gone into it to create those undoubtedly, scarier then crap Dandridge, Evil, Amy, and Billy Coal transformations. Chris Sarandon himself stated it was hell to do the make up for the movie but his character was worth it. I would rather see a film with special make up effects then with the modern computer animation special effects. More work and artistic, hands on talent went into movies like Fright Night. That's why Fright Night stands out as a eighties classic vampire flick. I personally would like to thank all the actors for the gift of entertainment when making the film. Also the brilliant minds and talented men and women who worked on the film. Fright Night is a movie that has fond memories for me in my child hood. Chris Sarandon will always be my first movie star crush. Dang, he is still hot today! I can't help but still imagine Jerry Dandridge as my perfect, eye candy neighbor. I would recommend anyone to view this movie. Appreciate it as a art form of entertainment with the taste of horror mixed in there. Enjoy it and love it!One final statement.....LONG LIVE FRIGHT NIGHT!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Favorite Vampire Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While with his girlfriend Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse) in his bedroom, the teenager Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) sees a coffin being transported to the house on the next door. A couple of days later, he concludes that his neighbor Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, who is committing some recent unsolved murders. Charley decides to look for help first his friend Evil Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys), since the policemen do not believe on his accusation. Jerry is upset and promises to kill Charley. Later, he meets Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), a middle aged man, who is a vampire killer in a television show but does not believe on vampires in the real life. Amy and Ed seek out Peter Vincent, and the group tries to prove to Charley that Jerry is not a vampire. 'Fright Night' is one of my favorite vampire movies, indeed a cult-movie in Brazil. I do not know how many times I have seen this film in my life, but yesterday I saw it on DVD for the first time and I was not disappointed, since the Brazilian DVD offers two choices (widescreen and fullscreen). There is just a trailer in the extras, but it suffices. Chris Sarandon is incredibly funny and sexy in this role; the movie has a perfect combination and timing of the genres of horror and comedy; the 'Van Helsing' of the story, Peter Vincent, is a fantastic joke with the names of the great Peter Cushing and Vincent Price; the special effects were state of art in 1985. My vote is nine.Title ('Brazil'): ' A Hora do Espanto' ('The Fright Hour')Note: on 14 January 2012, I saw this wonderful film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Fright Night is worth many words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is Fright Night my all time favorite horror movie within the vampire content? Well, simply because of the films actors and the story line itself. In the past month or so I have had the chance to reminisce on the fact that I had always adored this movie. Sitting down and taking the time to watch it through again as I had once done years ago when Fright Night was my inspiration to dive into the horror writing area with great vampire characters with memorable appearance and expression. From the villainous immortal to the pathetic immortal. Remembering my youth, not that long about, about close to twenty years ago I was introduced to Fright Night on a cable movie channel. The part I remembered the most was Evil Ed's transformation from wolf to man. Why that stuck out, probably played on my fear of werewolves (funny I know). As I got older I found that I was madly in love with the character Jerry Dandridge, just by the fact of Chris Sarandon's wonderful portrayal of the creature of the night. Just is seduction and sexiness. But also the fact that he was pure evil with all the vampire cunningness. Having the movie given as a birthday present at the age of twelve made my life peachy. Watching as much as I can. Now as a adult I understand more about the movie. It's contents, the story line and the effort that was put into making it a graphic film with horror and terror. Fright Night is a perfect example of the greatest of special effects for the 80's. It was battling against movies like Nightmare On Elm Street and others that played on fears. This is a classical story because it creates a modernized vampire and also shows what happens when a young teen gets nosey. With that, you think of what you might do when if a vampire lived nextdoor to you! But with all the actors and actresses, only one stood out from the rest. Chris Sarandon is a talented actor who deserves praise for his performance, which many seem to appreciate. I think any person with a horror taste should take the time to watch this classic movie and see what is definitely the most original and breath taking movie of its time. I can go on and on about this movie, but I am limited. But the time is ended. Please, take the time and watch the movie if you haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a along time. Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Great one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all this years (20) of vampire slaughtering, Blade's karate Vs vampire flicks, or even Carpenter's Rambo characters, Fright Night still offers the scent of a classic. Tom Holland's masterpiece holds by itself because of a great cast and a plot that gathers every single cliché of the genre and plays a bit with humor and a lot of effective spooks. Roddy Mc Dowall steals the movie with his over the hill terrified looser character. Even special effects are bizarre today as they're a craftsmanship result giving some scenes a bizarre concept that takes you directly into Roger Corman's "B" world. A true pleasure to watch from time to time. Happy 20 years</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Fright Night' is a movie that has stuck with me for years. Recently I was able to get it on DVD and have been watching it and trying to convince my friends to watch it ever since. It has it's flaws but time has been kinder, I think, to 'Fright Night' than it has been to either 'Near Dark' or 'The Lost Boys.'Chris Sarandon is great and charismatic in his role as the new next-door neighbor. He gives a deep performance and it seems like he's having a lot of fun in every scene. William Ragsdale isn't bad either as he tries with greater desperation and anxiety to convince people that the vampire exists and win allies to help him destroy it. My favourite performance comes from Roddy McDowall. Like Donald Pleasance later in his career, Roddy McDowell could reasonably be accused of acting in anything if there was a paycheck involved; this has damaged his reputation somewhat. I think 'Fright Night' and his performance as Peter Vincent definitely falls in the plus category rather than negative. He is great at hiding behind masks and is constantly performing for the other characters. As an actor, the part required versatility, compassion and depth. Had they been able, Peter Cushing or Vincent Price would have also played the part splendidly -- McDowell's character is of course a tribute to both these actors and I think that he was simply fantastic.So many of the moments in 'Fright Night' compete to be my favourite but I think it comes in the final third of the film. Peter Vincent has run out of masks to hide behind and becomes a very tired, very frightened and very old man. Redemption isn't out of reach -- but he's going to have to work for it.I mentioned earlier that 'Fright Night' has aged fairly well. There is decent gore and make-up so anyone looking for that will likely be satisfied. Music can kill films and age them more quickly than anything else. It works here where it might fail in other films.The strength of 'Fright Night' though are it's performances and the sense of fun that it has. Definitive vampire film? No, but a lot better than many, many, many of the pretenders to that title. Rewarding, fun, and worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Campy' Fright Night Fun To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I incorrectly assumed this might be some dumb teen vampire flick when it came out about 20 years ago, but that wasn't the case. It was simply a very entertaining horror flick with a good mixture of suspense, comedy and good special- effects. The kids - William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys - are all excellent but the two adults - Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowell - steal the show.Sarandon is very cool as the vampire; cocky, arrogant and smooth. He is easily the best character in the movie. McDowell does a nice job as the reluctant vampire slayer.The special-effects are good and the film is played strictly for fun, even with the suspenseful scenes. In fact, it reminds me of the word "camp" because it's so hokey in spots. Yet the film definitely has its scary moments. Note: I watched this 3-4 times on the tape so I am familiar with most of the film and after seeing the DVD, I swear several short scenes are missing (such as Bearse's quick shower scene). I've never come across something like this before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does for vampires what 'An American Werewolf in London' did for werewolves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a time vampires were a big deal and were a big draw at the Box Office. Hammer Films made numerous films about the undead and the US made their share as well. But of course people's tastes change over time and by the early 1980s vampires weren't nearly as popular as they had once been. Then it was killers in masks and zombies devouring the living that dominated the big screen. However, the sub-genre would enjoy a resurgence the same way that films about werewolves did. Tom Holland, who would go on to direct the first in the 'Child's Play' series, wrote and directed a very hip and thrilling new take on the vampire film. Over 25 years later it's still one of the best the genre has to offer.Pros: Amazing performances all across the board. Brilliantly written and directed by Holland. Stunning cinematography. Memorable score and fun 80s soundtrack. Fast paced from start to finish. Made with an obvious affection for the genre. Often very funny, including some snappy dialogue. Great special and make-up effects that have aged well. Even though there is much humor here, there are still some chilling sequences and images throughout.Cons: Dated in some aspects. At times predictable.Final thoughts: What Tom Holland has made here is a film that pays homage to the great vampire films and mythology while also effectively bringing them up to date. This is without question one of the most thoroughly entertaining Comedy/Horror films not only of it's time, but ever. It's a case of all the right ingredients coming together at the right time. Even 'The Lost Boys,' which is great in it's own right, doesn't match it.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He must've been a Vampire Fruit Bat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night, Lost Boys and Near Dark are the holy trinity of 80s vampire flicks. And arguably three of the best vampires movies of all-time. Just recently I returned to this piece of 80's horror gold and I have to say, I enjoyed it just as much as the first time I saw it.Fright Night is about a kid named Charlie Brewster who accidentally discovers that his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige, is a vampire. The movie is about Charlie and friends setting out to destroy the vampire. But Mr. Dandridge is no slouch and is more of a threat to them, then they are to him.Besides being one of the best 80's horror films, I think it's also one of the best movies of the entire 1980s. The movie is full of great performances, especially Chris Sarandon as Jerry Dandrige and Roddy McDowall as TV Vampire Slayer Peter Vincent. It has fantastic make-up effects that are sorely, sorely missing from today's horror flicks. And it also combines a great feel of horror with a realistic touch of comedy and drama. The best and funniest aspect to the movie for myself is how they portray the vampire character. I won't spoil it for you, but the guy enjoys wearing very "tata" clothes, eats "fruit" all the time, and has a live-in roommate. This movie is classic! Fright Night has a sequel that some say is equally as good, but I wouldn't be one to say that. But, I do enjoy the sequel and definitely think it's worth a view. If you're a fan of horror and vampires, this is a must see flick. Welcome to Fright Night baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: Fright Night Director: Tom Holland Stars: Roddy McDowell, Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys Released: 1985 Review: (very few minor spoilers) I'm sure many of you here know this movie by heart and have seen it countless hundreds of times, but this here review is for those newer schmoes who still haven't had the pleasure of seeing this masterpiece. So here it goes.This movie has a special place in my horror loving heart, for many reasons. Among them the fact that its just so fun to watch. Over and over again I find myself revisiting this flick, simply because I love the characters so much and because all those horror clichés I love are all over the place.The story revolves around a teenager named Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) who loves to watch his favorite horror show called "Fright Night". This show which is hosted by Peter Vincent (played by Roddy Mc Dowell) plays old horror movies every night and Charlie watches them all the time.One problem though. Charlie suspects his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, and therefore decides he has to destroy him. No one believes him, not his girlfriend Amy or his buddy "Evil". So he decides to take matters into his own hands. Once Dandridge realizes what a threat Charlie could be to him well, lets just say things get complicated. And for us horror fans, in a good way.This film pays homage to many horror films of old. If your a horror fan you'll get all the cool inside jokes...like Peter Vincent who is obviously named after Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. If you watch closely you'll catch a Hammer film playing on Charlies TV. Hell at one moment Charlie is even watching Children Shouldn't Play with dead things! This films taken inspiration from many other vampire films before it, like for example hammer films Horror of Dracula. Check out Evil Ed getting that cross burned onto his forehead to see what I mean! It also has some hints of 1979s Dracula adaptation by Jhon Badham. But thats not to say that Fright Night is not at all original, its taken inspiration by these films, and is paying homage to them, but it has its own thing going on.All the characters in this film are memorable, if not arch typical. Yeah, you get your teenage nerd/goody little two shoes with Charlie Brewster, Amanda Bearse as the virgin girl who's to scared to do it with her boyfriend and your get your clown act with "Evil", but they are so endearing and innocent that you cant help but feel sorry for what they are about to hurl themselves into.Then there's Roddy McDowells great Peter Vincent who plays a father figure to Charlie. The situations and scenes with them together are great. Specially that scene where Charlies begging Peter to help him.Then there's the main baddie, Jerry Dandridge a vampire who's lived for many thousands of years and now just wants to settle down in this quiet little town and suck it dry! Many female horror fans refer to Dandridge as the "sexiest male vampire ever" so there you go. He delivers many memorable lines and is a formidable character for Peter and Charlie to go up against.Cool make up fx, even by todays standards the make up fx seen on Fright Night stand on their own as being very well achieved, vampire transformations, werewolf's, giant vampire bats you name it, its in there and done well. One particularly good moments is "Evils" transformation...enough said.One minor set back, is that maybe some younger viewers might not like the 80s soundtrack which the movie has. All the songs on it are as 80s as you can get. This is very evident in a scene that takes place inside of a disco called "Club Radio". To me and many others that might come of as nostalgic and a trip down memory lane but to others (specially the younger viewers) it might prove to be distracting. But thats about the only set back I can see in watching this film.Fright Nights success at the box office was followed by an also entertaining sequel aptly titled Fright Night II. Not as good as the first but still highly enjoyable.Check this flick out...its a horror film done right. And one of the best vampire flicks ever if you ask me! Rating: 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched ''Fright Night'' two days ago and I had a surprise : the movie is good! I expected it to be one of those silly movies where I wouldn't give more then 6, but I liked it so much, that now I consider to be one of the best vampire movies from the 80's that I already watched, along with ''Lost Boys''. It's funny to see Amanda Bearse, the famous ''Marcy D'Arcy'' from ''Married with Children'' in the role of the teenager Amy(specially because she was almost in her 30's)and this is the first and only movie I watched with her in a different role from ''Marcy''.The plot: Charley Brewster is a big fan of horror movies, and is always watching ''Fright Night'', one of his favorite TV shows about vampires and other monsters. So, when his new and handsome neighbor Jerry Drandridge arrives, Charley immediately discovers that the guy is a vampire. Things starts to get bad for Charley, when Jerry discovers that Charley knows not only his 'secret', but also that he is killing a lot of women to satisfy his appetite.Charley tries to talk to other people about Jerry, but the problem is that nobody believes in a single word that he says. Now, the poor Jerry needs to find a way to be safe from being killed by Jerry and showing to his girlfriend Amy, his friend Ed and his hero, Peter Vincent (the host of a late-night horror show on TV) that he is in fact, right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale), a high school boy who was a huge fan of the vampire TV show "Fright Night", noticed that something was wrong with his new neighbors...and later he even saw one of the guys was trying to suck a woman's blood... Charlie felt that he must have stopped the vampire from killing more people, he contacted the police, and he told his mother and friends about it, but nobody believed him. So he went to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who hosted "Fright Night", "the great vampire killer"...This is a special vampire movie because the story happened in the modern time instead of centuries ago. It looked rather old-fashioned to me the first time I saw it on television, but the more times I watched the film, the more I loved it. Two memorable scenes: when the vampire "Jerry Dandrige" (Chris Sarandon) was dancing with Amy (Charlie's girlfriend, played by Amanda Bearse) and later when Jerry was about to vampirize Amy. Both of the scenes were highly seductive.One big difference between this movie and other vampire films- crosses don't necessarily work on vampires, unless you have total faith- said Jerry and Evil Ed. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Greatness from Tom Holland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film just Friday, I have already found this film to be a very memorable piece of work by Tom Holland who did Psycho II and of coarse Child's Play.The story is about a kid who believes that there's a Vampire living next to him. He tries to notify that people are being murdered by the blood thirsty Jerry but nobody will believe him. He then looks up to the famous horror vampire killer on TV, Peter Vincent who he believes will help him stop Jerry and his buddy.First watching Child's Play and now Fright Night (Another horror film I should have watched ages ago..) Tom Holland does a top notch job on creating the right amount of humour, scares and disturbance for us to feast on. I believe like Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper or even John Carpentar, Tom Holland is a legend in the horror business as in this film he can create the right mood like he created the right scares for Child's Play.Chris Sarandon does an excellent job as the charming but sinister Jerry Dandrige who takes people in and posses them with his evil love. I just could not get over how great Chris Sarandon was in this vampire role. I usually hate vampires and vampire films but with Tom Holland's great direction and once again memorable scenes and Chris Sarandon's perfect-o acting, I believe that now I like vampires (well only Sarandon's for now).The other actors where casted perfectly for their roles and the special vampire and wolf effects and even the concept are all done well.They say they are going to release a remake of Fright Night this year. All I can say is that I've looked at the trailer and it looks fail. The new actor playing Jerry Dandrige doesn't look like he'll be able to pull it off, he just can't do it and the whole remaking of the story looks like a complete mess. I have no hopes for the remake.The original from me gets 9 bloody vampires out of 10.</fullReview>

Yes, it is from the 80's and people that watch it in the last view years may have other visual demands... I watched it first at the age of 16 ;-) and i still love it. Jerry D. and the whole film is THE coolest classic vampire adaption on the planet. Period.I read about the remake ? I am excited, but I can't imagine that it will reach the reputation and fun of this favorite. I will keep my fingers crossed!CONCLUSION: To all Vampire and horror comedy fans: WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!PS: An Apple a day ... ;-) LOL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an age of Twilight, it's very interesting to see a film with vampires where they're portrayed as scary rather than your average soap opera character. In the Bela Lugosi Dracula, Dracula was portrayed with an almost Bond like stature. However, whether it was Lugosi or just the film making of the times, Dracula lacked just the the charisma to sell it. Now that's just my opinion, but in stating that, it makes my point clearer when I say the Sarandon's performance of the vampire Jerry Dandrige has that charisma so that you buy it when he seduces someone.I compare Dandrige and Dracula because that's what Fright Night is. It's a contemporary (well, in the eighties it was) take on the classic vampire. It doesn't try to create new rules or reboot classic Universal vampire lore. It simply elaborates on it. We never saw what would have happened in Dracula when Dr. Van Helsing holds up the cross. We just saw Lugosi's over the top reaction to its presence. In Fright Night, it's the equivalent of jabbing someone with a red hot brand.Speaking of Van Helsing, Roddy McDowall turns in a very fun turn as Fright Night's interpretation of the character, Peter Vincent. He's a washed up film star who's been reduced to hosting a horror movie show that shows. He has the know how and yet is crippled by his cowardice and greed. In the role of the brave boy, willing to risk life and limb to protect his neighborhood and girlfriend, is young Charley Brewster, played by William Ragsdale. He's the main character, after all, and plays the role with naivety and yet an undying persistence to stop this creature that threatens him and his community. In an all to common parallel is Charley's girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) and his best friend, Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys.) They don't believe Charley, but are concerned for him and enlist Vincent's help (with Amy's college fund.) The design of the vampire is the least faithful thing to the classic idea of the vampire. Well, the Universal vampire, anyways. When the vampires become hungry, they turn into more ravenous takes on Nosferatu (which is technically Dracula, the film studio just couldn't afford the rights to the name.) Anyway, the vampires also can transform (as did Dracula.) These effects are pretty good. One of the best involves just a quick effect with a wolves' eyes. The way the scenery blends with the film is also very well done, if not slightly exaggerated.As much as I've been praising this film, however, it's definitely not perfect. A lot of the acting is exaggerated. This problem is easily forgivable, although, because the overacting actually leads to some of the more memorable characters and moments in the film. Second, the screenplay is pretty weak at points and under mines itself when it's trying to be serious and scary and that's leading to my last complaint, which is, coincidentally, my complaint with Dracula, and that is that to me, this film just isn't scary. I mean sure, it's creepy, but if you're like me (a 14 year old boy), there's a strong possibility that this film won't scare you. However, I don't really count this as a strike against it, as it's not as much a flaw with the movie as it is with modern movie goers such as myself.The more I think about this movie, the more I realize how much this film is a contemporary re-telling of Dracula and it's a well made one, too. It's a refreshing break to see a vampire movie that doesn't try to be particularly special with it's portrayal of vampires and in not being special, it BECOMES special. And that's the beauty of Fright Night. And yet, it makes me sad, as it shows just how pathetic vampires have gotten that watching a movie where vampires do what they're supposed to do is such a rare and glorious occurrence. Oh well. In the end Fright Night is a fun, campy, and creepy vampire flick that would be ideal to watch on Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched Fright Night when it was released in Brazil. I was a 5-6 years old kid, and I admit I was intensely involved with the story. Years passed by, and its still the BEST Vampire Movie ever made. And I thought I would never watch it anymore..Last year, I found out that I could keep it forever with me - I saw the DVD for sale. I didn't think twice, I bought it. I lost track of how many times I've watched Fright Night - Just to see Chris Sarandon, playing as the most seductive vampire ever (Oh how I wanted to be Amy!); The brilliant Peter Vincent (Which name's a tribute to Peter Crushing and Vincent Price), who was supposed to be "The Great Vampire Killer"; William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster, an eccentric suburban teen, going nuts for the fact his neighbor was indeed a vampire..This movie is definitely one of a kind. I love 80's movie, even though we can notice the "flaws", it's still amazing how they managed to create such memorable scenes, a stunning atmosphere and a fabulous script. I suggest everyone to watch it and re-watch it. If you haven't watch it, do it. This is a movie you cannot ~ die before watching it. ~.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CHARLIE BREWSTER is your typical normal teenage boy, whom one evening, spots a coffin being taken into an old house next door to him, he later finds out that the house has been bought by a male house keeper &amp; his friend, a very handsome man named JERRY, whom unfortunately turns out to be an evil, centuries old, shape shifting vampire! who loves to put the moves &amp; the bite on the ladies (which results in a few murders being heard of in the news upon his arrival in town)&amp; enjoy the odd apple here &amp; there. When Charlie tells his friend, girlfriend &amp; even the police about it, they think he's crazy (I mean let's be honest, who would believe a story like that? especially one coming from a teenage kid who likes watching vampire TV shows!) seeking help, he enlists the aid of his favorite TV horror host, the vampire slaying PETER VINCENT, whom is none to happy &amp; none to brave when he is forced to fill the shoes of his on screen character a vampire slayer in real life in order to defeat these creeps. When Jerry brings his friend &amp; girlfriend over to the side of the living dead, Charlie &amp; Peter set out to save them before they become permanent members of the night shift, but can they stop them, or will they too join the ranks of the undead? FRIGHT NIGHT is a perfect example of one of the many great 80's horror movies that sadly just don't get made anymore, the film is both clever, frightening &amp; funny &amp; the make-up effects are also a big wow! the acting was great I honestly can't think of a better cast to fill these roles then the ones that were casted! the direction &amp; writing also helped lift FRIGHT NIGHT up &amp; above many horror movies being churned out at that time &amp; today. The film, never lets up nor stops to take a breath, so fans of horror movies most certainly will not be bored with this one. So if you're looking for a really fun horror movie to sink your teeth into (pun intended) then hunt down a copy of FRIGHT NIGHT now! Followed by a 1989 sequel, FRIGHT NIGHT II **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superior modern vampire film remains one of the best made and most wildly entertaining horror movies of the 80's!When teenage boy believes that his suave new neighbor is a vampire, he enlists the help of a TV horror host to destroy the blood-sucker.Even now, a good 20 years after this movie premiered, Fright Night is one of the best vampire movies anywhere! Many have called the movie a spoof on the horror genre and while it does have a sharp sense of humor Fright Night is really a full-blooded horror ride. In a way it's old-fashion horror fun thats given some nicely modernized twists. Tom Holland well writes and directs this film. Holland's story is quickly paced and becomes compelling fun. His direction is slickly done as well. Fright Night boasts some spectacular (and gooey) special FX that are still impressive even by today's standards. That alone is a great achievement. Another highlight of the film is the gorgeous and mesmerizing rock score by Brad Fiedel. Believe me, no other electronic score is more alluring that this! The J. Giles band also provides a funky theme song. Yet another highlight is the outstanding cast of this film. Chris Sarandon is everything you could expect from a vamp - charming, menacing, and drop-dead sexy. Young William Ragsdale is quirky as our unlikely teen-hero. The late-great Roddy McDowall shines as a veteran horror movie actor who must face real horrors now! The supporting cast is good as well, especially the wise-cracking Stephen Geoffreys.A horror delight all the way, Fright Night remains a big favorite in the vampire genre and for very good reason. See it!**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The '80s doesn't get a lot of respect from film snob types because it didn't have enough navel-gazing dramas or three-hour epics in desperate need of an edit. Sure, there are some, but not enough to please the elites. In my opinion, it was a phenomenal decade for movies that were just damn entertaining, whether they be comedy, action, horror, sci-fi, or whatever else. Fright Night is one of these '80s greats. Smooth direction, fun special effects, smart script, good score, and a wonderful cast. William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, and Amanda Bearse are all terrific here. However, the scene stealers are Roddy McDowall as actor Peter Vincent and Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed, the lead character's best friend with many of the movie's most memorable lines. It's a classic horror-comedy that's been highly influential on many movies and television shows since, not the least of which is Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Definitely should be on any list of "must see" '80s movies. Followed by a sequel and a watchable but pedestrian remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fright Night is a film about a teen named Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale). He lives a seemingly normal life in a seemingly normal neighborhood, and is in love with girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse). Charley loves to watch horror legend Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) host a late night horror show. Things start to turn weird for Charley when new neighbor Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) moves in across the street. Charley begins to suspect that Jerry is a vampire, but everyone thinks he is crazy. Jerry seems too perfect to be a vampire, and vampires don't exist, right? It's up to Charley to prove everyone wrong, and he needs the help of Peter Vincent and his friend, Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) to stop Jerry from finding more victims.This is a brilliantly stylish horror/comedy film that has held up well over the years. Sarandon is brilliant as the seductive Dandrige and McDowall is at his best. A great film that is fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Renowned in the horror community as a classic movie gym of the 1980's, Fright Night provides a fun, thrilling watch. What makes Fright Night spectacular is the six main characters who were terrifically written and portrayed fantastically by the actors and actress. Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowell, and Stephen Geoffreys were the strongest, Sarandon being stoic, while McDowell and Geoffreys were eccentric goofballs. The overall story is original for the time and provides a really nice blend of horror, comedy and drama. With an average run-time of slightly under two hours, all these great aspects of Fright Night really made the movie go by very quickly. What did bother me was some of the special effects and fake looking gore scenes but it wasn't a deal breaker to the movie by any means. Really recommend, Fright Night, it's truly a classic as a light fun horror flick.</fullReview>

Really is a great classic horror.This movie is about a young guy named Charlie Brewster. While spying on his neighbours one day he sees things to lead him to the suspicion that his new neighbour is a vampire. He is scared for his life while everyone else is scared for his sanity.I have loved this movie since I was a kid it used to be scary then but now its just funny and enjoyable.

		<fullReview>Original story based on traditional vampire rules... Excellent cast includes Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale, Roddy McDowall, Amanda Bearse and Steven Geoffreys.Sarandon's portrayal of Jerry Dandrige is the most debonaire, sophisticated and articulate vampire-next-door ever seen on film, in my opinion. Dandrige is an impeccably dressed, highly civilised apple eating vampire (in the early evening at least) who is dead keen to secretly "suck his way through the entire town".Frustrated teen, Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) stumbles across his neighbour's nocturnal activities by chance and although his friends refuse to believe it, his eventual all- too-close encounter with undead Dandrige puts him on a mission to protect himself in any way he can. Brewster soon transforms his bedroom into a holy shrine with crucifixes, candles and sharpened stakes.Failing late night TV host and very B movie actor Peter Vincent (who thankfully has managed to retain a huge number of his old movie props) thinks he's crazy too. Persuaded by Charlie's friends to use these props, Vincent attempts to prove to him that Dandrige is not a vampire, but all does not go exactly to the plan.An atmospheric score by Brad Fiedel, and true 1980s soundtrack including memorable nightclub beats from Evelyn "Champagne" King, Sparks and Ian Hunter help add credence to the in-the-now scenario.A fun and sometimes funny vampire film with reasonable special effects, enjoyable to watch throughout. And yes it's brim full of minor goofs, but they don't actually spoil it at all and maybe even add to its appeal!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fright Night is simply 80's vampire movies at their greatest. It goes along with The Lost Boys in terms of horror, gore, and fun. No depressing, sparkly, romantic crap here. Here we see Ragsdale discover his neighbor is a vampire. Of course nobody believes him and he's soon driven mad. Luckily he forms an alliance with a reluctant TV vampire hunter. As I said, Fright Night is a fun movie, which always raises a chuckle, but it also has some disgusting effects. I'm talking real practical stuff, with some of the most painful deaths and transformations you can imagine. This stuff is so much more creative with prosthetics and the like. Computers can easily make a body melt, or turn a wolf into a man, here some truly creative visuals make these things a reality. Sarandon is excellent as the charming vampire, and it's nice to see him go along with trying to prove he isn't a vampire. It shows him as a man that would rather keep his secret than enter a battle to the death. Ragsdale does the usual not-believed-kid routine, but he makes it work. McDowall stole the movie for me. He plays an out of date TV star given a chance to live out his pretend life. The threats are real, and the climax steadily grows. You do have to suspend some belief in terms of how the characters respond, but if you love the 80's, vampires, and movies that knew how to be fun no matter what their subject, you need to see Fright Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far superior to it's remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I finished reading the truly horrible script for the 2011 remake of Fright Night I found myself with a new appreciation of the original movie.Peter Vincent is probably the most enjoyable character in this film. Roddy McDowall stole the show as the slightly cowardly TV horror host who grows a spine and rises to be the heroic vampire killer he had always pretended to be. The soundtrack is incredible. The acting is brilliant. I have always loved Gothic Horror, particularly the old Hammer horror films such as what Peter Vincent shows on his TV show. Not only do I not see a purpose in the Fright Night remake but I feel it fails on my many levels where the original excels. The vampires of the original Fright night had the powers of Dracula, himself. They could turn into horrible little bats, or wolves, or mist. They could enthrall human wills and could show up on film as a human might. In the remake they have no such abilities and this is not so-well compensated by an excess of explosions. The writer of the remake claims that horror movie hosts don't exist anymore. Not only is this not true but there are more horror movie hosts on TV AND Internet today than there ever were on TV in 1985. Elvira's Movie Macabre, Mystery science theater 3000, Nostalgia Critic, just to name a few... I think they made a huge mistake in changing Peter Vincent to a nearly unrecognizable stage magician in the remake. If anything the movie host is more relatable now than ever before. Skip the remake, stick with the original. It makes more sense. It has more accessible characters. Peter Vincent actually has depth rather than the show pretense of depth with the added backstory given in the remake. Charlie is a lot nicer and a lot more sympathetic in the original. And this one had memorable and catchy songs on the soundtrack. The vampires are more frightening while at the same time more charming and strangely sympathetic while also terrifying and deadly. The humor isn't forced and there's no obnoxious product placement. The remake... has none of these qualities. This is by far the superior film. Skip the remake, kids. Stick with the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fright night still frightens the hell out of me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before playing Marci Darci in Married? with Children, Amanda Bearse terrified the hell out of me when I first watched this movie. In fact, I just watched Fright Night a couple of months ago and I chuckled nervously after seeing certain scenes thinking, "damn, this is still pretty scary." It's more of a parody of vampire movies, a campy horror flick that has some comedy but with Chris Sarandon as a Dracula-esque vampire, Roddy McDowall as a not-so-famous TV vampire killer, and the special effects, this is a must-see horror movie at any age. Charly (William Ragsdale) suspects his new neighbor (Sarandon) of being a vampire but, naturally, no one believes him so he takes it upon himself to take him down before he steals his girlfriend (Bearse) away from him and turns her into his bride. Sarandon effortlessly delivers as the vampire and McDowall's comedic turned terrified performance are enough to make me watch this but two things deliver and make this movie so good that there's obviously a remake on the way (August 12, 2011 starring Colin Farrell and David Tennant) because of it. Aside from the story and acting and blah blah blah, the special effects and Stephen Geoffreys' performance are awesome to watch. The way they made the vampires is extremely scary. It's not just the typical black eyes, white make-up, and long teeth. No, it's Julia Roberts-sized mouths with shark-type teeth that threaten to rip a chunk off your neck rather than leave two small holes. That and their movements. Fantastic. It might be better than Twilight. ;) The other thing is Stephen Geoffreys. He gives such an eerie and energetic performance that he definitely stands out more than his acting counterparts. His character is an enigma and when he's turned into a vampire he embraces it as much as any top notch actor can. He's phenomenal. Kinda makes you sad that he turned to making gay porn instead of an actual movie career. Oh well, c'est la vie.</fullReview>

The acting was not top notch by any means but it was somewhat believable and it didn't take you away from the movie. The transformations were excellent which the wolf to teenager transformation was extremely creepy. There were plenty of funny moments along with the right amount of horror. This was a completely fresh movie which was professionally executed. I was quite pleased with watching this at my age and enjoying it quite a bit. Not a bad reaction for an 80's film. Kudos to the director for his story and his vision. This is definitely a movie to watch, however I am going to be adding it to my collection so I don't forget about it again 10 years later.</fullReview>

He unwittingly puts his best friend Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) and girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) in danger. It's up to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) vampire hunter to help.Sharp, funny and just great vampire film. It was made to reintroduce the vampire to 1980s audiences and was a HUGE hit. The direction and writing by Tom Holland are just excellent and coupled with a great music score. The vampire himself is never played for laughs but he DOES have a huge sense of humor (Sarandon plays him to perfection). Also the story sticks to the original version of a vampire and his weaknesses (I especially like it when it's made clear that a vampire can NOT enter a house unless welcomed in by its rightful owner). The special effects, even by todays standards, are VERY impressive and they're wisely confined to the last half hour when the kids and Vincent are fighting for their lives. Also I loved the 80s fashions worn by Bearse, the J. Geils Band sings the title song and Sarandon and McDowell are fantastic in their roles. My only complaints--Ragsdale and Bearse are way too old to play teenagers (he was 24--she was 27!) and what the hell WAS Billy Cole (the vampire's helper)? Those are small complaints though. This is a strong, funny and scary vampire flick. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Charlie finds out that the house next door to him has a new owner, the mysterious Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) and his roommate Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark). But one night, when Charlie was studying. He was looking on his next door neighbor's window and what it seems to be his neighbor is about to have sex with a beautiful woman. Then suddenly, while Charlie is still looking... he realized that his neighbor has fangs and growing long finger nails. Charlie believes that Jerry is a vampire and his roommate is his guard during daylight. Now Charlie tries to tell his mother, his friends and even a police detective (Art Evens) the truth but no one believes him. Charlie turns to his idol, once B Movie Hammer-type Actor and TV Horror Host Peter Vincent (The late Roddy McDowall) for help but convincing Peter and his friends is a tough thing to do while Jerry is planning to kill Charlie.Written and Directed by Tom Holland (Child's Play, The Langoliers, The Temp) made an enjoyable horror vampire film with game cast and an sharp sense of humour. This is certainly one of the better horror movies of the 1980's and this went on to be instant classic with the fans of the genre. Sarandon is one of the sexier vampires to be seen on the screen and his performance is fun as well. McDowall nearly steals the show as the cowardly yet brave hero, who's faces reality by destroying vampires for the first time. This was a sleeper hit at the box office, when it was first release. A sequel was also produced with Ragsdale and McDowall returning in the second film but it was entirely not totally successful movie. This is probably Holland's sharpest film to date (although I really loved the film, he directed "Thinner"). This has crisp visual style, thanks to Jan Kiesser's (Bad Moon, Dad, Fido) cinematography and Brad Fiedel's (The Terminator, Terminator 2:Judgment Day, Blink) good jazzy electronic score. Make-Up effects, Special Visual Effects and the Production Designs are first-rate as well. Do not miss this one of a kind picture that become an major Cult Classic. Panavision.

		<fullReview>Fright Night (1985) was a horror film based upon the ever popular vampire genre. A nosy "kid" cast an wandering eye on the new neighbors. The suave handsome man and his weaselly looking buddy strike an eerie nerve within him, making his skin crawl. He's knows something is not right with the new people next door. Foolishly, he begins to snoop around the old house and discovers things that he shouldn't have.Charlie Brewster is his name, his best friend is a high school outcast named Evil Ed. His girlfriend (Amanda Bearse) doesn't want to go any further with Charlie than second base. What's a "kid" like Charlie to do? Especially when he discovers the horrible secret of his neighbor. Can he live with the fact that a creature of the night lives in his neighborhood?Fright Night is not like most other horror films. It's different in a way (like Nightmare on Elm Street 2). It explores the homosexual themes without being very explicit or stereotypical. True two of the co-stars are openly gay (but not at the time) and Chris Sarandon makes an excellent bi-sexual vampire. Fright Night is also the last hurrah for the great Roddy Mc Dowell, his role as the "legendary" Peter Vincent was superb. A true 80's classic. Followed by a lesser sequel Fright Night II. It's okay but not as good as part one.Strongly recommended.What was up with the Vampire's personnel assistant? That was one strange dude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of Vampire films, but 'Fright Night' is one of a kind.'Fright Night' isn't my favorite Vampire film of all time, that title belongs to 'Let The Right One In,' but it's not too far off. It's adds just enough comedy to go along with the creepiness - which mainly comes from the star of the show - Chris Sarandon. I'm sure Chris didn't make it to be as big as he had hoped, but he'll always be remembered for being one of the creepiest, hippest blood suckers ever put on film. As for the rest of the cast - all passable, somewhat forgettable, other than Roddy McDowell, who did his best to hang with the main star... and did a rather fine job. The plot? Who really gives a damn? It's a Vampire flick. If you're watching a horror film for it's plot, you're not doing it right. Although, 'Fright Night's' plot is certainly better than most horror films.Random Ramblings of a Madman: It's Chris Sarandon's show - everyone else is just along for the ride. If you like your horror mixed with a little comedy, you won't get much better than 'Fright Night.' It still holds up very well. Tom Holland and Chris Sarandon should be very proud for creating and starring in, what will always be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I still have the prop!" Massively cool classic, love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if you've merely got a passing fancy for horror, how could you ever read that title and *not* want to watch this movie? More than anything else, it's all about the fun, and I just find it as great and entertaining a watch as it's always been. That's the true test of a classic horror flick, if you can see it over so many times and still it seems fresh, still it offers new insights, still it lends itself to bold and exciting new interpretations! And, you can still go to the bathroom in the middle of it without missing a thing! It's very straightforward and dead easy to get into. I mean, what an angle: A teenage boy who's a big horror fan, he's seen all the movies, read all the stories, and he suddenly finds himself faced with a real monster who's moved in right next door and who soon knows that the boy knows about his true nature - what does he do? It's such a novel concept and one that plays out in such a satisfying way. The atmosphere is amazing, it doesn't ever drag and it doesn't take itself too seriously, not to say there are no scary moments or anything. It's helped a lot by a good cast. William Ragsdale as Charlie was fine, but he was kind of neurotic and boring for me, I thought he was overshadowed even by most of the smaller characters. He played the lead well, I just thought that the role could've been done a lot better and memorable by someone like Zach Galligan, say.. I loved his ditzy mother, she was a hoot! She kept coming out with such funny lines. I absolutely bloody adore Roddy McDowall in this, what a class act. He's simply priceless in his role as Peter Vincent, a meek and unlikely cowardly aged actor who becomes the hero he has played in a string of classic B-movie vampire pictures in his glory days after a graceful character arc in which he gains the courage and "faith!" to face his fear. And Chris Sarandon, he just played his vampiric character to perfection. I love the way he's got the whole charm and seduction thing down, but at the same time he has a certain little odd quirkiness to some of his lines and actions. And he was also perfectly intimidating and wrathful when he had to be. And although you understand how he's gotta go, you never really hate the guy, he's a very likable villain that I could 'dig', and that's half the battle right there at winning the audience of a horror movie over, if the bad guy's interesting and charismatic. I love all of the nifty and gruesome special effects, like the awesomely foreboding mist that swirls around Dandridge's humble abode and sets such a fabulous tone. There's the prosthetics and models of the prolonged sequence where poor strange Evil Ed slowly transforms back into a regular human following an impaling while in wolf form and dies.(Or does he?) I also love the brief but superb animation of the bat, and the little but effective gag of when Amy's dancing and sees a reflection that shows her dancing with thin air. I love that sequence, it's so vibrant and so of its time, it's like someone felt like indulging themselves by incorporating a glitzy music video into their movie and it's really 80s, really corny, and really epic!!! There is also the impressively gooey disintegration of the sexy and mysterious(Demon? Zombie?) Billy Cole, and the spectacular demise of Jerry Dandridge in which he kind of explodes to death. Some of the effects hold up a little better than others, but so what? There's such a charm there sometimes when you know that they had to put it all together themselves, and they clearly had a lot of love for the old vampire movies and the horror genre here, and you just very rarely get that anymore. Still brilliant fun, couldn't have asked for anything better! I wonder if any real vampires ever come to see these films....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, I really enjoyed Fright Night. The plot revolves around Charlie Brewster, a suburban boy who discovers that his new neighbor is a vampire. Later in the film, the vampire goes after his friends and his girlfriend. He has to get the help of an older vampire movie star to help him defeat the beast. The film does have a sense of humor, but also has a great,creepy atmosphere; especially in the scenes in the house towards the end. Some of the special effects didn't look too good, but others did.The characters are really likable and I thought that the cast did a really good job. This one gets recommendation from me, that's for sure</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror/Comedy from the 1980s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mid 1980s was not a classic era for vampire stories, but Fright Night came along just in time with a perfect response to the Jason &amp; Freddy Krueger movies that dominated the decade.It's the usual tale of the teenager who knows that vampires are in town, but everyone thinks he's crazy until the very end. They kidnap his girlfriend as well and try to turn her into the vampire queen. Can't forget that part. Roddy McDowell in particular is terrific as the used up TV vampire killer who goes into real battle with the undead for the first time. Chris Sarandon adds a real air of malevolence to the evil Jerry Dandridge.Even though this movie is really a horror/comedy, there is a significant level of violence and a small amount of nudity, male and female. Fright Night spawned a sequel and a remake, but anyone who's interested should stick to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you want about this film but without it, there'd be no Lost Boys (1987), no Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992) or all the later stuff such as the Vampire Diaries, Twilight, etc., etc. In this respect, it's been highly influential. This is probably why the remake failed -- what was once original became decidedly cliché. Merging the genres of teen movie with that of the vampire flick was an inspired touch -- as was the tongue-in-cheek plot and dialog. I have really only one complaint, that this would have been a decent franchise had it not been for the awful sequel which -- pardon the pun -- put a stake through the heart of that particular opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sooo cool" Teen-Charley Brewster is delaying hetro-sex to spy on his male neighbor and the neighbor's male roommate. Sounds like me growing up.Actually, I did grow up with this classic, this original Fright Night, released in 1985. So much so, I'd forgotten about all the classic lines I could quote verbatim this time around. Also, the two classic horror/comedy characters: Peter Vincent, TV host and Vampire Killer, extraordinaire and "Evil" Ed. And it helped that Charley was waaay cute when I first watched this ? and he's still adorable when I rewatch this.I loved this movie growing up and I can appreciate it more now with the likes of the wretched Twilight series that stomps all over the vampire legends. It's nice to revisit this and see real rules applying to "real movie vampires."Everyone in this movie was having a blast making this. Everyone chewed their scenery and we can join in with the fun. As mentioned, the one that stood out, overall, was the everlasting Peter Vincent, played wonderfully by Roddy McDowall. I loved those cheesy horror movies growing up and namely the last-night hosted programs, such as the one here. I could definitely relate to Charley who shared the same passion and idolized Peter.Basic synopsis: Geeky Charley thinks new neighbor as a vampire, and (surprise) no one believes him ? not his best friend, gal, mom or eventual pal, the Vampire Killer/Bmovie TV Host, Peter Vincent. The fun here, in this own spoof/comedy on the horror legend ? the Vampire ? is getting the goofy Peter to not only believe but aid Charley destroy the vampire neighbor and save his girl.This is a real fun movie. Sure, it's dated ? just listen to the soundtrack ? but for those who may not have even seen this, it's still great to check out for those who loved the old monster movies of yesteryears. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sink your teeth into this classic 1985 vampire movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie back in the mid-80's, when I was a mere teenager, and I watched it again several years later, and now in 2011, I find myself watching it yet again. Why? Well, because it is a classic horror movie, and also because it is quite good. But also as a freshening up on the movies (part 1 and 2) before watching the 2011 remake, even if it has Colin Ferrell in it.The story, for a typical 80's horror movie, is pretty straight forward, centered around teenagers. Charley suspects his new neighbor to be more than they appear, when he sees them dragging in a coffin in the middle of the night, and when people start disappearing only to end up murdered. Charley believes his neighbor to be a vampire, but no one believes him, not even Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer from TV. It becomes a race against the coming of dawn, as lives are at stake.Now, the acting in the movie was great back in the day, and actually still is good even today. I had a blast revisiting the movie here in 2011. It was especially funny to see Amanda Bearse in the role, now that we later grew up with her shining in her role in the TV sitcom "Married With Children". The one pulling the load of the movie was Roddy McDowall (playing Peter Vincent, a tribute to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price, I assume). He was just phenomenal.For a mid-80's horror movie, the effects were actually quite good. And I still liked them today. They look good and they are straight to the point, no fancy CGI with radiant colors and dazzling effects, just pure and simple effects showing what needs to be shown.Immediately after finishing this review I will sit down and watch "Fright Night 2", and hopefully it will prove as good as I remembered it to be from back in my teenage years."Fright Night" is a great vampire movie, especially since there are no glistening vampires with big hair and sparkling skin. The vampires in this movie are portrayed as they should be, vicious creatures with a taste for blood, not a taste for awkward teenagers in a town no one's ever heard about.This movie will appeal to us old fans but also to newcomers to the movie, because it has a good, classic story to tell, and it does so in a good pace, and you are never left bored at any time. For fans of vampire movies, thumbs up! Check out "Fright Night" if you aren't already familiar with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ted Munns Horror Film Reviews - Fright Night (1985)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched Fright Night as a kid I instantly feel in love with the film. It is a movie that has a fun yet creepy feeling towards it. It has kept me coming back for more and more year after year.Plot:Charlie (William Ragsdale) believes that his next door neighbour (Chris Sarandon) is more than just a little odd, after a number of strange events and the disappearance of a women. Charlie turns to his family and friends for help and when all else fails, he asks for the help from TV show host and horror movie star Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall).Hot or Not:Fright Night is defiantly Hot a film that is there to entertain and is made by a director who clearly has an affection for the genre. While scary in places (especially the scene in Charlie's room) the film is very fun and has comical aspects to it and generally sums up 80s movies (fun music, cheesy effects, not to say they are bad for the time and full of colour). The film gives homages to many of its fellow Vampire sub genre films, including the Hammer and Universal, the scenes on the staircase resemble universals Dracula a great deal.Fright night tries not to steer to far away from the original principles of the vampire movie and it works perfectly. There are no guns and heavy weaponry like some modern vampire films and it doesn't dry and take away from the original principles. Chris Sarandon doesn't no kung fu and doesn't have an army of vampire ninjas.Sarandon you feel could play Dracula perfectly and you feel Gerard Butler may have based his Dracula portrayal on Sarandon's character in Dracula 2000. Peter Vincent is clearly a homage to peter Cushing and Vincet Price and portrays his role well as the Van Helsing character.Birds and the Bees:We get a pair of breasts from Jerry's first victim, however the ladies get the best deal in this film seeing Chris Sarandon shirtless and just being dam sexy.Acting:Chris Sarandon (Jerry) steels every scene he is in, the guy is very sexy and that is coming from a straight guy. He clearly appreciates the genre and knows how to play the role to perfection, cocky and argent but at the same time charming. Roddy McDowall (Peter Vincent) is comical and very funny you instantly warm to him. William Ragsdale (Charlie) handles his whiny part well, although did become slightly irritating. Amanda Bearse (Amy) as the innocent girlfriend didn't feel right, she seemed out of place and was one possible let down, one of very few that the film had. She seemed to old for the role, perhaps that was so her and Jerry's relationship was weird.Overall:Fright Night is possibly one of the best Vampire films around, it doesn't get much better. Horror fans, vampire fans and even fans of just 80s films will appreciate this movie. It has all the feel of a traditional Vampire film but at the same time has a splash of 80's flavor. I especially loved the nightclub scene great music and the dance scene was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This brilliant film is a masterful mixture of sidesplitting laughs and hip, Hammer-style horror. When Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) discovers that his mysterious neighbor is a bloodsucking fiend, he immediately gets on the case and hires the help of a hapless horror TV show host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall in a scene-stealing performance) with often hilarious results. The film is made all the better with Ken Diaz's superb "Evil Dead"-style creature make-up effects and a wonderful turn from Chris Sarandon as the prince of darkness. Bursting with energy, wit and love for the genre (there is a poster of "House Of Dracula" in Vincent's house), this is one film that is an absolute must-see for any true vampire fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you do if you found out that your new next-door neighbor was a blood-sucking creature of the night? That's Charley Brewster's dilemma in this highly entertaining mix of horror and comedy. Charley tries calling the police. That doesn't work out so well. None of his friends believe him. Out of desperation, Charley finally solicits the aid of Peter Vincent, the washed-up host of a local horror television show who, unfortunately, doesn't believe in real-life vampires.This is one of those rare mixes of horror and comedy that really works. The comedy bits are funny and the horror is, at times, truly horrific. Much of its success is due to the actors who play the lead roles -- Chris Sarandon as the super cool vampire Jerry Dandridge; William Ragsdale as the hapless Charley; Roddy McDowell as the skeptical Peter Vincent; and Stephen Geoffreys as the aptly named Evil Ed. Add to the fine acting a literate script and excellent special effects and the result is a funny, frightening masterpiece.Highly recommended for all fans of vampire movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"'And Like A 'GHOUL' Neighbor, 'STAKE' Farm Is There!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the "vampire renaissance" that took place in the '80's, FRIGHT NIGHT was one of three films that made vampires hip and chic with the teen set, (THE LOST BOYS and NEAR DARK were the other two.) It was also the brainchild of ingenious writer/director Tom Holland, who would also give the horror world a demented little "Good Guys" doll named Chucky...Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) is a typical horny teen with two passions in life: getting to third base with his girlfriend Amy (future MARRIED WITH CHILDREN star Amanda Bearse) and watching the late night spook show FRIGHT NIGHT, hosted by former horror legend Peter Vincent, (Roddy McDowall in top form). Wellll...make that THREE passions. A recent series of brutal murders involving young women has Charley convinced that his 'playa' of a neighbor, the handsome and charming Jerry Dandrige (Chris 'PRINCESS BRIDE' Sarandon) is in fact a 'creature of the night.' The problem for both Charley and his night-prowling neighbor is...Charley's RIGHT.Holland and the entire cast have fun taking all of the conventions of a John Hughes saga and taking a Dracula-sized bite out of them: teens dealing with hormones, relationships, their favorite quirky habits and hobbies, and of course, with your single mom having a romantic interest in a new guy. Who just so happens to be a vampire.Charley tries at first to convince his late-night horror hero Peter Vincent that there's more afoot in the house next door than the usual hanky-panky. After he's persuaded with a little monetary 'consideration', Vincent relents and decides to prove to Charley once and for all that there are no such things as vampires. That's when Peter suddenly finds that, to his own surprise and horror, some things do have basis in both 'reel' AND real life after all, and must make a decision whether or not confronting them is possible...or even worth it!This is one of those horror movies that still plays well even now. McDowall's schtick is dead-on as he simultaneously satirizes and salutes the work of old horror stand-bys like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Ragsdale and Bearse are engaging leads, but the real scene-stealers here are Jonathan Stark as Jerry's "best bud" and familiar, Billy Cole, and Stephen Geoffreys as "Evil Ed" Thompson, Charley's best friend/sidekick, whose role as a teen outcast leads him to a painful and tragic end. Or does it?But a vampire movie is only as good as its lead monster, and Sarandon is more than up to the challenge, giving a career-making performance. (Holland would have him back in a more 'subdued' role in CHILD'S PLAY.)The visual effects (Richard Edlund) and makeup (everyone from Steve Johnson to Greg Cannom pitching in) were state-of-the-art at the time, and though some of the "boo!"- worthy scares haven't dated very well, since most movies have used them a trillion times by now, there's still one or two sequences guaranteed to make you wet yourself a little.FRIGHT NIGHT makes a great springboard for a "triple-night" at the movies, should you team it up with THE LOST BOYS and NEAR DARK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fright Night is a horror/comedy written and directed by Tom Holland (The Beast Within, Psycho II, Child's Play), one thing that makes Fright Night such a great movie is it's horror make up effects, it's all puppetry and latex. None of that CGI stuff today, this was all hand made which I find makes a film feel more real. That said there are some good films that use CGI effects like Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Pan's Labyrinth, The Matrix, etc. The Werewolf transformation scene is very effective since it's disturbing and upsetting. The Vampire effects is great and the Bat form may just be a rubber creature but it looks good. The acting in Fright Night is great, Roddy MacDowel does a great performance as the iconic horror actor Peter Vincent (Peter Cushin and Vincent Price's first names combined.), the music score is also cool. The Come to Me score is a very catchy theme that really sets the tone, especially with the love scene.The plot of the film sees teenager Charlie Bruster and his girlfriend Amy one night making out in hid bedroom, as they get ready to go all the way Charlie notices something strange outside. Two people are carrying a coffin into the basement of the house, Charlie discovers that someone's just moved in to that house a while ago. The next day Charlie meets a young woman who goes into the house and that night while he's in his room he hears a scream coming from next door, Charlie goes to investigate and sees the two people carrying a bag with what seems to be a body inside. On the news Charlie sees a report about another murdered body and discovers that it was the woman that went into the house, at night Charlie decides to spy on the house and soon finds the owner getting ready to bite another young woman he invited to his home. Charlie becomes convinced that his neighbour is a Vampire, he asks for the Leuitentant to check the houser for anything but when Charlie mentions he's a Vampire he leaves thinking he's making this all up. Charile asks for help off his friend Ed, he tells him to put garlic on the windows and use crosses. Ed tells him that has long as the owner of the house doesn't invite the Vampire he's safe. That night in his room Charlie nails the windows shut, he's asked by his mother to meet someone and that person happens to be the Vampire neighbour Jerry, after being attacker in his room by him Charlie seeks help and the he feels the only man who can do it is horror icon Peter Vincent. He tells Peter what's going on but he doesn't believe him and leaves, his girlfriend Amy and Ed go to see Charlie and find that he's been up all night trying to make his room safe so the Vampire can't enter, he tells them that he plans to sneak into Jerry's house and ram a stake through his heart. Amy insists that before he tries to kill him that they get Peter Vincent around to prove it, Ed and Amy go to Peter's apartment and pay him to prove that Charlie's neighbour is human. They go to Jerry's home and make him drink pretend holy water. As they go to leave Peter looks at his mirror to see that Jerry has no reflection meaning he really is a Vampire. That night has Ed is walking home Jerry chases him into an alley and persuades him to become a creature of the night like him, Charlie and Amy hear Ed scream and think that he's fooling around with them again but soon find themselves being pursued by Jerry. They hideout in a Nightclub but soon find Jerry inside where he takes Amy away, the only way he'll see her again is if he and Peter Vincent come to his house. Charlie goes to Peter's apartment and tells him what's going on, they then go to the Vampire's house and get ready to rescue Amy and finish off Jerry once and for all before Charile's girlfriend becomes a Vampire for all eternity.

		<fullReview>this movie is a classic. SFX are good era &amp; genre wise, although some of the prosthetics are bizarre and the prosthetics worn by Bearse in the end is absolutely ridiculous. What makes this movie worth remembering, though, is the "100% 1980s" atmosphere. It has not many "80ish music video clips " moments like the sequel and it is a true classic of juvenile comedies (although more serious than the sequel ) turned to horror so typical of the "golden 80s". Ragsdale as Charlie does a better acting job than in the sequel; McDowall delivers solid acting and even Sarandon is good in his bizarre portrayal of the vampire. Geoffreys as "Evil" comes distant second and I think I can act better than Amanda Bearse as Amy and other characters, EG the "zombie guardian" supposed to be intimidating but looking a bit queer to me. It is an "in jest" movie, often taking over the top motives from vampire movies, such as church items, prosthetics etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective blend of comedy and horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980s brought about an upsurge of vampire films. But ones that were drastically different from they're predecessors. The whole vampire mythos was something that seemed decidedly passé in the 80s what with flowing cloaks and hammy dialogue.So the films of this decade solved the problem by smartly bringing vampires into the present day. The best example being the extremely underrated Near Dark, one of the greatest vampire films ever made. And while I feel Near Dark has a slight edge over Fright Night, this is yet another superior film of the genre.Fright Night is a hip, witty and enterprising attempt to bring vampires up to date. It doesn't so much deconstruct the genre the way Scream did with slasher movies. Rather it reconstructs itself for a whole new day and age while still remaining true to its origins.Director Tom Holland is clearly a horror film aficionado. After all the heroes of the piece are a horror movie fan and a former horror movie star. And Holland who also wrote the script has made sure they're well versed in everything there is to know about vampires.All the traditional aspects are there. Vampires suck blood. They sleep in coffins. They turn into bats and wolves. Sunlight and stakes are deadly to them. And they can't stand crosses and holy water. The only difference is instead of living in gloomy mansions and Gothic castles, they now live in suburbia.Its a neat reversal on what we've always believed about vampires. And it turns out to be a surprisingly effective setting. The first half of Fright Night borrows a few tricks from Rear Window when our hero, Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) spots his next door neighbour necking a girl. Only with fangs!Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is the vamp in question. And he soon gets wise to Charlie's Peeping Tom routine. Despite Charlie's best efforts, nobody believes his story. And when it becomes clear Charlie won't let this go, Dandridge pays him a visit. Either he forgets what he saw, or Dandridge will kill Charlie.So Charlie must turn to his hero, TV's Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), vampire killer (and ham actor) extraordinaire. With Charlie's girlfriend and best pal both vamped by Dandridge, Peter becomes Charlie's only ally. They must kill Dandridge before he kills them.Fright Night is a rather appealing attempt to update vampire mythology, and achieves it with a remarkable degree of success and certainty. I'm sure that's in no small part to Tom Holland's confident and assured direction, but the astutely observed performances by the cast also goes some way towards making Fright Night a winner.Holland's witty and intelligent screenplay frames its idea in very inspired dimensions. Its a knowing and very self-aware film, and that extends to the characters too. In particular Jerry Dandridge.He finds the classic vampire films of yesteryear to be more amusing than shocking. And he probably assumes the same of other people. Nobody is taking the vampire mythos seriously anymore, making it that much easier for genuine vampires like himself to go about their nightly hunting unopposed. And he never has to leave home either. It's a clever and borderline scary observation.But Fright Night is more than just a postmodern take on the genre. It's also an excellent horror film in its own right. Holland achieves a tremendous amount of atmosphere from half-lit camera angles and a reasonably effective soundtrack. Some of the selections admittedly do date the film, but some of the more subtler rhythms pulse through the background to unsettling effect.The film is also quite a tour de force of special effects work. There are FX that are staggering for 1985. Scenes that spring to mind are a vampire turning into a wolf and back again. A decomposing corpse. And Dandridge's death sequence. They're as impressive as anything you've seen in The Howling or An American Werewolf in London.But more importantly, Holland never allows the effects to blunt the horror, or the humour. Yes Fright Night is an involving scare show, but its a darkly humorous film at the same time. That's especially true of Roddy McDowall's hilarious turn as Peter Vincent. Sometimes Roddy McDowall was an annoyingly hammy actor, but with Peter Vincent he's found a character that allows him to flex his theatricality, but with the benefit of a tight script that forces him to toughen up.Also Chris Sarandon is an impressive villain. He cuts a striking figure in a long, sweeping coat. Fright Night's substitution for a cloak. And he hisses and sneers his way through the role with entertaining regard. He makes Jerry Dandridge a very charismatic, modern day vampire (with a curious taste for apples!).Fright Night is a film that set out to make a defining mark on the vampire genre, and it succeeded. Its a film that walks a fine line between horror and comedy, without ever indulging one at the expense of another. A fine and amusing redefinition of the vampire mythology that just gets better and better with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fright Night (1985) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) is a "teen" who's trying to make out with his girlfriend (Amanda Bearse) up in his bedroom one stormy evening while the weekend horror movie on television's "Fright Night" plays in the background. Suddenly, Charlie begins to notice from his window that his new neighbor across the way, Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) seems to be involved in some shady goings-on. Charlie soon spots him unloading coffins, and romancing a nubile female guest before shockingly biting her throat. Then, Dandrige is seen with his live-in assistant carting away what appears to be a body in a bag. In no time at all, Charlie deduces that his next door neighbor is a real vampire, but nobody will believe him, including his girlfriend and his nerdy buddy "Evil" Ed (Stephen Geoffreys). It isn't very long before Dandrige becomes aware of Charlie's discovery and sets his sights on silencing him. With nowhere to turn, Charlie decides to contact elder film scholar Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) who has been hosting the local "Fright Night" TV broadcasts in the area and used to be a cinematic celebrity himself in bygone days, having played a Peter Cushing-like vampire hunter in movies before he became a has-been. It's then up to Charlie and "Peter Vincent, Vampire Hunter" to translate film fantasy into reality by attempting to do battle with Jerry Dandrige, who is the real deal.This is easily one of the best of the "modernized" vampire films. It's an old fashioned scary story set against a 1980s backdrop, and it works wonderfully. As the new vampire in the neighborhood, Chris Sarandon is outstanding. He can be suave and charming one moment and deadly fearsome the next. It's an extra special treat to get to see Roddy McDowall here making a strong impression in one of his last iconic parts as the frazzled Peter Vincent. In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is that, unlike today, it was filmed at a time where you could still get away with casting actors who were not currently "box office sensations". So Amanda Bearse (before she became popular from MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) is a refreshing choice as an unconventional leading girl; these days we'd probably have to deal with a Jessica Simpson. As Ed, Stephen Geoffreys can be a little irritating, but at least his character has a sympathetic side to him. It's nice to sense a sort of homage to the Universal and Hammer horror movies of yore, and the whole "late night TV horror host" craze that's lost today. One minor quibble of mine may perhaps be a slight over-reliance on extravagant makeups later in the film, but what the hell --- this is a fun horror movie. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vampire movies are almost by definition parodies, the only variable being the degree and the quality of the parody elements vs the scare elements. "Fright Night" (1985) is neither the best parody nor the scariest thriller, but it has the distinction of being the all-time best mix of the two. Both its parody and its scare elements work extremely well and their juxtaposition really makes the film worth seeing. "Fright Night's" production design will remind you of "Gremlins", a contemporary film, but the spirit of the film is more along the lines of Polanski's "Fearless Vampire Killers". Average suburban teen Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) accidentally discovers that his new neighbor is an evil vampire. The vampire is not particularly discrete, not bothering to pull the window shades and disposing of a victim in a plastic garbage bag. Charley unwisely goes public with his accusations. This tips off the vampire that his teenage neighbor may be a threat. But he is still safe because nobody believes vampires are real. Not only does no one believe Charley but the vampire discovers that Charley's girlfriend Amy resembles his lost love, which makes her a target. Amy is played by a young Amanda Bearse ("Married With Children"), which you will probably find a bit disconcerting for several reasons but it is kind of interesting to see her as a hot teen love interest. In desperation Charley goes Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), the host of the local television show called "Creature Features". The special effects are excellent and not overdone. Dorothy Fielding who plays Charley's airhead mother should get special mention for her excellent performance. One of the running gags during the first half of the film is her failure to find anything suspicious about her new neighbor or his nighttime activities. Then again, what do I know? I'm only an inner child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i have to say that i just love this movie. one of the main reason being the sexy chris sarandon, i have to admit...he was about 43 at the time and god, was he hot and handsome!!! but of course, that alone wouldn t make it the great movie fright night is.First, the actors are actually very good for a horror movie. i find charley excellent, and he seems to react like he really is scared, not just trying to fake it. i like also peter vincent, the scene where he watches evil die is actually touching. evil ed is also quite expressive in that scene, once he is back to human form of course. i also adore charley s mother. she is just hilarious, really! her few lines always make me smile. of course there is chris sarandon. not only is he quite pleasant to look at, he actually is a good actor. i love the scene when he visits charley at night, when he enters charleys room, turns around while closing the door, the whole time whistling "strangers in the night..." Ha! for me its a priceless scene! the look on his face...!And also i like the fact that the computer generated effects where not yet there. i prefer the make up effects. of course, some monsters look really fake like that (ex : ed when transforming back from wolf to human), but at least they were there during the filming, not only an effect added after the filming. for me, the effects not always so realistic are not spoiling the fun i have to watch that movie.of course, i don't hide anymore and now i can watch all the scenes! i remember the first time i watched it, in the scene with the bitten amy, where she is hiding her face in her hand, and all of a sudden, she lifts her face up and she has this horrible mouth full of theet, covering like 3/4 of her face...even though i was like 13, i was traumatized! for many years, i had to hide my face during that scene.well i guess thats it. i just got the DVD recently, and i am happy to be able to watch any time now. if you like movies with handsome bad guys, good actors, scary story and a lot of humor, thats exactly the movie for you! good viewing, i recommend to everybody!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fright Night is one of those wonderful and somewhat overlooked vampire/horror movies of the 80's. It delivers a solid story line and you'll enjoy the characters personalities throughout the film. Director Tom Holland truly had a sense of passion and sincerity for this movie and for the vampire concept. He opens the door for the modern day vampire and produces a humorous script. This is a good one to watch over and over. Worth the time for any horror movie buff and by far one of my personal favorites. Holland also directed Child's Play which is his more known work. However it is evident that his labor of love was in Fright Night. While Child's Play is extremely original Fright Night ultimately packs more punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great blend of "old" and "new" horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Holland's "Fright Night" combines the best elements of old and new horror films into a picture well worth watching. The story juxtaposes mythological figures of fright (vampire, wolfman, and familiar) with the real-world realities of high school and sexual awakening. Brewster's advances with his girlfriend Amy open the film with the awkwardness they share in coming closer to the 'final act.' Charley is diverted from his and Amy's moment by his new neighbors' transportation of a coffin into their home's basement. Charley can't cope with the approaching little death, and focuses on the real thing. A whirlwind follows with Charley and Amy constantly running from their fears of the unknown, represented by Dandridge (Chris Sarandon.) In keeping with the old, Holland characterized Peter Vincent as a generic meld of Peter Cushing and Vincent Price (often playing opposites as antagonist and protagonist in the same films.)To avoid spoilers, I recommend this film as a remarkable work of modern horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a comedy horror, and as it turns out it is one of the good comedy horror movies. This one is about a guy who watches vampire movies and one day some new people move in the house next to him. Suffice to say they do things a little differently. Yes, one of them turns out to be a vampire and of course nobody believes the guy. So his friends worry about him and turn to a person he worships the perfectly cast Roddy McDowell as an old film star of old vampire movies. This one has some comedy in it, but I would say it is more of a horror movie. There are some rather good effects and there is some gore though nothing all that bad. It moves rather predictably, you will not be surprised all that much, but it works rather well. I love Roddy in the movie and he adds to it quite well as do the rest of the cast. It is worth a look if you like horror movies and vampire ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in the 80s when it first came out and my sister and I watched it over and over. SO fun and different....especially, if, like me, you are a vampire fan. Never takes itself seriously. The teens overact, McDowell overacts, and then there is the Sarandon Factor. Is it just me or is this man just flaming hot? Thank God for DVD and slow-mo and rewind. WHAT happened that he just disappeared from films??!! Even the gay 80's Cosby-era sweaters and affected gray leather coat (hello shoulderpads!) could not really detract from his dangewrous and delicious appeal. I swear I would have been offering my neck about 15 seconds after meeting him if I were his neighbor. Even Amy (Amanda Bearse) giggles and says, "He's NEAT!"The only other sex-pot vampire also came out of the 80s....Anyone remember Frank Langella as Dracula? I can't find it on DVD anywhere. He and Chris Sarandon definitely picked up on that sexy "thang" that vampires have and made it a major factor. The voice (in both cases) certainly helped.Even though this is really campy and overacted, it is good, scary fun. The pre-CGI effects are solid, especially Evil Ed's grotesque demise. Makes a good companion piece to American Werewolf in London, Lost Boys, Dusk Til Dawn, Love at First Bite, and (for real scares) Near Dark.See it. It is nearly Halloween and I am on a vampire bender. Chris Sarandon, thank you. Hey, call me a baaaad girl, but I think I would follow this prince of evil down to his basement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been my favorite vampire movie for ages and I watched it recently to see if it was still as good as I remembered it. It was. Fright Night is full of memorable moments, characters, music, lines, everything. There´s one vital thing in this movie which I think is missing from recent movies: the feel that the characters are in danger. You really get the feeling that Charlie and Peter Vincent are scared out of their minds and that translates into the viewer. There´s lots of great lines but they don´t feel glued-on like in 99% of modern action/horror movies. The scenes toward the end are pretty gory and very atmospheric, just look at scene where the wolf/vampire is impaled: the swinging light, the bloody werewolf body, the unsettling howling.. very powerful stuff. And somehow all the 80´s stuff just makes it better! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They had Scream in the 90s, some of us had Fright Night in the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Classic! Spawning a whole new subgenre of vampire movies e.g. Vamp (Richard Wenk, 1986), Near Dark (Katheryn Bigelow, 1987), Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola. 1991) and Blade (Stephen Norrington, 1998), Fright Night is very similar to Count Yoga ? Vampire, but is a brilliant film in its own right. If you can get past those eighties fashions and mannerisms this is a timeless treasure.Charlie Brewster (Ragsdale) is the student/horror film fanatic accusing his super-suave next door neighbour, Jerry Dandridge (Sarandon) of being a bloodsucker. He begs cowardly, unemployed has-been horror veteran, Peter Vincent, ?The Great Vampire Killer' (excellent performance by McDowell) to help him stake the Vampire. Cue lots of laughs, scares and some genuine unforgettable sequences. Fright Night predates the Scream trilogy by over a decade and does a much better job of combining the chills and jokes with tongue in cheek all the way. Like the homoerotic Interview with the Vampire (Neil Jordan, 1994), there's a subplot concerning Brewster loosing interest in his girlfriend and obsessing over the good looking man next door.Brad Fiedel (The Terminator &amp; Serpent and the Rainbow) and Tangerine Dream (Firestarter &amp; The Keep)'s soundtrack here is also perfect and almost steals the show. Tom Holland, who had previously gained recognition and flashed his genre credentials for his screenplays for The Beast Within (Philippe Mora, 1982) and Psycho 2 (Richard Franklin, 1983), would go on to give us the charismatic killer doll, Chucky, in the original Child's Play movie, also starring Chris Sarandon.The Fright Night sequel followed in 1987, but was too similar to its predecessor and lacked the intense, roller-coaster feeling. It's still worth seeing though, for McDowell and Ragsdale's return to the characters, I for one, will mostly remember them for. Stephen Geoffreys also deserves a mention for his OTT performance as Charlie's manic best friend, Evil Ed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is perhaps the best vampire film I've ever seen. The directing managed to extrapolate optimum acting from the stars and produce a neatly condensed, funny and interesting picture without being pretentious.Credit must go to Sarandon who is mesmerising even though he cannot help playing the part "tongue in cheek". He is nevertheless the perfect archetypal vampire. His suave and debonair manner (oozing experience), and ice-cold dark glare left every woman (well me anyway!) drooling - a refreshing change from the usual nerd we have to settle for in most films! Indeed, his charisma suffocated the attempts of McDowell, who was nevertheless impressive as the cowardly charlatan, and Ragsdale, who suffered mainly from a poor script.Geoffreys was funny though bordered on the annoying. Bearse was surprisingly refreshing by managing to avoid posing throughout the whole film and shows obvious talent as a natural comedian. However, she and Sarandon looked completely incompatible. Stark spoiled the film by clumsily acting a part he was blatantly not suited for, even if his presence only served to highlight Sarandon's superior quality. He looked more like a bank manager than an evil henchman!Make-up mainly contributed to the comic side of the film through its sheer absurdity if nothing else. Soundtrack is lovably cheesy as any 80's flick should be! A timeless pic which can - and should be - watched again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I first saw that most defining of climactic screen battles, between Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in DRACULA (1958, a scene whose power has never been diminished or surpassed in the history of vampire films) I have always harbored a liking for the children of the night. Sadly, few films of this genre since, have been deserving of anything but scorn. Whilst Christopher Lee will always be the quintessential DRACULA (easily surpassing Bela Lugosi I'm afraid) many of the subsequent Hammer/Dracula films suffered from noticeably low budgets, laughable fx and embarrassing scripting. Since the 70's there have been three standouts FRIGHT NIGHT, THE LOST BOYS and my personal favorite, NEAR DARK (See my review)FRIGHT NIGHT had it all. An immensely powerful, sexy and stylish vampire in Chris Sarandon. The best soundtrack of pretty much any film I have ever heard. "Armies of the Night" and "The Beast Inside of You" are absolute rock classics..."Come to Me" is just magnetic. BUT, you need to hear the full versions directly off the CD!William Ragsdale is perfect as teenage Charlie Brewster who becomes Sarandon's worried neighbor and a very young Amanda Bearse as his girlfriend Amy. Roddy McDowall flutters around delightfully as the reluctant Peter Vincent - Vampire Killer who hosts his own TV show FRIGHT NIGHT. Who can forget Peter Jeffreys either as "Evil" ("Oh Brewster, you're sooo cool!")A standout is the nightclub scene where Amy is mesmerised by the vampire as Charlie attempts his doomed rescue mission! This is style PLUS!!!!! FRIGHT NIGHT 2 was almost as good but lacked the original flare displayed here by Tom Holland.This is great stuff...catch it!</fullReview>

His vampire was seductive in all senses of the word - all you have to do is watch the scene in the alley with him and Evil Ed to know what I'm talking about. "They won't laugh at you anymore, or beat you up. All you have to do is take my hand." What high school loser wouldn't have wanted to accept his offer?Some great lines:Dandridge: Hello, Charlie. I just trashed your car. But that's nothing compared to what I'm going to do to you ... tomorrow night.Dandridge: (cruelly mimics Peter Vincent's pompous delivery) Welllllcommmme to Fuh-right Night. (reverts to normal voice) For real.Dandrige: (contemptuously grabbing crucifix from Peter Vincent and tossing it away) You have to have FAITH for that to work with me, Mr. Vincent. Remember?Dandridge: I'm going to give you something I don't have ... a choice. If you forget about me, I'll forget about you.Vincent: You're ... out of time, Mr. Dandridge. Look over your shoulder. (Dandridge does so, seeing for the first time that the dawn's first rays are coming through the window)Not to mention some terrific "bits":Peter Vincent's understandable but regrettably misplaced assumption that, because Jerry Dandridge's companion can walk around in daylight, he's human and will be vulnerable to bullets.Jerry Dandridge whistling "Strangers in the Night" as he pays a nocturnal visit to Charlie's house.Amy dancing with Dandridge at the nightclub and realizing to her horror that she can only see HER reflection in the club's mirror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike the "Hellraiser", "Friday the 13th", "Nightmare on Elm Street", and other very weak (and extremely violent) horror flicks that tried to be like John Carpenter's "Halloween". Tom Holland's "Fright Night" isn't about a wimpy teen who is dealing with a mad slasher, instead of a slasher, a vampire is the opposing force.The story starts out like any other bad horror movie, and one night where Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) overhears a scream next door. He knows that someone has been killed not to far away from his house. The next day, he sees that two men, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) and Billy Cole (Jonathon Stark) have moved into the house right next to his place. Charley gets the thought that one of the two new neighbors is a vampire and he calls the cops, but they don't believe him. Now Charley gets a threat from the vampire and it's for real. His girlfriend, Amy (Amanda Beasre) and his best friend, "Evil" Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) also think Charley has lost his mind. So Charley has one last option, try Peter Vincent, who claims to be a great vampire killer in the movies.We first see Peter Vincent (portrayed fairly well by the late Roddy McDowall), who was a B-movie actor and now is fired as host of the last night creature features. When Charley tells Peter that he needs his help, Peter tells Charley that people don't believe in vampires anymore and that they want to see a slasher hacking up teenagers. That line is the film's main point. Charley fails to convince Peter, but Ed and Amy don't. That moment sets up the movie's second half, which is better than the first as Charley and Peter come into the house and the showdown that the duo with Jerry and Billy, who are both vampires is great. I have to give some credit to Richard Edlund, who also did the visual effects for "Ghostbusters" and the effects here are astounding. Brad Fiedel composes a very good musical score. The performances by Saradon and McDowall are fairly good, but Ragsdale and Stephen Geoffreys are spectacular here. Geoffreys is very funny here and also makes a good attempt at being a vampire.</fullReview>

His grades are going down, his circle of friends have become a triangle and love-life... floating out the window. His life is a complete bore until one night he witnesses an act of near sexual seduction changing into an innocent woman about to be bitten by the new next-door neighbor Jerry Dandrige, whom it turns out is none other than a vampire. Th kid calls the police. The police don't believe him. So, Brewster turns to a fictional vampire slayer Peter Vincent, his on and off girlfriend Amy and his horror-fanatic classmate to help rid the unwanted neighbor.This movie, unlike the rest before it kicks a fair amount of butt when it comes to the vampire/dead teen genre. There are solid performances from all the main characters, a fairly decent script, a cool soundtrack and wonderful vampire effects.Definitely a movie that will easily please vampire fans who are wanting a night of frights, jumps and scares.My rating for "Fright Night" ****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fright Night, a film most famous for being aired at one or two in the morning on Friday nights, actually serves to poke fun at movies in that genre. However, it turns out to be a very capable horror film filled with excellent performances, production values, and special effects. This movie works hard to take the subject of vampirism seriously, but all the while, poking tremendous fun at it. It follows the mythos to a genuine and romantic fault, and creates a memorable screen villain who is actually unstoppable despite his numerous weaknesses. William Ragsdale is fine as our young hero who finds the next door neighbor's late night affairs a bit too rich for his blood. But look for Roddy McDowall's role as Peter Vincent, a fictitious movie star vampire killer, and Chris Sarandon's Jerry Dandrige, the malevolent "spawn of Satan", as the scene stealers. Yes, Fright Night is the greatest vampire movie ever. It succeeds where many, such as the Lost Boys, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Interview With A Vampire, have failed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not all 80's movies were that bad. This vampire movie was very chilling and exciting. It begins with a teenage boy named Charley Brewster who finds that he is expecting a new neighbor in his town. It just so happens that his neighbor is a vampire. It turns out that this neighbor is also the murderer of several people that recently appeared on the news. Unfortunately, the vampire has a friend that can back him up during the daytime. So when Charley called the police, they of coarse don't believe him. Charley then seeks help from his horror icon Peter Vincent the expert on vampires. Roddy McDowell did an excellent job playing his role as Peter Vincent. He had just of a great personality as the typical Van Helsing in other vampire flicks. This guy is fun, loving, and very intelligent. Overall, the action is fun, the story is pretty sweet, and the special effects and make up are fun to look at. My only regret is looking at those fake teeth. I mean, that is not what charming vampires have. The turned vampires in this film looked more monstrous than human and that just gives too much away. Probably just as bad as Edward Cullen's cover up in the Twilight series. In conclusion, this film is fun to watch and I recommend it to any horror fan. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun horror comedy, with good special effects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fright Night' is, when you look at it, a horror comedy with every cliché of the genre in it. And that's the whole idea I guess.The story begins as a kind of a 'Rear Window' take, when young Charley (William Ragsdale) notices his new neighbor is carrying a coffin in his cellar. Soon after that he learns, that a woman he saw going into the mans apartment has been found dead. He starts to believe, that the man is a vampire, but of course no-one believes him, so Charley has to ask a horror specialist, Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) to help him before it's too late.Out of the cast MacDowall does the best job. After him comes, of course, the vampire, Chris Sarandon, though in the end it's pretty much the cause of the good special effects. Young Amanda Bearse does a nice role as a mandatory virgin girlfriend. The most annoying cast member has to be Stephen Geoffreys as "Evil" Ed, as he does his bit a bit too extreme.The special effects of the film are great and have been taken the stand of time relatively well. The transformations are very fluent and gruesome. Surprisingly enough the movie isn't, even though it's made in the heart of the 80's, in your face screaming "look this is the 80's". Of course there are the clothes and the music and the hairdo's, but somehow they aren't in your face, like they were in 'The Lost Boys' for example.'Fright Night' is perfectly good way to spend a couple of hours, if you want to see some horror and some comedy. Well directed film, with good enough cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally 80's guilty pleasure!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night Horror/Horror-ComedyRecently, I found this "classic" horror film on my cable company's "On Demand" set-up, and, bored out of my mind, I gave it a shot. Of the three movies I wasted an evening watching, this was easily the most entertaining.We have Charlie, plucky teenage hero, of the film who just happens to live next door to what he believes is a vampire (Chris Sarandon--that detective from Child's Play). Sexy women (only two of which we actually get to see) are mysteriously vanishing around the area and our young hero is out to stop the evil vampire. He attempts to enlist Roddy McDowell, who plays a "vampire hunter" movie &amp; television star to help. And Charlie's girlfriend is Amanda Bearse. Marcy Darcy from "Married with Children."Here's the breakdown:The Good:--Very simply, this movie is a lot of fun. From the characters to the action sequences to the cinematography--pretty much everything, this movie is just a good time.--For the most part, the acting was actually pretty good, and the characters were believable and generally enjoyable.--Good dialog and conversations.--Nice pacing.--Entertaining action sequences and gore. Some good (though not exactly great all the time) suspense, as well.--Strong atmosphere and really nice cinematography.--During the climax of the movie, Amanda Bearse is fvcking hot. Who knew she could look that good? Too bad she's a lesbian, am I right guys? Ha!Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The special effects, and vampire make-up, were at times pretty laughable. Generally, the effects were pretty good, but about average for the time. Sometimes, the attempt to make scary make-up ended up looking cheesy or rubbery.--Wacky "totally radical 80's" music. That part New Wave, part Rock, part Pop music that was often creamily spread over movies from the 80's also permeates this movie. But hell, I'll take cheesy 80's Rock over Rap or Hip-Hop in a horror movie any day!--Somewhat "loose" writing here and there. Generally, very enjoyable and entertaining, but occasionally you'll have moments of head scratching where you'll be wondering "why not just do this or that?" Watch it, you'll see what I mean.The Bad:--Charlie's best friend is one of the 80's most obnoxious teenage characters. On a plus side, he's actually played by a teenager and not some 29-year old nimrod desperate to hold on to his youth. Occasionally, the kid is also very amusing--which creates kind of a love/hate relationship between him and the viewer. And that laugh is just awful.--The term "Fright Night" is said about a million times.The Ugly:--Roddy McDowell's "Joe Bob Briggs" type TV show--"Frrrrrrright Niiiiiiiiiiiight." Still funny, though.Memorable Scene:--Roddy versus the wolf.Acting: 8/10 Story: 8/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Character Development: 8/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 6/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 (prostitutes and quick breasts) Violence/Gore: 7/10 (average for the time) Dialogue: 9/10 Music: 8/10 (zany 80's Rock!) Direction: 8/10 Cheesiness: 3/10 Crappiness: 0/10 Overall: 8/10 I was originally going to give this a "7," but realized just how much fun the movie actually was. So it gets an "8." Bear in mind, though, this won't be for everyone--what with the teenagers, sometimes silly special effects, and radical 80's tunes. But, it is a great guilty pleasure--and it's for people that enjoy horror films of this nature. A rare horror film that manages to actually be fun without forgetting that it is a horror film.www.ResidentHazard.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great vampire thriller/comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FRIGHT NIGHT is a wonderful blend of horror-fantasy and day-to-day life reality. What would you do if you thought a vampire lived (un-lived?) next door? Charlie Brewster's dilemma is just that simple, until it's complicated by the fact that the vampire knows he knows. What follows is a great romp through everyone's disbelief, punctuated by the seriously scary moves of Jerry Dandridge, the vampire. Peter Vincent, the broken-down vampire-movie actor, is nailed by veteran Roddy McDowell. He almost steals the show (and well he could), but instead he plays his part as a major member of the ensemble, just as he should. This film is a must-have for any vampire movie collector.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pure timeless 80's cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the first time I have ever heard of this movie it was by reading loads of pulp horror magazines back in the 90's that lead me to be enthralled into seeing it and when I rented it on home video cassette I was amazed on how brilliant it is and the bonus was having the celebrated legendary late and great Roddy McDowall playing the formidable peter Vincent in which it was an combination of peter Cushing and Vincent Price and how it took the whole concept of voyeurism to the next level that's where Charlie Brewster played by William Ragsdale and girlfriend Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse) comes in during an night of watching late Friday night horror films and love making that's where for Brewster his morbid fascination of peeping on the house next door begins by accusing neighbour Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon)for being an murdering fiend which lead to an confrontation with him one night by warning Brewster of due to the abhorrent theme of the boy that cried wolf scenario with this movie with stellar soundtrack and effects aplenty this movie sure holds up today and ages well like an fine wine 10/10 rating.FRANKIE HOLTZMANN SMALESALIENBUGSTOMPERFAN</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun vampire spoof ably mixes the laughs and gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FRIGHT NIGHT, one of the essential vampire horror films of the '80s, succeeds in being a far better spoof of the vampire genre than Polanski's THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS. Whereas Polanski's film tried too hard to be funny, FRIGHT NIGHT lets the horror and comedy flow in equal amounts, and often the two feed off each other to produce this enjoyable and campy tribute to the vampire film. Horror film addicts (like myself) will enjoy the many references to other vampire films of the past. McDowall has a portrait of Bela Lugosi on his wall, and there are many clips of horror films playing on television sets, from THE PREMATURE BURIAL to THE SCARS OF Dracula. Even the theme of vampires not being destroyed unless the protagonist has absolute faith, explored in Dracula HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE, turns up again here.The cast all do good jobs in their roles, and happily this time the female heroine (who looks strangely like Stockard Channing in GREASE) has more to do than sit around in a flimsy negligee and scream (although, unsurprisingly, she does both during the course of the film). William Ragsdale is likable as the hero who nobody believes and whom everyone thinks is merely paranoid, a theme resurfacing these days in the world of conspiracies. Chris Sarandon is a cool and suave vampire, and acquits himself well with the role, putting across a sense of raw power and hypnotism, just like Christopher Lee did before him.Stephen Geoffreys is memorably nerve-wracked as Evil Ed, however it is Roddy McDowall who is the real star of the film, as fading star Peter Vincent (obviously reference to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price here). He looks the role perfectly, and is great as the rather timid hero who doesn't actually believe in vampires and turns white at the thought. While the plot of the film is nothing particularly new (and a lot like that of THE 'BURBS), it stays fresh and frantic enough to never delve into the clichéd territory of THE LOST BOYS.The makeup is also remarkable, with the spiky fangs and coloured contact lenses being very similar to the makeup job done in the two Italian DEMONS films. In some instances the vampires even look quite scary, which is no mean feat. There are also two excellent disintegration scenes which are worth tuning in for. The shots of a skeleton burning and melting against a wall look very strange and different, I'm not sure if these were animated or not but they certainly stand out from the other rubbery offerings we have come to expect from '80s horror films.With a wry nod to the horror genre in general (McDowall remarks that nobody wants to see vampire films anymore, instead preferring ski-masked killers murdering virgins) and a tongue definitely in cheek, FRIGHT NIGHT is a fun film which deserves the status it has as a minor classic. Well worth seeking out if you're a vampire fan. A sequel, imaginatively titled FRIGHT NIGHT 2, followed a couple of years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy '80s Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would you do if your neighbor was a vampire? Naturally you would think you are crazy, but if it was true then it's your problem. This is the situation protagonist Charley Brewster finds himself in when his suspicions about his new neighbor, Jerry Dandridge, turns out to an actual bloodsucker. In the lead role of Charley is a pretty neurotic William Ragsdale who is relatively convincing as a teenager. You feel bad for him as Charley goes through normal teenage drama with a pesky friend who belittles him constantly, relationship issues with his girlfriend and a distant relationship with his single mother. When his suspicions are laughed at, we feel that maybe Charley is being ridiculous until he is confronted by Jerry and we know the vampire accusation is no joke. As the film's vampire we are treated to an equally charming and sinister performance by Chris Sarandon. He oozes charm when Jerry is formally introduced to the main character and us, the viewers, after Charley has made his accusation to his friends and mother. Sarandon ups his ante when Jerry threatens Charley to stay silent that we the viewers are as terrified as Charley is. There are various scenes throughout the film that make us both fear Jerry, but are also seduced by his sex appeal. Yet we cheer for the vampire to meet his maker in the end like a traditional horror fan.The film's score lends the atmosphere a creepy vibe as the viewer feels stalked by an unseen presence, our hearts feel adrenaline rush during a tense scene or we are drawn into an odd sense of contentment. The makeup effects are put to good limited use to make the film's vampires look unappealing. They are not attractive creatures in their true form, but rather hideous creatures of the night. With piercing glowing yellow eyes (contacts worn by the actors), sharp yellowing fangs, monstrous facial expressions and the shape-shifting ability to transform into a bat. We are repulsed by these undead beings when their real selves are shown to us.The film is not completely, but is a fun horror flick for Halloween or anytime you need a good scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic horror vampire flick better than remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night (1985) is an awesome true classic vampire horror film that is written and directed by Tom Holland him self. I love the remake, but I just love the original much better. In here you have monsters, a real vampires and werewolves in it. Chris Sarandon did a wonderful job as Jerry Dandridge a vampire by night. I love the make up and I love how they were portraying a vampire in this movie. Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) is a turned werewolves at the end of the film and he is staked by Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall). Fright Night (1985) is one of my favorite vampire horror flicks, I love vampire movies and this film is for me. The remake is a good film, but they aren't portraying real monsters and werewolves like they do in this movie. I am pretty sure if the new movie would portrayed such a monsters, werewolves like in here, I am pretty sure the movie would be better! The end was perfect and awesome how Charley and Peter are fighting Jerry, I love how Vincent and Charley are smashing in all the basement windows, allowing the sunlight to hit Dandridge. Using a mirror, they reflect the sunlight and finally manage to kill Dandridge by blasting him with the rays and he bursts into flames and within seconds his body is reduced to dust and bones. That scene was awesome!I love Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent the great Vampire Killer! Seriously this movie kick ass! Roddy McDowall kicks ass in this slasher vampire film! I love everything about this film, that it is in it! My all time favorite vampire movie ever, a classic, the remake doesn't even come close to matching it. Chris Sarandon was perfect as Jerry Dandridge the next door neighbor vampire, nothing will ever change my mind about this one, no vampire movie since this one has ever matched it, movie or series!! Fright Night is a ultimate classic a classic film that I will always cherish it to death! The special effects are great in this one. This film not only has vampires, werewolves and monsters in it, it also has a virgins, it has Roddy Mcdowell in one of his best performances. It has Prince Humperdink/Jack Skelenton as the baddie. It is quotable, self-aware way before Joss Whedon/Kevin Williamson, and funny as hell. The weakest link, although she still gives a very good performance, is Amanda Bearse AKA Marcy Darcy from Married with Children as the sexpot (could be bonus if you are so inclined), object of desire. It's hard not to look nor listen to her, without waiting for an Al Bundy insult, but there is some consolation when she "turns". Watch it and love it, this is what comedy-horror is all about. This is a great movie. I wouldn't say it scared me to death but it's good and creepy, it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again. GREAT FILM! Our heroes are a motley group of characters, the straight-laced boy next door who no one believes, the bookish girl crush who is coveted by all, the monster-fan geek, and a most wonderful touch with Roddy McDowall playing a washed-up horror actor similar to character actors such as Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee/Vincent Price. Bottom of line I love this film, it is one of my favorite Vampire horror slasher films, I also love the remake, tough it even can't hold a candle to this film. Meet Jerry Dandridge. He's sweet, sexy, and he likes to sleep in late. You might think he's the perfect neighbor. But before inviting Jerry in for a nightcap, there's just one thing you should know. Jerry prefers his drinks warm, red and straight from the jugular! It's Fright Night, a horrific howl starring Chris Sarandon as the seductive vampire and William Ragsdale as the frantic teenager struggling to keep Jerry's deadly fangs out of his neck. Only 17-year-old Charley Brewster (Ragsdale) knows Jerry's bloodcurdling secret. When Charley can't get anybody to believe him, he turns to TV horror host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who used to be the "Great Vampire Killer" of the movies. Can these mortals save Charley and his sweetheart Amy (Amanda Bearse) from the wrathful bloodsucker's toothy embrace? If you love being scared, Fright Night...will give you the nightmare of your life. That is the main plot in the remake they don't even mentioned Jerry's last Surname. I love this film to death! It is my favorite best horror slasher film, the rating I am giving tot his film is 10/10. This film deserves it! Tom Holland thank you for so beautiful wonderful horror vampire film, big cheers and thank you! Fright Night is a 1985 American horror film written and directed by Tom Holland and produced by Herb Jaffe. It stars William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowall, and Amanda Bearse. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures Starring: Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse, Stephen Geoffreys, Roddy McDowall Director: Tom Holland Producer: Herb Jaffe Writer: Tom Holland Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 46 Mins.

		<shortDescription>Exposing the Clichés.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night (1985): Dir: Tom Holland / Cast: William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowell, Amanda Bearse, Stephen Geoffreys: One of the great vampire films and this one addresses and exposes all the clichés. William Ragsdale plays teenager Charley Brewster who believes that his next door neighbor is a vampire. Chris Sarandon plays charming Jerry Dandridge who threatens Charley's life until an even bigger counter arrives in the form of TV star Peter Vincent, Vampire Slayer. Roddy McDowell adds humour and exploits the clichés. He is approached by Charley for help but doesn't believe him until a visit to prove Dandridge human goes wrong when he fails to cast a reflection in Vincent's mirror. Director Tom Holland highlights the film with ominous lighting and seductive music. Well written screenplay that isn't too complicated but has witty characters. Ragsdale plays off the nervous determination of Charley. Sarandon is a dominating presence as Dandridge. McDowell as Vincent must face the reality of TV props verses the rules of vampire lore. He must face his greatest fear without it being staged. Amanda Bearse plays Charley's frustrated girlfriend Amy who is targeted by Dandridge. Finally there is the cackling laugh of best pal Evil Ed, played by Stephen Geoffreys who turns into a wolf. Creepy and fun vampire film where clichés highlight the fright when the screams echo next door. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a horror buff, and real horror fans would consider this ridiculously weak tea, but I thought that it was an excellent campy 80s horror flick. It's the "Rear Window" of vampire movies with decent special effects, mild violence and gore by today's standards, and a clever plot line. The acting is very good throughout and it keeps moving from beginning to end. This film is just the ticket for those of us who like our horror on the very light side. If that includes you, you should consider giving this one a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fright Night is a film that moved away from the exploitation horror excess which seemed to populate the early 1980s with the advent of home video to a genre of campy horror which mixed laughs with chills.It also has the genre tropes of teenage horror including a slightly dorky boy trying to make out wit a hot girlfriend you know will fall prey to the vampire.Charley Brewster notices that there is something unusual with his new neighbour, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon.) There is that coffin being dragged into the house and the man trying to take a bite out of a woman late at night. Charley has seen it all but nobody believes him that Dandridge might be a vampire.Now Dandridge is after him and means to silence him forever. Charley enlists the help of school friend Billy Cole and later renowned vampire hunter Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) but Vincent is a bit of a fraud and Dandridge has set his sights on Charley's girlfriend.Sarandon is actually rather chilling as the vampire and also oozes sexual charisma. Although I saw the remake of Fright Night first and I felt that Colin Farrell adds more layers to his vampire, he initially wants to be Charley's friend in the remake and help him out. In this film the villain is antagonistic almost straightaway.McDowall has a hoot of a time as Vincent, the man who is exposed as a ham and fraud but finds the strength of character to fight back. Jonathan Stark also puts on a good turn as Billy Coles the friend who succumbs to Dandridge's bite.The film has a mixture of good and cheesy special effects. The film is not very frightening but does provide a few chills, some violence and gore with plenty of camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Vampire Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Suspenseful And Funny Horror/Comedy Cult Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night is one of the greatest Vampire films ever made,an excellent,suspenseful and funny Horror/Comedy that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a fine script,a wonderful score and soundtrack and memorable special effects. All of those elements make Fright Night not only a Cult Classic but also one of the best Horror films of the 1980s.Fright Night tells the story of Charley Brewster(William Ragsdale),a teenager who discovers that his next door neighbor Jerry Dandridge(Chris Sarandon)is a vampire that's killing people but Charley can't prove it because no one believes him. Running out of options,Charley turns to Horror actor and Television host Peter Vincent(Roddy McDowall)for help and to take down Jerry Dandridge.During the big and successful Horror movie boom of the 1980s the Vampire genre was making a comeback and during the comeback they're were three Vampire films that were true standouts and in my opinion The Big Three Vampire films of the 1980s such as Joel Shmumacher's excellent and thrilling The Lost Boys(1987),Kathryn Bigelow's brilliant and unforgettable Near Dark(also in 1987)and last but not least Tom Holland's Fright Night(1985),an outstanding and entertaining Horror/Comedy that was a Box office success,but also became a Cult Classic and is one of the most memorable Horror movies of the 1980s. From beginning to end Fright Night is an amazing Horror film that is the true definition of a thrill ride and is a movie that strikes a wonderful balance between suspense and laughs giving viewers a fun movie that is gripping and funny but doesn't take itself to seriously and where everything just works. Where as The Lost Boys and Near Dark were films that took Vampire movies into new directions Writer-Director Tom Holland gives Fright Night a classic,old school tone taking the style and influences of the Universal Horror movies of the 1930s and 40s as well as the Hammer films of the 1950s and 60s and puts the style into a modern day setting(circa 1985)that makes the movie feel fresh and creative while still giving viewers all of the known and familiar trademarks of the Vampire genre(crosses,sunlight etc.). What I also enjoy about Fright Night is that despite being set in the 1980s there is a timeless feeling to the movie where it feels like the story could've taken place in any decade or anytime. Another thing that makes Fright Night so great is that the movie never says where in what City,Town or state this movie takes place in. Is it in the big cities of Los Angeles or New York or in a small town in the Midwest? It's a question that will never be answered and one of the best things about the film. The main characters in Fright Night(Charley Brewster,Jerry Dandridge,Peter Vincent,Amy,Evil Ed)in Fright Night are all memorable and fascinating and are given enough screen time to make the movie more intense,wild and funny with a lot of over the top moments. The Comedy and Humor in Fright Night is funny and smart thanks to Holland's great screenplay which is filled with clever dialog and moments as well as nods to Horror films and actors of the past(the character Peter Vincent is named after genre icons Vincent Price and Peter Cushing). While Fright Night isn't a serious Horror film there are plenty of moments of atmosphere and terror thanks to the Vampire moments and the atmosphere with the smoke and lighting that is around long enough to put viewers on the edge of their seats. Horror and Humor go together well in this film. While Fright Night isn't very gory or bloody there are a few moments in the movie where blood and goo comes out and it is effective. The ending of Fright Night is sensational and intense with tons of special effects and moments of insanity and mayhem that just never stops. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is wonderful. Chris Sarandon is excellent and unforgettable as Jerry Dandridge,one of the greatest Vampire characters in the history of Horror films. Sarandon is charismatic,mysterious and suave commands the film every time he's on screen. William Ragsdale is terrific as Charley Brewster,the hero of the film. Roddy McDowall is brilliant and at his best as Peter Vincent,a Horror actor and television host. Amanda Bearse(of Married...With Children fame)is amusing and cute as Amy,Charley's girlfriend. Stephen Geoffreys is fantastic and hilarious as Evil Ed,Charley's quirky best friend. Jonathan Stark is great as Billy Cole,Jerry's assistant. Dorothy Fielding(Judy Brewster)and Art Evans(Detective Lennox)give good performances as well.The direction by Tom Holland is outstanding,with Holland always moving the camera and giving the movie a haunting and beautiful style and look to the film. Great direction,Holland.The score by Brad Fiedel is sensational,haunting,memorable and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Amazing score,Fiedel. There is also a wonderful soundtrack that includes songs by J. Geils Band(Fright Night),Devo(Let's Talk),Sparks(Armies Of The Night),Ian Hunter(Good Man In A Bad Time),Evelyn 'Champagne' King(Give It Up),Brad Fiedel(Come To Me)and more.The Special Make-up and Practical Effects are fantastic,realistic and at times gory and truly add to the film. Wonderful effects.In final word,if you love Horror Films or Vampire Movies,I highly suggest you see Fright Night,one of the greatest Vampire films ever made and a Cult Classic you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly this is not a genre that I am such a fan of (Horror comedy). I generally have not liked any movies from this genre that much. I decided to check out this one since I always give the classics a chance no matter what. There are certain aspects that elevate this movie about 80s cheesy mediocrity. One thing is of course Chris Sarandon. He is an absolutely smoldering hot man. OK that sounded gay but I don't care. Every time he is on screen, he is able to pierce through your soul. Nobody could do this role better than him. I heard of the remake and there is no way Colin farrell (who I don't like that much anyway) could be that sexy. There are many sexy scenes in this one. But don't expect too much nudity, it is no Jess Franco vampire movie. But it is sexy without showing too much, which is quite an achievement.Another point is the soundtrack. I just discovered that Brad fiedel did the soundtrack which stunned me because it seems a few of my favourite soundtracks of the 80s were by him (Terminator, Just before dawn and others). He doesn't disappoint here. The music is absolutely perfect for the sexy scenes and is appropriate for the creepier scenes as well. Just for your reference, there is a club scene and a sex scene (well not entirely) which show how perfect the music is. Another thing I liked is the level of comedy in the movie. It is more of a smart horror movie with clever lines (not the Joss whedon type) than a slapstick horror comedy. The comedy gets lesser towards the end and becomes more of a serious horror movie. Even with some dark humor, it doesn't seem distracting enough. Roddy mcdowall excels as the actor who is suddenly thrust into this situation. His lines were quite funny especially his line about slashers. An additional point which many ignore when it comes to this movie is the performance of Jonathan Stark who is quite creepy in his role as Billy, the assistant. This character, even when being overshadowed by Dandridge, presents a silent menace. One of the creepier elements of this movie. Even with all the comedic elements, it doesn't skimp on the atmosphere and there are certain scenes which are quite impressive, like the scene with the wolf and the scene when Dandridge comes to warn Charley.Overall I loved it and to be honest, it is maybe only the second comedy horror that I like after Scream.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Light with Bite...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the previews of FRIGHT NIGHT promised more than the movie itself delivered, it's still not a bad example of one of the better Horror Lights. William Ragsdale as Charlie is very good, and Chris Sarandon as The Vampire fairly OOZES with creepy charm, and it was always good to see Roddy McDowall on The Big Screen, but "Evil Ed" chews the scenery so badly every time he's on screen that one can't help but wish he'd just tone it down a notch or two (or three). The fx were (and still are) worth the price of admission and there are moments of sheer brilliance when it comes to mood (the scene where Charlie voyeuristically witnesses the murder of a young women, for instance), but the bottom line is that FRIGHT NIGHT is still Horror Light. The mix of Humor and Horror is handled well, however; the movie's a mixed bag, appropriate enough for what's essentially a Halloween offering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(57%) A refreshing change of pace to the mass of typical slasher movies that the period threw out which this actually mocks at one point. The plot is simple stuff centred around a vampire moving in next door to a typical suburban family, the teenage son gets suspicious after witnessing some goings on with some late night coffin dealings, so he contacts TV horror host Roddy McDowall to help him out. Its good points involve the likable cast, solid direction, and some great practical effects. And even though this isn't one of my favourite of the 80's horrors, it's still a cut above the average lot and should be tracked down by all vampire film fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lot of bite . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fright Night' presents the logical notion that vampires are safe because kids these days don't believe in them. That's probably why the villain in the film can live incognito. If the movies keep kids watching horror movies featuring a nut in a hockey mask then he can go about his nasty business without a problem.Unfortunately, this vampire has settled into a house next to a teenager with two things that could blow his cover: a belief in vampires and a good pair of binoculars. Suspecting that the evidence is piling up (people go in the house and don't come and the next day a lot of garbage bags are left by the roadside) young Brewster (William Rasdale) doesn't just suspect something is up, he is sure of it.He calls the cops who tell him that he is crazy and give him a warning not to snooping around the nice man's home. The kid has but one place to turn: aging horror movie host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell). Vincent was once a B-movie actor and most recently the host of the local midnight movie until he got fired because the films he is showing are passe. He is an expert on vampires and would like to tell the kid to stop wasting his time but he is out of work and needs the money that young Brewster is offering.That leads inevitably to a special effects showdown with the vampire, which are again miles ahead of the normal genre movies. This time, thanks to the special effects wizardry of Richard Edlund who has done special effects for everything from 'Ghostbusters' to the 'Star Wars' trilogy to 'Poltergeist', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Ghost', 'Die Hard' and 'Air Force One'. So this isn't low budget cheese. There is a lot a talent here and it shows on screen.Fright Night is directed by Tom Holland who is almost alone among horror directors who look beyond the constraints of the genre and tries new things. He isn't satisfied with a by-the-numbers plot. He was the mind behind the ingenious 'Child's Play' and he wrote the little seen curiosity 'Scream for Help'. But this is his best film.They did a smart thing casting two perfect actors. The first is Chris Sarandon who does a wonderful job as the knowledgeable vampire who is onto young Brewster right from the start. I liked the scene where he handles the cop's questions with a smile and a simple explanation for everything. The other is Roddy McDowell. He puts himself completely into the role of Peter Vincent who hams it up on T.V. and then just as much in the showdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>loving treatment of B-movie vampire horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) is a hardcore horror fan. One night while with girlfriend Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse), he notices two men carrying a coffin into the house next door. Later, he hears a scream from a prostitute next door who is reported dead the next day. After witnessing Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) with fangs killing another girl, Charlie is convinced that he's a vampire. Neither his mother nor Amy believe him. Police detective Lennox (Art Evans) investigates but Dandridge's human companion Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) covers it all up and Lennox quickly dismisses Charlie's vampire rant. Not even his best friend jokester Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) or the horror host and actor Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) believe him. In desperation, Amy hires the recently fired Vincent to end Charlie's delusion.This is a loving homage to all the B-movie horrors. Amanda Bearse gives this a couple of funny moments. Roddy McDowall is nothing less than perfect. Chris Sarandon has just the right creepiness without being the cliché Dracula. William Ragsdale is fine as the harrowed teenager although I do wish he was younger. This movie takes the old vampire horror genre and give it an adoring suburban treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic vampire premise meets the glory of the '80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor Charley Brewster? he's got a problem. See, the tall, dark, and handsome Jerry Dandridge has just moved into the rundown Victorian house next door; beautiful women come to the house, and are found decapitated by the river shortly after. Oh, and Jerry has fangs. And claws. But nobody believes Charley, not even his goodhearted girlfriend, Amy. And why should they?"Fright Night" is a film that very quietly lurked underneath my radar for years? as an ardent horror fan, it was one film that, when asked about, I'd always say I hadn't seen. People were often surprised, or appalled, even friends who were non-horror fans who had seen it. What took me so long? This is a great flick. The plot is relatively straightforward and takes its cues from classic vampire stories, but its injection with '80s charm lends the film an unusual retro feel that seems both modern and timeless. Writer/director Tom Holland's script is tight and engaging, following the vampire routine while still working toward surprises along the way. Quirky humor is scattered throughout the film, most prevalent in Charley and Amy's lover's spat and Charley's loudmouth single mom who assumes that new neighbor Jerry is "probably gay, with her luck." "Fright Night" is still a horror film by all means, though these unusually charming moments of humor? as well Charley's struggle to convince those around him that he's dealing with a vampire? give the film a lightness that is reminiscent of '80s and early '90s Halloween television films (though it's considerably gorier, showing off some "Evil Dead"-esque special effects in the finale).One of the film's greatest strengths lies its lively performances: William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse are quintessential '80s teenagers and make one of the most charming pairs in a horror film, while hunky Chris Sarandon lights the screen up as the slick and handsome man next- door who's killing local prostitutes and apparently sleeps in a coffin in the cellar. Roddy McDowall is another great asset to the film, playing the kooky horror television host whom Charley seeks out to help slay a real-life vampire. Overall, "Fright Night" is one of the more delightful '80s vampire romps that is both lightly amusing as well as suspenseful and substantially gory in the decade's fashion. The film's reliance on the textbook components of the vampire film provide it a timeless feel that is charming and engaging. Is it scary? No, not really; but it's got all the makings of a well- rounded teen horror flick with splashes of black humor and a memorable cast that do a remarkable job bringing the script to life (or maybe death). 9/10.</fullReview>

It's better than Dracula. This is an all-time classic. I wan't to see it's sequel Fright Night Part II. Jerry Dandridge is the best vampire better than these toothy goblins from From Dusk till Dawn.

		<shortDescription>Like 80s to the Max</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah the awesome 80s... J Geils Band, Devo, hair gel &amp; bad perms, nerds, high school kids wearing blazers with patches on the elbows, topless nude scenes that never seem to go any further (on screen or off screen, ugh!) and of course the modern reboot of the 100-year-old vampire story. Yes, you'll get all of those in this movie.Although the classic vampire story has been told &amp; re-told every few years since "Nosferatu" in 1922, I wouldn't be surprised if "Fright Night" gave us the first incarnation of a suave, hip, cool vampire who bodes well with the teen crowd. In later years of course we would get "The Lost Boys" (1987), "Interview with the Vampire" (1994), Twilight (2008), and whatever might come next. But this might've given us the first pop vampire.Expertly played by Chris Sarandon (yes, Susan's husband in the 70s, but perhaps best known as the evil prince in The Princess Bride), we get a charming, sinister character whom we often find ourselves rooting for, instead of being repulsed by. Think of it... when, prior to the 80s, did we get a monster whom we can idolize? In that context, this is truly groundbreaking. Chris brings to the role a cool, comedic wit and interesting quirks, not in the original script, such as his character's obsession with fruit (his nod to the majority of bat species who are actually vegetarian fruit eaters, go figure). This and other interesting idiosyncrasies, not to mention impeccable fashion sense, result in a unique, fleshed-out, "human" monster. The role is played with tremendous magnetic appeal, perhaps like the original Dracula in the book who can hypnotize his hapless victims into a state of mind-numbed participation.And speaking of mind-numbed participation, that's precisely what the audience might need for a while. For the first 30 mins or so, the story is preposterous, bordering on irritating (with the standard 80s "nobody believes me that people are getting brutally murdered!" premise). But if you can make it past that, I guarantee it gets interesting, comical, suspenseful, witty, sentimental and ultimately impressive.Definitely the minute Roddy McDowell makes his appearance, things get notched up. He plays the washed up actor "Peter Vincent", a lovable old anachronism who gripes how classic Victorian horror is now passé: "Apparently your generation doesn't want to see vampire killers anymore, nor vampires either. All they want to see are slashers running around in ski masks, hacking up young virgins!" That line itself introduces the theme that makes this film work. "Fright Night" is a modern throwback to the Victorian horror flicks that based their appeal on characters, not gore and special effects. The plot isn't just a simple "run from the killer" romp, but instead its like a chess game between vampires &amp; vampire killers, and each side is equally interesting to watch. There is one vampire-killing scene that's surprisingly emotional, and moments like that make this a great film to watch. Not just for thrills &amp; chills but for actual artistic content.Special effects? Minimal but quite convincing, even 30 years later. Most of the effects are transformations done with excellent makeup &amp; prosthetics... and TEETH. Egads, these are by far the most disturbing vampire teeth I've seen in any film. Blood itself, surprisingly not much. Again, it's a great throwback to the classic horror movies where violence is handled just off screen. And that's what makes "Fright Night" feel timeless. Soundtrack, wardrobes and hair styles notwithstanding...If you're a fan of this sort of experience, be sure to check out other 80s horror gems "Vamp" (sorta like "16 Candles" meets "13 Ghosts"), "The Hunger" (a very artistic vampire flick with Susan Sarandon, Catherine Deneuve and the great David Bowie) and the aforementioned "Lost Boys" (boasting one of the rockinest soundtracks of the 80s). In a different but related vein, an old gem worth checking out is "Targets" (1968) which is about a washed up horror film actor, played by Boris Karloff, who finds himself involved in a modern horror story of a mass shooter picking off people at random. I wouldn't be surprised if that one somehow inspired the writers of Fright Night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A teenage horror fan named Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) witnesses his new neighbor Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) growing fangs and feeding off of a helpless female victim, whose dead body is found days later. Unfortunately no one believes Charley's story about the undead murderer next door, not even his girlfriend Amy Peteron (Amanda Bearse) or his best friend "Evil" Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys). After being laughed at by the police, the troubled teen tries to enlist the help of former actor and TV show host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who doesn't believe him at first until he sees that Jerry Dandrige has no reflection in a mirror. After Jerry turns Evil Ed into a vampire and kidnaps Amy, Charley and Peter Vincent grab some wooden stakes and team up to stop the evil bloodsucker once and for all! Not only is this my favorite vampire movie but is also in my top five favorite horror films of all time! This highly entertaining 80's frightfest offers pretty much everything you could want from a scary movie featuring vampires. All the actors here are excellent in their roles. Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed steals every scene he's in with his over the top performance (especially after he becomes one of the undead) and Chris Sarandon as Jerry Dandrige is a very suave and charming villain who can be extremely frightening at the same time. In addition to the perfect casting, this film has just the right blend of suspense, scares, and humor to make for a very amusing and captivating watch. The only minor complaint I have about this movie involves a scene where Charley asks Evil Ed for advice on how to defeat a vampire, which makes no sense seeing as it was established earlier in the film that Charley is already an expert on the undead himself! That doesn't take any points off of this awesome movie however, which gets the perfect score of 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

David and Goliath or Wizard of Oz are only two references. but important is the joy of performance and the thriller slices. and, not less, the music. a film who seems, today, so common, than it is certainly original. after years, after horror waves and fashion, it preserves a delicate charm and , far from the preferences of a period or another, it is a pure classic, with all flavor of 1980 years.</fullReview>

Sure it's one of my favourite movies of all times.Great gore effects, romantic vampires, humor: these are the things that make it great! Starting with the "vampire next door" thing, that is so hilarious but, looking at it from the leading character, so terrible, going thru all the jokes and two-way situations, ending with the suspense created by a great Vampire only Mr Sarandon could create. You want a different Vampire movie? Forget twilight and look for fright night! You will laugh, you'll find romantic and sexy situations, things that make a horror movie so real! Sure Jerry is one of the most realistic vampires ever played on screen! And the fact that a teenager has to fight it is one of the funny things making it so remarkable!</fullReview>

I returned to his work and after watching the 2011 remake of this film I would say that the newer version is just slightly better.This film follows Charlie played by William Ragsdale who is a huge horror movie buff. He suspects that his new next door neighbor Jerry played by Chris Sarandon is a vampire. He enlists the help of a horror movie T.V. host named Peter Vincent played by Roddy Mcdowell to help eliminate his next door neighbor.This film I was disappointed I wanted more. But The acting is good, The special effects are amazing and the ending is great. But I think that the remake had a little more flare and a bigger spark to it.Rated R For Horror Violence And Language.1hr 46min/106min.4 uses of the F-word.***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first vampire movies I've ever seen and if I have to be honest one of the best! The storyline in this movie is great, a lot of vampire movies are boring at best. It takes Charley a lot of effort to convince his friends, and Mr. Vincent (the great vampire killer!), that his neighbor is indeed a vampire. One of the great things about this movie is that there is one main story, the hunt for Jerry Dandridge, and at least 4 different stories. The story of Charley and his obsession to kill Jerry, 'Evil' Ed, who's always the outsider, Amy, she reminds Jerry of his girlfriend, and last but not least Mr. Vincent, he lost his job and is losing his house and on top of that vampires are real! Every character has his own 'mission' to accomplish and that is the strongest part of this movie. And don't forget 'Evil' Ed's perfect punch line: "You're so cool Brewster!" Another great thing is the music from Brad Fiedel! That man deserve a medal! His song 'Come to me' is still rocking me, and it fits so good in the scene when Jerry bites, and turns, Amy. This is one the classic horror/vampire movies, you have to see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely creepy,...but not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tom Holland has been known to make some wicked horror films. He is best known for producing Child's Play (1988) but Fright Night is no different. It has its freaky and creepy moments too. However there are parts to this movie that could have been tweaked. And it's not like they're totally bad choices because it is a good movie. But those parts could have been replaced with something better if the producers were given the chance to.Fright Night is your typical teenage horror genre movie. A boy notices something supernatural and tries to tell the public about it and no one believes him. Worst of all, now that supernatural force is out to get him so no one will know the truth at all. In this case, the supernatural something that this boy notices is a vampire living next to his house. That plot line is creepy enough as it is. I don't think anyone would feel comfortable if that were to happen to him or her. The teenage boy, Charlie Brewster, is played by William Ragsdale and he's one of the flaws in this film. Ragsdale is good as the kid that he is, but I can't help but not feel any pity for him. Why? Because it was he who got himself into trouble with the vampire. He was spying on the vampire while feasting on his prey. Sorry but you don't go spying on others and expect to get away with it. Besides I really didn't care for his character either because of the nasally voice that he had. However, the vampire played by Chris Sarandon gives a redeeming performance for this movie. Sarandon's acting is so good that it really is hard to tell sometimes whether the vampire he's playing, is mean-spirited or just misunderstood.Getting help for Brewster is not easy until he decides to call upon a renowned Vampire slayer, Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall). Funny enough, even for him, Vincent has to confront with himself that Brewster's case is serious. The special effects are good too. It is fairly surprising for a 1985 film. The only other drawback this movie has, is that it never frightened me and it's not because the visuals weren't scary. It's that the movie never reached the psychological level where things can become truly terrifying and I never felt it. But nonetheless, this film is very creepy.The scares may not be all there but it will definitely evoke some good chills. Much of which the credit goes to Sarandon for his believable execution as a vampire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering 'Fright Night' is a film now over 25 years old it's still a great vampire flick, mainly because it doesn't take itself too seriously and also due to a great cast which are hugley engaging. The real star though is Roddy MacDowall, he brings just the right amount of hamminess, nobility and cowardice to 'TV vampire hunter Peter Vincent'. The film is filled with subtle references to past classic vampire movies, and does a great job of integrating vampire folklore into a world where everyone thinks vampires only exist in the movies. Overall, 'Fright Night' is a great film helped along by a witty and intelligent script, a classic 80's soundtrack and visual effects that still hold up well by today's standards, and to top it off a finale that'll knocks your socks off! If you're a horror fan this is a must see movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that never gets old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night is a classic horror (comedy?) movie of the 80's (1985), in which a teenager, addicted to horror series (particularly a TV show called Fright Night, which has a vampire hunter named Peter Vincent) who discovers that his neighbor is actually a vampire, and after the neighbor notes that he knows the secret, he tries to prove to everyone this, together with his friend and girlfriend. The film has the visual you expect from a movie of that decade, of course, with clothes and strange haircuts. The performances in the film are somewhat exaggerated, and in some cases, it makes it kind of funny, particularly the performances of William Ragsdale (Charley Brewster) and his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) that are bad enough to be funny. We have Chris Sarandon in the role of Dandridge (the vampire), that is very well interpreted, better than the modern version of this classic remake. The film ends up arresting our attention, and has a story that appeals and is neither long nor too short, just right: the movie goes from a comedy one to a horror, in the end. More than recommended, for the entertainment: My Score 8.3 / 10.0.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, since movies involving vampires are usually quite lame, I find this one to be a good one. It is interesting to notice how different horror movies used to be in the eighties; nowadays horror movies are extremely scary and are supposed to frighten you big time, whilst in the that decade they used to be mixed with fun, in a "Ghost Busters" style. William Ragsdale is a good actor and he is unintentionally funny throughout all the movie. One thing I must congratulate is the make-up team; the actors became really ugly when portrayed as vampires. Stephen Geoffreys' character begins normal, but once he becomes a vampire, he turns into a creepy monster that almost scares the spectator. It's impossible to not notice how many homoerotic scenes involving the vampires exist in this film; director really wanted to show that. All in all, I haven't seen the remake yet, but I will surely enjoy if it has the same feeling this version has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowall, William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse, Jonathan Stark and Stephen Geoffreys star in this 1985 horror film. Charlie Brewster (Ragsdale) is a nerdy, high school teen who is having issues with his girlfriend, Amy Peterson (Bearse). Soon, he discovers his new, next-door neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Sarandon) is a vampire. Charlie tries convincing Amy, his friend, Ed Thompson (Geoffreys) and police that Jerry is a vampire responsible for deaths of missing girls he last saw at Jerry's house. When they don't believe him, he seeks help from vampire killer, Peter Vincent (McDowall) who may be the only one that can help him. Peter is the host of Charlie's favorite TV show, "Fright Night" who doesn't believe him at first, but eventually does. Charlie and Peter become part of a real-life Fright Night episode when Jerry tries to seduce Amy into a vampire. Stark (House II: The Second Story) plays Jerry's roommate &amp; carpenter, Billy Cole. This is one of my favorite horror films with a great cast, neat effects &amp; great score by Brad Fiedel (The Terminator). I recommend this 80's classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie might not have invented horror comedy, but is sure did a great job with that "sub-genre". Chris Sarandon perfected a role that would make people remember him for it a long time after that. The movie stands the test of time (though it may seem a little bit dated to some I guess) and was recently remade with Colin Farell taking on the Sarandon role (and he was pretty good doing so).While the comedy factor is pretty high, there is still some horror elements in it though. That being said, I urge you to watch this before you watch the remake. It might feel a tad weaker in hindsight, because you know what is going to happen (more or less).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's a moral to "Fright Night", it's that you should just keep your mouth shut if you suspect your next-door neighbor of being a vampire. Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) makes the mistake of catching his neighbor (Chris Sarandon) in the act of a nocturnal blood feast, and no one will believe him that there's an honest-to-god vampire in the neighborhood. Charley's only hope is to enlist the efforts of a washed-up actor (Roddy McDowall), host of a nightly block of scary movie programming.Now, to be absolutely honest, I must've been living in a cave for twenty-odd years, because I hadn't heard of this film until news of this year's remake. It's only now that I discover the film's sterling reputation. And I imagine that if I had grown up with this film, my appreciation for it would be much stronger. The idea of a teen comedy being a satire of the horror genre is intriguing. And the film has style all over the place. But it's paced like an arthritic turtle. We don't see any of the makeup budget or even much action until the third act. And the "horror" is actually more in the gross-out vein.High marks for being spooky, but there's not much scare to it.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fright Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is inconceivable to imagine a time when vampires weren't smothering pop culture, when Fright Night was released in 1985 audiences were more interested in slasher sequels. The Exorcist had brought horror out of castles and into the suburbs where no vampire had been seen. The film's director, Tom Holland, being a fan of Hammer's and Universal's films, decided to make his own vampire movie as the genre had fallen into self-parody with Love at First Bite (1979). Holland was very familiar with Hitchcock from writing the screenplay for Psycho II, so he adapted Rear Window for contemporary preferences, adding a vampire as the antagonist. He was given a modern name in Jerry Dandridge, wore fashionable clothing, and even knew how to dance! Clearly, this was a novel idea that seems less impacting today than it actually was. Coming two years before The Lost Boys, Fright Night laid the groundwork for the revitalization of vampire cinema as it is today.Other than 80's-specific elements that are quite dated, Fright Night is nearly as pleasant today as it was a quarter-century ago. Holland isn't a great director and knows it, so his nostalgia and opportunism were stymied into making a genre horror film. And being such, the movie's adequacy denies its cult supporters from proclaiming it the classic they would like it to be while stylistically shielding it from being remade. The film's formula resonates as well today as it has since Nosferatu. A young man must save his lover from the clutches of a seductive vampire. Charlie Brewster of course manages to save his girlfriend Amy from Jerry, and he does it without our having to know too much about anyone involved in the process. Holland instead devotes a lot of the screenplay to various types of humor that vary in their effectiveness. Charlie is stuck between being a boy and a man and lets his curiosity deny him the sex he so much desires from Amy while making him susceptible to wasting his money warding off Jerry with every anti-vampire trinket his friend Ed sales him. Holland seems to have written the part of Charlie's assistant Peter Vincent for Roddy McDowell who literally echoes his anger at slasher films by saying, "Today audiences only want to watch madmen chopping up young virgins." Unfortunately, Vincent's dialog is mostly just an explicit in-joke for fans, but McDowell's aptness for physical comedy redeems the character in the film's second half. His television program, another in-joke, could actually be made relevant in the remake were it tied more appropriately to a character. Holland chooses to focus on what he perceives as a funny screenplay to make up for his pedestrian direction. His skills sure are obvious and in need of a re-write.Though, the enduring legacy of Fright Night has everything to do with Jerry Dandridge. His turtlenecks, affinity for art, physical closeness to his manservant, and the pet name "Jer" he likes using, all point to the metrosexual identity that has come to define the modern vampire. He never has to reaffirm his masculine identity, thus allowing the humor to actually be effective. Chris Sarandon plays the role to its fullest with his perpetually smug facial expressions, beyond what Holland probably intended. Even today there aren't actually that many notable gay vampires, but Louis and Edward can trace their family history distinctly to Jerry Dandridge.Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Fright Night...for real.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Brewster believes that his next door neighbour Jerry Dandridge is a vampire.His belief is strengthened when mysterious deaths of girls are reported.When Dandridge confronts Charlie in his own bedroom one night and tries to kill him, Charlie concludes that the monster must be destroyed.But since nobody believes his story he enlists the help of Peter Vincent, the vampire killer from his favourite horror TV show, who is in fact sceptical about vampires existing for real....Having not seen this film for nearly twenty years, i had no idea what to expect. The only reason i wanted to revisit this, was because of the imminent remake starring Farrel.It's still a little treat, which starts of quite slowly, but come the third act, really gets going and makes the film worthwhile.I don't know why, but the film had a 'Gremlins' feel to it. It's not scary, but more amusing. There are a few moments that make you jump, and the effects for the time are spectacular, but the film proudly has it's tongue in cheek throughout the movie.Sarandon is amazing as the smooth vampire, and really makes the film worth seeing. Macdowell is at his campest best as the TV star turned hunter.It does have an eerie quality to it throughout, and this being the eighties, has a cheesy nightclub scene thrown into the mix for good measure.It's one of those cult movies that you like to revisit every now and again, there are so many good qualities to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of the Best of the 80's Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night......without a doubt one my favorites from the 80's. The story of teenage boy dealing with an insufferable bloodsucker recently moved in next door. There are certain points where it dates itself, the music, the clothing, the hair, but nevertheless a classic in my opinion. I was about 11 when I first saw it on one of the movies channels and it enthralled me and I don't necessarily mean scaring me. It was an enjoyable film, with a good storyline, simple...but good. The acting is good for the time, and has some quirks, but not in a sense of filling like, "Man..that dude can't act!" The setting for the house that Jerry Dandridge lives in, casts a good, hauntingly chilled appearance and Chris Sarandon provides the smooth and calm, yet sly and sadistic performance as Dandridge and when you've spent a few scenes watching him you begin to realize this guy's no Grandpa Munster. William Ragsdale convinces you of his role as Charlie Brewster, the slightly paranoid horror movie fan with a bit too much curiosity flowing through his adolescent mind.....though they did a good job with the scenes of the first two of Dandridge's victims. When you see those long distorted fingernails, it makes me think of Nosferatu and his creepy Ole self. Roddy McDowall proves himself and his acting ability in the role of the Vampire Hunter, Peter Vincent, who in the beginning is put aside by Charlie and his newfound desires to kill the supposed vampire neighbor, but once convinced when being attacked by Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys of 976-Evil)is ready to take down the bloodsucker of the neighborhood. I will not go into more of the film, because I recommend the viewing of this classic 80's vampire movie, neither will I judge the remake that is currently out. The Con's of this film I have is probably the presence of the character Amy, who is also Charlie's girlfriend. I am still not fond of the character, nor the actress portraying it. So go to your video store, and rent it just might give you a Fright!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fright Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night is a simple straight forward 80's vampire flick about a teenager named Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) who discovers a vampire is living next door to him. When Charley realizes neighbour Jerry Dandrige is a vampire, he turns to local TV horror host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) in order to end Dandridge's killing spree in town. In the process, Charley's girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) and crazy friend Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) are put in immense danger.One of the best things about Fright Night are the actors and the characters they play. "Evil" Ed has gone down as one of the most iconic horror characters from the eighties. Stephen Geoffreys played the role very well. McDowall and Ragsdale are awesome as the films "dynamic duo" out to get Dandridge. And Chris Sarandon does well as Fright Night's villain vampire. Other than the acting, Fright Night is pretty average. It isn't a boring movie, but nothing really sticks out to me that makes it a horror classic.There are some cool scenes like when Ed gets stalked by Jerry through the alleys, and the big conclusion when Peter and Charley try to kill Jerry and save Amy. It is a good horror movie, vampire fans will love it, but other than a few really good moments it doesn't do much else for me.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love films from the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm probably going to go and see the remake of this film in the next couple of weeks so I dug this out for a little refresher. This was Tom Holland's directorial début and it is still an entertaining comedy vampire film now even if some of the effects have dated poorly.Charlie Brewster(William Ragsdale) is a teenager making out with his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse). Amy is just getting warmed up when Charlie gets distracted by men carrying a coffin into the empty house next door. This really pisses off Amy and she leaves. Charlie's mother tells him that they have a new neighbour Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon).Next day when Charlie gets home from school he sees a beautiful scantily dressed woman going into their neighbour's house. Later on that night while Charlie snoozes through old movies on TV he is awakened by the sound of screams from next door. At school the following day Amy is trying apologise for leaving but Charlie gets distracted by a news story on TV about the women he saw going next door being found dead. Amy gets angry about being ignored again and smashes a bagel into Charlie's face then storms off. His friend Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) is in hysterics at this. Geoffreys really has a weird persona and he uses it to pretty good effect in this film.Charlie is poking around the house when he gets disturbed by Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark), Jerry's house-mate and runs off. Later that night Charlie is watching Fright Night, the only show he ever watches, and he falls asleep again. When he wakes he sees a beautiful woman stripping at the window next door. Behind her is Dandridge who opens his mouth to reveal a set of vampire fangs poised to bite down the woman's throat. He must have heard Charlie because he looks right out at him then smiles and pulls down his blinds. Charlie panics, wakes his mother then goes out and hides in the bushes where he sees Billy dumping a body-sized bin bag in the back of a car. He tries to tell his mother but she thinks he must have been dreaming. Charlie faces a huge problem trying convince anyone since the truth sounds just like fiction.After he fails to get Amy to believe him he decides to try the police but without mentioning vampires. A police detective goes to Dandriges's house but Billy manages to fob the cop off and when Charlie is forced to say what he knows to try to get the cop to investigate further he just ends up looking crazy, meaning he can't turn to the cops again. He goes to ask Ed for help and Ed is offended that Charlie thinks Ed is crazy enough to believe vampires are real He also doesn't like Charlie using his nickname Evil Ed. Ed does help with little bits of vampire lore but I wonder how helpful he was since Charlie watches these films every night and must be as familiar with the vampire rules as Ed. Maybe Charlie was just desperate to find someone to believe him.One rule that Ed mentioned is never invite a vampire into your house so, of course, when Charlie gets back from Ed's Jerry is sitting the living room, invited in by Charlie's mother. I like the way that Dandrige threatens Charlie in front of his mother in this scene and Charlie's mother remains oblivious and thinks he's just making small talk. That night Jerry pays a more intimate visit to Charlie in his room and openly threatens him with dire consequences if doesn't stop snooping and telling people that he is a vampire.The situation is getting very serious so Charlie heads to the TV studio that transmits Fright Night and begs for Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), the host of the show, to help him but Vincent thinks he is joking or insane and drives away. Charlie now realises how alone he is and makes preparations to kill Dandrige on his own. Amy and Ed call round and are deeply worried about his mental condition with all his talk about killing Dandrige. They try to put him off the idea and when that fails they get him to agree to wait until they return with help. They go to Vincent's house and ask for his help with convincing Charlie that he's wrong. They want him to convince Charlie that Jerry is just human by adopting his vampire hunter persona and performing a fake vampire test on Dandrige. Vincent arranges the test with Dandrige not realising that Dandrige is making sure the test really is a fake. Charlie trusts them but is worried about what Dandrige is going to do to them when his vampirism is revealed. In Dandrige's house Dandrige charms his guests and gently pokes fun at the idea of vampires. He passes Vincent's fake test leaving poor Charlie looking more isolated and completely crazy. But Vincent gets the glimpse of the truth in the mirror of a prop cigarette case.This film is easily seen as just a throwaway popcorn flick and it is good one, but there is quite a good use of cultural blindness to isolate the genre savvy Charlie so that even when he's with people who love him he's totally on his own against Dandrige almost right up to the end. Chris Sarandon is perfect as Dandrige, easily switching the charm on and off as required. The late Roddy McDowall is also great as the washed-up actor Peter Vincent reduced to hosting a campy late night horror show, but the main credit has to go William Ragsdale who is excellent playing Charlie going crazy from being the only who knows the truth.Rating 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top vampire movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is glorious, everything about it is perfect. The effects are better than modern CGI, the actors are glorious, the plot and writing are beautiful.There's not a moment of this movie you won't love if you enjoy classic vampires and don't mind a dash of comedy in your horror, but the comedy never turns the whole thing into silliness. It just points out the natural goofiness of supernatural situations, and the exaggerations that come to the fore.The movie is not exactly scary as such, though. There are no crappy jump scares and it won't leave you quivering in bed at night afraid of being bitten. It's more about the characters' terror than terrifying the viewer. Whether this is good or not may be up to the individual.It's also a movie somewhat laden with tropes, you can predict 90% of the scenes as they come, but at the same time, every last one of those clichés are so well-executed that you can't help but love them anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely enjoyable vampire movie with humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the remake of Fright Night due to hit cinemas in the near future it is time to comment on the original - is it really over 25 years old? I first encountered this courtesy of the excellent novelisation by Skipp and Spector, but it wasn't too long before I caught the movie. Horror fan Charlie Brewster thinks he sees his new next door neighbour Jerry Dandridge up to vampiric activities. Lost for what to do, Charley tries to recruit late night TV horror film host Peter Vincent, reasoning that he will believe Charley's story and will know what to do. Trouble is, Vincent doesn't want to know, and Dandridge has his sights set on Charley's girlfriend Amy.Fright Night is a pretty good movie. It is well paced, well acted, and well written. It is suspenseful (with the odd scary moment) and amusing, often at the same time. There are some excellent effects, and the final half hour is non-stop eventful excitement.I enjoy it thoroughly every time I see it, and I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun &amp; Entertaining !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the mid 80s the classic horror genre had died down and film studios were interested in making slasher films that appealed mainly to the teenage audience. Filled with plenty of jumps, most of the slasher films as a whole are pretty crappy and aren't really scary at all. I haven't really seen any perfected horror film that isn't past the year 1985, or at least one that isn't a remake or revolve around teenagers getting drunk, having sex, then getting killed. Let's not also forget the cliché gags, such as where it seem as if the character is being watched by some slasher villain, but then, OH!, what a relief it was only his best friend trying to scare him.Fright Night is a genius story and revolves around a young teenager named, Charlie. Charlie is an avid fan of all the Universal and Hammer horror films. He watches these films on a late night TV show called Fright Night, which is hosted by the notorious vampire killer himself, actor Peter Vincent (an amazing performance by Roddy McDowall). One night while looking out his bedroom window he notices his new next door neighbors moving in.... the creepy thing is, is that the movers are carrying in a coffin ! Convinced that his next door neighbors are vampires and that they are in some way related to current killings going on in town, he desperately seeks the help of the police and his friends to try and convince them that his neighbors are in fact real vampires. He eventually has no one else to turn to except Peter Vincent !The story , written by director Tom Holland, is great (not surprised its getting the remake treatment like every movie ever made) however I can't help but feel that the movie falls weak at certain points. The lighting in the movie is real drab and dull and doesn't really help much at really setting the right mood (at least for the most parts). The directing could've been a bit better, but nevertheless the actors were pretty good, Roddy McDowall's performance sticks out like a sore thumb almost. The only real complaint is how drown out the movie can get. For instance when one of the vampires gets killed or when the main vampire is seducing Charlie's girlfriend it gets drawn out longer than it really needs to be. Aside from these small problems it sure is a fun and entertaining horror film with a light-hearted spirit that doesn't leave the viewer disappointed. The special effects are great as well !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long time ago... when vampires still wore shirts and drank blood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film with a video cover that looked just a little too much for 12 year old me when released, meaning I missed out on this minor gem until I was too old to appreciate it.For some reason I always mixed up Fright Night with Tales from the Crypt, meaning I expected one of those compendium films with three or four shorter stories instead of the full fledged Vampire film that I ended up with.In extremely familiar circumstances to many other films (The Burbs, House) Fright Night finds a young school student named Charlie ? a horror film fan ? dealing with the realization that perhaps the new neighbours might just be vampires, not especially good timing seeing as it happens on the same night that his long time girl Amy decides to "give herself up" to him.Unlike EVERY OTHER TEENAGE BOY IN HISTORY Charlie takes asks for a rain check from Amy even after she's assumed the position ? so to speak ? just because he saw people carrying a coffin across the yard next door. Speaking for myself at that age smacking me across the back of the head with a shovel wouldn't have distracted me one iota, I guess Charlie was made of different stuff.Over the next few days Charlie sees and hears things that elevate his threat level, meanwhile corpses start piling up. He decides that the new neighbour is indeed a vampire, only no-one believes him, not his Mum, not the cops, not even dear old Amy.So he does exactly what any lad should do and asks his whiny mate for help and advice. The whiny mate has a nasal high pitched and frankly offputting voice, he also laughs like an idiot and seems to snort at the end of most sentences. For some reason he remains just as annoying and obnoxious and they justify keeping him in for the remainder of the film. There always seems to be the dorky sidekick in these sorts of films ? I just can't remember one so clearly abhorrent. The one worthwhile thing this dipsh*t tells Charlie is that vampires can't enter your home unless you invite them into it ? Let the Right One In also sees the vampire having to deal with the same issue.All should be sweet? but you should always think about the innocence of your Mum, that very night she not only lets the guy in, she invites him to dinner! The neighbour is a suave, smooth talking, good looking man named Jerry Dandridge, at least to Mum and everyone else. But as soon as he and Charlie are alone or if no-one is looking he lets Charlie see the real him, and openly tells him that he is coming to gettim.So the cops, GF, loser mate and even Mum have failed him so Charlie turns to the one guy who surely must come through, a late night host of crappy horror movies called Price Vincent (get it?). ultimately Amy comes back onside ? which is important as she must play a key role in the vampire's masterplan, and Charlie, the old hack and Amy must battle the evil undead for control of both Amy and their lives.Aside from one scene this is all reasonably tasteful and even low key in stretches, far from some of the more over the top antics of say From Dusk Til Dawn or other 80s horror films. There was one particular scene though where they obviously went balls-out to make an impact.With minimal gore or massive makeup effects there isn't much to report on that front, but there are a couple of memorable decompositions and a cool ? if awkward ? transformation sequence. I found Fright Night refreshingly low key and old school, where perhaps many other films of the era might have let things degenerate into a schlockfest they spaced out the early kills and confrontations and allowed things to build up to a short but impactful finale.Final Rating ? 7 / 10. Not the best horror movie of the era, but alongside The Gate a solid 80s effort and an ideal non-threatening intro to the genre for a newbie or a movie marathon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For Charlie to survive, his salvation may rest in the hands of fiction, but if the stories are not true, then how will he defeat the one coming for him, the vampire living next door? Fright Night is a chilling movie touching on what we fear the most, the unknown. The main character is the reflection of youth, curiosity, and the struggle against a darkness revealed, and through the actor, we meet a young man fighting for his life. And with high stakes and a race against time, this storyline grips you from start to end, a true tale of terror. And it will make you wonder what really lies within the dark, and should we worry about who is living next door.</fullReview>

The main character who stumbles upon two vampires then soon learns that they know that the main character knows that they know that they are both vampires. Though it was from the 80's and it was supposed to be scary back in the day, I still believe that it is still a great classic and that I am still liking it as much as the first time I ever watched it. It wasn't scary the first time I watched it but then after a few times it was a little scary. I would rate this movie a 10 out of 10 because it is a classic and will always be a classic and no other spin off movie or whatever can change it or take it's place in the in the whole movie making industry world!</fullReview>

Roddy McDowall did a really good job in this movie, as well as Sarandon, Ragsdale and Bearse. "Evil" Ed was kind of weird, but funny. Had they brought him back in the sequel, "FRIGHT NIGHT PART 2" would've been great. i'm not saying the sequel was bad, but it was inferior to the original. it didn't really take me as a surprise when i found out that Stephen geoffreys was gay (his character seemed kind of queer), but Amanda bearse?! i have two favorite parts in this movie. the scene where jerry seducts Amy, and the part where peter Vincent tries to fend of "Evil" Ed with the crucifix. if you like vampire movies that have a dark blend of humor, i recommend this movie. and "The Lost Boys" (1987) lol.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainingly cheesy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fright Night" is a solid slice of 80s cheese and vampire affairs, and is thoroughly enjoyable.**SPOILERS**Staying home one night, teenager Charley Brewster, (William Ragsdale) and his girlfriend Amy Peterson, (Amanda Bearse) watch the local horror show, hosted by Peter Vincent, (Roddy McDowall) which leads to a fight between the two. The cause of the fight, the strange man, Jerry Dandrige, (Chris Sarandon) who moved next door, soon becomes an obsession in his life to the annoyance of his friends and family. Voicing his belief that he and his henchmen Billy Cole, (Jonathan Stark) are both vampires, no one believes the story and he is ostracized for it. Despite getting evidence that he is indeed a vampire, he still has trouble getting people to believe in him, and the vampires go on a killing spree to spite him. Finally getting him to agree about the situation, they try to formulate a plan to deal with it. Once it appears that an army of vampires have been created and are out to get them, they try to get them before it transpires.The Good News: This is a pretty nice vampire film at times. This one manages to update the traditional vampire fare into the current time period and mixing it in expertly. The fact that this feels incredibly 80s, with the clothing, music and the big scene in the nightclub, which all just scream 80s, yet there's all the classic rules of vampires coming into play as well. This here mixes everything so well that it feels like an excellent example of the two. This cheesy it a pleasant cheese factor that works quite well in the film's favor. There's even a few really nice suspense moments in the film which do send chills down the spine, mainly for the one scene in the darkened alley that features an incredibly creepy chase through that as well as an unearthly fog that appears from nowhere. It's at the best, though, when it gets to the final showdown in the house. This manages to work in plenty of great parts, as there's a lot of great special effects thrown in. From dissolving into piles of goo and blood, transformations into creatures of all sorts and back into human form and plenty of action and horror chills. This is fast-paced goodness with plenty going on to entice anyone into it, and stands as a great part of the film. It's also got most of the film's blood and gore in the film, and this is a big bonus. All of these make the film slightly underrated in the genre.The Bad News: There isn't a whole lot of stuff wrong with this one. The biggest problem is that there's really no threatening vampire in the film. The main one is played up as a debonair man, which isn't the sort of personality needed to become a threatening figure. That quality can be present, but it's the dominant one and doesn't come off as the secondary one, which is what it should be. This one isn't that frightening or scary, and that can be dangerous for a vampire as they never appear as frightening as they should be. That is the main problem here, as keeping the charming personality in the forefront doesn't make the main threat come off as being something to reckon with. The other problem is the nightclub scene. It's supposed to be a really erotic scene to demonstrate the power it has, yet instead it comes across as just corny since the victim swoons at the site of his glare at first glance rather than the eventual win-over that should transpire. The cheesiness might be a problem to some, and could be a source to overcome. Otherwise, this one wasn't that bad.The Final Verdict: There isn't a whole lot wrong with this one, and there's enough right with it to make it seem really entertaining. Vampire fans or those into the 80s cheese will be able to get into this one nicely, while those who aren't into any of these will be able to get through it without enjoying it that much.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language and Brief Nudity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Holland (writer and director) gives us a good vampire film that is funny, frightening, and has just enough gore to satisfy the fans.Charley's (William Ragsdale) new neighbors are little strange. So strange that when his girlfriend (Amanda Bearse) finally decides to give herself to him, he is more interested in what is going on next door. Soon, he discovers that a vampire has moved in, but no one believes him.The local host of Fright Night (Roddy McDowall) is brought in to convince him that it's not real, but soon discovers the truth. Unfortunately, he has no real experience. But Charley and Peter (McDowell) manage to stumble though and save his girlfriend.Super makeup made this an enjoyable experience. Chris Sarandon (Dog Day Afternoon) gave a good performance as the vampire.Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange one this, went into it expecting to laugh at another poorly made film from the 80s that i enjoyed when young but turns out to be complete rubbish.So was heartily surprised when it turned out this film is actually really good, surprisingly well made and there are many laughs during the course of this film but they are intended, (apart from one heroically bad special effect) The effects in this film (except for th aforementioned) are remarkably good also, in this age of doing everything cgi films such as fright night are a reminder of how good certain things can look when done handmade rather than just using a computer to do it for you.Basically watch this film, its a fun couple of hours</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who could forget this movie? I couldn't. The day it came out my friend and I was in line to see it and it blew us away. The plot is simple yet original: A teenager start to believe that his neighbor is a vampire, and is, he is set out to prove himself right. What makes this movie work is the fact that this teen enlists the help of a TV personality vampire killer, played by Roddy McDowall, to help him capture the vampire. Roddy's performance works for the most part as being the washed up TV host looking for away to redeem him.The scares are there and Tom Holland rethought the design for a vampire, as well as the bat that comes with it. It had a great blend of sexual pleasure, which vampires often do, and humor that drove this film. It had a very memorable dance club scene and a great theme song by the J. Geils Band simply titled, Fright Night.The few bad things are very minor. The acting could have been better given the situation and the makeup, though good, was sort of funny. The special effects were great on the other hand.Overall, this movie deserves a change. If you like new and interesting vampire movies, than this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare for a movie to do everything right from the get go. Fright Night is a old fashioned vampire movie brought up to date. From the set up of the story to the introduction of characters...everything just works perfectly. Chris Sarandon is hypnotic as the vamp. William Ragsdale is believable as the teen trying to get anybody to believe he has a vampire living next door to him. The real star though is Roddy Mcdowall as Peter Vincent. He turns in a fine performance and is a benefit to the movie. The effects are good(in a 80's way) and there is humor here and there. Anybody who likes vampire movies or horror movies from the 80's should check this out. This is a great movie that still holds up today. They just don't make movies like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'TV myth' has its roots. The truth is far darker...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's brave about this (and still holds up today) is its willingness to poke fun at pop-culture obsessed youth while recognising that without such 'historians', the fabled lore of the past would have found itself extinguished long ago. "Fright Night" was the inventive precursor to the ironic horror hits of the following decade, such as "Scream". It's made by the geeks who love the genre to serve as some sort of justification, implying that one day being a 'geek' might just save your life...It really is great fun for a movie fan to see Roddy McDowell - himself something of an acting legend in the sci-fi arena - taking on the role of a veteran performer forced to use the skills of his craft in a real-life situation. It's vindication for every armchair observer who gets themselves involved in another reality. Like "Rear Window" with vampires in it, "Fright Night" is a hair raising ride and one of the slickest, most enjoyable horror-comedy efforts that the '80's managed to give us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reason I began loving vamp/horror movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie one Halloween night (appropriately enough) at home with my parents. It blew me away with its scares, sexiness (in the person of Chris Sarandon - to one of the other commentators on this film, you are NOT alone in him being your first movie crush)and effects. I plan to make it a Halloween tradition of my own now that I'm a grown-up (sort of) with my own place. I can't imagine another vamp I'd rather spend that night with! I can thank - or blame - this film for making me a "vamp groupie" - a phase I hopefully won't outgrow anytime soon.Others have commented on the surprisingly moving "Evil Ed" death scene, and I agree it tugged at my heart-strings as well as my stomach! And in the "I want to BE her" category, there's Amy after she's transformed by Jerry's bite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good horror flick with standout vampire work from Sarandon...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any fan of '80s horror films has got to love this one. It starts with a hook that grabs you into the story immediately--a vampire moving next door to a boy who spies a casket being carried into the cellar--and a vampire kiss turning into a bite right before his peering eyes (from his bedroom window).As soon as WILLIAM RAGSDALE spies CHRIS SARANDON and realizes he's a vampire, the heat is on--because Sarandon knows his neighbor has seen him. Sarandon plays his role with a sexual edge, cocky and arrogantly handsome, but as menacing as all get out.Fortunately, between the fright scenes, there's a good abundance of humor and gags to keep the blood flowing smoothly and to remind you you're only watching a horror flick that turns out to be very entertaining as it delivers the shivers along with the laughs.RODDY McDOWALL excels as a veteran host of a program called FRIGHT NIGHT who gets talked into reluctantly checking out Ragsdale's story about having a vampire for a neighbor. A number of scary and sometimes shocking scenes of bloodlust do take place and sometimes the director has gone overboard in his use of special effects that tend to be more disgusting than frightening. That's the main flaw of the film once it veers fully into horror territory. This, I'm afraid, is typical of the taste prevalent in the '80s when audiences wanted their horror effects to be as graphic as possible.Performances are excellent with STEPHEN GEOFFREYS and his whining voice standing out as the neurotic best friend of the hero.Summing up: Not for those easily disturbed by grotesque effects for the sake of cheap thrills. Interesting to note AMANDA BEARSE from "Married With Children" (she was Marcy) in the female lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my mother had brought a VCR back in '83, we were moving up because it meant a good middle class status. She brought many tapes, then on to 1985, the year of the big godzilla movie and of course BK's (British Knights) and my mom's promised me either to see the movie or by me the BK's but failed to do so since she (being a single mother) had to work all the time. I think she was trying to make it up to me a year later when she got ET, and Fright Night and the Howling. Fright Night is a great movie regardless. The acting was superb and the soundtrack (even the dreary synths) were all great in telling the tale of modern vampiric horror. Chris Sarandon was an excellent creep/gentleman in this movie. I even like Amanda Bearse's spunky attitude when Charlie ignores her (all the girl wants is a little love) and it goes to show that you have to treat your women right because you'll never know when you'll have a vampire for a neighbor. This movie stands by itself for it's genre because even though it was made in the heart of the 80's (which most of us miss and is a corny era compared to today's mindset) because all the parts were executed well to piece together this movie.I've read somewhere the question of why does Dandridge eats the apple, and even was asked this myself a couple of times.No one knows for sure but I'd like to think that it's just a little tasty habit he picked up to compliment his smugness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, the plot: For young Charlie Brewster, nothing could be better than an old horror movie late at night. Two men move in next door, and for Charlie with his horror movie experience, there can be no doubt that their strange behavior is explained by the fact that they are a vampire and his undead day guardian. The only one who can help him hunt them down is a washed-up actor, Peter Vincent, who hosts Charlie's favorite TV show, Fright Night. Vincent doesn't really believe that vampires exist, but does it for the money...Fond, fond memories of my childhood. Well more like my teenagerhood. This film is set in a neighbourhood in America (not the hood). Great horror, great comedy and pathetic sound editing all makes one good film. ENJOY THE NIGHT!!</fullReview>

I saw him a number of years ago on the Jerry Springer Show. Someone said something about a remake? I don't think that they should do it. For some reason, this movie wouldn't work that well if it came out today. It seems to take more to scare somebody than it did in the 1980s. I sort of wished they had made a part three. The second one wasn't as good as the first, but it wasn't that bad, nevertheless. Besides Fright Night, what other movies from the 1980s does anyone consider to be a classic? I don't care what anyone says, but the movie Troll 2 does not count as a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) is a teenager who has just learned that his newest next door neighbor is a vampire. And worse, the vampire (Chris Sarandon) knows it. With help from and aging actor who once starred in vampire movies as a vampire killer (Roddy McDowall) Charlie must kill the vampire before the vampire kills him and his friends.I enjoyed Fright Night. It was a horror movie that had humor that actually worked an added to the film. The acting was pretty good too. I actually didn't dislike the characters like I do with lesser horror films. In fact in this movie, the acting made the movie even more worthwhile.The visuals were incredible for 1985 before computer graphics. One of the best transformations scenes was when one of the vampires transforms from a wolf back to a human. It was definitely astonishing for a movie that only cost a mere 9 million dollars to make.THis movie was definitely 80s, and it still holds up pretty good today. I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A comedy horror about two teenagers: Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) and Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse) who were in love. One night, saw caught sight of a coffin being taken into the basement of the house next door. Anything to do with death freaks me out!!!! My friend Jacque told me that was the most beautiful coffin he ever saw!A couple of days later when things started to look mysterious, late at night; Charlie heard a scream that came from next door and when he looked out from his window, the light in the room went off. The prostitute that entered that house has now died. THAT WAS THE SECOND MURDER IN THE LAST TWO DAYS!!!!! The next evening, Charlie watched the guy from next door who was Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) kiss his girlfriend and then, JERRY BIT HER AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF CHARLIE. Ooh! Spooky. Now Charlie knows that Dandrige is a vampire and nobody believes that he is.On the following evening, Charlie got some advice from his class mate Evil Ed/ Ed Thomson (Stephen Geoffreys)in connection with keeping vampires away because, Charlie knew that Dandrige was going to visit him.Later that night, Dandrige appeared in Charlie's mom's room, Judy Brewster's room (Dorothy Fielding)and then he entered Charlie's room and there Dandrige tried to kill him due to telling everyone that he is a vampire. It was a cool scene, Dandrige picks Charlie up by the neck and throws him into his cupboard. It was so funny when Charlie's mom called while they were having fight! Ha!Ha!And when morning came, Charlie got a call from Dandrige saying that he will see him the next evening.When Charlie tried to convince Amy and Evil that Dandige was a vampire,they believed him.There is one thing that will amaze you in this motion picture, and that is the inside of the house YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!!! And plus, this is where the freakiest parts begin like, when Dandrige saw the cross, he walked backwards and the vampire hunter who was hired from the "Fright Night" t.v. series Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall)looked into a mirror and noticed that Dandrige did not have a reflection! Dandrige was found everywhere! And when Evil went into an alley, he attacked him, and he also put a spell on Amy in a nightclub called " Club Break". And when Dandrige bites, that is something else. It's very painful especially when he bit Amy! On the same evening, when Vincent was checking out Carlie's house, A HUSKEY APPEARED and it tried to attack him and when Vince killed it GUESS WHAT???!!! It was Evil. Back at Dandige's house, it was freaky to see his house mate Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) melt!The hissing of the vampires were good and when Amy turned into that hideous monster THAT WAS WHEN THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!! And also when the light broke through the windows of the basement and Dandrige turned into a half human half bat-like creature.The movie ends with Amy and Charlie back together in his room and with Peter Vincent no longer staring in the Fright Night t.v. series and, with Evil watching them kiss from Dandrige's window with a pair of binoculars. LOL!Good horror with comedy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another gem from the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980's was, as far as I'm concerned, the best decade for movies the world has ever seen. It seems like 99% of the movies that came out were not at all intended to be taken seriously, but were made just for the sake of pure entertainment. "Fright Night" is a perfect example. It's a lighthearted, peculiarly sexual horror flick with some very memorable characters, especially Chris Sarandon as the seductive vampire, Roddy MacDowall as the skeptical Vampire Hunter, and of course Evil Ed Thompson, who is not the best actor of all time (either that or he was on crack) but unforgettable all the same. Plus it is packed with homages for fans of this sort of thing (check out the stuff playing on Charlie's TV screen). It's a funny, cool, and sometimes genuinely scary film that any fan of classic 80's silliness should own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfection is a word I use sparingly, but Fright Night is the Perfect Halloween movie to watch !!! Tom Holland does an outstanding job of directing, drawing you into the everyday lives of Charlie Brewster, and his girlfriend Amy..and then into the darkness of the Supernatural . Hyper teens, vampires, and Roddy McDowell are the Quintessential Mix, in this SUPER natural thriller . where a vampire moves next door to the average American teen, and there it begins...... The story takes place in a small town in Iowa. People start showing up dead !The Director spares NO expense showing us the many different shapes and shadows of EVIL . Roddy McDowall is EXCELLENT in any role he chooses, but his Tour DE Force performance will be ONE of his most memorable and enduring ..... Feeling the pages of life turning without him , the aging Peter Vincent(Roddy McDowall} becomes a TV ratings victim as host of "Fright Night ", and is summoned by Charlie Brewsters friends to perform a debunking of the new next door neighbor of Charlie, where weird events have been taking place...and this is where the fun begins...Club Radio is a Great scene , really well done !!! Evil Ed Thompson, a friend of Charlies, is transformed ,and becomes a protégé of Jerry Dandrige(Chris Sarandon)and an integral part of the plot. William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse are outstanding as the Star crossed lovers, whose fate is reshaped by the mysterious Jerry Dandridge ! PERFECTLY CAST..... A TRUE American CLASSIC !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brewster's Wild Ride! (SpOiLeRs)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fright Night' is one of my favorite vampire movies. Charels Brewster (William Ragsdale) is suspicious of his strange new neighbors and in no time, his sneaking around and surveillance of the weirdos next door leads his to the discover that they're bloodsuckers! No one, of course, believes Chuck, especially his friend, weird "Evil" (Stephen Geoffreys) and his girlfriend, Amy (Amanda Bearse) who figure he's watched one too many horror movies and blown his lid. So, Brewster employs the help of a washed up late-night horror TV host, Peter Vincent (Roddy MacDowell) who Brewster is sure knows all their is to know about vampire hunting. Although, the ridiculous belief that a guy who hosts a cheap late-night horror series would know all there is to know about vampires (other than what people can already pickup from the lore in movies and other pop culture) is more like something that we would expect from a say, a young kid, and not a grown teenager. The funny thing is that, Peter Vincent, perhaps lonely and liking the attention, agrees to help Brewster. Especially, when he soon finds out that Brewster isn't totally nuts about his suspicions of his neighbors being vampires. Everyone in horror movies learns that sooner or later.This movie has a lot of good things going for it. For one, it has some horror/comedy elements to it, particularly from the character "Evil," Brewster's friend, who thinks Brewster is totally nuts, and gets a kick out of mocking him. Even when he's bitten by a vampire, the evil Evil doesn't lose his sense of humor. More like he just gains a taste for flesh. Stephen Geoffreys was great here. The second thing is the special effects, which aside from a story, are key for me in 80s horror films. And 'Fright Night' certainly does fail here at all. You have a scene with a pretty disgusting transition of a wolf to a human. You have some pretty gnarley vampire faces on Chris Sarandon, who I suppose is the head vampire, and Jonathan Starke. It's pretty wild, very cool stuff. And why not? Some of the guys credited with the makeup and SFX work is Dale Brady and Ken Diaz, two guys who worked on 'The Thing' several years before this one. That movie has some of the most incredible special effects scenes ever in a horror movie (or any movie, really).Also, you have a fine cast to pull of what may otherwise be a kind of stupid story (or, not another teen horror movie). Especially Roddy MacDowell and Chris Sarandon. William Ragsdale's character, Charlie Brewster is a real nerd, so Geoffrey's is a perfect counter to this is the hilarious, eccentric "Evil." Even the accompanying music video, by J. Geils Band, (entitled "Fright Night") was pretty cool. Yep, I'd definitely recommend watching 'Fright Night' if your searching for a proper 80s horror movie. They came out with a sequel some years later that I remember not being all that great. But then again, it's been some time since I've seen it. So, I guess that means I should watch it again.</fullReview>

It's got that added touch of "but he's telling the truth- why don't you believe him!" Great special effects, good casting- clever touch to use the safe "make-believe" horror on TV and the actual horror occurring in "that" house! Interesting to see the rules of vampire-hunting being put to the test- the film has substance and a storyline- unlike many of the "teen-slasher" movies that have been made in abundance. I didn't get to see this in the cinema as I was too young when it was released- but I bet there was great audience reaction to some of the scenes and would've been one to talk about later! Still a good one to view in the "safety" of your own home late at night (in the dark!) I have watched this movie many times and will continue to do so! Gets a "thumbs-up" from me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie again for the first time in years. I remember loving it as a junior high student who didn't know much about film and being able to watch it much more deeply today than I did back then did not kill the movie at all. This was before CGI took over so the effects were outdated, but somehow this made the movie even better. Evil Ed's wolf was much more realistic than the terrible modern CGI wolves of the blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow released just this year. The scene where he is stabbed and reverts back to human form was fantastic. Yes, the bat was cheesy but the transformation was well done. I also liked the makeup used on Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys for their characters as vampires.The real strength of this movie, however, is the ability of the actors themselves. William Ragsdale carries the movie well. He's what most people picture when they think of a young b-movie fan. Stephen Geoffreys is hilarious and the perfect choice for the annoying sidekick. Amanda Bearse was great as the shy, virginal girlfriend. Chris Sarandon was the best 80s update of a vampire I'd seen. He was manly, making it obvious why women would fall for him, and very ominous. His character of Jerry was funny, but still dark and mysterious enough to be intimidating. I especially liked his use of the trenchcoat as a modern vampire cape. Finally, the late Roddy McDowell fit the movie perfectly as well. Not many will remember this film as part of his legacy, which is sad. He was the transformation character who goes from non-believer to scared believer to strong ally.The movie did have a plothole or two, but don't let this detract from the timelessness of this film. This film was TRUE horror. It was in no way like the MTV-generation junk that is spewed out today and called "horror" like the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Urban Legend, and the like. I especially liked how the film briefly poked fun at the typical "horror" films of the 80s that featured "men in hockey masks hacking young virgins."This film is for fans of true horror and worth another look. The amount of humor was perfect and never detracted from the horror. The gore was present, but never overdone or glorified. This was easily the best horror of the 80s and among the best all-time vampire films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely awesome 80's horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fright Night" has definitely earned a cult-like status over the years but I still think it's widely unseen and unsung. Man, this movie is just so under-rated. I saw it in a theater when I was 12 and at that time it scared me pretty good. But what a rush. A couple of years later it was one of those movies that you could see on HBO ten times a month, and it was at that point that I watched it several times and it became one of my all time favorite movies. Maybe it was just one of those things, where you have that certain window of time at a particular age, or a particular mood, and something registers. Whatever it was, "Fright Night" just hit me as one incredibly awesome horror flick. Like Stephen King's "Salem's Lot" did in book form, "Fright Night" was a classic American vampire story. All of the trademark folklore was there: the creepy house, mysterious neighbors, missing local girls, crosses, garlic, holy water, wooden stakes, and a general chill in the air. Chris Sarandon was terrific as Jerry Dandrige, the modern day Dracula who moves into the house next door to high-schooler Charley Brewster (excellently played by William Ragsdale). Roddy McDowell, in one of his ultimate performances, was also perfectly-cast as Peter Vincent, the reluctant vampire killer.The thing that made "Fright Night" different from a lot of the typical 80's horror movies was that perfect balance between horror, comedy and drama. Scary scenes all over, comedy from Ragsdale's fumbling, awkward high-school student and his best friend Ed. Drama in the night club scene, and when Charley begs a frightened Peter Vincent for help. Much like "American Werewolf in London", the other great 80's horror-comedy, this one has it all. Make no mistake, if you're the type of person that gets scared or can let yourself get scared at vampire movies, you will be. But there are sweet, tongue-in-cheek moments laced throughout the film that let you know it never takes itself too seriously. The music is killer and the make-up effects are way better, and more terrifying, than you expect. From top to bottom this is really a very well-made film. There are just too many great things to say about "Fright Night" and almost nothing bad. If you have never seen it, you are missing out on a classic. I practically had to force the DVD on my brother, but of course he loved it when he watched it. Writer-director Tom Holland deserves a lot of praise for creating an extraordinary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The not-so-fearless Vampire Killers! (Spoilers Ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fright Night" is one of my favorite vampire movies (And I have seen MANY!), which takes the "boy who cried wolf" theme to a new extreme.Charlie (Cute William Ragsdale)is your typical teen:having problems with high school, has an embarrassing mother (Who tells her son about a nightmare where she's naked and offers him a Valium!),and trying to get into the pants of his virginal girlfriend, Amy (Also cute Amanda Bearse). His life takes an interesting turn when Jerry Dandridge (Sexy Chris Sarandon) moves next door. Soon Charlie finds out that Jerry is a vampire and tries to convince his mother, girl and friend, Evil Ed (Jack Nicholson lookalike Stephen Geoffreys, who steals the film). He then enlists the help of Fright Night host, Peter Vincent (Wonderfully played by the late, great Roddy McDowall). Soon, the group of friends are drawn into a chain of events that have them running for their lives.Best parts: ALL OF IT!There are so many parts of the film that are great. This is not your typical group of vampire hunters: Charlie goes about the wrong ways to convince his friends about what he sees (And if he's such a horror fan, why does he ask Evil Ed what to do?). Peter is flawed: he battled imaginary vampires and now his fears are made flesh, which terrifies him. Amy is the typical damsel in distress (And a reincarnation of a girl that Jerry knew a long time ago). They have to face not only Jerry, but Billy, his servant (Jonathan Stark, looking a bit like Norman Bates).The film is a bit dated (It's a 80's movie after all), but it is STILL a good movie to watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best vampire films to date!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favourite's. This film was released in 1985 but is yetagain a true quality 80's horror film. The special effects and make up were some of the best i have seen in any vampire film to date. A simple yet great story line with some interesting characters played by somequite famous actors, excellent acting through out the film. This filmtruly captured the 80's era as well, especially in the night club scenebetween Jerry Dandridge, Charley Brewster and Amy Peterson. Watch outfor all those classic 80's tunes in the background. Evil Ed is great.I think if directed and written in the right way this film would make a great remake. This film from start to finish incorporated a unique balance of horror, fear and humour. Spot on Tom Holland, i take my hat off to you, please can you direct some more vampire films.If you love your vampire films and you have not watched this film,watch it,you won't be disappointed. Also i would like to apologise to anyone who has read any of my other comments on various films as some of my spelling is not too good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Vampire movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor SpoilersThis is not only one of the best Vampire movies ever but one of the best (in my opinion) horror movies ever made. It has a great sense of humor and a great story with great FX and great action also some great scares and a great performance from Roddy McDowell. The humor is prefect and fits the film perfectly. The story is a variation on the classic "boy who cried wolf" with a vampires twist. The FX is wonderfully done on the Dandridge bat the Dandridge monster vampire makeup and especially on the death of Dandridge. The action is also very good some very intense action scenes one. The scene where the ghoul comes through the smoke was great and the lady vampire was crazy looking. And of course what could be considered the best part of this movie Roddy McDowell as Peter Vincent a perfect performance everything about it was great from a pompous egotistical B movie star to a coward to a Coward forced to act heroically it was all wonderful.In conclusion this is a great movie and one of the best of the eighties along with American Werewolf in London.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still my favorite vamp flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember first seeing the movie in my early teens and being frightened the first time I watched this film. After that, I couldn't stop watching this movie to pick up minor details I missed the first 50 views and to break down the reasoning for each action. I lived in the country with nothing to do at the time so I took the time to memorize the script word for word. Now that I'm in my twenties I've seen some great vampire flicks (Razorblade Smile, The Addiction, The Vampire Journals, Interview with a Vampire, etc.) but I always come back to this movie because it has every element that a movie could offer. The action is great and the scenes in between are filled with a great dose of 80's cheese(the parts we like to remember). I definitely recommend this movie two anyone interested in any genre, a good time will be had by all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Roger Ebert's review of the film, and I remember reading what he said about how vampires weren't as popular as most of the maniacal characters we see on screen, and that a character of the film said that people wanted to see a slasher cutting off the heads of driven sex teens than watching a vampire flick. In "Fright Night," we see what would happen if a vampire were to invade a neighborhood without people suspecting he's a vampire."Fright Night" is an early version of the Wes Craven film "Scream" where audiences get to know the rules of a particular horror film and with "Fright Night," we get to know the rules on vampire flicks.Charlie Baker (William Ragsdale) is a big fan of horror movies for which not only does he watch a famous TV show with the host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), but he watches the show while making love to his girlfriend (Amanda Bearse of Married?With Children fame), and yet she's committed while he's distracted from the television set. After the girlfriend leaves, Charlie notices that a new neighbor (Chris Surandon) has moved into the neighborhood at night where after our young hero goes upstairs, he sees him and a woman having sex where Charlie notices that he's a vampire.Charlie tries to convince his friend Evil Ed, the cops, and his girlfriend that the new neighbor is a vampire, but nobody believes him; he even goes to his idol, Peter Vincent about the situation to where he sees that he needs help. As much as it sounds crazy, Charlie's friends and Peter Vincent go to visit the neighbor for which he is a vampire and its up to Charlie to stop before more people get killed."Fright Night" is a true original like a funhouse where back and forth you don't know what is going to happen next. With an all-star cast from Chris Surandon, Roddy McDowell, and a hot Amanda Bearse, I love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly fun. A few laughs and a few scares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although some of my friends disagree with me on his, I really think highly of 'Fright Night'. Now, it has it's flaws.... Firstly, it has Amanda Bearse, an openly gay actress, as the romantic interest of the lead character. We know Amanda best as Marcy Rhoades D'Arcy in Married with Children. She doesn't do a bad job here, it's just kinda weird. Also, there are a lot of very predictable plot points...But, William Ragsdale and especially, Roddy McDowell are Excellent!Chris Sarandon turns in a great performance also. He is even more creepy than seeing Amanda Bearse as a hetero love interest.This is not a classic vampire movie nor is it one of the more recent hardcore, blood-running-out-of-shower-heads type of movie. Rather, it is a funny, silly little confection that has some surprisingly scary and graphic moments.My favorite scene is the moment when Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) accidentally sees that Jerry Dandrige doesn't reflect in a mirror and thus really IS a vampire. William Ragsdale gives a very real and believable performance.Roddy McDowell has a lot of fun in his role and really steals this movie.This one is a sleeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant movie. Loved every minute of it, watched it many times over and had to buy the full Video. Chris Sarandon acting is incredible as the handsome evil vampire (to think he was appx 46 years old when doing this movie, when actually he looks around mid 30's). His acting in the disco scene is totally believable, when he is walking around that disco, you can see that this person has amazing charisma and stands out from the crowd. Roddy McDowall is in top form as the bumbling vampire killer, again amazing acting and a delight to watch. The musical theme is beautiful for this film, the Fright Night theme that Brad Fiedal created is echoed throughout the whole film with the complete sensual song being played when Chris Sarandon does his seduction acting in the lounge in his house. That song is very difficult to get hold off since normal soundtrack being sold contains a slightly different version of that song. I am amazed we dont see more of Chris Sarandon, after this movie he was amassed with fan mail. His vampire appealed to people so much that he was asked to appear in a cameo as a vampire in a TV vampire drama. Like it like it.</fullReview>

C'mon, Amy with that huge fangy mouth? who didn't LOVE that?? It sort of scared me the first few times, but come on, I was only about 7 months old. After the first time I watched it over and over and I still do, I watch it average 100 times a year at the very least. I NEVER go through a halloween without seeing this movie. It is fantastic.

		<shortDescription>One of the best vampire movies of the 80's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me the top vampire movie of the 80's was 'The Lost Boys', but this one is up there with the best of them. The 80's saw a deluge of vampire movies, so for these to stand out amongst them was no mean feat.According to Tom Holland, the writer/director of this movie, he wanted to do a movie with 'the boy who cried wolf' as a theme. He also had an interest in vampire stories and so he combined these two elements to create a very enjoyable and original script. Although not entirely true to 'the boy who cried wolf' since Charley did not make up the story before it happened for real, the concept of the movie, that is, a teenager with an interest in B grade horror movies see's a vampire claim a victim and cannot convince his friends of this, holds it's audience throughout the movie.Jerry Dandridge is a prime example of the type of vampire audiences saw in the 80's. He is suave, good - looking and has an eye for beautiful women - thus captilising on the sexual allure of being at the mercy of a being more powerful than yourself who needed your lifeblood to sustain his existence. His bloodlust was satiated by attacking the victim's neck, biting into it and sucking their blood. This also has strong sexual overtones since the neck can be an intimate area and giving or having someone take your blood is the ultimate submissive act since blood is the life. The vampire of the 80's has is own distinct personality and is able to interact as an ordinary citizen in everyday life. This is most unlike the vampire in Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' and FW Murnau's 'Nosferatu' who were more like the vampires of folklore, that is, they had repulsive features and were not much unlike scavenging rodents since they were perceived in past centuries as pests who were plague carriers. Some folklore is still evident in the 80's vampire - a vampire cannot enter your house unless invited, it cannot be seen in mirror's and is fearful of Christian symbols thus showing it for the malignant evil that it is. I believe that Holland has created a sound balance here by not introducing too much human personality traits into Dandridge that is so evident in today's vampires. This may be because he was influenced by the B grade movies since these movies are a strong part of the story. Further evidence of this is the character of Peter Vincent. Chris Sarandon is perfect for the role of Jerry. He has a commanding presence which makes him a powerful adversary for the heroes.Peter Vincent has proved to be the most endearing character and it would be hard to imagine anyone other than Roddy Mcdowall playing the role - Cushing of the 80's. His passing will mean that another sequel will quite rightly have a gaping hole in it which only he could fill. Part of why this is so is because he makes it so believable that he is an actor passionate about his B grade vampire hunter roles. He is the vampire hunter determined to rid the world of these vermin and holds high credibility within that world. This is in stark contrast to the real Peter Vincent who is financially struggling and finds that he is petrified when faced by the real vampire. Although he manages to gather enough courage to face Dandridge, he has to be saved by Charley. He fails to truly overcome his fear, but the audience is drawn to the failed hero who gave it his best shot. He is the underdog that we cheer for.The special effects of this movie also deserve special mention. They add to the B grade feel of the movie since the shape shifting of the vampire is overly grotesque and exaggerated. This is no criticism since this is what Holland wanted to create and thus it blends in rather than overawes.Also of note is the variety of different characters within the movie. You have Evil Ed who is interested in the occult and being a social misfit thus making him easy to seduce for Dandridge. There is Amy who is sexually prudent which makes her a viable victim for the predatory vampire. Charley is the average American teenager who has to grow up quickly if he is to overcome his ancient foe. Finally there is Billy Cole, the ghoul or zombie wholly dedicated to serving his master.The soundtrack is most notable within this movie since it adds to the fun we have at watching the not too serious B grade movie influenced 'Fright Night'. Each track is suited to the scene and accentuates the emotion that Holland is trying to brew. This is particularly well done in the nightclub scene.'Fright Night' is a great popcorn movie and never takes itself seriously. Part of the appeal of this movie is the fact that it has a strong 80's feel to it - catchy soundtrack, hip teenagers, exaggerated special effects much like the exaggerated dress of the 80's such as shoulder pads, wild hairstyles and cheesy one - liners. Having said this, although it is obvious that the cast had fun playing their characters, they acting is of a high enough quality to ensure that this movie did not fall into the B grade abyss.</fullReview>

So during the day a beautiful lady asks him about an address and it happens to be next door. That night he witnesses something strange out his window (Jerry Dandridge has fangs) that the lady has been murdered. The sad thing about this movie was none of Charlie's friends believe that Jerry Dandridge is a vampire. This is because when Charlie and his friends were invited into his house,Mr.Dandridge appear to be very charming. Till Mr.Vincent notices Mr.Dandridge didn't cast a reflection in his mirror. With Mr.Vincent's help who was a famous TV horror show host goes after Mr.Dandridge,and luckily killing him before Charlie's girlfriend is a permanent vampire. But too bad for Ed who was Charlie's best friend and the funniest throughout the movie was murdered. Due to Charlie's friends ignorance lives were taken because they didn't think vampires exist.

		<fullReview>From director Tom Holland ("Child's Play") comes this tale of bisexual vampire Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon of "The Princess Bride") who butts heads with his neighbor Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale of "Herman's Head" fame). "Married With Children" star Amanda Bearse has the tough task of pretending to find Charlie attractive (a job that would be tough enough for a straight woman) and Roddy "Laserblast" McDowall is Cushing Price, I mean, Peter Vincent, a late-night horror host who Charlie enlists in his battle against Jerry. Too bad the movie doesn't take place in Cleaveland, or else the Ghoul could have been the fearless vampire killer.It starts out like a lame "Goosebumps" episode, but gets progressively cooler, climaxing with some great gore effects. I love movies where people are really, really scared, like Don Knotts, and McDowall is great in that capacity.Stephen Geoffreys is pretty good as Evil Ed, and he went on to star in Robert Englund's "976-Evil" as well as "Gay Men In Uniform", "Cock Pit", "Transsexual Prostitues 1 AND 2", "Latin Crotch Rockets", and "Mechanics Bi Day, Lube Job Bi Night". Despite his gay porn career, he's still more respectible than William Ragsdale, who went on to do "Mannequin 2: On the Move".</fullReview>

Vampire violence follows.I always appreciate the attention paid to the legends of the vampire. You know, vampires can't see their reflection, holy water hurts them, sunlight kills them, stake through the heart etc. Too many movies come out and say something stupid like, "Forget what you've seen in the movies! This is how it's done!". "Fright Night" stays true to the legend and makes it much more enjoyable.This movie moves ahead without any slow spots. Vampire moves next door, hero must kill him. Bingo.

Long before Scream launched two awful sequels and a legion of funny horror imitations in the 90s, there was Fright Night. A simple, classic horror story, which was among the first to really bring the vampire legend into the modern American suburbia, in the same tradition as such great modern vampire tales as Stephen King's remarkable novel "Salem's Lot." Roddy McDowall is never better than he is here as the yellow-spined "vampire killer", and Herman's Head star William Ragsdale is really terrific. An underappreciated classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fright Night", even today, seventeen years after first being released into theaters, is still a real treat. It's about what will probably be the most gruesome and horrifying week in the life of Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale), a young suburban teenager who claims that his new next-door neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) and his live-in carpenter, Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark), are vampires. Naturally, when Charlie first discovers this, which is when Jerry is about to kill a beautiful woman, no one believes his story. Not even his mother, his girlfriend, Amy (Amanda Bearse) or his best friend "Evil" Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) will believe him. So what is Charlie going to do? He will call upon a washed-up horror movie star named Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who will battle the undead with him."Fright Night" is a well-acted, funny, and scary vampire film. The special effects are pretty gory, especially for when this movie was made. My personal favorite character will always be "Evil" Ed. I cannot get enough of this guy because he's so funny! If you're ever looking for a nice, scary, and hilarious 80's horror film, check out "Fright Night".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie compares favorably with any horror movie that's been made in the last 25 years, partly because it doesn't take itself real seriously and partly because the teen cast in this one is engaging and talented. The real stars though are MacDowall, Sarandon, and Stark. Roddy brings just the right amount of hamminess and nobility to Peter Vincent while Sarandon and Stark make for one of the creepiest couples in movies.The movie is filled with subtle touches recognizing all the vampire movies that came before and does a great job of integrating vampire "lore" into a world where everyone thinks vampires only exist in the movies.The movie is nicely filmed and the special effects don't seem at all dated.All in all, a great pic. Excellent acting, a witty, intelligent script, good music and visual effects, and a finale that knocks your socks off. I'd give this flick 8 out of 10 stars and I rarely give any movie made in the last 30 years more than 5 or 6.</fullReview>

The actors were great,even though I wasn't too ecstatic about the special effects, they were still pretty good, I mean for 1985!The story line was very appealing too, and not to mention the villain was pretty creepy at times. Another thing that drew me to this movie was the great picture quality. It doesn't have that blurry image that most horror films in the 80's had.

		<shortDescription>My favourite vampire movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great but underrated.It is about a teenage boy who finds out a vampire is living next door to him called Jerry Dandridge.Charlie (the teenage boy) tries to find out more and realises that he's a vampire,but who is going to believe him. As night falls,under the cover of darkness he goes after Charlie.The only person who can help Charlie is Peter Vincent,a vampire tv show host,even Charlie can't pursuade him. Charlie sets out to kill Jerry and then things get out of hand. Fright night is a very stylish (for the time it was made) vampire movie which is just as hilarious as it is scary. Jerrys (Chris Sarandon) character looks very young and great in the film along with the other characters.The make up is done better than I have seen it done in any other movie.It goes great all the way through the film and the performances are superb,why the film isn't as popular I don't know.I rate 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lethal vampire moves into a large suburban mansion, and the young boy next door sets out to destroy him. He gets invaluable help from Peter Vincent, a TV-personality working on a low-rated monster show called Fright Night.This teenage-vampire movie has it all: Truly frightening transformation-scenes, spot-on jokes, outlandish visual effects (Richard Edlund of Star Wars fame and John Bruno - Terminator 2, Titanic, the Abyss, Ghostbusters), outstanding actors: Roddy McDowall, expertly hamming it up as the TV-presenter/ vampire-hunter Peter Vincent, Chris Sarandon, really cool and dangerous as the vampire, pre-Bundy Amanda Bearse as love interest, and Stephen Geoffreys whose creepy, high-pitched laughter has no equal.Sexy, funny and campy to the bone, Fright Night is something to watch when you want to treat yourself to something special. I love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of the horror genre, there are few, particularly slasher flicks and monster flicks. The ones I prefer are the more pyschological horrors such as the Sixth sense, that aren't so in your face from minute one. This however I did enjoy, I wasn't expecting to but since it had a good rating in my TV guide I thought I would watch it anyway. Where this differs from similar flicks based on boogy men type characters, this being basedd a vampire, is that the acting is actually quite good. I mean looking at for instance the Nightmare on Elm streets you see that the acting is terrible in them, but this was surprisingly good from a teen horror film. William Ragsdale is good as Charlie Brewster the boy who becomes obsessed with his next door neighbour because he thinks he's a Vampire, he is of course right but initially no one believes him including his girlfriend played by Married with Childrens very own Amanda Bearse. She is good in this and looks very nice in a cute sort of a way. She is following a typical horror trend where a woman in her late 20's plays a teen. The film never takes itself seriously, which a film of this type really shouldn't. It is funny but manages to chill at the same time mainly thanks to the incredble performance by Chris Sarandon, he is excellent as Jerry Dandridge the Vampire, he is sauve, and devilishly evil it really is a scene stealing performance. Overall the film is an enjoyable horrer, sure theres little plot to right home about but its fun and has your classic 80's monster and gore effects. Certainly it beats most of the genre and unsurprisingly is somewhat of a cult hit. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great VAMPIRE movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was totally 80s and done VERY well. The main reasons I like this MOVIE is for the reason that I am that person's age. At least, when the movie came out in 86, I was 16, about the age of the hero. He plays a person who catches his neighbor doing some seriously weird stuff. So, he gets too nosey and the vampire comes over and meets his mother (thus being invited into the house). That's when the fun starts. The vampire is played by a rather handsome man who can make the women turn to jello or putty in his hands. The excitment in this movie is never ending and the movie never tires. I have seen it over 20 times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best about "Fright Night" :-Great acting : Roddy Mc Dowall is one of the best actors to appear in a horror movie. His character is the wise Peter Vincent "the vampire killer". Mc Dowall's performance steals the movie. Then we have Academy Award nominee Chris Sarandon. Sarandon's character (Jerry Dandridge) is the spinal cord of the movie, because he's the vamprie that stalks Charlie Brewster (William Ragsddale), his friend Evil Ed, and his girlfriend (played by young Amanda Bearse). Another but less important character, Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) does a nice job as Dandridge's vampire bodyguard. -Kick ass special effects! : The F/X in this are incredible, can be compared with actual F/X in any movie. The make-up is great too, Sarandon and Bearse look scary while being caracterized.-An effective score. The music is pure 80's! Cool stuff!-A creepy atmosphere : Dandridge's house looks very creepy, specially the basement and the stairway.IN OVERALL, "Fright Night" is one of the best vampire movies EVER made. Watch it only if you wanna be scared, and get into vampire stuff.A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FRIGHT NIGHT is an excellent vampire movie for any horror movie fan to consider. The movie stars Chris Sarandon (Child's play) as the blood thirsty vampire, and Roddy McDowall (The Mad hatter from Batman the animated series) as the dubious vampire hunter from a T.V. show "Fright Night" who later turns out to understand something about vampire hunting. The acting is superb, we get excellent performances from all every cast, especially from Charlie Brewster, Roddy Mcdowall and Chris Sarandon. The script is cleverly written as well, much of the dialogues are interesting and the events are laid out perfectly well that it doesn't leave you to yawn for a minute. The movie also has great special effects (loved the part where Jerry Dandridge turns into a bat shown in a silhouette form) and the scenes where Jerry casts no reflection in the mirrors are awesome. I have only one thing to say about this movie, WATCH IT, you'll be pleased with it! Other recommendations: John carpenter's VAMPIRES, its another vampire flick thats also worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like "The Company Of Wolves", Fright Night is one of those rare films which does not sit comfortably in any genre but rather creates one of its own; horror/comedy.It updates the traditional vampire story by having the vampire move in [at night]next door to Charlie Brewster and his mum,and soon the female residents of Charlies town are dropping like flies! The vampire ,Jerry Dandridge is impossibly cool,suave and sophisticated and aided by his "familiar" Billy Cole. Charlie teams up with his friend Evil Ed [superbly played by Stephen Geoffries],girlfriend Amy and an aging horror movie star Peter Vincent to send Jerry back to hell.Sounds like fun? You bet! The script crackles with biting wit,great performances from a talented cast and a fabulous score especially during the "seduction"scene in Jerrys" bedroom.I suppose the special effects are a wee bit dated now,but since all we see nowadays are po-faced "horror" movies with puny CGI effects,who cares?Critics tend to deride the 1980s for cheesy music and hairstyles,but what will the 2020 verdict be on 2002? Favourite Dialogue--Peter Vincent "BACK! Spawn of Satan!--Jerry Dandridge "Ah ha ha ha ha Oh really?" 10/10</fullReview>

The guy shoulda got nominated for a best supporting Oscar for it or at least a Golden Globe!Fright Night tells the story of a teenager who thinks a vampire may have moved next door to him. The flick has a simple good premise and is highly well written, directed and acted. Chris Sarandon's portrayal of the vampire is first rate too. He portrays just the right amount of menace and tongue in cheek humor. William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall are perfectly cast too. As is yummy Amanda Bearse.Major congrats goto writer-director Todd Holland as well. Now hey, how's about a Fright Night 3: Evil Ed Lives! How's about a plot where Evil Ed tracks down Charlie Brewster and wants revenge on him for killing his vampire master from the first Fright Night? And get Malcolm McDowell to play the part of the late Roddy McDowall's brother. I'd pay major bucks to see that, Jack!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the classic tale of the boy who cried wolf yet wasn't and no one would believe him. This film has several role reversals...a mom who acts like david doyle in CAPRICORN ONE...a sarcastic mom....and a son trying to grow up too fast. The film was also a religious morality tale and possible metaphor. The hero this PETER VINCENT finds renewed faith in himself and in a higher power when confronting the demonic powers of the vampire played by CHRIS SARANDON. The key note to sarandons appeal in this film is his sex appeal with the women complete with disarming charm and utter ruthlessness as a villian who consorts with satan. One of the best and most beleivable vampire movies ever made. FRIGHT NIGHT mixes tounge in cheek humor with scares and suspense. A film that has emotional pay off in the end of the film and a film that goes well above schlock horror. Of note is the humorous "movie within a movie" spoofs of hammer films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vampire flick with real bite, fang you very much!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silent ghoul Max Schreck and, of course, the incomparable Bela Lugosi were the earliest creatures of the night to nail down the vampire image successfully on film. Then the infinite (and mostly inferior) sequels rolled in, together with Hammer Studios' gruesome, yet anemic British series courtesy of Christopher Lee. In fact, over the years everybody's pretty much gotten into the act, including Drac's 'extended' family (`Dracula's Widow,' `Dracula's Daughter,' even `Dracula's Dog'!). In the 70s, Hollywood offered some fresh new blood: Frank Langella gave the Count smouldering sex appeal, Jack Palance added new dimension and insight, and George Hamilton went for laughs.Ready to sink your teeth into something different? Welcome to `Fright Night,' a 1985 version, and the very charismatic Chris Sarandon, who casts an altogether new reflection (sorry) on this centuries-old fly-by-night. Sarandon (yes, actress Susan's ex-) manages to combine the best of Langella and Hamilton, making his vampire not only entertaining, but charming, sexy and downright lethal. It's a tasty Drac he's packaged and it's his interp that highlights (as it should) this alternately scary and amusing spoof. Adeptly written and directed by Tom Holland (`Child's Play'), Holland tones down on the gore and instead hooks us in with a twisty, tongue-in-cheek plot, an assured style and point of view, and plenty of character interest.Set in a typical folksy town, fresh-faced William Ragsdale plays a teenage horror film enthusiast who begins to suspect the new male couple on the other side of the fence are not your standard neighborly types. Firmly convinced that beautiful young victims are entering the house at night but leaving in trash bags by dawn and that other insidious, paranormal happenings are occurring in and about the house, it's another thing to try to persuade those closest to him that a cross and necklace of garlic would not be a bad thing to carry around in a fanny pack. His girlfriend (Amanda Bearse), buddy (Stephen Geoffreys), mom (Dorothy Fielding) and even the police (led by Art Evans) believe his sightings are the product of an overactive imagination. In the meantime, the body count starts to rise.In a last ditch effort to find a true believer, Ragsdale prevails upon the expertise of his idol, Peter Vincent, the Fearless Vampire Killer, played with broad temerity by the late Roddy McDowell. A one-time popular `B' film actor, Vincent has been reduced to parodying himself in full regalia (not unlike Elvira) as a TV horror host. And here's where the REAL fun begins...Ragsdale as Charley (the Jonathan Harker role) possesses the right mixture of earnestness and angst for this amateur vampire slayer. Proving once and for all that 'curiosity killed the bat' (sorry, again), we're with our young hero all the way. And will everybody please stop bashing Amanda Bearse as Ragdale's gal pal? Her Amy is nice and natural compared to the innocuous Tiffany-Amber Thiessen all-boobs-and-no-brains types were used to being force-fed. She has a feisty, tomboyish appeal at the beginning which provides a fine contrast in later scenes when our Mina succumbs to Drac and starts to primp up provocatively. Nobody ever complained about her fine work here and in `All My Children' until AFTER she came out of the closet. Give her a break, people.Geoffrey's Evil Ed, the school's prime weirdo, is appropriately outrageous and irksome as the pal who goads Charley on and derides him rather cruelly for his suspicions. Eventually he evokes a bit of sympathy as he 'lives' to eat his words. McDowell, at his most effete and harried, is given a prime featured assignment after scads of rather colorless roles. As the reticent, timorous Van Helsing counterpart who is forced to deal with his dauntless celluloid image, McDowell lets it all hang out in fun, superficial fashion.But it's still Sarandon's show -- his sleek gestures and toying, glib remarks anxiously awaited for. We miss him whenever he's off screen. His transformation scenes are quite effective, yet he has the confidence to embellish even those with a mock sense of humor. And dig that coy relationship with his very un-Renfield-like `partner' Billy (Jonathan Stark), which has a vague, teasing sexual charge to it.One minor flaw: the 'disco' flavored musical score tends to date it. But, in every other way, it holds up. A real sleeper in my book, this runs neck-and-neck with my other favorite of the period "The Lost Boys".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a decent vampire flick 15+ years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to re-catch this on AMC and still find Fright Night a decent vampire flick. It doesn't go the easy route of turning its vampire antagonist into a punk-types who's "with it" in the latest goth-style (see Lost Boys, Dracula 2000, Dusk til Dawn, etc.), but has Chris Sarandon show why Dracula could have been viewed as a seductive, evil yet believable presence whether Drac is in the 19th century or the 20th. Instead of doing a "modern" vampire, Sarandon plays a character who shows why vampires are timeless seductive evil and don't have to be up with today's styles to pull it off.There's also lots of little injokes, from Dandridge whistling "Strangers in the Night" to his obsession with apples (harking back to Eden and the serpent and the apple), to his fixation with clocks (wouldn't you?) to the vague kind of bisexual relationship he has with a wacko Jonathan Stark as Billy Cole.Roddy McDowell is the other half of the show, managing to be impressive, petty, egotistical ("What could be more important then an interview?" - "Oh, well I could see how a boy's life _might_ be more important."), desperate ("How _much_ money?"), all too humanly flawed, and heroic. McDowell flashes through all of these emotions sometimes in the space of seconds, and shows why he was always a class act.The rest of the cast is okay. Amanda Bearse must have fun looking back at this, her only attempt that I can remember at being a female romantic lead. A little of Stephen Geoffreys goes a long way, and ditto for William Ragsdale, who I never really have liked. He spends way too much time in full-blown panic mode here to be very sympathetic - you end up wondering what kind of idiot this guy is.It's pretty much those six actors for the most part - everyone else is pretty much forgettable. Sure there's some weird moments (Charley and Amy discussing their aborted sex life 20' away from Charley's mom), and the "Boy who cried wolf" thing goes on _way_ too long.Overall, though, I'd still recommend this movie to those who want to see that vampires don't have to be punk to be impressive.</fullReview>

I caught this the other night on - believe it or not - American Movie Classics. I didn't see the lead-in but this film was about as classic as crap on a cracker.Horrible, cheeseball acting, utterly stupid characters, and to top it off, Amanda "Marcy Darcy" Bearse from "Married with Children" is the female lead! Yeah, real sexy. **Spoilers** She looks like a boy the entire movie, then she gets turned into a vamp and is actually kinda sexy, then she recovers and goes back to looking like an ugly boy. Of course, a lot of women had those ugly haircuts in the 80s, only she STILL has it. But I digress. Let's see. What else sucks about this movie. Oh, well the holes in the plot you could drive a truck through, the scenery-chewing death throes every murdered character goes through (I think they were trying to set some kind of record), the "it's over now - or is it..." ending, the list goes on. I recommend you rent this only if you like making fun of bad movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really is a great movie. I loved every minute of it. William Ragsdale plays Charlie Brewster, a horror film fanatic who believes his next door neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire. He tries to convince his friends, (Played by pre Married with Children star Amanda Bearse, and Stephen Geoffreys) but of course, they don't believe him. (Would You?) He turns to his idol, a B movie actor named Peter Vincent (An Excellent Roddy McDowall) for help, as Vincent is supposedly a fearless vampire killer, but naturally, Vincent doesn't believe him either. Of course, Dandrige IS a vampire, and it is up to Charlie and Peter Vincent to try and stop him.Really, fright night is more of a comedy that a horror film. McDowall's character of the B movie actor is very well written. In the best scene of the film, after killing one of the vampires, Vincent breaks down and weeps. Peter Vincent is NOT a vampire killer. He's just a B-movie actor who has been roped into this situation because he feels it is his duty to help. And Roddy McDowall establishes that point extremely well.The movie eventually follows the "Hunt the Vampire" movie formula, with Chris Sarandon playing the movie's Dracula, and Roddy McDowall playing the movie's Van Helsing. And it very effectively wraps up the movie's third act.As to the actors, Chris Sarandon is excellent as the vampire, William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse, and Stephen Geoffreys play their teen roles extremely well, (Though Geoffrey's occasionally underacts) but Roddy McDowall steals the show as Peter Vincent.This is a must see for fans of the vampire genre. You won't be disappointed.10/10***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't explain it. Fright Night is just so much fun. Scary and sweet. Why does it succeed when really, it's kinda cheesy and seems to be geared toward high schoolers? Again, I don't know. But it does manage to rise to the level of almost greatness in an odd kind of way. Roddy McDowell - I wish he was still here. He was particularly sweet in this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet again another horror/comedy that I don't like that much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of ****When it comes to horror/comedies, I find myself feeling a little split. I enjoyed The Return of the Living Dead and its sequel, but I found Re-Animator slightly dull at times and Scream to hardly be well...a scream. Fright Night isn't so different. It's never scary, and it's not nearly as funny as I had hoped it would be. I suppose the end result is rather middling, it's neither truly bad or good.Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) notices something odd about his neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon). One night, he spies on Dandridge and another man moving a coffin around. Then, he notices a prostitute enter his house, and later the next day she's been found murdered. Charlie begins to suspect Dandridge is a vampire, but can find no one, neither his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) nor odd friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) to believe him.Finally, he tries to enlist the help of horror movie star Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), who initially thinks he's crazy but begins to believe when he notices that Dandridge doesn't cast a reflection. Meanwhile, Amy is being seduced by Dandridge, much to Charlie's dismay. It then becomes a matter of time before she will become a vampire and he and Vincent try to reach her and kill Dandridge before the transformation can complete.Fright Night isn't really that much of a waste of time. There are far, far worse vampire films out there and the fact that this one doesn't take itself seriously doesn't hurt matters. However, I expected a lot more laughs than what I got. As a matter of fact, I remember laughing hard twice, chuckling a couple of times, and a smiling a few other times, but that's about it. I did love the scene with Ed inside Charlie's mother's bed, since it broke every horror cliche in the book, yet I can't help wonder why more jokes weren't added into the film. It doesn't help matters that the movie isn't particularly scary, not that it aims to be but it would help. The film suffers from far too many slow moments, mostly from extended 80's dance scenes that are unbearable, as well as a cheesy 80's soundtrack that's a pain to listen to. There's even a death scene that feels like it's going on forever. Eventually, the movie does get reasonably exciting in the last 20 or so minutes but that feels a little late, especially for a movie that's a 105 minutes long. There's no real suspense present, either. Let's face it, the final outcome is never in doubt, despite an attempt at an ambiguous final scene. Sarandon's Dandridge doesn't really feel that menacing and he sure takes his sweet time trying to bide his plan. He executes his plans so slowly, any chance of tension developing is killed. The pacing sure as heck needed better work.Those aren't the only problems. The movie has an annoying 80's feel to it just about the whole way through. There's also a scene where Charlie asks Ed about how to get rid of a vampire, despite the fact that it had already been established that Charlie was a huge fan of vampire flicks. A mistake like that feels a little unacceptable in a movie like this.The performances, however, are fairly enjoyable to watch. William Ragsdale is pretty good and sympathetic as the unwitting protagonist. Chris Sarandon initially is a lot of fun to watch, but doesn't get quite as much sharp dialogue as the movie rolls along. Stephen Geoffreys is the most amusing as Evil Ed, and also the most annoying (but in a semi-good sense). Amanda Bearse is so-so, all she really does is play the damsel in distress. Highly overrated, though, is Roddy McDowall, who's hardly funny or compelling as Peter Vincent. The character's just plain unlikable and he brings the film down a bit.Tom Holland wrote and directed the movie. Initially, he seems to make some good jabs at horror film cliches but the film grows weary and dull as it chugs along. Until the finale, he rarely tries to up the excitement or humor factor, keeping things moving at something of a plodding pace. But the ending is something to admire when it comes to special effects. The exploding and melting bodies are a sight to behold and are gruesomely fun to watch. I've heard a lot of comments about how Fright Night is the best vampire film ever made. When it comes to this subgenre, I'm not a very huge fan, possibly because they're almost always the same when it comes to certain plot elements. Vampires are so rarely scary, for some odd reason. Sure, Fright Night aims purely for campy-style humor, but it doesn't really hit that mark, either. A sequel was made, which I've seen before, but can hardly remember anything about it except for more bad 80's music and more vampires. I'm not sure I'd want to give that movie another look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slick, cunning thriller with a package to be unwrapped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night is without a doubt a shrewd thriller with suspense on the low and humorous horror on the high. My whole family watched it and enjoyed it likewise. I must have seen it at least ten times. The movie is about a typical teenager who suspects his next-door neighbor is a vampire because of strange dissapearances of women that visited him. The boy is in fact right of his premonition. He enlists the aid of a once vampire killer, only famous for his work in the movies, to help hunt Dracula down and kill him. It takes a while for the kid to convince, but once accomplished, they all set out to do their vampire hunting. This intelligent but simplistic horror film moves calmly and delivers the scares when needed, and sick humor when invited. Chris Sarandon does a fantastic job as Dracula himself(Suave and clever). Jonathan Stark works to his best potential as the live-in undertaker(Caretaker)for the vampire. The remaining casts...William Ragsdale, Stephen Geoffreys, and Roddy Mcdowall show what they are capable of bringing tension and some form of amusement to their character. The score works well with the style of the film and direction savvy. If you enjoy old-fashioned vampire cult films, add this one to your list. Rated ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool horror flick from the classic 80's that made us get that feel good feeling at the same time want to be scared.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how many times I've seen Fright Night maybe they are countless. If you grew up in the 80's this is a film that you remember seeing. Since then Fright Night has grew in popularity it continues to be shown all over TV. The film just has that dark and scary look to it. Every minute is filled with suspense as William Ragsdale proves along with an aging TV horror show host Roddy McDowall that his next door neighbor is a vampire. Chris Sarandon plays the vampire role just brilliant. Fright Night features the blood, fangs, and killings that are all so common to the life of a vampire. The 80's is well represented also the film looks just like the times back then. Fright Night is a horror classic that sure put the modern day vampire back in business, so continue to check out this 80's horror classic and have fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a dandy horror movie that spoofs itself at the same time that it offers some good chills. There is an interesting cast and some truly spooky atmosphere. Humor is well used both to counterbalance the horror and to make the horror more powerful.Roddy McDowell lends credibility with a most enjoyable performance as Peter Vincent, "the Great Vampire Killer," from old movies who must become a real vampire killer in order to regain his self-respect. Chris Sarandon is sly and cunning as the nasty villain you love to hate. Stephen Geoffreys is surprisingly good at giving us a rare combination of nerdiness, comic relief, and tragic pathos.This is definitely a good Halloween movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very enjoyable film. Maybe not as scary as its tagline ("If you love being scared it'll be the night of your life") or the spooky poster (the one with the vampire's face floating above the Dandridge house) would suggest, Fright Night is far more successful as easy-going entertainment. The 18 certificate it got in the UK is ridiculous, as the tone of the film is lighthearted and only occasionally dark and eerie, like The Lost Boys. Even though The Lost Boys is more ambitious, imaginative and original, Fright Night is probably a more consistent film with a better script. The acting is pretty good, the contemporary soundtrack ranges from the amusingly dated to the admittedly brilliant, the special effects are decent (from the GhostBusters crew:not surprising since the vampire bat looks a little like the terrordog from that film)and the balancing of horror and comedy is very well judged. The story premise is an absolute peach, and the scriptwriters have done it justice, building up the suspenseful plot to a spectacular climax. William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys make for a sympathetic bunch of victims, while Roddy McDowall is very funny in a well written part. Of course the most important character is the vampire, and the talented Chris Sarandon from Dog Day Afternoon is the perfect bloodsucker: the film moves into top gear whenever he's around. For those who loved The Lost Boys and GhostBusters this is highly reccomended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fright Night is a great mix of horror and humor. By 1985, I thought I would never again see a horror movie that was not completely predicated on violence and gore. But Tom Holland came through like gangbusters with Fright Night. This movie is a throwback--a creepy horror flick with minimal gore, great performances, and effective chills. William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowell are fantastic as Charley, the boy living next door to a vampire, and Peter Vincent, the third-rate actor pretending to be a vampire killer. The supporting cast is excellent as well, especially Sarandon as the long-toothed neighbor. There are just too many good scenes to pick a favorite, and the ending is a good as I have ever scene in a vampire movie. If you like a little scare, but don't like being grossed out by gratuitous gore, this is a sure bet. They don't make them like this anymore, but, then again, I said that back in 1985 too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hip 80's Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night is a film that tries hard to be cool.Main character Charlie lives as an only child with a mother that turns a blind eye to his sexual and social development, and holds a similar treatment to his room-- that kind that every teenagers dreams of having but is denied by his parents, with the horror film nostalgia covering every bare inch of both wall and table.Dracula here loses the cape, the white makeup, and takes on a hip, older-man personage that will naturally drive the young girls wild. Looking like he just stepped off of poster that some girl pinned above her bed, Dandridge carries a strong aura of sexuality and mystique, as is required of such a dark character. Despite the subtle homosexual nature of his relationship with his human accomplice in crime, which is debatable as imagined or not, he is quite a lady's man, in essence, the complete opposite of inexperienced, high-pitched Charlie.Essentially, the setup is that this film was intended for teens, and although the fashions (as with almost all things 80's) have quickly become outdated, the ideas still remain the same. Instead of the pretentious Gothic hue that most vampire movies fall into, this one just tries to be a hip, fun movie to watch.Peter Vincent, the over-the-hill horror movie star, states in one scene that nobody cared anymore about vampires, that people only wanted to see serial killers in ski masks chopping up campers. He was right on, as many of the 80's horror films had become mindless slash fests that took themselves too seriously with the "teens get laid, then teens get slashed" formula that was recycled throughout those countless sequels. Fright Night just tries to be hip, have a little fun, and thumb its nose at those other horror flicks.Overlook the bad laughs that 80's trends can induce, mind the annoyance that is Charlie Brewster (do all of his lines have to end in exclamation points? "I hate exclamation points!"-Elaine Benes) and enjoy some particularly good special effects.</fullReview>

As well as being a great film it also has one of the best ever movie soundtracks with the main songs that stand out for me by Ian Hunter - "Good man in a bad time" and Evelyn King - "Give It Up".

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of the 80's Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a question in my mind, Fright Night stands out as one of the best horror film of the 80's, that in itself is a honor but then the 80's was the decade of numerous Freddy, Michael Myers, and Jason films(YUCK! and YIKES!) Fright Night blends genuine scares with a generous dose of comedy/spoof. The script, the acting, the sets, etc are all first-rate. The special effects are also well-done for the most part, although at times a bit over the top. The story concerns a young man that lives next to a vampire and what ensues when he faces him for what he is. William Ragsdale does a good job as the young man Charlie, who along with his two friends(one played by Amanda Bearse of Married With Children fame) enlist the aid of a late-nite horror host affectionately named Peter Vincent(an obvious homage to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price). Screen veteran Roddy McDowell has a chance to flex his acting muscles and his charm as the former vampire killer of filmdom confronting a real vampire. McDowell's performance is one of depth and worth a look at the film alone. The vampire in this film is played by Chris Sarandon and he is excellent as a somewhat atypical undead. Fright Night is a reel treat to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Check this out if you like Reanimator and American Werewolf in London. This is a fun film with a great deal of gore and violence and like the two mentioned above its a black comedy which also laughs at itself. Chris Sarandon gives perhaps his best filmed performance and creates one of the great screen vampires, but unlike other memorable movie vampires makes you laugh into the bargain. There is an implication that Dandridge and his "pal" may have more than a professional relationship, "Evil Ed" is surely written as gay, and three of the actors in the film ARE/were gay. In spite of the gay references I don't believe a connection to AIDS and vampires is being made. (as in FFCoppola's Dracula film). Fright Night shows that blood and gore can be great fun and the recent comedy starring Seth Green and Devin Sawa proves it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First saw it in the eighties with a friend who then mysteriously disappeared to this day (alright, he went to Spain, but that's the next best thing to disappearing.) This amazing load of old codswallop boasts some dodgy direction by Tom Holland, the man who brought you the seminal 'The Langoliers'. Would Charley suddenly start whistling as he was called downstairs by his mother while in terror of his life from vampires? How did his vampirised girlfriend Amy manage to get out of the locked room and come down the stairs to the basement when it was daybreak? She would have been burnt to a crisp. Also what vampire would be dumb enough to move into a busy residential street and then bite someones neck with the curtain open? Blaming Charley for exposing his secret was a bum rap. Anything with Roddy McDowell can't be all bad but he overacts here, although that's nothing compared to Stephen Geoffreys' bizarre performance as Evil Ed. Amy's line, "cut it out Evil, it's not funny" had the opposite effect in the cinema I was in. Chris Sarandon's a laugh though. Fun seeing it again but I've decided to give the vampires a rest for a while (right, Alistair?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FRIGHT NIGHT was not your ordinary vampire movie. The film had a sense of humor and was a modern retelling of "the little boy who cried wolf". In this film we have a young man with a over-active imagination, who stumbles across a REAL vampire living across the street from him.....naturally, no one believes him. The man enlists the help of a washed up "Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee" style horror movie star, who hosts a local tv late night horror movie show. The young man, having seen him in a slew of "vampire killer" movies, believes he may be the real deal and might be able to help him. The washed up guy (RODDY MCDOWELL) takes the kid's money (he just got fired from the station) and thinks he'll just play along.....come to find out the vampire is real!! Both the characters get sucked into a supernatural ADVENTURE that was shockingly, well written. The characters are incredibly life like, and CHRIS SARANDON, gives a great performance as the vampire. The film has another context to it though....it's a commentary on self esteem and the importance of having faith in one's self. By the end of the film the young many has the affections of his favorite movie hero and the Roddy McDowell character, has found worth within himself and someone who has faith in him.</fullReview>

When I was a kid I happened to see this movie on Cable and I was a bit scared of it back then, but for some reason it became our favorite movie between my best friend and I (I miss you Rob if your out there). That says a lot seeing as how I'm am not, generally, a fan of horror films. This movie, however, has a humorous flavor and that keeps me coming back to it. It pokes fun at it's horror roots while at the same time managing to convey it plot seriously.This movie still could have fallen on it's face without the right casting, luckily, it has it. William Ragsdale does a good job with the "typical teenager" against the non-believing world role. The real stars of this movie are Chris Sarandon, the suave vampire next door, Stephen Geofferys, as the main character's oddball outcast friend, and Roddy McDowall as the out of work B-movie "vampire killer" whose old role has become a bit too much his persona. McDowall deserves a special mention because he makes his character so human and real, while Geofferys does a fantastic job in his creepingly funny off the wall role. On the whole, the chemistry between the actors is very strong and noticeable, and most importantly, you get the sense that everyone is having fun in their role , which is what really pulls this movie off. This is a well executed movie that both young and old can enjoy, and I urge almost anyone to look past it's genre and give it a chance.</fullReview>

They're both GREAT actors, but this is the best work I have ever seen them do. I've watched it at least 100 times and it's still interesting, fun, and captivating.

		<fullReview>This is a well handled hybrid of horror and comedy. Fright Night works just as a horror film, but the comedy brings an extra dimension. Sarandon sure makes a suave vampire. The best part of this film is the excellent performance by Roddy McDowell. His doubting television vampire killer is a winner. A well recommended horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best vampire movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the best vampire ever made. I remember watching it when I was younger and liking it a lot, so I wanted to see it again. I was not disappointed. It was great! The casting and acting was great, and the special effects are remarkable for 1985. Also, the mixture of satire with its spooky story was done very well. The soundtrack was also really good, but it is unfortunately out of print. Roddy McDowall is right on the mark as Peter Vincent. If you pay attention to the clips shown of Vincent in his vampire movies, you can see just how silly they are, it is actually very funny. The sequence with Amanda Bearse and Chris Sarandon in the dance club is great! Totally 80's! William Ragsdale stars as Charlie Brewster, a boy who suspects an evil blood-sucker has moved in next door. This movie seems to have certain undertones, which you might be able to figure out while watching. Check this movie out. It's definately worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was easily the best vampire film of the '80's! Chris Sarandon's sleek performance of Jerry Dandridge is a masterful portrayal of charming evil. The supporting cast, mainly the underated and underused Stephen Geoffreys, is also top notch. The films sets, tone, music, and overall feel is perfect for the mid-'80's and it's old horror roots are also very enjoyable and nostalgic.

The soundtrack to the movie was awesome but 80% of all 80's movies had great soundtracks so it's no surprise. Chris Sarandon was also great as Jerry Daindridge which was an excellent role for him and William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse gave good performances also.

		<shortDescription>Vampire Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Holland brings to the screen a classic vampire tale, filled with cool and fun atmospheres and humor mixed with tons of fantastic and creepy make-up effects. Columbia Pictures has made three spectacular vampire films, FRIGHT NIGHT, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA and JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES, Vampires comes close with it's Carpenter-style score that rocks the house and vampire-hunting techniques that overcome every previous vampire-hunting film including FRIGHT NIGHT... still FRIGHT NIGHT is sometimes forgettable, but ranks up there in the all time greatest vampire flicks and is limitless fun!!!!! This movie perhaps has cheesy elements, but not for it's time, just for audiences now. Tom Holland went on to direct another one of my favorite horror films, Child's Play. His latest horror direction was THINNER. The late Roddy McDowall and the rest of the cast put on great acting! Very real. Hopefully, very, very hopefully we will see this popular vampire classic on DVD! This movie never lets up on its entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about fun and fright and more fun!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the first vampire movies that I saw, and I absolutely loved it. As a teenager at the time, I watched it over and over and always wanted to check out my neighbors...just in case! It's a fun movie. Not very frightening, but definitely fun. I loved the cast. There wasn't a one that I thought didn't fit the part they played. It was William Ragsdale's (ABC's "Brother's Keeper") start and he's only matured through all his roles. Chris Sarandon was great...sensual and funny and dark. You could see that he was troubled by his somewhat lonely existence that only his best friend and ghoul Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) could understand. Amy (Amanda Bearse) was wholesomely cute, became sensual at the touch of the vampire then went back to cute by the end...only not so wholesome as before. Roddy McDowall (gods rest his beautiful soul--we'll all miss his talent) was perfect as that Fearless Vampire Killer. I think he definitely gives Elvira a run for her money as a horror movie host. The only one I haven't touched yet is the adorable and creepy Evil Ed (played by Stephen Geoffreys). His character is one of the best and the one most changed and matured by what he goes through. I loved him then and I love him now. I really think that he was one of the best characters in the movie.The movie is great, the soundtrack is great...buy it. Rent it. Just watch it over and over!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all, this movie is worth seeing. Unfortunately, the villain comes off as far more sympathetic than the hero. It would have been far better with more exploration of Jerry Dandridge's motivations and plans (it's actually unclear whether he wants Amy, the heroine, as his consort or just wants her to help him kill the hero), and more character development for every character. Much was touched on that should have been explored. Also, the gruesome special effects were unnecessary and way overused. In summary, I will recommend this movie to anyone who's not squeamish, with a slight sigh of regret for what it *could* have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic 80's Horror Flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night is a classic 80's horror film. It's a shame that it's taken me so long to actually see it, I always passed it off thinking it was a crappy low rent horror movie. Boy was I wrong, here is a film that mixes comedy, horror and great special effects.The film is about a young kid who loves vampires (yet somehow doesn't know about garlic and stakes until someone tells him?) and finds out that his neighbour is exactly that. When no one believes him he takes it upon himself to put a stop to the vampire's vampire ways.Compared to the other classic 80's vampire flick The Lost Boys, Fright Night doesn't stand a chance, it simply doesn't have as strong characters, scenes or entertainment. BUT, Fright Night is still an entertaining cheesy film that should be watched by people who love the genre.The special effects are pretty sweet, specifically when one character is staked and is stuck mid transformation between man and wolf. Although the actor who played this character has an incredibly annoying laugh that will get on your nerves.Chris Sarandon is the vampire in question, you may remember as Humperdinck from The Princess Bride. He does a great job at being seductive and cool all while still being menacing in his looks. Roddy McDowall is the vampire slayer (on TV) and is hilarious in this role, the man is terrified to be in this situation, but gets the job done when he has to.This is Tom Holland's best film, he came close with Child's Play, but Fright Night is a film that you can watch more then once. The camp in Fright Night is perfect and everything works so well. Fright Night may not be as good as Lost Boys, but you will not be disappointed with it, it's just a fun film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feeling like a time warp now, but oh so much fun and frights.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewing this for the first time in 20 years really put a smile on my face, now I know that for after having just watched a horror film that may not be the best guideline you will ever read, but the film has it's tongue firmly in cheek and it doesn't come up short on the thrill factor.You will read other reviews stating that the film is a little cheesy and a little dated, and sure, in this day and age of gorno and ultimate slash kill death murder movies, the film can be judged as tame alongside the big box office ghoul movies. But from a personal point of view I got such a kick out of watching a good honest genre piece that shows love, care, and entertainment rolled into one movie. Perhaps I'm the old fart who is so desensitised to blood horror these days? Perhaps I live in the past too much? So what? It matters not because as long as there are delightful genre pieces like this to remind me that the 80s horror crowd had some knowing style, then I'm a happy bunny.Cute teens embroiled in Vampire next door plot is about the make up of the film. No one believes the central guy of the piece (William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster}, but he convinces TV Vampire Slayer Peter Vincent {Roddy McDowell} to join his quest to rid the neighbourhood of the murdering menace living next door. The film has the love interest in peril {Amanda Bearse}, it has the grossly annoying best friend {Stephen Geoffreys}-and boy is he annoying! And it has all the homages to the horror classics gone by you could wish to have.Such guts and gusto went into making this film I felt like clapping at the end. It's aware of it's horror competition when you catch some of the dialogue, so it should never be allowed to become a perceived cheesy relic, because this is 1985 and it rocks for those that remember when horror had a glint in its eye instead of a sabre thru its head. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How wonderful! A cross between the old-fashioned vampire flicks and '80s teen movies! In this case, Southern California teen Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) suspects that his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a member of the undead. Naturally, nobody believes this. So, Charley's friends Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse) and "Evil" Edward Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys) convince horror star Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) to acquaint Charley with Jerry. Needless to say, Jerry doesn't do anything vampire-like during the meeting, but Charley isn't convinced. As you may have guessed, Jerry has a few "bites" throughout the movie.It's just silly entertainment for the most part, but it doesn't pretend to be anything else.I suppose that "Fright Night" can also lay claim to being the movie where Cornelius from "Planet of the Apes" met Prince Humperdinck from "The Princess Bride".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1st half was good 2nd half not so much!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first half of the film when the lead character is being thrown around by Chris Sarandon and he tries to warn people who don't believe him. The first half was suspenseful and satisfying to watch a vampire who shows no sign of giving up trying to kill the lead. It all quickly declines though when the lead's girlfriend becomes the center of it all and this really took away from the film because I don't give a darn if the female characters die I'd rather see a male vampire go against the male lead. The second half was a real disappointment because the 2nd half should of been all about the vampire trying to kill the lead character, not his girlfriend. All the acting was fine for being a cheesy 80's film, that is. I give it a 4 out of 10 because most of the effects weren't all that great either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfriendly neighbourhood vampire...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Geekish teenager Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) lives his charmed suburban life, befriended to the wacky Evid Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) and squeamishly dating Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse). His idyllic youthful existence collides with the grim realisation that his next door neighbour Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is in fact a man with distinguished tastes in human blood. Unable to convince anyone about this revelation. Charly seeks the aide of Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), the host of late night C-class horror movies "Fright Night", whose owes his limited fame to being a vampire killer.With a script that didn't invite much in terms of plot-hole afterthought, Tom Holland grapples his basic premise by the next and delivers a disgustingly funny vampire movie with some memorable quotes, wicked charm and three star quirky characters in the form of neurotic whiny Evil Ed, timid self-absorbed Peter Vincent and the vintage Jerry Dandridge. Despite the painstakingly obvious flaws somewhat reminiscent Roger Corman-like disregard to logic, "Fright Night" has grown somewhat of the cult status, imprinting various quotes and scenes into mainstream pop-culture. Whatever your tastes the 1980s had a peculiar ability of delivering rare treats, which worked not only despite its flaws, but to some extent thanks to them. Nowadays movies seem so polished, that they avert the potential for creative disaster, thus no longer being able to deliver the kind of fractured horror gems. Verging somewhere in 'so-bad-its-good' territory, enhanced by some chilling visual effects (the disgusting morphing of the period is just so much more effective then CGI).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Vampire movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This flick is my favorite vamp movie of all time and IMO one of the best horror movies as well. The movie stands out as having a sense of fun to it despite being a full fledged monster/action film. All the characters are perfectly cast with the exception of "Marcy" (she is supposed to be a teen? she is supposed to be hot?) who is badly miscast here. This is probably why she does not appear in the second installment. The film moves at a brisk pace and is both comedic and horrific. This film has also stood the test of time well- even my son loves it! An all time horror classic ! The film stays true to the vampire genre while charting a course of its own. I thought the concept of having to have total faith in utilizing the cross against a vampire was ingenious and made sense. There really is not a boring stretch in the movie. When there is a pause in the action the characters/plot are being developed. Rent or buy it and you will not be disappointed if you are a horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>loved this movie and have caught it several times on television late at night. i never tired of watching this wildly imaginative and entertaining film from the eighties starring herman's head star William rags dale and Chris saran don. the basic plot tells the story of teenager Charley Brewster who thinks his neighbour across the street is a living and breathing vampire, jerry dandrige, played by saran don. Charley has a difficult task in proving to everyone that jerry is a vampire and soon enlists the help of an ageing horror television host played by Roddy McDowell. the two than embark on an adventure to vanquish jerry and save Charley's girlfriend Amy who soon falls under the vampire's seductive spell. what i enjoyed most about this film is that they don't rely primarily on heavy gore effects but a solid story line that goes at a steady pace and keeps the viewer's interest. and considering that back than, they didn't have the multi-million dollars special effects studio like they do is awesome. just relying on prosthetics and make-up is way cooler. i don't know how the planned re-make is going to fare in theatres. we will just have to wait and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, Everyone, This is a good Vampire movie, but not the best. Of the movies I have seen, I would say the best Vampire movie would be Night Stalker with Darren McGavin.Roddy McDowall performs well and my guess is he actually owned the Studebaker he drove. He was able to start it and shift and maneuver it very well in his scene where he was getting away from his bothersome fan. That fan was the teen (more or less) lead in the movie.Where this movie falls short is in its use of special effects. It overdoes the fog swirling around the spooky house and the use of morphlike changes from men to monsters and back. The director should have trusted his cast. They were capable of doing a better film.I was somewhat reminded of Rebel Without a Cause with a Vampire added and stirred with a funny bone.I think the best scene was Roddy McDowall getting his faith. It comes on a staircase. Not quite as good as the staircase scene in Sunset Blvd. but still good.I think the Vampire should have driven a Nash Metro or Henry J. Roddy could have chased them with the Studebaker. Lose the disco scene and add a road chase and you would have a better movie.I highly recommend Night Stalker with Darren McGavin and Love at First Bite. Also Vamp with Christopher Makepeace is fun.Tom Willett</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The makeup effects here are wonderful. Humor is used to balance the heavier moments, and to give you more of a feeling of realism within the character base.While this is not a movie to be taken seriously, there are some good horror elements and even some tense and freakish moments. There are even some seriously frightening scenes here.The story is not new, but this class of characters renders a new life to the old vehicle, giving it a much more endearing quality which has brought this movie into My personal collection.This endeavor, while a bit campy at times, follows all the basic rules of the sub-genre, and still manages to deliver a delightfully thrilling finished product, which I highly recommend.Evil Ed. He is the boy everyone picks on. He is the horror fan, the computer nerd, the gamer of the bunch. His portrayal here was heart-wrenching, funny, dramatic, and completely professional. He was the greatest casting asset to this entire endeavor.Roddy McDowell of stage and screen was believable as he gave an entirely convincing portrayal of the television vampire hunter playing a role. So often, fans tend to fasten the personalities of the characters these stars portray, onto the persona of the actors themselves, as Charlie Brewster and his friends, do to Mr. Peter Vincent (McDowell). He is brilliant as the reluctant hero here giving, as always, his very best-regardless of the role, the budget, or the project.But again, it was Evil Ed who stole this show.It rates a 9.8/10 on the "B" scale.That translates roughly to a 8.2/10 on the "A" Scale, from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is okay at best. McDowall and Sarandon are over-the-top but good, the kids all basically stink.What I wanted to comment on is "Fright Night"'s place as one of the gayest non-gay films of all time, and a film so sexual you wonder how it got past the Hollywood censors.You know the films I'm talking about: "X-Men 2." "Chariots of Fire." They have absolutely nothing to do with gay or lesbian issues, but at the same time they are, unintentionally, almost completely gay films. Same with "Fright Night."Let's get the obvious out of the way first: Stephen Geoffrey goes on to a gay/bi porn career and Amanda Bearse comes out of the closet during her time on "Married...with Children." Here they're just bad actors.The only-slightly-less obvious: Sarandon has a magnetic sexual hold on everyone else in the film. His right hand man is also his lover, and it's obvious from the very first scene to anyone who's not dense to such things. While his sexual relations with Bearse are portrayed on camera, Sarandon also takes Geoffreys, it's just done in a haze of smoke and mist and cut away cameras. Even Ragsdale is practically salivating over the guy, totally ignoring Bearse throughout much of the film.As to over-the-top sexuality, people who get up-in-arms about intergenerational relationships seem to have missed the molestation overtones in "Fright Night," both Sarandon's seduction of Bearse and his seduction of Geoffreys. Censors in the '80s missed so much...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgettable, In My Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night in a nutshell is essentially a horror/comedy about vampires. If you want a cheesy fun horror movie to watch with your friends you might like this. However, I was not too fond of this flick to be honest. There are better horror/comedies out there like Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland. There are certainly better vampire movies out there. If you want a fun vampire movie then watch John Carpenter's Vampires or Blade 1 &amp; 2.The story is very simple. A high school kid named Charlie Brewster soon learns that his new neighbor is a vampire. He tries to get help but no one believes him. The vampire realizes he's on to him and threatens to kill him. He is then forced to get the help of "vampire hunter" Vincent from the TV series Fright Night.The film does some things right. It has some good-up effects and the effects when the vampires die is good also. The score is decent. Also, the acting isn't that bad.However, the film has many issues. The biggest problem is the character. I didn't find myself caring about a single one. The main character, Brewster is so bland. The rest of the cast are just assholes and on the whole not interesting at all. The only character I slightly like is the so-called exterminator Vincent, but even took a while for me to warm-up to. The interaction between the characters, I thought, was very poor. There is nothing to the villain either. If I don't care about the character than I don't care what's happening ultimately.I also thought the film was a bit too long. There are many scenes that I thought were unnecessary and just dragged out particularly the final battle. That final confrontation could've ended like three times but they kept dragging it out. I didn't really care anyway so I just wanted it to end.Overall, I found fright Night a forgettable movie. Like I said earlier, if you want a fun time waster to watch with your friends then you might enjoy this. Maybe I'm alone in this because there are many people who enjoy this film.

		<shortDescription>One of Those 80s Horror Films You Will Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a teenager (William Ragsdale) learns that his next door neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, no one will believe him.What do you do when a vampire moves in next door and starts killing people? Well, if you are Charlie, you get your friends and a local B-movie actor to help you stop the vampire. But of course it is not going to be easy, because your parents and the police are not going to believe you. Such is life..."Fright Night" is an 80s horror film, not unlike "Monster Squad" and "The Lost Boys". It has that feel where kids (or teenagers) are capable of fighting monsters while parents look the other way. Heck, throw "The Gate" in there, too. Similarities exist between this and "Lost Boys" -- the vampires, the mother's involvement with the local vampire leader, a close friend or family member turning evil...And we get this from Tom Holland, who has a sketchy record. Sure, he has got this and "Child's Play" (both excellent). But "The Langoliers"? And "We All Scream For Ice Cream"? Holland has a strong connection to Stephen King, and for some reason seems to bring out the worst of King's work. Luckily, this is a notable exception -- one of the defining films of the 1980s horror scene. And that is how Holland became a "master of horror" (a title he earned, but is quickly losing).This film is full of odd things. Christopher Sarandon (an amazing actor) is constantly changing clothes, and in one occasion wears a very metrosexual turtleneck. He keeps eating apples (although I do not know why). One of the main characters, Evil Ed, looks like Beavis (from "Beavis and Butt-Head"). And there is a hero named Peter Vincent (an obvious homage to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price).There is a lengthy dance club scene, with a really cool mirror effect. Dance clubs are so 1980s. Think "Adventures in Babysitting" or even "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II" (early 1990s, when the fad was still wearing off). It was the thing to do -- have the action move into a musical environment to showcase a band. And I love it every time a film does this, so thank you "Fright Night" (although the scene does run a bit long).The effects in general are good, and I have o give a lot of credit to the person who designed the monsters. The werewolf creature (actually a vampire in wolf form) is great, the vampire bat is pretty good, and just the regular vampire makeup is better than average. I did not find it scary, but I certainly did not think it was cheesy.If I had to say anything negative, I would concede the running time is a bit long and some scenes could be trimmed a few seconds or a minute to pick up the pace. The music and clothing also dates the film, but that may not necessarily be a bad thing.The 1980s were the time for horror. Watch this one. Get this and "Monster Squad", put in some butter lovers' popcorn, grab some A&amp;W root beer. Maybe invite your significant other or a group of friends over. This is a casual party movie, and one I think the whole family can love if that is your preference. Another 1980s horror trait -- good horror without the excessive nudity or violence. I dare any film maker today to make such a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FRIGHT NIGHT Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: Dolby StereoUnable to convince anyone that his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, a desperate teenager (William Ragsdale) summons the help of a reluctant TV 'horror host' (Roddy McDowall) to confront the monsters in their midst...Bridging the gap between 'traditional' horror and contemporary, effects-driven blockbusters, Tom Holland's enjoyable potboiler saves most of its fireworks for the second half, when the forces of Good and Evil square off against a barrage of monsters and mayhem, courtesy of Richard Edlund's extravagant visual effects. Ragsdale and love interest Amanda Bearse are saddled with stock juvenile characters, but Sarandon relishes his role as the vampiric predator, and McDowall is superb as a faded horror star whose old-fashioned values are shaken to the core by his confrontation with modern evil.Some observers have discerned a homoerotic subtext in Ragsdale's obsession with his handsome, vampiric neighbor, and also in Sarandon's pursuit of Ragsdale's high school buddy (Stephen Geoffreys, later known as 'Sam Ritter', star of gay adult movies like VIRTUAL STUD and SEX ON THE BEACH), but homophobes are reassured that this particular subtext isn't allowed to interfere with the slam-bang pyrotechnics. Geoffreys employs a range of tics and mannerisms which will infuriate some viewers and endear him to others, but his final sequence - one of the best in the entire movie - is charged with genuine emotion (rendered even moreso by McDowall's extraordinary, wordless performance on the sidelines), and the 'death rattle' which accompanies his departure is one of the creepiest sound effects this reviewer has ever heard! Followed by FRIGHT NIGHT PART 2 (1988).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A theft of innocence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't bore you with a synopsis; if you read the previous posts, they will provide you a complete summary.What I will relate is on a somewhat different level.There is an old quote: "There is no greater aphrodisiac than innocence".This film creates a theft of innocence and in the process utilizes extremes: virginity as the treasure and consummate evil as the thief. And this theft, this seduction, is bound by a soundtrack that hauntingly, pervasively, entwines itself to the viewer. Not unlike a morbid curiosity, the violent car wreck from which you cannot avert your eyes, the moral mind wants to deny that so vile a creature is about steal a prize he is so wholly undeserving, yet, simultaneously the libido is stimulated to the contrary.During the nightclub scene, Jerry Dandridge, our romantic (I use romantic in the classic sense here) hero, moves through the crowd magically unimpeded, a vision of calm, yet focused, sexuality, and that focus is on Amy. She is drawn to him, to his undeniable charisma, and begins a dance of seduction, despite her awareness of his evil. He dances with complete control of the situation, and complete control of her. At one point he blatantly shows her his control of her, letting her drop to the floor after she, awash in his sexuality, has slid down to be facing his manhood, him with an expression of mild, yet amused, disappointment. A flash of embarrassment reflects in her eyes, yet she recovers and counters his abuse by taunting him; she spreads her collar and deliberately exposes her neck to him. An interesting sexual exchange.Yeah, there's silly stuff: over-acting by Roddy McDowell, Stephen Geoffreys and William Ragsdale (I believe the over-acting is deliberate to enhance the evil), dumb lines and over-the-top f/x, but Chris Sarandon is just having a great time in his role. He appears to be ready to bust out laughing he's having so much fun, yet he maintains an undercurrent of evil with great aplomb.Still, a good fun movie. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Soooo stereotypical for this kind of movie in the mid eighties. It is a little hard to picture Amanda Bearse as the teenage love interest after her coming out as a lesbian (I still think she is cute, just not for guys I guess). Roddy McDowall is so good as the campy late night host of horror movies who gets fired, but helps out the young Charlie Brewster when push comes to shove. Brewster is a courageous young teen who steps up to the plate when no else believes him about the bloodsucker living next door to him. Chris Sarandon plays the very chic vampire who plots to suck everyone he can. When Roddy doesn't see any reflection in his cigarette case things start to change. When Roddy hits the turned best friend with the cross, burns his fore head but doesn't kill him, the turned friend threatens revenge by by the Master. The physical display at the disco is not in keeping with the whole staying under the radar of most vampire movies. After all if they know you exist they can come up with a way to kill you. But of course all ends well, kind of maybe, almost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fright Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film with a very clever idea for both horrifying and slight comedic moments. Basically teenager Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) notices the house next door to be for sale, and then it is bought by a mysterious man. After a little while, looking through the window and sneaking into his house this teen believes he is living next door to a vampire, Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon), and he is! No-one believes him, not the police, his friend 'Evil' Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys), not even girlfriend Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse), but don't worry, they will. The only person that might be able to help Charley is the famous "Vampire Killer" from TV's Fright Night, Peter Vincent (Planet of the Apes' Roddy McDowall). With great special effects and gory moments, it is a good idea for a horror story. A sequel followed two years later. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, and very 80s vampire flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I hated it. I was a kid who thought Interview with the Vampire was the best film ever made and hated all 80s music, fashion and movies. I had a lot to learn.I just saw the film again and can safely say, while it hasn't aged well, it is a lot of fun. It follows the story of Charlie Brewster, who has some neighbors move in, and he is convinced they are vampires. Charlie hires his favourite TV horror movie host (once an actor himself) to help kill the vampires.The acting is bad, the filmwork is terrible, the script is crap, but Fright Night still manages to be a fun way to kill two hours or so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't make up its mind if it wants to be scary or funny and thus succeeds in neither. If you want a funny vampire movie, I recommend Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Lost Boys. For a scary one, From Dusk Till Dawn. If you want to rent a total piece of garbage and waste of money, this thing. Here's a hint - Marcy Darcy from Married with Children is the romantic lead. That gives you a glimpse of how crappy this movie is. Ugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend and I accidentally borrowed Fright Night on DVD thinking it was a recent movie.Some parts of the movie were so cheesy I couldn't help but smile. I couldn't help but think the movie was not completely serious. There were some genuinely 'frightening' parts, but that was due to the soundtrack. Don't you hate when they add a sudden noise in an otherwise quiet scene? ;)The special effects were pretty good, considering the age of the movie. The soundtrack and effects seem to be remastered and done quite well.6 out of 10. Recommended if you like B grade horror.</fullReview>

When a movie about vampires is not scary, then it has to be fun, and in this way 'Fright Night' has good scores. Acting is good, and special effects too. I found there are too many climaxes in the last 30 minutes, and it gets boring. Anyway, worth to be seen. I noticed two well known faces from cool TV shows: William Ragsdale from 'Herman's head' and Amanda Bearse from 'Married with children'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fright Night contains Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Corey McCrory, and Vincent Price. In this performance they all act as people in a situation involving scary bits and laughings. Most of the time I tend to often call these things 'hilarious screamers' because they mix the two most famous emoticons- fear and funny. Now let me say this (I'll say it anyway, if you'll let me): If you were being chased by a maniac with a knife- would it be funny? What if he caught you, and dove into your flesh with his blade- would you start laughing like it was Christmas? Even if you were running and he slipped on an apple skin, you would stop and start slapping your thigh at this slapstick marvel- nein, you would get out of there like a monkey from a box. Hilarious screamers really began in the 80s, with films such as Friday the 13th part 3 and The Exorcist. Featuring lots of gags and gores these provided popularity and box offices ticked to the sound of ticking tills. Fight Night (the first part of a trilogy and a loose remake of Night Of The Lovely Dead) was calamitous success, the biggest of the three, bigger than it's sequel (Fight Me) though not as big as the final part (Fight Club). I don't like these films- I always have and I never will. I like my horrors to be horrific and my comedies to be comific. However, as a person it is my duty to watch all screens, even ones I don't like want to want to.A young boy moves into a house in a city with his older brother, mum and dog- Wolfie. He is bullied at the new school by all the bigger boys for having stupid hair. He goes to his brother but he has started disappearing at night with local biker gang members- sleeping all day and partying all night. He tries to get his mum to help, but she is too busy having adult relations with a funny looking man. His grandpa is senile so he resorts to sitting at a park at night time. He meets a young girl, roughly the same age as himself who is very pale and doesn't talk much. He likes her but she always disappears off into the night. Soon they form a friendship, meeting every night in the snow, but she never tells him how old she is or anything else about herself. They notice a new neighbour moving in- an old evil looking man and imagine that he is a monster, an assassin, a lonely old prostitute etc. They are in bed one night when it collapses and he breaks his leg, confining him to his bedroom. He becomes obsessed with this new neighbour, watching his every move from his wheelchair. He believes he is a vampire. The girl thinks he is losing his mind, but can't help too much because she in fact IS a vampire. Soon all the secrets come out and it turns out everyone is a vampire apart from the mum who is a mummy. It becomes quite messy with all these twisting story lines, the best bit being when the girl climbs up the wall of the hospital and sets fire to the woman who likes cats. That was quite funny, but I don't think it was meant to be. A big fight ensues with the boy and his other friends the Fog Brothers and soon they rid the town of vampires. The boy hides the girl in his suitcase though as she is a good vampire, and the four of them leave on a train, the Fog Brothers not knowing there is a blood sucking fiend of the night nestled in amongst their underwear.Best Scene: When the 4 go to where the creepy old neighbour works- in a TV studio where he presents a monster programmathon. He slips on an apple skin and that is always funny, no matter what the presentation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the film is "well crafted" "well acted" "witty." So what. To me this movie is just the product of a large budget and there is nothing brilliant about it. There is no play on conventional structure or genre, rather, the play and humor that is employed is only a conventional play with structure, genre, humor. Then again I'm not one for main stream high budget comedy horror movies that offer the same old wit and humor. Charlie is obviously an easy to identify with protagonist for a lot of people. A sensitive, softy, genuine guy. But he severely sucks in my honest opinion. His girlfriend is even more annoying, her cotton ball hair makes me cringe and her blind devotion to him is appalling. Her character is so undeveloped, she's not even a funny parody of person. Evil is also the most irritating little twerp ever. Probably as annoying as Chop Top in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. He should be gagged and stuffed in a body bag. So basically I hate all of the characters. The movie is just lacks any flesh, life, heat energy. What a waste of my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, for an 80's horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night is what you'd expect from an 80's film. I mean that in both the good and bad ways. It's a somewhat original story and with special effects that are of course dated.Basically, the premise is that a horror movie lover teenager, Charley has a vampire (Sarandon move in next door but nobody believes him. As bodies start turning up all over town, he knows what is going on and starts to spy on the vampire. The vampire sees him and begins to terrorize Charley.Charley seeks help from his friend "Evil" and eventually from a B-movie TV actor named Peter Vincent played by Roddy McDowall. Vincent has a series on TV where he hunts vampires and so Charley thinks that this washed up actor will believe him.Finally, after a staged test, Vincent does believe Charley but is too afraid to help. The Vampire then begins his attacks on Charley and his friends.The end is a long fight between Charley and Vincent against the Vampire. They ultimately succeed and save Charley's girlfriend and the town from this menace.It's an entertaining movie, not one you'd rush out to buy on DVD though. I suppose they enlisted Roddy McDowall as a way to give this film more respect much how Halloween had Donald Pleasence. Not that Fright Night and Halloween are in the same league.If you like vampire movies or campy 80's movies, then you'll enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eighties youth movies... don't you just hate 'em? Surely one of the worst things in society; a cultural glitch that will return to visit you in Hell, along with Country music and corduroy trousers.Fright Night is typical of the period, and contains all the requisite elements: A club scene with eighties music and fashions - (hello braces!) - check; Some sub-soft porn titillation, including a gratuitous breast shot set to a drum machine - check; Excessive gore and ropey make-up effects - check; Irritating ugly nerd sidekick - check; Wit and understatement - sorry, you're not on the list.Fright Night is a spoof of horror movies, with Roddy McDowall (a fun performance, but can't save the film) as a TV host who is scared of vampires in real life. So that when William Ragsdale finds his neighbours are vamps, McDowall is too terrified to help. There are some brief mentions of other genre films, though Roddy having a justified pop at Friday the 13th does not a satire make. And while it predates The Lost Boys by two years and sort of inspired Buffy et al., this is hardly worthy of praise. Not very funny, not very scary, and not very good, Fright Night is a weakly directed, bog-standard "youth" pic that drags on too long at just 105 minutes.There was a sequel (imaginatively titled "Fright Night Part 2") three years later, though you don't really expect me to see that as well do you? 4/10.Post-Script, 11/9/2008: Happened to catch this film again forgetting that I'd seen it, much less commented on it. I can only assume I was in a REALLY bad mood when I wrote the above, as I found it fun and gave it 6/10 this time. And despite my earlier protestations, I HAD watched the sequel, and gave that a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The retina of the mind's eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inside of this cheesy throwback nests something heartfelt, borderline intelligent. This potential is all the more interesting because it suggests itself in a contradictory environment.We see an aging Peter Cushing character whose horror star has faded; in order to matter again, he must become a character in a movie. He must become the vampire killer he portrays, and in order to do so, he must buy into the mythos he has helped cultivate. He must learn not to be a cynic. This is a touch I like in movies, characters who open up themselves to the possibilities of worlds beyond.The bits of vampire action in the film mirror the clips of vampire films we see inside of it, a Fright Night-within. The cheesiness then had potential to become a reflection of the TV screen. Or if that screen is the retina of the mind's eye, as Videodrome would have it, in a roundabout way we could get the creation myth behind the film, what preexisted it.What keeps this back for my taste is that the parts of the film which are not precisely about the creation of a vampire film inside the Fright Night we are watching, where stakes are driven through hearts and the undead undergo gruesome transformations, are not markedly different in tone from everything else. Real and filmic life are one and the same here, undistinguished from one another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful! Clever! Funny! Original! Yes, these are just some of the words I can't apply to "Fright Night", a very lame attempt to fuse horror and comedy together, that has all the suspense and chills of 'The Flintstones Meet Rockula And Frankenstone', and humour silly enough to impress Elvira.It doesn't help that the film contains all the standard vampire clichés - wooden stakes, crosses, the seductive power of vampires, etc. You're almost led to believe these are being satirised, yet at other times they are taken seriously when it's time to dispatch the undead. I've never been entirely successful at taking vampires seriously, and throwing the clichés at me is more likely to elicit a groan than a gasp. To be fair on 'Fright Night', I would imagine that a lot of its fans saw it when they were kids, which no doubt left a strong imprint that paints it in shades of rose. Trying to watch it once you're beyond the age when McDonalds is considered gourmet food is only going to have less impact. I can certainly list off personal favorites that fall into this category. Ironically, I did watch 'Fright Night' as a kid, but somehow, whatever effect it had on me didn't stay along for the ride two decades later.I will give a thumbs up though to the special effects. Good creative practical wizardry beats cgi any day, and 'Fright Night' delivers the best 1985 had to offer. I also enjoyed seeing Amanda Bearse in something other than 'Married...With Children', giving a wonderfully 'earnest' performance. Indeed, all the acting was competent enough, although Stephen Geoffreys' 'Ed' made me realise Dustin Diamond's 'Screech' *isn't* as irritating as you can get. Chris Sarandon is no Christopher Lee, but he does know how to combine 'evil dead' and seductiveness effectively.Overall, while I certainly wouldn't call 'Fright Night' a dead loss, it fails to sufficiently amuse or frighten. However, the production values are excellent for the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) discovers that his new neighbour, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), is a vampire and suspects he is responsible for the recent spate of murders that have been occurring locally. Neither Charley's girlfriend, Amy (Amanda Bearse), nor local weirdo, Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys), believe him, so Charlie turns to washed-up horror star Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) for help.A likable cast, a great script and a load of cutting-edge (for the 80s) special effects make Tom Holland's Fright Night an extremely successful attempt at mixing humour and horror, whilst also nicely illustrating the sexual power and erotic lure of the vampire.Sarandon is great as the nasty vampire who exudes, in equal quantities, both menace and sexual magnetism (even over the same sex?his relationship with both his assistant, Billy Cole, and Evil Ed suggests that Dandridge isn't that fussy about who he seduces) while Ragsdale, Bearse and Stephens all give good performances as the youngsters pitted against him. Best of all is McDowell, whose appearance as the somewhat cowardly 'vampire slayer' Peter Vincent is a joy to behold, as he affectionately sends up the greats of horror after whom his character is named (Peter Vincent is an amalgam of Peter Cushing and Vincent Price).Writer/director Holland keeps a tight rein on affairs, lovingly mocking the genre but never insulting its films or its fans. Faithfully adhering to the recognised rules of vampire movies, he squeezes genuine laughs from the absurdity of Charley's plight and yet still manages to throw in plenty of scares.Both the make-up and visual effects are very good, and include some nicely realised vampire make-up for Sarandon, Bearse and Geoffrys, a great bat-monster and a wonderful scene where Evil Ed, impaled on a balustrade, slowly reverts from wolf shape back to human form (ironically, this would not be the last time Stephen Geoffreys would appear on film naked and impaled on something long and hard?he would later go on to become a gay porn star!).Spectacularly 80s in style (check out the cheesy pop/rock soundtrack and those awful clothes), and incredible fun, Fright Night is the perfect antidote to the endless remakes and soulless gore-fests of today. I award it a score of 8.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 9 for IMDb).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre horror-comedy with an outsize reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorky teenager William Ragsdale discovers that his new next-door neighbor Chris Sarandon is actually a vampire and tries to enlist the aide of hammy former horror film actor/late night TV host Roddy McDowell to help him vanquish the bloodsucker.The plot is a thinly veiled reworking of the reliable Boy Who Cries Wolf theme wherein the main character knows something to be true, but cannot convince his friends and family until it becomes too late. This horror/comedy has a loyal cadre of fans, which is somewhat surprising considering its chronic mediocrity. The shifts between horror and comedy are not effortless resulting in a rather jarring experience. Sadly, the film is never especially scary and what comedy there is stems almost completely from McDowell's performance. There is a distinct lack of surprise to anything that happens in the film. Every plot development is almost painfully predictable to anyone who is even marginally familiar with horror film clichés, and the execution is never clever enough to add enough flourishes to make the conventions seem fresh.Part of the problem is that the main character of the piece, the teenager next door, is a completely uninteresting character. Despite all of the screen time, he constantly seems to fade into the background beside the vampire and horror host characters. This prevents the viewer from becoming too involved in what unfolds on screen.The acting is a real mixed bag as well. Sarandon is a charming and seductive vampire, if not particularly menacing. McDowell has a field day as the hammy actor distressed to find his real life taking on the guise of one of his old films. These two actors are the main reasons to see the film and, if fans of the film were honest, probably the only reasons. By contrast, Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse, as his girlfriend and predictably the amour whom the vampire sets his sights on, are painfully dull characters with all the entertainment value of wallpaper paste. It is difficult to have any rooting interest or concern for either one of them. Stephen Geoffreys, as Ragsdale's best friend nicknamed Evil Ed for some unknown reason, easily contributes one of the worst performances I have seen...ever. His every on screen moment is a torture, with him shrieking his lines inappropriately and bouncing off walls. Was director-writer Tom Holland afraid to restrain him or something? The finale devolves into the typical confrontation with a variety of visual effects thrown at the camera to sustain interest, but the whole production seems a bit underwhelming given its reputation among horror film fans. In the end, the film's successes (Sarandon's and McDowell's performances) are nearly outmatched by its negatives (uneven tone, bland hero and heroine, the dreadful Geoffreys).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary 80's soundtrack...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One more film about vampires, yeeeha! This time they merged blood-suckers and the typical 80's teenage horror stuff. It looks more like a parody than like a true horror movie, and I don't think anybody (not even the actors) took this project very seriously (neither did I!!).So the B-series lovers will enjoy "Fright night", but the only scary thing in this movie is the soundtrack (say your prayers before listening' to it). What else could I say about it? Man, it doesn't even deserves the compulsory 10 lines.*My rate: 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that technology back then was bad but I also know that there were better movies made -- with the same tech.There are bats flying around AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THEIR CORDS hanging from the ceiling, at least make sure you cant see them. Also the vampire's cords were overwhelmingly visible too.The sound (like when the vampire gets thrown back (and you can see the cords there too) and hits a closet) was awful.My friends and I had a wonderful time watching this movie -- at how bad it was. We all thought it was hilarious how terribly made it was because we kept pointing out every single detail that was wrong about it as they came (not to mention the homosexuals!) So because we laughed our @$$es off, I have to give it a 5/10 at least</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A night of fright and fun with Fright Night is a true delight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love movies of all genres, and Fright Night was an example of a movie that I watched many times as a 14 year old and loved every minute of it. At 19 I revisited it once hearing of its remake, and it is every bit as good as I remembered, in fact it is one fangtastic(pardon the pun) movie. The film still looks great, with atmospheric costumes(great authentic fashions!), sets and lighting with skilled cinematography, cool make-up and impressive(even for now) effects. The score gives its film its perfect sense of quirkiness and creepiness. The story is straightforward admittedly, but also very well paced and compelling, and the script has the odd scary moment but is very wickedly funny. The acting is great, William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse appeal, and Roddy McDowell is magnificent but it is Chris Sarandon's funny, creepy and very sexy performance that makes Fright Night such a delight. All in all, a true delight. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but nothing too special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent if not particularly memorable vampire flick. Teenager William Ragsdale openly suspects his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, which causes Sarandon to retaliate by going on the offensive against Ragsdale and his friends. Roddy McDowell co-stars as a local horror show host whom Ragsdale recruits as a vampire expert. Future Married with Children co-star Amanda Bearse plays Ragsdale's girlfriend. Stephen Geoffreys is the low point of the film as Ragsdale's semi-retarded best friend. I swear Leo DiCaprio must have studied his performance for What's Eating Gilbert Grape. The similarities are uncanny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had somewhat heard of Fright Night from IMDb users, to be honest though, I never looked at the rating on IMDb before renting the movie. But I came across the film today and decided to rent it and give it a look. I watched it tonite and I have to say that this was just a fun movie to watch. It had a perfect combination of horror, comedy, action, and sigh, romance. The cast looked like they had so much fun putting this film together, it's hard not to love it. Now I admit that this film has the 80's cliché's written all over it, so it is a bit dated with it's big hair, clothing, and style, but it's all good. The story of Fright Night is an entertaining one.Charley has a new next door neighbor who's quite the mysterious guy, he has beautiful ladies come over but then they end up missing afterwards. One night Charley spies on his new neighbor, Jerry, while it looks like he's about to have a hot date, but Charley sees Jerry's fangs and knows he's a vampire. Problem is that no one believes him, not his girlfriend, Amy, his best friend, Evil Ed, or his TV icon Peter Vincent. But Charley is determined to fry this blood sucking fiend before it's too late.Fright Night is just a fun midnight pic that I'm sure any horror fan could enjoy. I'm sorry that I came across it so late, but considering that it was made the year I was born, better late then never, right? So for horror fans, I would recommend this if you have never seen it. It's just a good fun horror film with decent scares and a great cast. I can't believe all the familiar faces that came with it, but you'll have to see for yourself. So pull up the popcorn and be prepared for Fright Night.7/10</fullReview>

OK, it has some nice (but rare) special effects and the plot is acceptable, poor but acceptable... terror? no in this one... the only good scene is the wolf scene, now that's a really funny one, as well as the guy that plays the wolf's character... actually, i think it's the only good thing in this movie...' honestly, if you already concluded primary school, then this is not a movie for you to see... there is simply not the terror you are waiting for... gets a 5 cause it's somewhar entertaining... nice one to see on a Saturday's breakfast...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A high schooler is inconvenienced when a vampire moves in next door. It gets off to a fairly good start, but soon turns into a run-of-the-mill vampire movie. It is a standard horror movie that reveals that there have been no technological advances in the art of killing a vampire since the Bela Lugosi days of the 1930s. One still needs to use garlic, holy water, stake, and the cross to be rid of the blood-suckers. Sarandon makes a good vampire. McDowell does a curious turn as a TV horror show star who reluctantly agrees to kill the vampire neighbor. It seems like it's meant to be a spoof of vampire movies except that it's hardly worth a chuckle and it goes on forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool and fun 80's kitsch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980's is the decade responsible for some of the silliest films ever made - like this one, Fright Night. Despite being camp and silly, Fright Night still manages to be a great success in the low budget end of the horror genre thanks to it's great humour and surprising amount of originality. The film follows a young man named Charlie who, after seeing several strange things happening next door, starts to believe that his neighbour is a vampire. Of course, nobody believes him, which prompts Charlie to enlist the help of the only man he knows that knows anything about vampires - Peter Vincent, star of a late night horror show known as 'Fright Night'. Of course, it isn't long before Charlie turns out to be right and the good guys find themselves in serious trouble! Movies like this are rarely - if ever - taken seriously, but the fact of the matter is that a B-movie like this one is infinitely more enjoyable than most of the latest 'A' class films that the critics are raving about. Fright Night is not a great movie - and it never tries to be; it's just a damn good time! The acting isn't really a big part of Fright Night, but the one performance that really does stand out is Roddy McDowall in the role of Peter Vincent. This great actor steps into the role of the washed up TV star brilliantly, and it's his comedic take on the over the top horror stars of yesteryear that provides this movie with some of it's best laughs. Chris Sarandon is slightly annoying as the kid at the centre of the story, but he does a good job and actually manages to convince as someone who believes that his neighbour is a vampire. In the 1980's, special effects were a big thing as movies that showed 'everything' were very much in vogue. This movie actually features some impressive effects, which while no match for some of the effects in latter day movies, were good for the time and help the film to achieve it's "80's" vibe. This is the sort of film that I can't understand why anyone would dislike it. Fair enough, it has hardly any substance and it's very difficult to take it seriously, but it's great fun and the originality and humour make it ever easier to like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long-in-the-tooth teenagers tangle with an equal-opportunity bloodsucker...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suburban kid, living with his single mom, thinks the new next-door neighbor is a genuine vampire, but can't get any of his friends to believe him. Tom Holland wrote and directed this low-rent, yukked-up horror movie, but his handling of the genre is depressingly straightforward; he invests nothing new in the scenario, sees no fresh comic possibilities in the modern-day-Dracula milieu, and fails to provide the characters (especially the younger ones) with witty repartee or personality. The dated make-up effects are of the "Thriller" era, which can be excused, though they offer nothing truly exciting, at least not until the finale (Amanda Bearse's transformation is well done). The over-the-hill teens seem to have no agenda, very little back story, and no connection with each other (particularly the goof-off, odiously played by Stephen Geoffreys). Chris Sarandon's vampire has presence, but his googly-eyed, overacting male roommate--who comes and goes--is funny for all the wrong reasons (he purses his lips while sizing up passers-by, like someone out of "Sunset Blvd."). Holland doesn't have the delicious, nasty streak in him to reinvent the bloodsucking monster movie and, while this film was a sleeper hit and spawned a Holland-less sequel in 1988, it never aspires to be anything other than a cheap entertainment for its time. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun 80's Vampire horror, Fright Night is alright!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night begins late one night with a teenager named Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) having trouble with his girlfriend Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse) in his bedroom, I'll say no more... Annoyed he turns away &amp; looks out of the window&amp; sees two men carrying what appears to be a coffin into the empty house next door. Since Charley is a huge horror film fan Amy doesn't believe him &amp; leaves. It turns out that the house has been sold to a man named Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) who has just moved in with his supposed roommate Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark). The next day Charley bumps into a hooker named Cheryl Lane (Heidi Sorensen) who he remembers because she's a bit of a stunner, going into Dandridge's house. Soon after he hears on the news that she has been found dead &amp; the police are appealing for witnesses. That night Charley also sees Dandridge with another teenage girl (Irina Irvine) &amp; grow a set of fangs &amp; sharp fingernails with which to kill her with, Charley becomes convinced that Dandridge is a Vampire. Charley goes to the police but Lieutenant Lennox (Art J. Evans) isn't interested in stories about Vampires &amp; warns Charley not to waste anymore of their time. Charley then seeks the help of his idol, a washed up horror film star named Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) who hosts a cheap cable programme called 'Fright Night Theatre' which shows his old horror films. Peter refuses to help &amp; Charley decides to act on his own. However, Amy &amp; a friend named Evil Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys) convince Charley not to do anything on his own, they then contact &amp; pay Peter to visit Dandridge with them &amp; prove to Charley that he isn't a Vampire. Peter agrees &amp; the four head round to Dandridge's house where the thrill's &amp; chill's really start...Written &amp; directed by Tom Holland I thought Fright Night was an entertaining little Vampire film that has just enough about it to make it stand out, Fright Night reminds me greatly of another Vampire film made around the same time Vamp (1986) in both tone &amp; execution, if you liked Vamp I'm fairly positive you'll like this. The script is fairly light in tone throughout, although I don't know why the IMDb lists this as a comedy as there just isn't any here or if there was it went over my head. All the Vampire elements are here that we want &amp; expect, stakes through the heart, the Vampire's are unable to be exposed to sunlight, holy water &amp; crucifix's, they have no reflection in a mirror, the coffin in which they sleep, the obligatory fangs &amp; biting people on the neck therefore turning them into Vampire's. Having said that Fright Night tries to incorporate a few new ideas of it's own like the water &amp; crucifix's only work against the Vampire if the person using them has faith, one vampire turns into a wolf &amp; as he turns back it looks like something out of a Werewolf film &amp; the strange Vampire helper who is neither human nor Vampire. It generally works well &amp; is entertaining to watch but I found Fright Night dragged a little during the middle third when not much happens, in particular the unnecessarily long &amp; drawn out 80's disco dancing scene &amp; for a Vampire Dandridge was far too brazen &amp; public, I mean having a hooker catch a cab to his house in broad daylight who is then found dead a few hours later, hardly conspicuous is it? I also felt the climax went on for a little too long with various creatures &amp; a drawn out final confrontation all set in the confines of one house. There are some good make up effects even if the puppetry &amp; animatronics looked a little stiff &amp; unconvincing on a few occasions, the filmmakers seemed to mostly concentrate on the creature &amp; Vampire effects rather than blood &amp; gore of which there is surprisingly little. There's a melting man, a pencil through a hand, &amp; the Werewolf &amp; bat type creatures. The acting is OK with Sarandon making a decent villain &amp; Ragsdale a likable hero, McDowall is alright too but given little to do. Technically Fright Night is well made with a definite polish throughout, by horror film standards anyway &amp; director Holland manages to create some decent sequences with a bit of style about them. Overall I liked Fright Night, it's good fun &amp; kept me entertained for an hour &amp; forty odd minutes. Definitely worth a watch &amp; pretty much essential viewing for horror &amp; Vampire fans alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Children of the Night...what 80's music they make!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fright Night" is a truly campy but nevertheless respectable 80's horror comedy, made by one of the most talented guys active in the genre back then; Tom Holland, who was also responsible for other modest classics such as "Child's Play", "The Beast Within" and even the belated sequel "Psycho 2". It's pretty much Holland's surefooted directing, along with some nice make-up effects and Roddy McDowall's vivid performance, what makes this film so enjoyable as the storyline is pure &amp; silly nonsense. Charley Brewster is a typical teenager who's convinced that his new neighbor is a vampire responsible for the death of several young women. After being laughed at by his friends, Charley turns to TV's fearless vampire killer Peter Vincent but apparently he's not as heroic as his shows and movies imply. "Fright Night" couldn't possibly be more eighties-like, with a terrible choice in music, grotesque gore, odd-looking teenagers and the typical casting of a washed-up star for one last glorious role (Roddy McDowall was in "Planet of the Apes", for God's sake!). It's a fun movie, though, with some memorable sequences, like the vampire-variation on the famous "American Werewolf in London" transformation and of course the meltdown-scene. The weirdo kid who plays Charley's best friend, Stephen Geoffreys, is genuinely creepy with his squeaky voice and bizarre reactions. He went on to star in gay porno movies and has delightful sounding titles on his repertoire, such as "Gay Men in Uniform", "Latin Crotch Rockets" and "Butt Blazer". That's horror for ya!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Little Gem from the 80s Horror Period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fright Night (1985) *** (out of 4) Fun throwback to the genre films of the 50s has a teenager (William Ragsdale) fearing that his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is actually a vampire. When his girlfriend (Amanda Bearse) doesn't believe him the teen tries to talk a horror TV-host (Roddy McDowell) into helping him destroy the undead neighbor. FRIGHT NIGHT isn't the greatest film in the world but it's so well-written and acted that you can't help but have a soft spot for it even with its flaws. I think the film's greatest strength is in the performances as all four leads are terrific in their parts and really bring their characters to life. I think the real standout is Sarandon as the vampire. He manages to bring the sexuality of a vampire out but he's also quite menacing and the actor really digs into the role and makes you believe that you're really watching this undead creature. Ragsdale is also quite believable as the dorky teen who finds himself in danger once he witnesses something he wasn't supposed to. Bearse, best known for her work on "Married....with Children" is also quite good in her supporting part. McDowell has no problems fitting into the part of host Peter Vincent (named after Peter Cushing and Vincent Price) and delivers one of the more memorable characters of this era of horror films. McDowell is clearly having a lot of fun with the role and this is easy to see during the non-stop violence and action during the final thirty-minutes of the picture. Director Tom Holland was also in charge of the screenplay and it's clear he's a fan of the horror films from the 50s as we get countless homages to earlier films and it's clear that the writer wanted to make sure the audience was aware of such winks to the past. I think the screenplay does a very good job at mixing the horror and comedy elements, although I do think some of the early stuff with the mother goes on a far too long and it's never really funny. This also accounts for another problem in that the film goes on a tad bit too long but as I said, had some of the stuff with the mother been cut out this issue probably would have been fixed. Another major plus that the film has going for it are the wonderful special effects including a jaw-dropping sequence where one man pretty much melts right in front of your eyes. FRIGHT NIGHT was a rare horror film during this period because it doesn't feature any mad slashers or non-stop gore. Instead, it offers up a nice little twist on a familiar storyline and in the end it remains a nice gem.</fullReview>
