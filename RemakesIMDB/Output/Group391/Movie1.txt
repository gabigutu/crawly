		<shortDescription>A giant monster movie in the style of the new Godzilla movies from Japan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers in this very brief review! All i can say is that it was fun trash and a million times better than that awful American Godzilla remake. I loved it because it was fun in a "so bad it's good" kinda way. The CGI effects aren't actually that bad all things considered although the acting was appalling.Kinda like daytime soap acting, only not as good. Imagine if the cast of "All My Children" were to be suddenly confronted by Godzilla and Mothra? You get my drift? The story is at least trying to be original and there are so many different trash movie clichés going on it's almost hard to keep up! Picture bizarre aliens,huge spaceships and battling giant monsters and you may get the general idea! All in all, a fun way to spend a rainy afternoon. And it will certainly keep the kids amused during the Summer vacation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godzilla + Power Rangers + Extra dosage of idiocy Reptilian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like the worst parts of every Godzilla movie decided to combine with Power Rangers and form the biggest load of idiocy ever to hit my TV screen. The moment I saw people in jetpacks shooting at a fireball-spewing plastic dinosaur with machine guns, I recruited about 5 friends via telephone and instant messenger to gape in awe over how awful this was. It was a laugh riot, not over the movie being funny (because it wasn't) but more over the fact that such a piece of crap was even being aired. Painfully bad in every way, not even worth paying for a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Between the almost transparent special effects and bad acting this movie reminded me of the old fashioned japanese monster movies. All it needed was bad dubbing. Apparently the creature is an ancient dinosaur from another planet fulfilling some sort of doomsday prophecy. It almost seems like it was poorly made on purpose to give it cult value. It is worth seeing with a group of friends, so you can all lob sarcastic comments at it.</fullReview>

For me, though, it was the most fun I've had with a movie for a long time. Really bad acting, really great monster battles, and some of the lines the actors have to say are... odd. It's most assuredly not the best monster movie out there, but it's a great party move.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the long history of Godzilla films, Yonggary adds a small twist of alien invasion and tells the story of a monster, determined to destroy Earth. It's a low budget film with low budget digital effects and quite simple plot, reminding us B Movies in which actors play flat, monsters are unable to fright even the children, nobody cares about what it's going to happen next and everything is silly but entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awful remake that makes the American Godzilla great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing it on SciFi before the channel turned to total crap. This was in a marathon with other monsters, like Godzilla and Mothra. Unfortunately,this movie is a crap fest. The CGI is awful, the acting is wooden, I would have never guessed that this was the remake of the original Yongary. The one line: compared to this guy, Godzilla is a P** sy. Right, this awful computer generated crap isn't even as good as the worst Godzilla movie. You might as well buy the American Godzilla, even that is better than this sludge. The aliens, the second monster, the added "G" to the monster's name, it just doesn't make sense to me. The American actors don't do the movie justice at all. Just don't buy it, it may seem like a monster movie, but it sure isn't to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird but entertaining, but is there an 'OldGary' too?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DO NOT take this film seriously. Compared to this flick, even the poorer Gamera and Godzilla films are Citizen Kane when it comes to taking the film seriously. Taken as face value as entertainment, kudos to the director for making a great popcorn cruncher. Yes the dialogue is awkward at times- Yes the CGI doesn't quite look finished- Yes it's kinda odd a South Korean film has near only American actors- Yes the monster looks nothing like the original Youngary- But heck to all that, it's IS entertaining!This movie falls firmly in the 'So bad it's good' category. The action scenes have a lot of hilarity going on, dialogue can be flat out hilarious, the plot, while executed a bit oddly, IS pretty original; and the monster designs aren't half bad. I saw this as a kid and loved it for the unintentional humor as much as I did the big monster fight at the end. As for any parents who's monster movie loving kids might want to see this, this is a pretty safe film. Outside of one scene that could be a bit squeamish where (offscreen) a fossil tooth flies through a dig worker, I can't see anything in this film that would be bad for kids under 10. If you want a film to kill time and to leave your brain at the door to have some fun, this film will for the job. When it comes to Godzilla's numerous foreign relatives, Yonggary did pretty well for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is s**t. First let's talk about the acting. By god is it terrible. There is not one actor that sounds even slightly credible. The plot is at least original, it's not at all good but it is original. It's been asleep for two hundred million years. Now it been awakened by aliens from another galaxy. The aliens are using Yonggary to destroy mankind.......never mind maybe it isn't so original. Finally, lets address the special effect. For a while I thought that the CGI for "Adventures of a Teenage Dragonslayer" was the worst. But after seeing this, I mean wow. This doesn't even look finished. At least Teenage Dragonslayer tried to make it look good. Here it just feels like they didn't care. It's like the just threw up there hands and said "Really, who gives a s**t."So in the end I really say that you stay away from this stinker, for as long as you like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I have no idea where to begin. There were just so many things wrong with this movie. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*1. This movie was a very cheap rip-off of the old GODZILLA movies. Only the FX in this movie were far worse.2.The graphics on the monster were horrible. A second grader could probably come up with something better.3. You could never hear what the alien dudes were saying to each other because they were always mumbling. 4. The plot was really dumb and a lot of the dialog was stupid. EX. Guy talking to monster while holding really big gun says: "Hey, Mr. Monster, I want you to meet my friend Tommy".5. What did the second monster have to do with anything? If the aliens were so powerful, why couldn't they just take control of the monster's mind again?I could go on forever, but since this has to be under 1000 words, I'm not going to. So, again, I cannot stress how bad this movie was. Stay away! This movie is a deathtrap......... -5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this is a real stinker! With a stupid plot (deep-voiced lobsterish aliens with a plot to destroy Earth using a fire-breathing dinosaur), lousy effects (even worse than the typical Sci-Fi Channel original), and acting that often makes the work in any old Godzilla retread look good in comparison, "Reptilian" is so bad that you won't be able to look away.Regarding that acting, special notice has to go to Richard Livingston as Dr. Campbell. For a while, I thought his tendency to gaze off-camera while reciting his dialog was supposed to indicate that he had been hypnotized by the aliens, but apparently it's just the result of either amazing overacting, or an inability to remember his lines, making cue cards necessary. Fortunately, he gets squashed like a grape before this becomes really annoying. You have to wonder what other careers he tried before deciding that acting was where he really shines.The rest of the cast is almost as laughable, with the possible exception of Harrison Young (Dr. Hughes), who's probably doing about all that can be done with the lines he was given. To be honest, he's probably the reason I sat through the movie anyway, as I spent the whole time trying to figure out where I'd seen him before (it turns out Young played the old version of Ryan at the end of "Saving Private Ryan) but I would have missed a real treat if I had changed the channel.The effects are pretty bad, too; I thought maybe the monster was supposed to be glowing from radiation or something, but unless I missed some explanation, it's evidently just really cheap effects work. You have to wonder why the pilots attacking the monster didn't start shooting lower after watching him duck the first five or six missiles. Also why Captain Parker (Briant Wells) thinks his machine gun and jet pack will do anything to Yong Gary that fighter jets have not.Just when the futile attacks start to get tedious, though, the giant dinosaur gets a lobotomy, breaking the aliens' control over him. Of course, that just means you need a new monster, and the alien attackers quickly send a new one so we can have a battle royale between Gary and the new one. Considering that in the end our new buddy Yong Gary is carted off to storage on a deserted island somewhere, it's amazing that there has never been a sequel made (I mean, c'mon, we're up to "Saw VI" already.) Certainly this is not a serious movie; it's not even a good movie. But at 2:00 in the morning (the only time you're likely to find it being shown) it's pretty entertaining, if not in the way its producers intended. "Reptilian" is one that will be appreciated by any aficionado of bad sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me put it this way. I love bad movies. I pretty much grew up with MST3K since I was about 10. I often rent cheesy horror and action films for a good laugh. This movie made the original Godzilla movies look like Oscar worthy films. They even try to make their monster seem more powerful and more impressive with the line "This guy makes Godzilla look like a pussy." Well at least any Godzilla films (Japan or USA versions) has better plots and acting. The special effects were awful. A special effect is supposed to blend in to make creature or other objects look like they are real. The special effects in this film stick out big time. I would not wish this film on anyone.1/2 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared to this, Godzilla 1998 is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start this review, let me let you guys know that this review may contain a few spoiler alerts, viewer discretion is advised. Reptilian (or Yonggary) is a 2001 remake of the 1960s classic Yonggary. Yonggary was Korea's answer to Godzilla. The story in this movie is about an ancient monster called "Yonggary" gets resurrected by the aliens from outer space, the aliens have control over Yonggary and they made him go out destroying the town. Then towards the end of the film, one of the soldiers destroyed the crystal on Yonggary's forehead, then later, we get another monster &amp; it's also from the aliens. Now let's see if I would recommend this film or not. Pros: -None at all Cons: -Horrible acting -Bad plot -Very mediocre final battle scene -Poor CGI effects (Yonggary looks like something I can expect from a Dreamcast game) -Boring soundtrack -Bad cinematography -Bad cover design Overall, this movie gets a 2 out of 10. This movie is worse than Godzilla 1998, both of these movies should be avoided at all costs, but again, I'll rather watch Godzilla 1998 than this god-awful ugly Korean rip-off. The endRated PG-13 for some violence &amp; mild coarse language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad acting, Bad CGI, Bad Plot, Badly thought out Aliens. The only thing saving it from a 1 rating is that it has Rocket Rangers (not what they call them, but you know what I mean when I say it). They are, of course, poorly done and poorly thought out - but I have trouble giving a really crappy rating to any movie featuring a squad of jet-pack equipped soldiers. Of course the Aliens make it impossible to give any rating higher. They can teleport and mind-control the monster, blast cities, and have been around for 200+ million years and yet they are defeated because without mind control Yonggary (the fire-breathing monster) is good and like humanity.The climactic final CGI battle occurs when the Aliens send in a tentacle-using electric Turtle (the writers must be watching too much Hentai) that Yonggary blows up by shooting a fireball into the shell while the electric turtle has its head withdrawn. Overall, just say no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first the movie seems to be serious. A powerful wraith is unleashed by some archaeologist guy who has an inflated vision of his own importance. Then some dinosaur bones are found. And some poorly animated aliens show up--they know the monster or something. Soon, things are going downhill fast. Either it's a parody of some other loud sci-fi's, or it's just downright insanity.The satired movies include (but or not limited to) Godzilla (97 version) and Independence Day. Also some demented legend stuff. A big ugly creature with a propensity for smashing helicopters goes on a rampage, and then winds up in a city somewhere. Another rampage. I love the cheap CGI insertions over old footage: while a 50 foot monster battles jets with rockets and buildings are being destroyed, directly below in the background, calm traffic is rolling back and forth like this happens every day. Many buildings are blasted by fire, but subsequent shots show no fires anywhere, lol. Also, scenes where the thing casually dodges missiles: priceless.Corny lines are numerous. Action is dizzy and non-stop, and clichés are everywhere. The movie just mocks itself, and it's good enough for a few laughs.</fullReview>

On channel 32 in my home town -- they used to run all the Giant monster films in the afternoon. Godzilla, Rotunda, Ramtha -- you name it, Japan supplied it.

When the monster was in the city (destroying it as usually)I did not recognized this place at all. There was English and also Japanese on some on building tops. But then at the end of the movie - they were airlifting the monster from downtown Los Angeles - because you could see the Liberty Tower, The Bonaventure and the Citibank building.

		<fullReview>I have just finished watching YONGGARY 2001. After Centropolis-Tri-star's miserable attempt at recreating their own version of Godzilla, I wasn't going to raise my expectations too high. Being a fan of this genre-especially a die-hard Godzilla fan, I was impressed.Unlike the americanized Godzilla, Yonggary was a real hell-raiser. From the moment it was resurrected by an alien force, Yonggary proceeds to wipe out one major metropolitan area after another in the grand tradition of Toho's big guy. This movie is every bit of what the Centropolis Godzilla should have been-and wasn't.The CGI effects were decent enough-it seemed more like stop- motion animation, but it fit well here. It somehow made the monster more surreal, adding to his ferocity.YONGGARY 2001 bears no resemblence to the original version, which is just as well. I highly recommend it to any and all monster fans.Just bear with the lousy one-liners.Rating: ****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

I think to feel the lack of comical. ("Yonggary 1999" and "Taekwesu Yonggary" are comical. "Yonggary 1999" is the Proto-type of "2001 Yonggary".)Anyway, "2001 Yonggary" become a pleasure for the monster movie fans.

However, the effect were banal, there were too many plot cliches, and the acting was not merely wooden, it was petrified.But, it was funnily bad, in ways that could easily be pointed out. Thus, I would have picked this for Mike and the Bots to abuse instead of "Overdrawn At the Memory Bank," this week's MST3K offering.Besides the above line about Godzilla, I liked the one deviation from cliche that this flick offered. At one point the commander of the elite ranger unit "T-force" describes how dangerous the mission to blast the monster will be and one sensible soul actually has the temerity to back out of the suicide mission - and they let him quit! I loved it. Of course, there was an eager young lieutenant right there to volunteer to wield the dropout's "Hellblazer," of which the new cannon fodder stated "I've studied its designs and protocols." Gotta love total misuse of the language in scenes where the moviemaker's actually trying to be serious.Please - make this movie the next MST3K release in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good of this film is that the monster effects, artistically speaking, are excellent despite other reviews likely to be contrary. The bad news is the acting...whether its the direction or the talent, it doesn't matter. This one begs for the MST3K treatment. How can I differ so greatly with others on the effects issue? Well, from an artistic view, the drawings, as it were... the creative product of creatures, their movement, spacecraft and their activity and effects alone, are in fact elegant. The creature actually dodges attacks fluidly, something rarely seen in city crunching monster flicks. The reason other reviewers may well be harsh on the same subject is that these selfsame creatures and effects are poorly applied to the canvas so-to-speak. As though the glue on a paste-up were showing around the edges of the artwork. A direct description would be, the effects are translucent appearing and must be judged apart from the film itself... no really they must be judged apart ... because the effects LOOK like they ARE apart from the film. Too bad... the bad news out-weighs the good when the storytelling presentation is finally viewed.</fullReview>

As bad as the acting is, one still can't help but feel a bit sorry for the actors for having to spout out such astonishingly inane dialogue, and to portray characters that couldn't possibly be more stereotypical, in a storyline that would make the average 12 year old cringe.Ed Wood's movies became classics because they were so earnest, yet so genuinely bad that they became funny. "Younggary" distinctly fails to be scary, simply because it is so utterly silly in all respects, and the storyline has more holes than swiss cheese, but it may have some minute appeal in the similar vain as Ed Wood's material, provided that the audience is in the right frame of mind. And preferably quite drunk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have a new found respect for this (after watching GODZILLA (1998).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie and it should be on every monster movie fans DVD shelf. Sure, the CGI is tacky and the actors and actresses are unknown, but it's a hell of a movie! Just compare it to G.I.N.O and you will love this movie.It was made for international release, and they really should have used Korean actors in this movie.Yonggary and Cykor are two cool creatures. Yonggary looks much better than in his 1967 debut movie.A cool movie with a bad reputation.- Steven</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly less entertaining than an infomercial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing positive I can say about this movie. Third graders at a Thanksgiving play could act better than anyone in this film. Not that the actors were given a plot or any dialogue of any kind to act with. The story is so stupid it insults even the dimmest viewer.The real reason people will watch this movie is to see a monster movie. But the special effects are so bad; the old Godzilla movies with rubber suits are way ahead of Reptilian. The cgi effects are jerky and poorly superimposed. It's like a bad cartoon on top of a bad movie.Save this movie to watch with people you hate. They will suffer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Day Korean Kaiju Eiga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, this is the first time I commented on a Korean monster film, my previous films I commented were American and Japanese. Now let's begin. The film is a combo between INDEPENDENCE DAY, DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, and the 1998 GODZILLA. No one has ever attempted to do that. Remake a forgotten classic. The miniatures were well done, but the CGI spaceships and monsters, look like something from BEAST WARS. Plus the aliens in the ship, were puppets. Lousy. Yonngary starts out as an atagonist, to a protagonist.Cyker sounds like a POKEMON name. But is a combo between a tortise, and a scorpion. I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel recently. But two years ago, I made Power Point presentation on this film and other Korean monster flicks, like 1967's YONGARY: MONSTER FROM THE DEEP, A*P*E*, PULGASARI, just to name afew. This lead me to high grades, since I decided to do a presintation on something no one has ever seen nor heard of. Does anyone one want a sequel to this movie? Erm (clear throat), no. Zero-Nine Pictures (est. 1993 with the first film, YOUNG-GOO AND DINOSAUR ZUZU) has announced that they are making a film called D-WAR about dragons attacking medival and modern day Korea. It is due out in 2004. But when it will be dubbed in English? I have no idea. Oh well, at least this film won at the 1999 Cannes film festival. Got updated in 2001 as 2001 YONGGARY (US video title REPTILIAN). Cool flick eh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Homage to Bad Japanese Monster Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who hated this movie probably didn't get through the first forty minutes of it. And, they're not necessarily overreacting: it's an illogical yet painfully predictable film; it's over-the top but only in the most cliched manner possible; it's terrible, but truly, unabashedly terrible. And, from that standpoint, I can somewhat respect it for what it does. My suspicions are that director Hyung-rae Shim INTENDED this to be an homage to the hilariously cartoonish slough of monster movies to come out of Japan after the success of Rodan in the 1950s. It succeeds in evoking the same, unrelenting two- dimensionality of those old films, uses the same formula seen in Gameron and Godzilla films (the seeming monster foe turned champion of humanity). Same cheesy models and doe-eyed onlookers. Same military and scientist bad guys. Where it fails, unfortunately (and what would have made it an adequate homage to Japanese monster filmmaking) is that it omits the essential morality play at its heart. Without a moral framework to make the "good monster v. evil monster" scenes meaningful, the movie is virtually useless. I say "virtually" because, as my partner often says, nothing's completely useless. You can always use it as a bad example.Some youngin' fed a steady diet of sophisticated special effects movies is not going to tolerate this. So be it. I got a kick out of it at times with a long groan and a smile. To the over-40 set, crack open a six-pack, and enjoy the nostalgia. (Just say, "no"!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool movie for the Monster fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, this movie would cheese for plain movie lovers. But you Monster movie maniacs must see this. Old school style monster movie with CG and some kind of humor. I don't know when you could see this movie in JAPAN and USA. But if you have any chance to see this, you must rush!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Next to this guy, Godzilla is a WUSS!"(actual line from film!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie as "Reptilian" and was genuinely surprised, first by the unusual monster effects, and second by the realization that the monster himself was none other than "Yongary, Monster from the Deep", an all-but-forgotten early attempt to cash in on the Godzilla craze from decades ago. He's back, and he's bigger, badder, and more realistic looking than any current remake of Godzilla has been. This is an immense achievement considering the laughable ineptness of the original Yongary film, but this one still suffers from a plot involving aliens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK monster movie..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Shaman legend comes true when Yonggary - a millions years old giant dinasour wakes up from its long sleep with the aid of some ailens. It is determined to destruct the earth. CG effects are quite succesful. Of course it is not a Jurassic Park or any other big-budget film and so don't expect much. However Yonggary is still entertaining. If you have time, take a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its attacking the city</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a terrible movie. The dialog is beyond cheesy, the special effects might have been cutting edge in the eighties. The acting? Bad! I could go on and on... The thing that got me the most was the classic sci-fi movie blunder: "the city". Rather than try to actually pretend to destroy an existing city they just have a bunch of buildings and call it "the city". The dialog reflects this, such as "The monster is attacking the city" or "If it gets to the city we are done for" or "the aliens are directly over the city". As if there was only one city on the planet.</fullReview>
