		<shortDescription>Godzilla's Seoul Brother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Scientist and a young woman get married and immediately are harassed by the bride's young brother, whom you will likely hate almost immediately. Their honeymoon is short lived, as the scientist's new father-in-law calls him into action on the wedding night, not the kind of action he was looking for. It seems this man is the only one who can solve a problem plaguing the Korean people...a giant, angry, thunder lizard who has emerged from "the deep". I guess it's happened before, as most of the people know this Godzilla-like beast by his first name, Yongary. Anyways, Yongary destroys a bunch of buildings, killing a bunch of people I assume, and ravages the Korean oil refineries, using the blow-torch in his mouth. We find out that he was only causing this ruckus because his tummy was growling, yes our boy Yongary was hungry. That pretty much covers most of the movie, other than a scene where he starts to dance, which makes it all worth watching (not really).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Korean made Kaiju film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the night of his honeymoon, a Korean astronaut { I did not know that Korea had a space program}is sent on a re con mission to observe an earthquake moving to the center of South Korea.This however is no earthquake. The scientist- and his obnoxious but likable 9 year old sidekick soon discover that nuclear testing in the Mid east have awaken the legendary monster Yongary, and he's heading straight for Seoul!After making quick work of the army and air-force Yongary- who looks like a close relative to Godzilla heads for an oil refinery and starts to drink the oil! Having followed Yongary to the refinery through the sewers, the kid aims his static gun at the beast and he starts to dance to what sounds like surf music!Before long, the monster is on the rampage again.To the uninitiated, this might seem like a Japanese monster movie. Although it does borrow heavilly from Godzilla, this film has its own unique feel. The FX are reminiscent of Tsubarayas work and the directional style is pure Honda, but thats not a bad thing.Even though Yongary is a man in a monster suit, it is fairly well done The FX do run hot and cold. The prerequisites city stomping is good, but you can see the blowtorch in Yongarys mouth as well as the 3rd wheel undert the jeep before the rear section gets blown away. It is amazing that these goofs were not edited from the movie. The end is kind of out of character with the rest of the film, but you will feel sorry for Yongary.Far from being Bergman or Kurosawa, the film does have its moments, The spaced out patrons at the club and the street evangelist yelling "repent, repent" are priceless.This is like the old channel 9 movie{in the New York area}that they used to show at midnight on Saturdays in the late 60s and early 70s. Great fun for fans of the genre. How can you NOT like a movie like this?}</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey Korea...you're late!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But you did give us a great one. Thank you.An earthquake shakes up the peninsula and it turns out a 'Seoul' version of Godzilla is to blame. Meet Youngary.Like the Japanese films, this big creature stomps cities and causes general mayhem just because. People flee and we hope they make it. So why is it different? Korea gave the cast, crew, and direction a lot more emotion. The stoic nature in Tokyo is a lot more stressed. The Koreans were allowed to free their feelings. Therefore our hearts were with them.A lot of the decor was different too. An Asia-phile would notice it more. But it was good to see a "Kan-Kokku-no" version in the monster genre.Nice job Seoul-mates. Welcome aboard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kuk Dong delivers a poor but amusing Godzilla ripoff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean...the company is called Kuk Dong. If you speak Swedish, that is quite funny. Otherwise its just random. Umm...movie review.A giant monsters appears after a space shuttle launch. It goes to crush a model of a Korean city. An annoying kid uses his flashlight to make Yonggary dance. After much pointless destruction, a random scientist dumps a load of toxins on Yonggary and he dies a painful, withering death.It's standard stuff here, folks, but very quaint and amusing in it's production. It's got some random stuff, like the Korean priest shouting repent in one of the crowd scenes, and the epileptic rave scene. Otherwise it's Godzilla from start to finish, complete with terrible models, a supremely cheesy space sequence, and pointless, unintroduced characters.Yonggary has got a neat cutting beam that he slices a motorcycle and a jet fighter(straight out of Team America) in half with.If you want some late night cheese, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cheapo Korean GODZILLA rip-off. Yonggary has a nose that glows when excited, likes to dance to rock 'n' roll, and is vulnerable to itching powder. Going Godzilla one better, Yonggary breathes fire AND shoots lasers from his nose. An allegedly cute eight year old boy befriends him; you keep hoping a building will fall on the boy or he'll get run over by a tank or be trampled by the mobs fleeing in terror to shut him up. The weirdest sequence occurs early in the movie: on his wedding night, just when his new bride is getting amorous, an astronaut is summoned on a secret mission; the next scene you see, he's blasting off into space in an enormous phallic rocket ship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth Beneath Plate Tectonics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nuclear testing in the Middle East awakens the earth-shaker Yongary from the depths of Korean mythology. This medium-sized kaiju is essentially Godzilla with big canines and a rhinoceros horn glued to his snout, and he is about to face the entire South Korean space program, air force, army and a willful eight-year-old. Needless to say, there really isn't much competition and Yongary makes short work of Seoul and everything along the way.The special effects are anything but. The miniatures and cinematography are actually worse than some of the worst Japanese kaiju films of the early '70s. The acting and English dubbing is actually fairly good and the plot is not incoherent, though it is ridiculous.Recommended for silent background play accompanied by your own soundtrack at a house party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Sickness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost always watch this ridiculous muddle when it comes on cable television! I cannot fathom why. It's a sickness I guess; because there has never been a monster picture in which I wanted to see the monster win more than in Yongary! Perhaps I'm hoping for a directors cut with an alternate ending?An atomic blast, how au currant, releases the hapless Yongary from some deep ocean tomb, and he rises to wreak monster havoc on Korea. Of course the all the scientific forces of the orient are thrown against him in a battle for survival of the fittest.SPOILER ALERT!!! As If? The monster doesn't win! What a surprise. He defeats the finest scientific minds of Korea, but falls prey to an obnoxious eight year old kid. Then the entire cast spends the last five minutes of the film gloating, boasting and congratulating themselves after having killed the poor beast with what seemed to be itching powder. Go figure!I confess, Yongary is not any worse than the Japanese monster films where a plump stunt man is waddling about in a rubber monster suit stomping on doll houses. I actually kind of like those things. I guess it's the human cast that makes me side with the monster this time. I keep hoping for a sequel entitled "Yongary Conquers Korea!" The monster does have fun swatting airplanes and squashing much of the financial and cultural infrastructure of Korea; and he's entertaining to a monster aficionado, in a rubbery sort of way. But in the end, Yongary is just another predictable formula entry in the "Giant Monster versus All Asia" genre. So why can't I resist it? Give it a look, and let me know!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot imagine to much good that can be said about this muddle. It is amateurish even by the standards that defined the genre of cheap, japanese monster movies of the sixties and seventies. The set, especially the backgrounds are so obviously phony and the rockets, army equipment, etc. might as well kept the tags on them from the toy store. The buildings were so hokey as they toppled (they had nothing inside, even fake floors, to give the illusion of reality. And to top it all off was the guy in the rubber monster suit. How hard is it to look like a monster in a monster movie??? Six-year old Trick or treaters give better performances.The only redeeming aspect I can point to is that it made in Korea, instead of Japan, which is kind of interesting to see on a why would anyone think copying cheap Japanese monter movies was a good idea level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1967, the year Japanese audiences came face to face with "Gamera vs. Gyaos" and "Son of Godzilla". However, Korea was also releasing a kaiju flick that year: "Yongary: Monster From the Deep". Following in the line of King Kong, Godzilla, Gorgo and Gamera, Yongary emerges to wreak havoc on mankind. The monster looks like your average dinosaur, nice and fearsome (quite obviously a Ceratosaurus). Oddly enough, as opposed to most monster movies, there are a significant number of people who choose to die as the monster approaches. Another plus is that the miniatures look pretty awesome in this one.Like Gorgo and Gamera, this movie gets a kick out of throwing a child into the plot. I can't say I care for him but it's still nothing compared to other tortures I've been subjugated to, like "Gamera vs. Guiron" of 1969. The characters here aren't too developed but there's some nice comedy between them. At one point a plan is forged and a government official remarks, "If it can save just one life it'll be worth it". Wow, if only governments in the real world acted on such polices right? I will say though, the scene where Yongary is killed is something akin to the 1933 King Kong death atop the Empire State Building. You actually feel for the poor dancing dinosaur, even though if it is a tad less elegant. Yongary is poisoned like a giant rat, even ends up pissing blood, what a way to go.A lot of what we see here is familiar but it's all in good fun. I find this film better than the new Yongary film, a.k.a. "Reptilian".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag of charming camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yonggary (1967) is much like Gamera, a cash crop film, aping off the success of other pilfered monsters, better ones. The film opens with what I thought was a rather nice shot of space with rolling credits, followed by a fine cast of mediocre actors and a young boy in shorts, the evil omen for any giant monster movie fan of terrible things to come. The story and plot run through very worn out terrain, mysterious happenings somewhere, a loving couple, monster attack, and discovery of weapon to kill the monster. The film was geared to children, as most kaiju films of this time (late 60s), one would expect this in itself would diagnose Yonggary as terminally unwatchable, but the kid aspect is what to me kept it entertaining, Yonggary dancing, drinking, etc. were all bizarre enouph to keep a smile, bad editing also played it part. As for the action sequences, Yonggary's arrival and first rampage was well done, not very convincing mind you, but thats never really the point in these films, to look interesting and incite nostalgic inner child hollaring.Yonggary is by far one of the most forgettable Kaiju monsters to grace East Asian screens, his physical appearance is right down the middle neutral to anything that may catch attention; his skin color bland, his design simple and uninspired and his range of emotion nonexistent. However , despite all of this, I had fun watching it, unlike Gappa, pretension toward seriousness is out the window, thus making the inevitable moral lesson and speech at the end all the more bearable.One of the better, lesser kaiju films. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie for a first try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No offense to the South Koreans, but I'm surprised to see how similar the town and people looks compared to the kaijyu moves from the similar era Japan. I've heard that this move is not well known in its home country, and the version I saw was an English dubbed version made by MGM.An astronaut is asked to investigate a bomb experiment. When the bomb goes off, it starts a chain of earthquakes. The earth quake strangely is heading towards middle of Korea. A martial law s declared, and soon after the monster Yonggari appears from the ground.The look and feel of this movie is very similar to the Gamera series movies from the mid '60s. The man protagonist's driving a Chevy Corvair just like the original Ultraman series defense force guys were driving. Then comes the obligatory scientist's lab scene, and another obligatory meeting of the minds of the government officials. The Yonggari's special effects scenes were shot by Daiei's crew that were flown over from Japan, so I can understand the similarities, but even the scenes involving humans were very much like (almost identical) it's Japanese cousins. I'd like to compare this movies to other Korean movies from the same era to see if the similarities, were a coincidence.The movie is on par with the likes of Gamera vs. Barugon. Even the roar of Yonggari is borrowed from Barugon, but suitmation part isn't as good as the Japanese counterpart.There might be no market for this type of movie in Korea, but it would have been interesting if they developed this idea further as it was done n Japan. An okay film that's as entertaining as the kaijyu movies made by Daiei of '60s Japan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rather enjoyable mid-60s Korean monster film, in which a Godzilla-like monster decides to give Tokyo a break for once and ravages Seoul, Korea (maybe the South Koreans would have cheered it on if it had attacked Pyongyang instead??? hmmm...). Anyway among the cast we have a young scientist / astronaut who along with his new wife and her annoying 8 year old brother, try to find a way to stop Yongary from flattening the better part of the capital.The effects are quite low budget but passable for this genre of films. Whenever you see Yongary in a shot coming close to a large building or a bridge, you just know that structure has gotta go! Call it Yongary's plan for the urban renewal of Seoul. Yongary itself is quite obviously some guy in a rubber monster suit who had the joy of smashing his way through flimsy plaster-of-Paris building models.If you go into the film with the understanding that this is a Korean Godzilla ripoff on a low budget, you will not be disappointed and you may enjoy it. Finally I wish to say that the character of Suna, played by actress Jeong-im Nam, was quite beautiful, especially in that red dress... wow</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Godzilla and Gamera of Korea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Yongary: Monster from the Deep" is another entry on a nearly endless list of low-budget giant monster films that owe their inspiration and creation to the two most popular movie monsters of Asia: Godzilla and Gamera. The monster, Yongary, has characteristics similar to both of these monster icons. The thing is that Yongary makes his film debut in a film that is very cheap, dull, and oftentimes unintentionally funny. And the moments that were intentionally funny, are mostly just painful to look at.Yongary, as you can imagine, was represented by a man in a rubber suit. The suit, I'm afraid to say, is a very poor effort. It isn't bulky like Godzilla, but in fact very slender, like the T-rex costumes of some particular low-budget American dinosaurs movies. When viewed from the side, Yongary doesn't look half-bad. But since we most commonly see him from the front, he mostly looks pretty bad. Too skinny, too humanlike, too unrealistic. There are many other revealing aspects to the poor special effects. Yongary, like Gamera, can breathe and literally inhale fire. Whenever he does either one of these, you can see the nozzle in the back of his mouth and his tongue just seems to disappear. And what's also funny? Yongary is prone to feeling itchy, and also likes to dance. Yes, dance.The human characters are dull and uninteresting, mostly annoying, as you would expect. Dubbing, for once, wasn't half-bad. Like Gamera, Yongary has a child character who idolizes him. But I think this character just smiled too much. Even when he talks about how Yongary wasn't a bad monster, he just smiles. If Yongary is facing danger, instead of being angry, the kid still smiles. There is also a sense of stupidity with these characters. Such as, what's the point to sending a man in a rocket into space to observe a nuclear explosion? One can easily see and observe from a safe distance on Earth. And also, there's a moment where the characters argue about missiles to attack Yongary with, and say the missiles could be too dangerous to the city to use. But, when they are used, the missiles don't seem to cause much for an explosion. Missiles fired by jets later on, which are much smaller and less destructive, seem to cause greater damage.Bottom line, "Yongary: Monster of the Deep" is a movie that is worth looking at. But do not expect much from it. It is better than other low-budget Godzilla-rip offs such as "The X from Outer Space", but is still not all that impressive of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest thing I've seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was flipping through the movie channels with my mom and we spotted this movie. If I happen to find a film like this, I usually watch it for at least a few minutes. I watched this one for forty-five minutes, until the end! It wasn't the genius cinematography or the vivid special effects that drew me in (sense my sarcasm?), but it was the epic story. From what I saw, a boy, Echu, saw the monster drinking oil and asked himself, in overdub, "Why would a monster want to drink oil?" That line alone made me giggle. The boy tells his Uncle Elu (I hope I'm spelling these names right) about the monster and, conveniently, Elu is a scientist. He begins constructing a formula containing ammonia, which makes the monster go crazy, and Elu proposes to drop it from his toy helicopter onto the guy in the reject Godzilla suit making the equivillent of $17 an hour for this film. It takes twenty minutes to get a reaction from the monster and all he does is swish his tail around angrily. At closing, they manage to drop enough chemicals on the monster so that is falls into the lake and begins bleeding tomato juice, oddly enough. But before the anamatronic eyes closed for good, the boy asks "Uncle, do we really have to kill him?" and the uncle explains to the boy the dangers of having a 70 foot lizard walking around Seoul, randomly smashing buildings and growling. Nothing, however, could prepare me for what I laughed at so hard that I nearly peed myself. When the monster breathed fire, it was easy to see the valve pumping out the flames at the back of the monster's throat. My mom and I had a hoot. But later, when little Echu is watching the monster by himself, the monsters horn starts glowing and - yes- it begins to dance! Surf music is heard as Echu cries "He's dancing!" and the monster boogies down. I can be quoted as saying "That's the best thing I've seen all year!" through my tears of laughter. Well, best thing I'd seen all day, anyway.So there you have it. If you get a chance to watch this movie, I suggest you take it and be prepared for a howling good time. It's these bad movies that make you glad you chose to watch them instead of something like "Crossroads" or perhaps "From Justin to Kelly". </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yongary Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This time I'm doing a public domain movie from South Korea in the 60's called Yongary. I think it's based on a Korean myth of a dragon living underground Korea. It's also Korea's take on the giant monster movies that were going around at the time. Monster movies like Godzilla and Gamera. I'll talk about Gamera in another review one day but lets not get of track.The plot is when there's an earthquake and a giant monster called yongary comes up from the quake. He does your typical monster stuff, reeking havoc, and destroying stuff. Yongary also ends up eating fossil fuels and even dances a little for some reason as well.Just watch it for yourself and see what you think of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinosaur by play dough, trucks by Tonka. That's the obvious credit that this film should carry, a silly "Godzilla" rip-off where the sets are obviously models (check out those battery operated tanks) and pretty much every piece of metal (every shape or form of it) was utilized to provide plenty of amusement, but not in the way the creators may have wanted. This time, the monster is in Korea, not Japan, and Yongary comes out of the ground just as an enormous earthquake is continuing to devastate the whole country. The hero is a young kid, originally seen with some sort of gun that flashes a light and makes its victims itch horribly, in this case his own sister and her fiancée. Later, he gets the over-sized reptile to itch and dance at the time, making you think that you're in the middle of the "Itchy and Scratchy Show", ironically with rock music in the background. There's a strange brief sequence showing partying Koreans getting wasted, not realizing the danger outside approaching, but that's never even seen again, making me wonder if the editor cut out the wrong footage. Even with obvious models, the effects are pretty good, although kids today spoiled by computer technology and graphics are going to realize it's all phony. So if you want a few laughs with some bad English dubbing and a reminder of what didn't necessarily come from Hollywood (even though this ended up in a sequence of the 1982 documentary "It Came From Hollywood"), check this out. This is marked, interestingly enough, as having been released by American International Television, but for some reason, it's in widescreen, giving the impression that some drive-in or second rate theater somewhere must have shown it.</fullReview>

From deep withing the earth, Yongary emerges from the fissures and rampages through the city, heading for the oil fields which are his food source. Yongary bears a striking similarity to Godzilla even though the writers allegedly based the monster on ancient Korean folklore. Yongary's taking a moment to dance to music played on a radio by an adoring child is also in keeping with the Toho films which were increasingly kid friendly as the 60s wore on.

		<shortDescription>A very underwhelming start to the Korean giant monster genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After The Best From 20,000 Fathoms, Toho was inspired to create a movie and monster that would become far more famous globally, 1954's Godzilla. After Godzilla's success at both the box office and in popularity, other companies the world over scrambled to create their own monster films to attract similar success. America launched countless efforts, from The Giant Mantis to It Came From Beneath the Sea (and many more). Britain had Gorgo in 1961. Within Japan there will films like Gamera. But Korea launched its own low budget attempt at Godzilla and the new-at-the-time Gamera series. Yongary (1967) was this movie.Yongary is proportionally based on Godzilla with a head that apes Baragon and Gamera to an extent. So the monster itself is nothing compelling, and the quality of the suit is poor, as you've probably well gathered by now. Giving him more convincing eyes would've gone a long way, because they don't move and they glow unrealistically. The pump shooting fire in his mouth was another goof. And with trying to appeal to children at the time -much as how Godzilla and Gamera were- we received a child for a lead. The plot is nothing fresh either, with a giant bipedal fire breathing monster rising from the Earth.The one surprising scene in the movie is at the end when the monster is dying a slow, painful death while jerking from pain and bleeding. It's the first time the film begins to draw in something from the audience. Unfortunately, it's FAR too little FAR too late. You can watch the entire movie for free on Google, which is probably the only way I'd watch it. Even though you can purchase it cheaply for $5-6, I'd pass. Even then it's too much for a movie you'll surely watch just once. It has nothing on even Toho's movies of the late 1960s, such as War of the Gargantuas or Destroy All Monsters. Buy one of these or something from Gamera's series if you want an Asian giant monster flick from this era.As a final word, a Korean company tried to resurrect the Yongary monster in a new film from 1999, titled Reptilian in the US. It's probably even worse for its time than the 1967 original. It makes the 1998 American Godzilla and 1999 Japanese Godzilla 2000 look like the best thing since sliced bread.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why this movie was made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To understand this movie, you have to know something about Korean history. The Koreans are still smarting after thirty-five years of Japanese occupation (1910-1945), which ended with Japan's defeat in World War II. The Japanese treated the Koreans much the same way the Russians treated the Poles or the British treated the Irish. Even today Japanese movies and comic books are illegal in Korea. Thus, perhaps not surprisingly, most Korean movies are calculated imitations of popular Japanese genres--give the home folks their own version of Japanese movies so they won't long for forbidden fruit. "Yongary" may seem to us a poor "Godzilla" rip-off, but to Korean audiences that haven't seen a Japanese monster movie it's undoubtedly much more exciting. Judged strictly on its own merits, "Yongary" is about par for the Japanese kaiju movies of its era--neither better nor worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Host it ain't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yongary ? Monster From the Deep, Korea's first grab for a slice of the 60's Godzilla market is no Host. It's very much an example of optimism over experience, but it does at least provide several opportunities to laugh at it rather than laugh with it. The plot is the usual one ? atomic testing causes earthquakes that awaken Yongary, an ancient and almost anorexically slim monster whose existence is accepted by the authorities sight unseen without a moment's doubt. Can our workaholic scientist hero save the day? Can the special effects get any worse? Unlike the Godzilla films, there's no subtext here: this is just a man in a joyfully unconvincing monster suit crushing toy tanks and knocking down balsa wood buildings. While it will make even the most casual viewer reassess the credibility of the Toho films, but it's not just a matter of bad special effects. This is pretty inept all round ? in one scene a guard repeats his lines twice as if two takes had been used instead of one while in one memorable effects shot people fleeing Yongary are shot so wildly out-of-scale against the model city that they look like they're30 feet tall themselves. Still, in a brain-off, possibly-had-too-much-to-drink way it does offer some entertainment value, and the sight of Yongary bopping away to rock'n'roll on a kid's transistor radio is almost worth the price of admission on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really fun &amp; funny Korean giant-monster-on-the-rampage creature feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American International Pictures, clearly eager to capitalize on the meteoric success and tremendous popularity of the "Godzilla" films, probably picked up this unintentionally riotous el cheapo Korean giant-monster-on-the-rampage picture for a song, poorly dubbed it into hilariously awful English, and sent this gut-busting baby straight to television so it could be rerun countless times on mid-afternoon creature feature shows.An earthquake awakens a gigantic, fire-breathing, ill-tempered legendary prehistoric bargain basement Godzillaesque lizard beast from its centuries of slumber; said enormous poor-slob-in-a-lovably-obvious-bulky-rubber-suit thingie comes complete with a loud rumbling roar, glowing yellow eyes, sharp spikes on its back and tail, a mouthful of nasty fangs and a big red laser-shooting horn on the end of its long snout. Naturally, our grouchy reptilian behemoth embarks on a delightfully lengthy 50-odd minute mondo destructo spree: he tramples tanks, levels bridges, swats at helicopters as if they were large pesky flies, guzzles oil by the drum load, knocks over buildings so numerous expendable faceless extras can be crushed by Styrofoam concrete slabs, exposes the local military as a bunch of useless inept clods, blows up fighter jets, and generally causes a lot of mass panic and hysteria ("Repent all you sinners!," screams a cross-wielding priest to the fleeing mob). Best of all, Yongary even gets in touch with his lowdown funky side and boogies to groovy rock music. Shake it, Yongary, shake it! The special effects are every bit as laughably lousy and unconvincing as one could hope for, with plenty of wonderfully awful miniatures (the tanks and planes in particular look like they were taken from some little kid's model train set). I'm sure both gasoline prices and real estate taxes skyrocketed considerably after Yongary was finished trashing the countryside; whether or not Yongary's endearingly clunky dance caught on as a hip teen craze is open to debate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Korean Godzilla</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Korea's 1967 version of the Godzilla type of films and its pretty much identical to those style of films from Japan. Film starts out with a Korean astronaut on his honeymoon but is called back to work to man a rocket for some such reason. While up in space there are massive earthquakes rocking the country and it turns out to be the legendary monster that has caused them. The monster crawls out of the ground and starts kicking over buildings and breathing fire! Of course, there is a little kid that is running around and noticing things about the monster that he relates back to his sisters boyfriend that is a scientist. The kid gives him information that ultimately will be the creatures demise. Yes, its a silly movie with horrible special effects and just a guy in a rubber suit but aside from a couple of dumb scenes this is a film that stays within a boundary of decency. The dumb scenes are when the jets attack the monster they fly right into him! Nice flying!! And of course the monster dance! What was the point of having the monster get up and dance? Anyone? *****SPOILER ALERT***** The ending to the film is really kind of sad and the characters show some compassion to a dying monster. As the helicopter keeps dropping a chemical powder on the monster and he dies the little boy tells them to stop. I don't remember ever seeing that in a monster film before. And watching the monster die a slow death was not like other films. In most films you cheer the conclusion but here with the monster bleeding and twitching it becomes painful to witness. Not a bad film of its type. You definitely laugh at parts but by the end you have stopped laughing. In their own little way, they showed they were different from the giant monster films from Japan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Monster but Largely Boring Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yongary is a terrific Monster with fantastic powers(albeit a little too much like Godzilla). Particularly I like his horn which shoots laser beams.However the film itself drags on incessantly, stars an annoying little kid in short shorts and has less than spectacular special effects. Particularly bad is when the flame-shooting device used for Yongary to breathe fire is so obviously visible on screen. Also the eventual outcome for Yongary may be too much for some children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting monster flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notable among guy-in-rubber-monster suit epics for the fact that this is a Korean film, rather than Japanese. Some of the building-trampling scenes are impressive by standards of the genre, but other than that this is pretty much formulaic with cheap visuals, toy tanks and aircraft, and silly dialogue. Monster tramples buildings, annoying little boy teams up with scientist to stop the destruction. The ending with Yongary's slow death despite the boy's grieving is oddly moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monster fun... with a distressing finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fairly standard 60's Giant Monster rip-off, like those produced in Japan by Daiei, Shochiku and Nikkatsu Studios in the wake of Toho's success. Yongkari's special powers are his ability to burrow through the earth, and a death-ray he sometimes projects from his horn. He has a wonderful roar, and even starts dancing to a rock version of a famous Korean folk song...But then there's the ending. Once again the scientists trying to stop Yongkari do about as much damage to the environment as the monster did... Our heros dump chemicals on the beast. There has never been a more horribly realistic demise in rubber-suit monster movie history, as Yongkari sinks to the ground, twitching and bleeding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schizophrenic Rampaging Monster Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now HERE is an odd egg to say the least. I must admit that I had confused YONGRAY with REPTILLICUS, a Danish made Giant Rampaging Monster flick, and was overjoyed when I found it on a new 3 DVD Public Domain Market wonder from St. Clair Ent. called GIANT MONSTERS, containing most of the PDM Gamera films, the requisite GIANT GILA MONSTER, a couple others I have not heard of (WARNING FROM SPACE, anyone??). REPTILLICUS stands out in my memory not only because someone swiped my old pre-record of it a few years back, but because it was a stop animation European made monster flick and not some guy in a suit pummeling models. YONGRAY amusingly turned out to be something totally different, and one of the strangest viewing experiences of this type I can recall. YONGRAY -- or "Yongaree", as he is called in the film -- is a South Korean made ditty that was filmed on such a low budget that you can see the tin seams on the wind-up model tanks used in the big battle scenes. YONGRAY is some sort of beast of legend who is awakened from his slumbers underground by the side effects of South Korean space program tests (talk about odd coincidences with real life ...) and the first quarter of the film is actually a THUNDERBIRDS worthy display of model rocketry &amp; assorted technologies as our hero -- a maverick Korean astronaut -- is sent into space on a "reconaissance mission" which serves no real purpose, other than to awaken Yongray. And like his cousin Hedorah the Smog Monster, Yongray feeds off our industrialized petrochemicals &amp; their waste, namely gasoline and other fuel oils. As he seeks to chow down on various refinery tanks stuff gets blown up real good, the Korean Army steps in and efforts are made to kill the beast before that aerosol can they used to simulate his fire breath explodes &amp; kills a stage technician. Half of the fun in the film IS how ultra-low budget and somewhat shoddy it looks. "Endearing" is the word I think. YONGRAY has an endearing immediacy too it, sort of like Ed Wood doing Godzilla, but with what for him would have been actual money.So far so good, but one of the odd aspects of the film is it's ambivalence towards Yongray as a character himself, who is on one hand a rampaging juggernaut of destruction, but on the other hand is lovable &amp; strikes up a predictably annoying bond of "friendship" with an annoying 9 year old tyke annoyingly written into the script for the sole purpose of annoying anyone watching older than, say, 12. But this does treat us to the odd sight of the supposedly sky scraper sized Yongray dancing to Korean surf rock with the kid, who sort of kinda sticks up for poor Yongray when the South Korean Army starts spewing a chemical weapons solution at it, and eventually KILL Yongray in a scene that can only be described as "pathetic", meaning that it inspired pity within the viewers present during the screening here FOR Yongray. We were rooting for him, but no. Spew enough orange gunk and he is meat getting cold.The Korean cast then stands around laughing about it with these creepy, canned, dubbed laugh tracks -- especially creepy when the annoying tyke announces that he liked Yongray, that Yongray was his friend, and that when he grows up he wants to be a biochemist. Laugh laugh laugh, and there is poor Yongray lying dead in a mucky, polluted river, now only about as big as a tractor trailer (Yongray's physical scale changes dramatically in relation to the sets from scene to scene) and his tail twitching painfully in the toxin polluted water that killed him. Are we having fun yet??Don't get me wrong: I LOVE this movie. It is twice as cool as REPTILLICUS, with bizarrely translated dialog, cunning use of models, interesting use of color schemes and YONGRAY!! who's creature costume design looks more like a guy in a suit than any other Asian-depicted monster I can think of, even King Kong. I like the way technology is used in the film, the fact that our central hero figure is an astronaut who's special skills are never really explained (other than that he can pilot a spacecraft, though how that would help the Earth defeat a Giant Rampaging Monster is beyond me), and enjoy the quasi-futurist 1967 era production design. There is even a "party scene" with characters getting totally wasted in a bar: This is a movie with a split personality disorder, unsure of just what it wants us to get out of it but very enthused about showing us the works nonetheless.But I cannot get around how sad it is that Yongray had to be killed off, the pathetic and presumably environmentally destructive way he is killed, and the fact that the on screen characters feel "good" about it all, even though we in the audience do not. Unless you are some kind of a sick Nazi I guess: How can you cheer for stupid humans poisoning to death a goofy lookin' monster who likes surf rock? In the words of the annoying kid, "Just because Yongray did terrible things and killed all of those people, that doesn't mean he was bad or a monster."Amen to that; 7/10UPDATE 9/17/07: YONGARY has been released by MGM on a beautiful remastered Region 1 DVD struck from a fantastic widescreen transfer. Give your bargain bin DVD version to someone who might not otherwise bother, this new version is a sign of PROGRESS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Godzilla Rip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yongary, Monster from the Deep (1967) ** (out of 4) South Korea comes under attack from a prehistoric creature (obviously looking like Godzilla) who starts to unleash violence so it's up to an overworked scientist and a small child to try and find out its secrets and destroy it. YONGARY, MONSTER FROM THE DEEP isn't a classic by any stretch of the imagination but I think fans of the "monsters-on-the-loose" genre should at least get some mild entertainment out of it. This was clearly influenced by the various Godzilla movies that were out around the time and this includes the monster itself, the story structure, the messages and of course we're even given an annoying kid who of course comes up with a few things about the monster that not even the adults could figure out. The first thirty-minutes of this thing are pretty boring as we're basically given a lot of dialogue scenes and sadly no monster. This introduction to all the human characters was just boring and frankly it was hard to sit through. I never understood why so many of these monster movies had to drag us down with these things especially when the producers knew what the people were really coming to see. Once the monster finally gets on the screen things start to pick up. I thought that the special effects were rather good for this type of film. The monster costume itself wasn't the greatest but it was good enough for a light version of Godzilla. The special effects were somewhat laughable in regards to some of the action scenes that happen towards the end. There's a sequence where Yongary must fight a couple jets and I couldn't help but laugh when he finally destroyed them. Once the jets blew up it looked like they were made out of cardboard. Another funny moment happened after Yongary split an Army vehicle in half and one of the people inside just kneels down begging the monster not to kill him. If you're looking for classic cinema then it's best to stay away from this but if you're just looking for some goofy fun then enjoy.</fullReview>
