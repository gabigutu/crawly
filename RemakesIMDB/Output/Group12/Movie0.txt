		<shortDescription>Much Prefer This One To Re-Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a nice film, nothing special, but certainly better than the terrible Disney re-make in 1994. The baseball scenes were pretty good and they should have stayed more with that. They had footage from real-life Pittsburgh Pirates games and that helped make it look more genuine than most sports films that Hollywood made back in the 1940s. Paul Douglas was pretty funny, especially when he started "swearing," mixing his sentences together so you couldn't understand anything he said.Once again, as was the case in a number of classic films, the story was going along pretty well and then a sappy romance ruins things. I'm all for romance but they are done so stupidly in most films, it's an insult to your intelligence.The little girl in the movie, "Bridget White," (Donna Corcoran) was a cute, sweet little thing. She lives in an orphanage run by nuns (Spring Byington and Ellen Corby are featured). It's interesting to note that all the pro-religious scenes in here were deleted in the 1994 Disney version.The villain of this movie turns out to be the baseball announcer, of all things. Keenan Wynn plays the role so effectively you want to reach through the television and punch this guy out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun baseball film with some baseball history to boot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Douglas plays the demanding manger of the Pittsburg Pirates whose team begins winning after being blessed from above. Look for a young Ellen Corby, the lovable grandmother on the Walton's TV series. Other cast members include Janet Leigh,Keenan Wynn and Spring Byington. The filming locations were old Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, home of the triple A Los Angeles Angels before the Dodgers arrived. Forbes Field in Pittsburg and Yankee Stadium were also used in this 1951 film. Some popular ballplayers can be seen also.It is a fun movie to watch, especially for a baseball fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angels Alert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angels in the Outfield" (1951) is the one of the best and most original comedies ever made. It is about a baseball manager (Paul Douglas) who loses his temper too much until he hears an angel's voice (James Whitmore), who makes a deal with him. He and his other angels will help the baseball team win games if the manager stops losing his temper. When the deal is set, the manager's life changes. It is a lovely movie to watch. The movie should have been nominated with Academy Awards for the major categories. It was totally ignored. Paul Douglas and Bruce Bennett, as the aging baseball player, should have been nominated for best actor and best supporting actor. They have something in common; both of them made another great movie in their long careers: Douglas made "Letter to Three Wives" and Bennett made "Mildred Pierce". "Angels in the Outfield" was perfectly cast. Another outstanding performance was by Kennan Wynn in his best role and best movie. Mr. Wynn should have been nominated for best supporting actor, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How I miss Forbes Field</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was taken by this movie the first time I ever saw it. That was so long ago, I can't even remember when. Paul Douglas as Guffy was superb. Angry, contrite at times, not quite sure what is happening with the angels, but in the end, he is willing to believe. The baseball scenes are pretty realistic. I enjoyed the shots of Forbes Field, as it was always one of my favorite places to watch a ball game. Donna Corcoran and Janet Leigh were both excellent playing their parts. However, the best performance (and most overlooked), was that of Keenan Wynne as the commentator. He played his part so perfectly that you forget this is only a movie. You really wanted to throttle him, the way he denigrated Guffy and the rest of the team. Excellent acting job on his part. James Whitmore did a great job as the voice of the angel, taking no "guff" from Guffy. I enjoyed the scene where Guffy lets his old and tired pitcher (Bruce Bennet) stay in the game, because Whitmore informs Guffy that "We are recruiting him (Bennet) next season." All in all, this was a terrific baseball movie. Yes it was predictable and at times a bit sappy. Having said that, the film was still well done and is certainly a fine movie for family entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now who'd have thought angels would be helping a bunch of pirates.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the New York Mets came along, the Pittsburgh Pirates were the first name in baseball for flat footed futility. At the time that Angels in the Outfield was made the Pirates had a long term lease on the National League cellar. In fact the only reason the Pirates drew any crowds at all was the presence of the premier slugger in the National League, Ralph Kiner. One shudders to think where they might have finished without him.But that's reality. In this film some heavenly help is granted the Pirates, presumably by a long suffering Deity who's maybe a Pirate fan. That is on condition that manager Paul Douglas clean up his act. He's told that by unseen angel James Whitmore.As it turns out Douglas is not the only one getting celestial visitations. He only hears angels, but little Donna Corcoran sees them behind every Pirate player on the field. When reporter Janet Leigh writes the story all kinds of complications ensue.Even without the special effects of the 1994 remake, Angels in the Outfield still maintains an innocent charm that is irresistible to baseball fans of a perennial losing team. After all we found out in Damn Yankees the kind of outside help they've been getting to stay on top. Nine years later the Pirates were in fact World Series winners, humbling the mighty Yankees in seven games. And for thirty years after that the Pirates were a contending ball club. They're back in the doldrums that Angels in the Outfield portrays. Maybe time for another heavenly assist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful baseball movie with more depth than the Disney rendition. Paul Douglas and Janet Leigh are wonderfully cast as the gruff team manager and female reporter out for a story. It was a treat to see Barbara Billingsley as the hat check girl in the resteraunt. Some very famous ball players make guest appearances, which is a real treat.This is a touching movie that the whole family can enjoy. It has similarities and some serious differences with the modern Disney rendition of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prayers of the young are answered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pittsburgh Pirates are a team in disarray and just keep on losing. Could the reason be the manager Guffy McGovern played by Paul Douglas as the reporter Jennifer Paige and the players believe. Guffy has a foul mouth whenever he gets angry which is most of the time. Unbeknown to Guffy and the Pirates is a little orphan girl that is praying for them. God hears her prayers and sends an angel to help but only if Guffy can control his temper and mouth. Guffy does and the team starts to win. Little Bridget White, the orphaned girl gets a chance to attend a game and is the only one to see angels behind the ball players. Can Guffy change his ways and will Bridget find a home? At the end is a very touching decision by Guffy concerning his old bitter friend, a washed-up pitcher that started the game as to whether to stay with him in the ninth or to replace him. Excellent film for those that believe in the power of prayer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have to use the word "cute" to describe this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And that's even though I hate using that adjective to describe any movie, but this one fits the bill perfectly. PAUL DOUGLAS is a temperamental baseball player who makes a deal with a heavenly angel to curb his temper and maybe win a few games with help from above.JANET LEIGH is a girl reporter who eventually falls in love with Douglas (hey, this is a movie!!) after a rather brief courtship during which both she and Douglas fall in love with little Donna Corcoran. This little girl has one of the sweetest, most angelic faces I've ever seen on a child actress and she's got a sincerity that makes everything she says and does look perfectly natural.The orphanage where the girl is sheltered is run by SPRING BYINGTON, in one of her most unusual roles as a nun who knows baseball, and ELLEN CORBY who does a wistfully sweet job as a beaming assistant to Byington.The baseball flavor gets help from some real footage of Pirate games and some humorous clips of famous people commenting on the angel situation. Among the movie stars, Bing Crosby playing golf.The story is a morality tale done without any special effects gimmicks. I didn't see the remake, but I understand it did use CGI to make more graphic use of the angel element. KEENAN WYNN has the film's only unlikeable role as a sports announcer who's cynical about the little girl's claim that she sees angels in the outfield.Summing up: An amiable comedy, well played by Douglas, Leigh and Corcoran.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real classic and one of my all time favorite movies. So many wonderful moments throughout the film. Paul Douglas is great as Guffy McGovern, a rough, tough hard-nosed baseball manager. His guardian angel changes his ways as the Pirates go from worst to first. Keenan Wynn - don't you think he's the role model for today's outspoken writers and sports radio guys? I cheer every time Guffy punches his lights out.Yeah, the movie's syrupy and has a few clichés, but man, it sure resonated with me when I was younger and still does today. Whenever something goofy happens in a real baseball game I wonder if there's an angel out there wreaking some havoc on a hapless player.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely well-done family-fun story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying my 9 score is based on similar types of movies. I don't know how to compare the kind of a silly, fun movie fit for a five-year-old with, say, Twelve Angry Men, or, The Sound of Music.The idea here is primarily a funny movie set at a ballpark. The Pirate Manager Guffy McGovern has turned into a total jerk by doing little but berating his players until he hears a voice and learns that he has an angel watching him who will help his club, provided he starts behaving better.With a few setbacks, he reforms, and the team climbs out of the cellar into the thick of the pennant race.Much of the story centers on the female newspaper reporter who becomes friendly with him, and the little orphan girl who the reporter made famous by writing about her seeing these angels at the ballpark one day.As the story gets bigger, right before the season's final game, the baseball commissioner holds a hearing, prompted by the former Pirate announcer who has a grudge against manager Guffie.Then we have the final game, naturally a dramatic one with a sentimental story to it, and a happy ending for the three main stars.Throughout the film, there were lots of good laughs, starting with the wonderful idea of having the scenes where McGovern is supposed to be cursing out the umpire or someone sound with the audio cut and pasted to come out as double-talk gibberish. I don't see how it could be better handled. Today, we would hear the cussing and only the 9-year-olds would laugh.It did have more shots of real ballparks than most of these old baseball movies and the action shots, some real footage, were definitely more realistic than most of these films.The religious aspect was most fitting, given the subject at hand. How could you not bring in the subject of religion in a discussion about the existence of angels? I believe the commissioner's "decision" carefully skirted around that point in a way as to not offend non-religious people.The remake was not an absolutely terrible film, but it didn't have one-third the charm or humor of the original. Even the way the angels helped the players here was much more plausible than in the remake.For funny movies centered on baseball, this ranks right in with the best of them. My other favorites here are Little Big League (kid becomes manager of the Twins), It Happens Every Spring (professor develops wood-resistant liquid and becomes star pitcher), and Major League (misfits somehow transform Cleveland into contender).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable family film of the 1950s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baseball and fantasy combine to make exceptionally comfortable movie partners here, as the hot-headed, foul-mouthed (for 1951) manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team learns to clean up his act after he and his losing team receive Divine Intervention on the playing field. Potentially sticky premise gets some heavenly assistance of its own, with Paul Douglas just about perfect in the lead. He's supported by a fine cast, including Keenan Wynn, Janet Leigh (looking lovely), as well as Ty Cobb, Joe DiMaggio, and Bing Crosby in smart cameos. The whimsical script is surprisingly witty, and the direction is straightforward and never too mawkish. Remade by the Disney people in 1994, with one major difference: in this one, you don't see the angels. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't typically watch the "oldies" but within a few minutes this movie grabbed me and didn't let go -- a delightful surprise. I fell in love with the characters and the story line -- it did not disappoint. I noticed in other reviews they did not mention the little girl -- she was a fine actress and so sweet to watch. I loved every scene with her in it. I am not a baseball person, but I found myself falling in love with the game during this movie -- it truly pulled me in and I found myself caring about the plays. The movie reminded me of a mix of "Field of Dreams" and the old "Miracle on 34th Street - charming and full of heart! After the movie I was in the best mood I've been in a long time.

		<fullReview>This is a nicely done little film of the feel-good variety that dominated the fifties. It is the story of an unsuccessful baseball manager whose temper and general disdain for his players has cost him dearly--he is just moving through life. Enter an angel who lays down terms this man must follow in order to redeem himself. Also, he finds a pretty reporter and a little orphan girl who has the ability to actually see the angels as they assist the lowly Pirates. Of course, at some point everything has to return to his having to trust strictly in himself and his players. The angels got him so far--now it's his turn. The baseball scenes are pretty well done and realistic for the most part. It is formulaic but still pulls at the heartstrings.</fullReview>

One of my favorite character actors, King Donavan, has a small role as a reporter. The movie is corny in spots but it is fun and moves along well.My favorite scene is when Douglass announces who will pitch in the game against the Giants. It is a scene a friend and I have reenacted hundreds of times over the years.To paraphrase Douglass as manager Guffy McGovern, "you're getting a good movie".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authenticity knocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1951, the year of this film's release, the Pirates were in a very long dry spell, 9 years prior to their first World Series appearance since 1927. The obvious set-up : "Heaven help the Pirates". I saw this picture as an adolescent during its theatrical release, and 5 times recently. In addition to perfect casting of Paul Douglas, then in his prime - having recently filmed "Panic in the Streets" , the supporting cast is superb, notably Spring Byington and Ellen Corby as Sisters and Janet Leigh is a very credible love interest .Donna Corcoran is a wonderful orphan.What I admire almost as much as the acting, premise and writing is the director's use of actual Pittsburgh locations, although there was no imperative to do so. Included: the King Edward Apartments, Forbes Field, PCC trolley cars, Bigelow Boulevard, Checker cabs. As a former Pittsburgher, I can attest to the authenticity of these elements.A sentimental favorite of mine, but not just for Pittsburgh fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than the remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a general rule, I hate remakes. Now this isn't always true. There are a few, very few, times that the remake is better due to a defect that is eliminated in the remake. However, I really disliked the remake of "Angels in the Outfield" because they took a very good film that could be enjoyed by the family and made it a film most adults couldn't stomach. I know you might disagree, but I loved the 1951 version and would rather just pretend that the Disney remake never occurred.The film is a cute little fantasy about a hot-headed baseball coach (Paul Douglas--who is wonderful in this role). The guy explodes and curses all the time--and he's difficult to like--especially since his team seems to do nothing but lose. Eventually, however, his nasty ways have got to stop--and an angel's voice calls out to him and threatens him unless he changes his ways. And, as an added bonus, the angel and his pals will help the coach's team IF he sticks with the bargain! It's all quite cute and well done--with Janet Leigh, Spring Byington and a cute orphan (who is NOT too cute, thank goodness) on hand for support. Well worth seeing and very clever.By the way, look close for a few cameos--such as Joe DiMaggio, Bing Crosby and Ty Cobb! Also, in a small role as a hat check girl is Barbara Billingsley--the future Mrs. Clever from "Leave It To Beaver".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A More Innocent Era In The World OF Baseball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh how times have changed in the world of baseball. Today we worry about performance enhancing drugs and steroid scandals and players cheating, along with multi-million dollar contracts and ridiculously priced tickets. Back in 1951, apparently the biggest scandal would be a manager who believes he talks to angels! And ends up being threatened with discipline for no reason other than that his belief in angels apparently makes him a better person and his team a better team!Paul Douglas played Guffy McGovern, the manager of the sad-sack Pittsburgh Pirates - a bad joke around the world of baseball. McGovern is mean and demanding to his players, abusive toward the umpires (this being a family movie, I love the very innocent and even humorous way that he's depicted swearing) and he's involved in a long running feud with broadcaster Fred Bayles (Keenan Wynne.) But there's a little girl named Bridget in an orphanage run by nuns who prays for the Pirates and McGovern every day. Her prayers get heard, and all of a sudden heaven is on the Pirates' side. There aren't just angels in the outfield - they're in the infield, in the dugout and sitting on the scoreboard, too. And with the help of the angels the Pirates are transformed into contenders. But when, partly the result of stories written by reporter Jennifer Paige (a very young and beautiful Janet Leigh), people find out that McGovern is consorting with these heavenly beings - well, all hell breaks loose. Suddenly, Bayles has evidence that McGovern is crazy, the Commissioner of Baseball holds a hearing. My gosh, you'd have thought this was about Pete Rose gambling again.It's a very innocent movie - quaint even - when sports wasn't quite the big business it is today and when society wasn't quite as cynical about the stars. It's humorous - but not over the top - and Donna Corcoran (who plays Bridget) is an adorable 8 year old baseball fan who just wants the Pirates to win. On occasion it's even thoughtful - there's some commentary on the debate between belief and disbelief, but - as with most other things in this movie - there's no heavy duty religious content. The baseball action is even pretty well done. Perhaps it turns a bit overly sweet toward the end, but basically, this is a very enjoyable movie - perhaps not the best baseball movie ever made ("Pride Of The Yankees" still holds that place in my books), but quite well done.

		<fullReview>Paul Douglas is perfectly cast as the belligerent, irascible, steak- devouring Pittsburgh Pirates manager whose second-division club is the beneficiary of divine intervention in the form of the unseen Angels of the Heavenly Choir summoned by the prayers of an adorable eight year-old orphan girl (charmingly played by Donna Corcoran) who idolizes Douglas. Filled with top-notch performances: Janet Leigh ? seen here about a decade before her notorious shower scene in Psycho ? as the novice baseball columnist initially outraged at Douglas' harsh methods; Keenan Wynn as the cynical and surly radio announcer with an ax to grind; Spring Byington as the baseball-savvy nun; and James Whitmore as the voice of an Angel who teaches Douglas kindness and shows him the error of his ways, converting him from a foul-mouthed, quick-tempered punch- thrower to a Shakespeare-quoting gentleman. Joe DiMaggio, Ty Cobb, and one-time minority Pirates owner Bing Crosby offer their take on the existence of angels in cameo appearances. Actual game footage of Pirates games ? look for a homer from Ralph Kiner (wearing # 4) who led or tied for the league lead in round-trippers every year from '46 to '52 ? is spliced in to enhance its authenticity. Poignant tale of faith, forgiveness, friendship and second chances with a tear-jerker finale involving a potential new home for Corcoran and a weary ex-pal (Bruce Bennett) of Douglas' taking the mound in a final shot at glory in the last year of his baseball career?and his life. An underrated and overlooked gem deserving of multiple annual cable TV showings. Remade in 1994 with Danny Glover and Tony Danza with glitzy special effects that add little to the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Alright, you play ball with me and I'll play ball with you".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You pick up some interesting tidbits watching these old flicks on Turner Classics when they're hosted by one of their movie critic pros. For example, when Janet Leigh visited Forbes Field to see where this movie was being filmed, she stepped on the infield grass in her high heels and they immediately sank into the turf. Pittsburgh Pirate Ralph Kiner came to her rescue and carried her off the field and some newspaper photographers captured the moment. What seemed like a romantic match-up turned to naught because Leigh was engaged to Tony Curtis at the time.Well this was a nice engaging family picture with a baseball backdrop but I think there was a missed opportunity. Being a fantasy, it could have been more whimsical if the film makers had actually put some angels on screen, you know, maybe borrow someone like Cary Grant or Constance Bennett from 1937's "Topper" to liven things up. OK, they were ghosts but you know what I mean. A couple of winged apparitions behind each of the players might have given more credence to the title.I'd also question the casting of Paul Douglas and Janet Leigh as potential romantics. It worked out for the story but I don't see the connection to reality if you wanted to maintain some credibility for the outcome. Oh well, with angels in the outfield, there wasn't going to be a lot of credibility left to go around anyway.What I really found interesting was seeing Forbes Field the way it was back in the day. To me it didn't look much bigger or better looking than the ball field my home town semi-pro team used back in the early Sixties. I never went to a professional baseball game as a kid, and was never to a big league ball park until the Seventies, so my only basis for comparison would be the old Shea Stadium and Yankee Stadium in New York. Come to think of it, those aren't around anymore either. Boy, time does go by.I'll say one thing though. The story really made you think about the plight of orphans, as in little Bridget's (Donna Corcoran) case where she had spent her entire life of eight years in one. It seemed extremely sad that she was 'given' a birthday by the nuns because no one knew when she was really born. That seemed just so incredibly sad, on top of the ruses the orphan girls thought they needed to attract potential parents, like taking off their glasses. It really makes you think about how lucky most of us are.Well anyway, long before the Los Angeles Angels ever held a home field advantage, this film entertained a good idea about how to treat one another both on and off the field. It might not be the greatest baseball movie, but where else would you ever be able to see Joe DiMaggio, Ty Cobb and Bing Crosby all in one place at the same time. And if you're a seasoned citizen like myself, you won't have any trouble picking out the Beav's mom herself, Barbara Billingsley in a couple of scenes as the hat check girl at Johnny's Steakhouse. Just another reason I get a kick out of these old pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Angel Hits A Homer-Angels in the Outfield ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baseball films, especially those of the 1940s and 1950s were so good, and this film is no exception.As the cantankerous manager, the always excellent Paul Douglas has a role made for him. When a woman reporter is assigned to find out what's wrong with the Pittsburgh Pirates, she aptly comes to the conclusion that Douglas, who is irascible and making life miserable for the players, is the major cause of the teams woes. Janet Leigh is that reporter and any romantic attachment that forms between the two is really inane due to the vast age difference.Did anyone really recognize Spring Byington as Mother Superior? They really did an excellent job in disguising her.The picture deals with the coming of belief of angels by Guffy (Douglas) and he finally shows his humility in his actions, not only to the players but to an orphan girl, Donna Corcoran, who first sees angels when her orphanage brings her to a game.Keenan Wynn steals his acting scenes as a vicious sportswriter, out to get Guffy. He will do anything to attain his objective and even goes to accusing Guffy of insanity.Bruce Bennett as the dying pitcher, given one more chance in the show down game with the Giants, is memorable as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that this movie was directed by Clarence Brown, who gave us such masterpieces as Garbo in Anna Karenina, Gable and Shearer in Idiot's Delight, and a very moving adaptation of Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust. Be that as it may, this a a generally flat film, with no real sense of pacing. The actors are all fine - indeed, much better than their material - but they can't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear.Which is not to say that there is nothing of value here, however. The last part of the movie, which doesn't build a lot of tension, nevertheless shows the main character doing something very decent. It could be developed a lot more effectively, I suppose, but there's something very satisfying about that. (I won't go into details, because I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone.) Yes, this movie is worth watching. It's not close to being a great movie, but it won't waste your time, either.-------------------------I watched this again tonight on TCM. The basic plot - a baseball manager's conversations with angels - is pure fantasy, and not that interesting. It is also very much a repeat of the 1947 20th Century Fox hit Miracle on 34th Street, especially in the final courtroom scene, where, this time, various witnesses are called in to prove the existence of angels, as opposed to Santa Claus. For that, Miracle was a much better movie than this.But where this movie is interesting is its recreation of baseball in the late 1940s/early 1950s. The Pittsburgh "fans" turn downright vicious when they fear leaving an aging pitcher in will cause them to lose the game they need to win the pennant. There are other touches here and there that come off as very real, despite the fantasy of the main story line.As I wrote last year, you won't waste your time watching this movie. Some of it is blatant emotion manipulation. But there are interesting elements in it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental 'Angels in the Outfield' (1951) can't compare to much more compelling 'It Happens Every Spring' (1949)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to compare 'It Happens Every Spring' with 'Angels in the Outfield' as they were filmed within two years of each other (1949 and 1951), are both about baseball and feature Paul Douglas in key roles. 'Spring' is a vastly superior film in almost every way. The protagonist, Vernon K. Simpson, played by Ray Milland, is a chemistry professor who, as a result of an accident, gains access to a wood repellent formula which he uses to become a star pitcher. It's a great fish out of water story where the introverted professor is thrust into the gruff baseball world, and must prove his mettle amongst street smart ballplayers. Douglas plays ally Monk Lanigan, a catcher who looks after Vernon, but is constantly at odds with him since the star pitcher is determined to keep his identity a secret so that his girlfriend and her father (the dean of the school), don't find out what he is up to.In contrast, Douglas' role in 'Angels' is virtually a passive one. Here he's 'Guffy' McGovern, manager of the last place Pittsburgh Pirates, who has a chip on his shoulder. Throughout the first third of the movie, he's as mean as the film's antagonist, sports announcer Fred Bayles (Keenan Wynn) who's bitter after being canned as the Pirates' radio announcer at the behest of Guffy. Nothing is endearing or interesting about the Guffy character and one wonders why any club owner would keep such a surly person in charge of a baseball team (he's constantly berating his players after each game due to their poor play). Why is he so mean-spirited? The answer is simplistic: we find out much later on that apparently he was ditched by a woman for another ballplayer in his younger days! Unlike Ray Milland's pitcher, who must actively overcome personal demons through self-actualized behavior, all Guffy has to do is to listen to an (unseen) angel in the outfield at the old Forbes Field Pirate ballpark advise him to keep his foul language in check and act a bit more graciously toward his fellow man; in exchange, through heavenly intervention, a few of the Pirate miscues in each game are reversed, resulting in the team's sudden improvement in the standings. All it takes is a Pirate winning streak and good old Guffy is no longer playing the part of the team misanthrope. Since Guffy is transformed into a good guy so early on in the film, the internal arc (self-conflict) is resolved.Now with Guffy 'defanged', the rest of 'Angels' mainly features a polemic in favor of religion, pitted against scientific rationalism. Little Bridget White, a nine year old clairvoyant, is soon trotted out and she's the only one who can actually see the angels in the outfield. Also in the mix is the Mother Superior who's looking after little Bridget at the orphanage (the 'tough as nails' sister, is reminiscent of the nuns in 'The Sound of Music' who spunkily remove a spark plug from a car and prevent the Nazis from going after the fleeing Von Trapp family). Guffy is accused of being flat out crazy and the Commissioner of baseball is called in to determine whether he's acting toward the 'detriment' of the game. A creepy psychiatrist is cross-examined by the ever-belligerent broadcaster Bayles but both are made to look by fools when a Protestant Minister, a Rabbi and Catholic Priest testify in Guffy's defense?they argue that angels are certifiably real since they are referred to numerous times in both the Old and New Testaments.After Guffy gets into a fistfight with Bayles, the angel concludes that he hasn't quite learned the lesson of 'turning the other cheek'. They'll be no more 'miracles' for the Pirates and they're now forced to win one last game for the pennant without heavenly intervention. Guffy must now put his 'faith' in a veteran pitcher whose performance of late has not been up to snuff. Of course the veteran bears down and ends up winning the game for his fellow Pirates. One additional happy-ending: Guffy will marry newspaper columnist Jennifer Paige (Janet Leigh) and they'll end up adopting little Bridget.Speaking of Ms. Leigh, in her younger days, she certainly was most pleasing to the eyes?except here has little to do in this film; except perhaps cook dinner for Guffy and hug little Bridget, as the two cheer on the Pirates from the stands.'Angels' has only one thing up on 'It Happens Every Spring': Many of the scenes were shot at the actual Forbes Field ballpark, effecting a visual verisimilitude the latter film lacks. In addition, 'Angels' sports cameos from both the sports and entertainment worlds including brief interviews with such 'luminaries' as Joe DiMaggio and Bing Crosby.It's revealed at the end of the film that the angels actually are famous deceased ballplayers such as Babe Ruth and Christy Matthewson. It would have been nice if we could have actually seen the angels and the story would have been enhanced if they were given some kind of personality. Somehow, when we do hear the angel's off screen voice, those scenes don't work precisely because there's nothing happening that's visually interesting.A good film needs to have both a strong internal and external arc. Unfortunately, there are no twists and turns once Guffy 'sees the light'. Couple that with an antagonist who has no charm, a protagonist who early on is just as surly and a storyline that rather makes an unconvincing case for the ascendancy of religion (i.e. spirituality) in modern life, Angels in the Outfield ends up failing on both counts.Baseball is hardly the type of arena which should be equated with the world of the spirit. Despite also being a fantasy, 'It Happens Every Spring' has no illusions about the rough and tumble world of our national pastime. Why not catch it instead of the sentimental 'Angels in the Outfield'?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inventive idea that's not used very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people may recall the 1994 Walt Disney Pictures remake better than this 1951 MGM original which has basically the exact same plot. However, Hollywood's limitations on special effects and types of sentimentality send this original version downhill and explain its obscurity. Rent the remake instead.</fullReview>
