		<shortDescription>Screwball Comedy, Italian Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 1970's Lina Wertmuller was an art-house superstar. But more importantly, she was a first class original, bursting with a fresh, exciting vision. Now, here's a lively storyline: a rich, racist, reactionary female- a right wing, fascist mind in a knuckle-biting, voluptuous body -is stranded on a mid-sea desert isle with a poverty-stricken, chauvinistic, Communist male- a left-leaning propagandist in a scrawny masculine body. "Make nice" they don't. Well, not right off the bat. Not before much nasty invective and grievous bodily assault take place. But then afterward....ahh, afterward.SWEPT AWAY, though a foreign film, is in the manic, irreverent, well-timed tradition of Hollywood screwball comedies like THE AWFUL TRUTH(1937), MIDNIGHT(1939), THE LADY EVE(1941), and most emphatically, HIS GIRL FRIDAY(1940)- only with a shipload more profane repartee, orgiastic lust, and bone-crunching physicality than was ever permissible or desirable in those older classics. Throwing all vestiges of caution to the four winds, Wertmuller really surprises the viewer with her take on the battle of the genders strained through a volcanic political dialectic.Upon its initial release many in the audience demurred strongly (and still do) as the male's dominance slipped into outright brutality. Certainly, Wertmuller can be accused of going too far, but never of boring us. Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangelo Melato are absolutely letter perfect: sulking, teasing, attacking, retreating, seducing, rampaging, abandoning. Their director spurs them through an emotional and physical gauntlet and they meet each dramatic challenge with winning artistry. You may feel wrung out by film's end. Or enraged. Or both. But you'll have quite a time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keeps reinventing itself; highly recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that's exceedingly difficult to pin down. It would be easy to dismiss it, but it's just as easy to be startled and amazed by it. The story's simple enough: a shaggy, dark-skinned man (played by Giancarlo Gianni) works under the thumb of the bourgoisie on a hired yacht. He despises them, and they despise him. One of these rich people is particularly annoying, a blonde woman (Mariangelo Melato), who spends her days incessantly bitching, spouting capitalist slogans, and putting down the servant class. These two characters, not surprisingly, end up together on a dinghy whose motor has broken. She never shuts up, he stares at her murderously. They eventually land on a deserted island, where he refuses to help her whatsoever. She eventually has to submit to whatever abuses he chooses to dish out. Yes, that does include physical and eventually a near-rape, which will certainly disgust and upset a lot of the film's audience. The film can actually be sort of perverse. I'm sure many have marvelled that, with some of the film's crueller scenes, the film was directed by a woman. It is actually, in its way, nearly as perverse at some times as The Night Porter, directed in the very same year in Italy, also by a woman. That film's merits are more dubious than Swept Away's, however. The film is unexpectedly hilarious, at least for the first forty-five minutes or so. When the abuse starts, the film begins to shift to a social issues picture. Class issues are important, as well as racial issues (which kind of amount to the same thing). I didn't mind seeing the woman verbally abused - she spent the first forty-five minutes doing the same to the guy. The smackings she receives were hard for even me to take, however. The politics are nevertheless exceedingly interesting. The film has some very good material on the social constructions of class. After this section of the film, the story shifts to erotica, and it is very erotic at times. In this section, the film is a direct descendent of Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris (as was The Night Porter, incidentally). After that, the film shifts once again to romantic melodrama, as the two are rescued. The man makes the decision to signal a yacht that he sees in the distance simply because he wants to test the deep love that the woman swears by. These shifts in narrative can be clearly felt, like upshifting in a manual transmission vehicle, but it works rather well. I was always right with the film with its emotions (although it took me a good twenty minutes to get into the film). I ended up rather loving it, despite its flaws. Now I actually want to see the Madonna version to see how bad that hack Guy Ritchie screwed it up. At one point in the film the man tells the woman that she looks like the Madonna. Pretty funny, no? 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw, not politically correct, but as passionate as they come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire premise of the accidentally positioned relationship of the sailor with the rich and spoiled woman is entirely contrived and like a very well oiled opera, it spins in surprising circles, taking us to places we did not anticipate when we first meet the characters.Where it could have fallen into a parody or in its simplest form, a Marxist diatribe, the director raises the form into metaphor and both shocks and surprises us along the way. I can imagine that when this film first came out in 1974, the public must have gasped at several things: there are several moments in the film when the sailor just explodes in a rageful outpouring of physical abuse to the lovely lady. In short, he beats her about the face and wrestles with her until she is quite roughed up. The repeated slapping is still hard to watch, even if you think in your mind that these are well trained actors. The overt machismo that the sailor humiliates the lady with is both laughable and grotesque by our standards. Sure the film is making fun of Italian men and especially at the expense of the so-called coarser Southern Italian men and even more the Sicilian men....but it is so overdone that it too rises to metaphor. He struts about like a liberated tyrant, cave-man, looking for every opportunity to enjoy sweet revenge over his hapless companion. What does he achieve? He certainly does break her down and destroys every vestige of her snobby, boorish, disrespectful, artificial outer self and when pealed away what emerges is her long suppressed tender and humbled self. Listen: some people, usually men, go and seek some lunatic guru up in the mountains to help them attain this type of simplicity and humility, so the idea in itself is not far fetched. The difference is that this lady did not choose her fate on the island, did not go seeking humility; it was the only way to survive and in a way here lies an important aspect of Wertmuller's film. Is she asking us: what control do we have when forces much greater than us (poverty in particular as exemplified by the sailor and his laments) push us to limits of endurance? What type of people do we become? Wertmuller is also asking us: the rich have so many more choices, including cultivating their own sense of place and humility in the world and that they do not cannot be attributed to the same stresses that tear apart the poor. I'm simplifying but this seems to be one of the underlying themes.Other themes: the sailor takes advantage of a situation that presents itself in his life for the first time. Sure he's been working hard all his life and he's still the lackey cleaning up the crap of the rich. And, he's totally unappreciated by his family. Now, he can work just as hard but call ALL of the shots including sexual domination and physical appreciation. He certainly did not set out to win over the lovely lady but after seeing how dependent she was and how unaware of her own self sufficiency, he saw an opportunity to dominate and over a woman! The temptation was too great to let alone. She is everything he has fantasized about (without admitting it) and he taunts her with the very same thoughts.And then let's look at passion and love. Where the chemical attraction ends (and by the last third of the film there is plenty of that) there appears to be true and passionate love. At this point I started to feel completely caught up in their torrid affair and the tenderness the sailor finally gives to her just melts your heart. Underneath all that caveman behavior is a very soft hearted and loving man, who never had an outlet for his feelings. Sure he acts like a child, demanding love only on his terms, but that's not the point. They are both childish in their own ways. What the film leaves in your mind...how is it that such diametrically opposed and different people can scratch and crawl their way into passionate and REAL love? And while the film leaves you believing in the truth of their passions, it evaporates at the end, leaving me, at least, very upset at the outcome. Of course Wurtmuller could have opted for the happy ending and then what? In a sense it would have become just too ridiculous, becoming a lampoon of what was uncovered between them. In life, these types of illicit affairs are very often ephemeral and while short lived, very hot. And then they disappear into thin air. Do we seek the romantic ending we wished the film to have taken or do we accept the bitterness of the sailor, cursing much more than the rich lady: his fate yet again returning as bitter as ever; he returning to be a smelly lout of a husband, dragging behind his wife as she barely endures his presence.Giannini gives a towering performance which although teeters on comic self parody, he inhabits his role and lets his inner self evolve as the moment changes. Never over acting even when in a full rage, showing gentleness and hot passion in perfect balance, he is awesome as the rough edged sailor, going nowhere in life. Mariangela Melato is simply gorgeous and sexy and has the time of her life with this role. The two of them took risks as actors but the sparks all seemed so real. You just don't see movies made like this today because we live in politically correct times. Films like this and Linsday Anderson's "IF" would either shock us or else would have been ignored as too artsy. I loved this film and the way it moved my heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Power, Politics and Human Nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that many of the comments for 'Swept Away...' slightly miss the point. Certainly, it is about politics. But Wertmuller is not taking sides between her communist &amp; capitalist heros. She is examining what happens when they are removed from the society that defines their roles and their relationship.Once the balance of power is reversed, they essentially change places. He becomes dominant (and often abusive). She becomes weak and submissive. The rough sex, etc. is all symbolic of how the poor are treated by the rich. And Wertmuller shows us that the 'working class hero' has no inherent nobility. Put in the position of power, he is every bit as cruel as his former oppressors. Once they return to society, the balance of power is once again reversed.The message here is that there are no political heros and villains. Power is relative and arbitrary. And sadly, it is our nature to abuse it. The lesson is, perhaps, that we must rise above that base instinct and treat our fellow men with empathy and generosity. "We have met the enemy, and he is us."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the shrewish bitching of Rafaella and the grumbling of the sailor help- this is a very thought-provoking movie. What especially helps is the cinematography- by Wertmuller's husband- the white sailor uniform, the black diaphanous garb of R. and the blue sea as backdrop. As the affair progressed from hate to a passionate love the changes in body language is well done. Though I saw this movie many years ago- its power to address class wars, the battle between men and women and in inevitable conclusion has never left me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are we all just puppets of society?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A totally compelling story of two totally disparate people (rich vs. poor, capitalist vs. communist, helpless vs. capable, male vs. female) put into a life and death situation, and the love that develops when the barriers that society had put between them evaporate.25 years after it was made, this movie still has lots to say and says it with a great script, solid acting, and lush location shooting. The message of the movie is as valid today as it was then. There is a sort of "rape" scene, which may offend the politically correct... but then again, what doesn't offend these people? My favorite line is from the rape scene, as a matter of fact. The sexual tension has mounted between the two principal characters who are stranded together on an island and the final barrier between them is about to come tumbling down. As the beautiful but hapless woman (whose makeup enhanced looks are now starting to fade in the harsh environment) puts up some token resistance, the dirty little Sicilian sailor slaps her and says, "Shut up and let me f**k you while you still look good!" It's a classic.One last thing... the idiot factory that is modern Hollywood is releasing a re-make of sorts of this movie... starring Madonna. Please see the original before this suck-fest of a remake comes out and tarnishes this beautiful movie's legacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this movie. I have to admit I only saw this because I heard of Madonna's remake and my love for the Goldie Hawn movie "Overboard", but...wow! Interesting, romantic, powerful, hard-to-watch, political, funny, sad, etc. This movie has it all. You can analyze this movie to death, but it will do it a disservice. Quite simply, it's about a bizarre romance that happens when two people who are total opposites, thus hating each other, are stranded on a remote island and must learn how to live together. By today's standards, this is a very un-P.C. movie: Male domination over a woman. However, it IS just a movie, not real life--don't let that put you off; and there are some scenes that are hard to take, but given the context of the characters, you might think to yourself--"is this deserved?" I think some parts are, and others--not at all. You might like this film if you liked Pedro Almodovar's "Atame! (Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down!)". This is a film you'll end up discussing with others after you've seen it. Also, I don't recommend viewing this around children or very impressionable teenagers.</fullReview>

Giancarlo Giannini is THE best Italian actor of his time. And as a bonus, with the explicit subtitles, you can learn how to curse in Italian! While the abusive male behaviour is not terribly pc these days, it reflects the culture of some European countries. All in all shows why foreign films are so different from American films.

		<shortDescription>Objectively Observing the Motions of a Preposterous World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Swept Away is criticized by Tania Modleski for poking fun at feminists. That is part of the film's accomplishment, though: Swept Away is culturally valuable for its ability to poke fun at everyone whose flaws warrant it. Wertmuller presents us with extreme characters in absurd situations?characters we love to hate but who are still capable of moving us when they express sincere emotional tenderness and vulnerability. This story explores the ways in which political and economic divisions allow pig-headed people to treat each other. And it certainly doesn't support the oppression of women, as a short-sighted viewing of the film may suggest, because Wertmuller emphasizes the notion that relationships based on one's ability to dominate the other perpetually fail. Whether that dominance comes from political, economic, or gender roles, domination and subjugation create such mistrust in both parties that love cannot sustain itself. Wertmuller masterfully creates type characters?the rich bitch and the vengeful Sicilian?who turn into human beings outside of society and touch the audience with their attempt and failure at love. The elements of composition, music and lighting are used in such a beautiful way that the audience is convinced throughout the couple's stay on the island that love is possible, despite the divisive odds against them, and so their fall is that much more saddening at the end of the film. And the often harsh dialog and action are Wertmuller's bright way of presenting a farcical tale to her audience, daring us to judge the characters lest we be judged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Lina Wertmuller's frequent themes is how Northern Italy often looks down on Southern Italy. Nowhere does she explore this better than in "Swept Away". While on a tour in the Mediterranean, spoiled, pro-Fascist Northern Italian Raffaela Pavone Lanzetti (Mariangela Melato) orders Sicilian deckhand Gennarino Carunchio (Giancarlo Giannini) to take her to the grotto so she can go swimming before dinner. Lo and behold, the boat conks out and they end up an uncharted island (no, this isn't "Gilligan's Island" here). Raffaela treats Gennarino like dirt at first, but after he explodes at her, she grows to respect him.Like I said, this was Lina Wertmuller's best treatment of Northern-Southern Italian relations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say this was what Lina Wertmuller was shooting for. But it seemed to this viewer, that the luscious, sex-in-every-pore, Mariangela Melato was playing a super woman who always wins, no matter what. She adapts. To whatever. And wins. She won her first world by totally dominating her rich husband and all his servants. It worked. It was never her plan. It just worked. And so she tries to dominate Gianinni when they are stranded. It doesn't work. His survival skills are necessary and his personality is not to be dominated, at least not in the regular way. And so she surrenders to him. Not by plan. But still she surrenders completely and totally to him. And his passion for the conquered goddess becomes so consuming that he is now the conquered, the consumed. She's not in control, but she's in fact totally in control. Super woman has won. Super woman understands that this paradise they have fallen into works only if they stay in this Eden. The smitten fool realizes this too, but must bite the forbidden apple to satisfy his fool's desire to see the truth in front of his eyes. Once out of Paradise, super woman, armed with new tools learned in her stay in Paradise, begins a new conquest of her husband's world. She's super woman and she will win again, not by intent, but because she is who she is. The fool goes back to his fat wife and his foolish life and his foolish passions. He lost. She won. She always wins, all the time.Thank you Lena, for this incredible film and this unfogettable film viewing experience. You should know, Lena, that the lovely date I took to this film in NYC's Paris Cinema so long ago, well, she shook at the climax of the rape scene. I think she actually had an orgasm right there.Let the film professionals dwell in the horrors of wars andConcentration Camps in Seven Beauties. Let them find their insights and meanings of the world in that. That's their world. This is Lena's masterpeice for the people. People living lives. Thank you.</fullReview>

The fact that a woman directs the film makes it even more empowering to the male ego.

		<fullReview>This movie is a bit odd and it is a bit long. However, it is impossible not to watch. While I do think most of it can be taken as being highly allegorical I prefer to watch it on a simple surface level. It is too easy to reduce its characters to being representatives of political systems and when you do this you miss the emotional heart of the story. It is a sort of odd love story about opposites who connect on a secluded island. The film features some completely ridiculous dialog and lots of shouting. Some of the physical violence is off putting but these people go through a "primal" experience therefore certain walls must be broken down in order for this to happen so the violence sort of works and then again it sort of does not. In many ways this is like watching a love story unfold between two violent, largely unlikeable people. Fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd Politics, Good Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers*** Don't try and analyze Lina Wertmüller's 1975 "Swept Away" too deeply. You'll go nuts. Treat it as a strange little story, a fable if you will. The story itself is straightforward. A gaggle of wealthy Italians have chartered a yacht for island hopping around the Mediterranean. One of them, Rafaela, is a boorish, arrogant bitch, always picking on the crew, one Sicilian in particular. Her politics are right wing, and that of the crew, Communist. She is also beautiful, and as you would expect, there is much conflict. One fine day, during an ill-advised trip to search for sea caves, she and the sailor find themselves lost and adrift after their dingy breaks down away from the yacht. Finding a small, but forested island they land, but have to fend for themselves as its completely deserted. Now, the tables turn, and the sailor, who knows how to survive, has the upper hand over Rafaela, who doesn't. He's physically and emotionally abusive, crushing all Rafaela's self-respect and forces her to be his love-slave and all-round gofer. And guess what? She loves it. I've said enough about the plot, and certainly don't want to delve into what all this is supposed to mean. What I will say is that the acting is superb, and the direction and photography top notch. I recommend this movie, but warn you not to be too analytical about it.</fullReview>

I saw the original Italian version of "Swept Away" on late night TV when I was about 16 (1980). In later years, I remembered this excellent film about class struggle, ship-wrecks, and battle of the sexes. I knew it was Italian, but no one I asked seemed to know what the damn thing was called....until last week. I saw a commercial for the new Madonna film, and even before the commercial was done, I knew it was a shoddy remake of that classic 1974 Italian film I loved so much. The original film really reminded me of "Lord of the Flies" (But sexier!), in the aspect that on the Island all the rules changed and they were in their own environment. I always remember how the class structure returns as soon as they are rescued at the end of the movie. The original "Swept Away" is a classic, and thanks to Madonna I can now rent it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good "Swept Away"; not the terrible "Swept Away" with Madonna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever see Italian director Lina Wertmueller's "Swept away by a Mysterious Destiny in the Blue Sea of August" at a DVD store, or Netflix, or the TV guide, please do not dismiss it as being the same as "Swept Away" with Madonna, which was an incredibly boring film from beginning to end. Wertmueller's "Swept away by a Mysterious Destiny in the Blue Sea of August" is so much better than that.During the early 1970s, Lina Wertmueller went through what was arguably the most creative period in her career. She was writing and directing films like "Love and Anarchy," "Seven Beauties" and "Swept away by a Mysterious in the Blue Sea of August." And what is so great about this latter film with such a long title? For one, "Swept Away" is actually about something: Marxism, class struggle, love on a deserted island and people rediscovering themselves and these themes are all dealt with in a novel and highly intelligent way. "Swept Away" has great actors, like Giancarlo Giannini as the sexist and communist Italian sailor Gennarino Carunchio and Mariangela Melato as the snobbish Italian aristocrat Rafaella Lanzetti, who are transformed into lovers by the crucible of class warfare while on a deserted island. The great thing about these two characters, Gennarino and Rafaella, is that they are not solely good or solely evil. They possess many bad and good traits and we discover, over the course of the film, that although they do horrible things to each other (Gennarino is by far the worst) we end up sympathizing with them on a human level in spite of ourselves.For these three reasons alone - the plot, the actors and the character development - this film already has a home run. But in addition, "Swept Away" is also a wonderfully musical film which breathes life into the gorgeous cinematography of the deserted island in particular and imbues each visual with meaning. A brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swept Away: Classicism rather than misogyny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When assessing the fighting that occurs between Raffaella and Gennarino in Lina Wertmuller's Swept Away (1974), many critics are led to believe that the movie discusses sexual roles in society, or Gennarino's misogyny, as Raffaella becomes subordinate and is slapped many times by the male Gennarino. Thinking of this satirical film solely in terms of the battle of the sexes only diverts viewers' attention away from the political meaning, which is much more distinct: the conflict between social classes and the rivalry between Italy's richer north and poorer southern region. The moral point of this satire is to depict the timeless clash of the two most opposing political views at the time the film was made in 1974. Only by considering the political situation in Italy in the 1970s, a period laden with social conflicts, and paying heed to the political dialogues and symbolism in the movie, can one truly understand the satirical theme of Swept Away. In Swept Away, political discussions among the characters are shown from the beginning to the end of the movie. The two main characters are not only separate by gender, but also by region of birth, class and politics. Gennarino considers the capitalist society as evil and is a committed Communist, while Raffaella is a raving capitalist. Even though a New York Times article addresses this movie as "Lina Wertmuller's Epic Battle of Sexes" alluding only to the physical fights between the two main characters, one should remember that for each slap on Raffaella's face, Gennarino names an evil deed the north Italian capitalists have done to the poor, which brings us back to the conflict of classes. But some insist there is no political content at all in this movie. Tania Modleski finds it an antifeminist, misogynist, film about men's sexual fantasies and sexual roles and attitudes in society, that the scenery of a desert island only makes the plot a classic masculine porno fantasy and an insult to feminists. Moreover, the author Lina Wertmuller despises ugly women, as the lovely beauty of Raffaella throughout the movie is towards to the end contrasted with the ugliness and unpleasant manners of Gennarino's wife. Lina Wertmuller has been indeed attacked from critics on feminist grounds. One of the misogynist critics brings up these questions: "For was not Wertmuller humiliating the woman merely to cram down our throats the spurious thesis that a work-class lover is so virile that we would at once be Swept Away by his abusive charm? That Woman secretly wishes to be abused and in fact can attain sexual gratification only by submitting to violence and degradation? And this thesis from a woman who calls herself a revolutionary? Are Wertmuller's women mere cows, anxious to be mastered and abused?" (Melle 82). Most of the feminist criticism centers on the scenes of physical fighting on the island, where Gennarino only uses violence as a reaction against his learning and socio-cultural limitations, of which Raffaella tirelessly makes him aware. Raffaella is a blonde, blue-eyed northern Italian; her northern accent is meant to be more sophisticated than that of the dark-skinned Gennarino, who speaks with a rustic and thick Sicilian accent. Not only because of their different accents, but the fights are also regarding their class inability to communicate that includes a mixture of difficult vocabulary and different values. The movie shows us a conflict of classes between two opposing stereotypes representing two extreme different worlds, the rich and the poor, the capitalist and the communist, the North and the South, the "pale" the "dark" skinned Italians. This conflict of classes reflects Italy's social reality of the time when Swept Away was released, in 1974, when the Italian political context in the late 1960s was characterized by social disorder, which resulted in a difficult and contradictory situation in the 1970s, the time when advanced and traditional sections of society got in disagreements creating serious national problems between north and south. In Swept Away, Wertmuller intelligently explores human emotions through the interaction of classes that defines and motivates not only Gennarino and Rafaella's behavior but also everyone's reality under capitalist society. On the yacht Gennarino works hard but his work does not mean anything, Rafaella maintains the position of a boss because of an accident of birth. She does not earn her position; she does not work for this position. While on the island Gennarino works and his work gives him power. He feeds them, hunts, builds the fire, and creates a place to sleep. His work has value while Rafaella's accident of birth does not guarantee a privileged position anymore. Perhaps, reviews should focus more on the issue of class rather than finding it misogynist. Works CitedCanby, Vincent. "Lina Wertmuller's Epic Battle of Sexes." New York Times.

		<shortDescription>Sexiest Movie in Ages with REAL Chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinematography: superior. Writing: excellent. Acting: somewhat over the top in the political arguments yelled at top volumn. Sexual chemistry between the proletarian and 'aristocrat': Priceless.I found myself mesmerized. The huge eyes of the man, as he listens to the bigoted arrogant arguments of the beautiful woman are amazing, as you can see the tension and anger building. Turns out, he is a devoted communist, not a follower of the totalitarian government in Russia...so often confused with true communism, but a devoted communist. One of those.We are about to go crazy with the stupid mindless arguing by these rich people on this gorgeous yacht, when finally we are rescued by the imperious bikini-girl, demanding that she be taken to the others to fish at 7 p.m. Of course, we all know that they won't get there, as the motor kicks out and they wander around in the middle of a gorgeous sea. No one seems to ever have to go to the bathroom, unfortunately. Just as well. No, they don't get thirsty either.But the acting, especially the fury between them which resolves itself into hot, flaming sex that she has to beg for is glorious!!!! It is definitely NOT what you would expect.Spoiler*****************8 When finally united with his wife, he asks tenderly about the kids. So you know, he can't return to that magic island where all the love was white hot. That's not real. But when he takes the 100000 lire and buys a beautiful ring for the woman, you know that he is showing todo el mundo that he is indeed a man, buying her this 'divorcement' ring....already knowing she'll reject his invitation to return to the island.Great movie. I"m glad I bought it, and I WISH there was one of those discussions on it to give us some insight into the Italian government of the 70s. I was confused by the discussion of the Pope, fascism and communism. Had I known the political climate of Italy at the time, I might have understood this part better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**** (Out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, damn all those pretentious artistic Italian film projects of twenty-five years ago! They possess a certain freedom of dialogue which was altogether lacking in American film then and still is undeniably lacking in even the best-written States projects. Here is a very interesting little film from female director Lina Wertmueller...a film of clashing passions, yes, but also a very beautiful film with an ironic foothold on its material on one end and a dervishly melancholic view on the other.Simply put, this film is about the hunger developed between two Italians of differing social castes. One is a bearded Communist with a serenly blue pair of eyes (Giancarlo Giannini), and the other is a spoiled, slender blonde made rich through methods of capitalism (Mariangelo Melato). Of course at first they can't stand each other, but as time goes by, the Communist lies hold of the woman (both figuratively and physically) and practically forces himself upon her.The film reminded me of Jonathan Demme's equally overlooked "Something Wild" in the two vastly different tones of its sections which seamlessly fit together at the end. The first half of the movie portrays life aboard a yacht as the capitalist woman and her husband sun bathe on deck while those who prescribe to socialist practices do the manual labor underneath. This part of the film is as bright and witty as any I've seen, not lacking the slightest inhibition at using such words as "proletariat" and commenting on the various evils of capitalism that would scare off many an American producer when faced with a similar project.However the dynamics of the story are soon set in place, as man and woman are placed out at sea, amidst the sparkling incandescence of the water as captured by Giulio Battiferri, Guiseppe Fornari and Stefano Ricciotte's gorgeous cinematography. Eventually they find themselves on a deserted island, where the man turns the woman's capitalism against her by making her wash his underpants for food. Later the man pushes the woman past her economic facade into a primal state of sexual ecstasy interspersed with the man's vicious slappings equating himself as the "master" over the woman. Such a film leads to its inevitable conclusion, and one finds oneself exhausted at the allegorical nature of the situation.Although I don't look at "Swept Away" with any sort of agreement on its sympathetic view of the Communist proletariat, I find its symbolic interpretations fascinating. Indeed the movie gives capitalism the slinky, seductive form of Woman, and equates the marketplace as whorishness of the worst kind. On the other hand, the film portrays Communism as some sort of untamed beast irresistable in its muscular masculinity. As the film ends one is reminded that two different perspectives can hardly live together, but at one time they were able to coexist. Of course those sympathetic to the Communist cause have less to worry about now then they did in 1975 when "Swept Away" was released, but nevertheless it remains a mesmerizing find essaying the ideals of such a state of mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A trip into the Mediterranean sea becomes a trip into the discovery of how society's frameworks of the rich and poor are delicate and temporary.In his review in the Chicago Sun-Times, American film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, his highest rating. Ebert wrote that the film "resists the director's most determined attempts to make it a fable about the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and persists in being about a man and a woman. On that level, it's a great success." I'm on board with Ebert. I think this film was exceptional. Emotionally, it was raw, and I have to praise the performers and the director for the intensity. How you get a love story out of deep economic and political hatred, I don't know, but they pull it off. And despite the violence and abuse, there is something deeper here. Really a great film with something powerful to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What marvelous Italian sensibility! Italians have to be muted for drama, but give them comedy and they soar, it's who they are, who we are in general down South and all over the Mediterranean - boisterous, frivolous, yelling past each other out of some need to stay afloat, lest the silence bogs us down.The allegory is of course as obvious as the characters, a shrill rich wife and a grumbling sailor, a communist we're told, on board her yacht during a cruise get stranded in a deserted island. Of course the dynamics shift - we see how easy and quick it is for him to become a tyrant now that he has the upper hand, how degrading for her to be ordered about. But then sex enters the picture and that changes everything; she's beaten around, almost raped and comes to love the submission. As thin as the politics may be, so much more subversive when it becomes sexual. Rape fantasies are common in men and women alike, no reason to hide, and nothing peculiar about it - sex is after all in a primal way about the swap of power. But here just as about the fantasy is about to be consummated, at the peak of sexual paroxysm, this is the moment the filmmaker chose to have the man pull back and be revealed a delusional fool - she must cherish him as her god and so on.The question that looms, a deep deep one, is was it the island? Or is it civilization that obscures? Which of the two shows their true self? Eventually they bond as lovers, but that is based on everything else we've seen. Do the limits imposed by being seen and known in public lead into delusions of self? Or does uninhibited freedom? Was it true love or was it a simple desire that found no limits to run up against? Who's to make all these impositions of truth anyway?And we have to counterpoint all this against the richness of how they hold themselves in each other's eyes, some of the most expressive eyes in film - it's perfectly cast anyway, but the eyeplay between the two is marvelous, starting from that moment they share on the deck one night.So this is fascinating stuff, about limits of self, about a slippery passion and having no logical truth that can explain beyond it, the only thing it asks is that you don't be moral about it. I can only imagine it better in Pasolini's hands, this lover of textures and breezes of air.</fullReview>

I had never even heard of the (female) director before but am completely sold, not only ordering more right away but even ordering the Madonna remake that I wasn't even aware of. I'm sure that will be a disappointment but I wonder if it is really as bad as some make out, for this is a really tough little tale. Strong political and socio-political elements together with increasingly controlling and sadistic sexual goings on as a rich socialite in all her finery and extreme right wing views gets marooned with the much despised communist deck hand. Some elements are a bit dated but from the almost screwball first section through the hardening and desperate survivalist relationship stage, this is absorbing and thrilling stuff. There is much here to delight, upset, and thrill but not for the tender hearted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swept Away (1974) **** (out of 4) Rich woman Raffaella Lanzetti (Mariangela Melato) and her servant Gennarino Carunchio (Giancarlo Giannini) end up being taken away from their boat as the current sweeps them away and onto a deserted island. Now that the tables are turned and her money isn't going to save her, Gennarino plans to teach the woman a lesson about life. Lina Wertmuller's SWEPT AWAY has been called a masterpiece by many, a evil picture by some and there are certainly some that fall somewhere in between. I think the reason there are so many mixed reviews of this film is that it's so hard to fully put your hands on it. I mean, a hundred different people could attend a screening of this film and then afterwards each of them would see something different. Is it a drama? It is a political message about living conditions between the rich and poor? Is it some sort of dark comedy where the poor man gets his day in the sun? SWEPT AWAY is a film I really loved watches even if parts of it certainly rubbed me the wrong way. The opening twenty-minutes or so clearly set up that this rich woman is rather heartless, cruel and uncaring about anyone other than herself. When she gets lost at sea you're happy to see her get a dose of reality but at the same time I can't say I enjoyed how she got it. There were times where the man physically abuses her and I must admit that this didn't make me care for him any or cheer for him to "teach" the rich woman. Yet, the film takes these ugly moments and does stuff with them that most films wouldn't dare try, nevermind actually making them work. Another rather remarkable thing is how much you can believe what you're seeing. I'm not going to ruin what actually happens but director Wertmuller really makes you believe it from start to finish and talk about the perfect ending. The film contains some very harsh language and some ugly violence but in its own pay these scenes are rather poetic. Another major plus is that both Melato and Giannini turn in two of the greatest performances you're going to see. Both of them were simply terrific in their roles and even when the tables are turned, both of them are believable and really sell the fire and passion of the story. SWEPT AWAY is a very unique film that's quite unlike any other including the countless imitations that have been released. The film manages to work on so many levels and it's greatness is also what many might see as ugliness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film in a Film History class. I was quite impressed at how Lina Wertmüller had shot this film. Although I think the story line is more important. I think that this film shows a raw look at a certain time period when men saw things a certain way. I think that Lina Wertmüller saw this as more of a satire than anything else. Showing that women need to be dominated and that men need to be more assertive. But I think that the meaning has been lost and that this film itself has fallen into the cracks of a "period piece". In which we assume that things were that way, and they may have been. But I see this film as a very important step in the right direction, meaning that this film has shown what a joke male superiority is and that things must change. Also i think on a certain level how primitive life works, how we can all be removed to our base essentials and how the rich, those that forget their deep "hunting and gathering" past will suffer. I think that this is more a stab at the rich in Italy at the time. In any case this movie is entertaining and when you leave it, you leave it thinking, so that is why I think it deserves to be seen by many people</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raffaella, who is a rich woman, her husband, and their rich friends rent a yacht and go sailing in the Mediterranean. She and her husband carry on screaming arguments about political ideology, with Raffaella expressing her fascist views with much vehemence. We all expect Italians in movies to be passionate, but we have never seen anything like this. Gennarino is a deckhand and a communist, whom she treats like dirt.When Raffaella and Gennarino get stranded on a deserted island, he decides to reverse roles with a vengeance. He beats her into submission, forcing her to call him Signor Carunchio, while calling her Raffaella (when not calling her a bitch or an industrial whore), instead of Signora Lanzetti, as he did on board the yacht. Then, when all this verbal and physical abuse has finally made her want him to ravish her brutally, he says that is not enough. She must tell him she loves him, kiss his feet, and worship him like a god. She actually does kiss his feet and submit to him totally, falling madly in love with him. But he still beats her whenever she misbehaves, as when she presumes to think instead of doing what she is told.This may be a minor point, but it is odd that Gennarino, the communist, believes that women should be totally subservient to men, which we would be more likely to associate with fascism.Anyway, the day finally arrives when a boat comes within sight of the island. Raffaella does not want to signal them because she fears being rescued might spoil their happiness. But Gennarino believes that only if they are rescued can he be sure that she truly loves him. Once rescued, Raffaella might have been able to thwart public opinion and marry Gennarino, but when she sees him being greeted by his wife, who talks about their children, she has misgivings. But given Gennarino's attitude toward women, why should he care about what happens to his wife? He wants Raffaella to go back and live on the island with him, but she decides against it. He reverts to calling her a bitch and an industrial whore.Because this is a comedy, we hesitate to take it too seriously, but there simply is not enough humor in this movie to overcome the revulsion we feel at the way he treats her, especially since the movie seems to prove he is right in believing that a man can make a woman love him by degrading her and beating her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this film so interesting is that it involves you in it's conversations and hidden meanings. Though, the part that is the most shocking in this movie is how the poor sailor treats the rich woman. To me the movie showed the problems with communist and capitalist societies. Though I believe that it shows the dictatorial prone communism is even more dangerous than the deprived consumer obsessed capitalist society that can lead to the exploitation and the expansion of the underclass.One interesting contrast is that the poor sailor looses his temper every time he is asked to do something, for which is payed. Than out of retaliation he simply enslaves the rich woman on the island, by using ancient yet affective method of violence. While the other view is that the capitalist woman treats the sailor with utmost disrespect, even though he is payed, to her he is nothing more than a figurative slave.In the beginning of the film the rich woman comments that communism ultimately leads to totalitarian dictatorship and that is exactly what happens on the island. Some confusion comes in when she enjoy's being a slave, though I think that is a different offshoot of the argument that the director is trying to make.There are many more such examples through the film, and I hope my insight is not too far off the mark and is somewhat helpful.</fullReview>

When the larger social order is removed, people go nuts until they can create one of their own; so that the order they make feeds on that dementia and the microcosm is as crazy as the larger order that spawned its members. Smack a girl around, make her sleep rough, make her work for birds eggs and raw fish till she calls you "master." Sounds like a recipe for true love.

		<shortDescription>Defeatism or just realism?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SWEPT AWAY is a genuinely artistic, intelligent, and thought-provoking film that uses a simple story to deal with many complicated issues. However, it's also a product of the school of thought that advocates (1) frustrating audience expectations in the name of artistic evolution, and (2) being as downbeat as possible in the name of realism. The result is a film that I can appreciate at an intellectual level, but can't genuinely enjoy at some deeper gut level.The story is a variation on a theme that's probably as old as literature itself -- the role reversal that results from a master and servant being "swept away" from a world governed by the master's rules and into a world governed only by the law of survival. The master in this case is Raffaella Pavone Lanzetti (Mariangela Melato), a high-society lady to whom reheated coffee and undercooked spaghetti are major crises. (In fact, the spaghetti was NOT undercooked; Raffaella had never heard of al dente.) Ms. Lanzetti is also offended by the hired help's sweaty T-shirts, apparently unaware that if you perform manual labor in the hot summer sun and the hotter galley of your husband's yacht, a significant amount of sweat is inevitable. The servant is Gennarino Carunchio (Giancarlo Giannini), one of the workers on the yacht, who suffers the largest share of Raffaella 's complaining and derision. In the first part of the film, Gennarino spends much time muttering about how he'd like to get his hand on Raffaella for five minutes.Gennarino gets to act on his stored-up anger when he and Raffaella get stranded on a deserted island. And herein lies the first example of the film deliberately frustrating the audience. A traditional drama would let us see one character as the hero and the other as the villain. Or, possibly, we'd be asked to see both of them as heroes, villains, or mixed bags. In any case, we'd be able to decide who we were going to sympathize with throughout the story. But SWEPT AWAY continually turns the tables on you. Until they get to the island, your heart is going out to Gennarino, and you would dearly love to dump a plate of that al dente spaghetti on Raffaella 's head. (BTW, you actually get to see something like that happen in the Madonna remake.) But when the worm turns, the "lesson" Gennarino gives Raffaella is so cruel, brutal, and sadistic that it seems way out of proportion to the offense she committed against him -- especially since it goes on so relentlessly for so long. Furthermore, we realize that Raffaella 's attitude toward Gennarino wasn't so much due to malice as ignorance. Her high-society world is all she knows. And we wonder if Gennarino should perhaps have taken that into account. We also wonder if Gennarino really is the vile creature that Raffaella has accused him of being.But we're forced to switch sympathies yet again -- back to Gennarino -- when they get off the island. By this time, they've fallen in love -- or so they believe -- which begs the question of what's going to happen to their relationship when they get back to Raffaella 's high-society world.I can't tell you what happens, but I will tell you that the message we're left with is not the one I suspect we were supposed to expect. I'm guessing we're supposed to hope for an upbeat statement about how these two different classes of people can learn from each other. Instead SWEPT AWAY seems to be saying that's a bunch of hogwash, contrary to what you and the two main characters might have wanted to believe.Of course that could just be the truth, and the upbeat message I spoke of could be trite and corny, which SWEPT AWAY definitely isn't. The power struggle and love/hate relationship between Raffaella and Gennarino serves as a vehicle to explore a lot of complicated issues about class struggles and conflicting values, and maybe where we end up is where the filmmaker honestly believes all this exploring is supposed to take you.But the end result -- for me, at least -- is that SWEPT AWAY might be a great material for a master's thesis, but not for a fun evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film that is super-original but I have a few reservations about strongly endorsing it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a time capsule of the 1970s in Italy and today many who view the film may not understand the context. At that time, there was quite a political schism in the country between the conservative and leftist wings of government. So this film can be enjoyed on two levels--one being a microcosm of the political and philosophical differences between the far right and far left. To me, though, this is not a great strength of this film, as the female lead is just too far right to be representative of the average political conservative--just the most rabidly extreme and one-dimensional. She was more a combination of a Fascist and ultra-Capitalist who sees the common people as riffraff to do her bidding--a horrid combination to say the least! He, on the other hand, was very pro-Communist but seemed like a much more reasonable person. So, if this WAS intended as political satire, the deck was definitely unfairly stacked in one direction--but it is still very interesting.Now if you DON'T see this as political satire, it's a much more enjoyable film. Instead of all the Italian politics, it's basically the story of a super-rich and super-selfish woman (Mariangela Melato) who mistreats everyone she considers her inferior (i.e., anyone not rich). On board a luxury yacht that was chartered, she is constantly demanding, whiny and NEVER appreciative of anything--treating those working on the ship as if they were idiots. You REALLY wanted to see something horrid happen to her! One of the crew members who comes to hate her most (and deservedly so) is Giancarlo Giannini--who is simply tired of her abuse but has held his tongue in order to keep his job.Eventually, through a strange series of events orchestrated by Melato, she and Giannini become shipwrecked on a deserted island. While there is fresh water and enough to eat, life is hard and the lady is ill-prepared for survival--as she expects Giannini to continue playing the role of a servant!! Well, this doesn't last long as their primitive lifestyle also calls for a more primitive relationship--with Giannini playing the strong clan leader and Melato as HIS servant!!! At first, she balks at this--that is until he brutalizes her until she shuts up and does everything she is told! This is very satisfying to watch. Rarely would I enjoy seeing anyone slapped around, but believe me, the writers did a great job of setting this up and getting the viewer to sympathize.Now where the film goes next is probably pretty realistic but also makes this a VERY adult film. Considering that they both are relatively young and good-looking, it's not surprising that the film becomes very sexual. I understand why the film went this direction but this makes it totally inappropriate for kids or even teens--especially when he ultimately forces himself on her. In addition, later they discuss sodomy--another topic most responsible parents don't want the little kids learning about from a film!! This aspect may also make the film uncomfortable for many adult viewers--particularly rape victims. However, if you are able to look beyond this, the film is in many ways quite erotic and even romantic.There is really MUCH more to the film than this. The film is super original, fascinating and well-made. It just MIGHT not be what you are looking for--please consider the content of this film before watching.UPDATE 9/10--I just saw the silent movie "Male and Female" which was based on the J.M. Barrie play "The Admiral Crichton" and can now see where the writer/director of "Swept Away" got her inspiration. Clearly "Swept Away" is a re-working of this earlier story, though unlike Lina Wertmüller's strong secular-humanist/communist leanings, the silent film was, at times, very preachy and religious. Interesting and a film fans of Wertmüller should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great disappointment: boring, tedious, full of stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess that this movie is an excellent example of "different strokes for different folks" - but I found our obnoxious, doe-eyed "hero's" continual attempts to humiliate our obnoxious "heroine" tiresome. And I found offensive the portrayal of his routine physical abuse (rape, punches, etc.) as behavior that was helping her become a more compassionate human being. This movie gets my double YUK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With dialogue such as "Madam, I am f*&amp;%ing you", I tend to disagree. Bad camera work, miserable editing. I am being generous by giving it a 3 rating. The only redeeming quality was the poetic justice aspect to the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could have been an interesting and funny film about the struggle between the classes and the sexes, turned out to be very poor love story. That is, if your definition of love involves rape and submission.I had trouble rooting for the protagonists and believing that a rich, supposedly well-educated and independent woman, would fall in love with a man that repeatedly slaps her and forces her to wash his clothes, clean his hut, etc. Likewise, I thought the portrayal of the Sicilian man was a bit extreme, however true. I kept waiting for a plot twist, but none came.Finally, and most importantly, where in the hell is this deserted island off the coast of Italy? That was probably the most far-fetched aspect of the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wildly overrated and rather unpleasant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disclaimer: perhaps I lack the historical context to appreciate this movie's boldnesses, and perhaps I have a prejudice against Italian films -- I've seen very few that I like, and usually find them pretentious, obscure, and far inferior to, say, the French or Scandinavian cinema. But that aside, I thought this movie was really quite lousy. This movie's supposed insights into the dialogue of the sexes (and the classes) are hardly deeper than your average cartoon -- and, as the movie progresses, rapidly become far more offensive: while I don't have any trouble with the considerable sexual content per se, I find the treatment of rape and violence to be unpleasant at best. If the script were better and the leads weren't two-dimensional archetypes, it might be a bit more convincing, but instead we get something that's scarcely any more rewarding or thoughtful than soft-core pornography. In fairness, I must admire Wertmuller's bravado, and the last 15 minutes or so are actually pretty good. There are also a few moments of genuine pathos, comedy, and erotic tension. But on the whole, the movie just leaves me feeling a little bit dirty and disgusted...and watching it with my girlfriend -- who was, in fact, physically abused by a previous boyfriend -- left me all the more aware of its unpleasantness. Maltin's four-star review in his movie guide is way, way overkill; I might give it two for ambition, but really, it barely merits one-and-a-half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.There is art that is intelligent, and intelligent things that are artistic. When you try the latter, you really have to be intelligent though. This film attempts that.Unfortunately, it rests on banal insights and sophomoric ideas. This is not just a film whose time has passed. I saw this when it was new and it was childishly naive and dim then.I have several Italian friends who have learned to live with the lack of political and societal sophistication that has become embedded in the national consciousness. But even they cringe when confronted with this. Yes, context matters. Yes, eroticism is essentially political. Yes, violence is cinematic. All this in the story argues against the form of the film.She should have known that few contexts of viewers would allow this to work. She should have known that politics is not essentially erotic. She should have known that personal violence and submission is thin stuff when it comes to weaving a truth.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>
