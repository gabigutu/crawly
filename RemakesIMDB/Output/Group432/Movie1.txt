		<fullReview>It's another Madonna film: does anyone really need to know more?The only thing worse than Madonna trying to be funny is Madonna trying to be serious. The only thing worse than being trapped on a desert island with Madonna is being trapped on a desert island with Madonna and a film crew.In 2002, the only thing worse than Madonna in SWEPT AWAY was Robin Williams in DEATH TO SMOOCHY.The only thing worse than watching Madonna in any movie is trying to come up with new ways of saying she can't act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does the woman even bother anymore...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost saw this at an actual movie theatre (an art-house theatre, no less!) but couldn't make it there in the one whole week it played, but yesterday I finally saw it on cable and...well...I wasn't disappointed, that's for sure! Madonna has done it again: YET ANOTHER BOMB! When will this woman learn? When will the studios learn? (Or perhaps they already have, since this film was largely dumped, with little fanfare and deadly word-of-mouth.) One would hope that being directed by her talented husband, who's created some interesting and/or terribly entertaining work, would bring out the same quality Madonna showed in "Desperately Seeking Susan"; alas, it just isn't meant to be, for here she is, at her very worst: singularly convinced of her own greatness, the smugness permeating every frame she's in, made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux-British accent, an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant. This may sound unnecessarily cruel but LISTEN to the woman, and LOOK at her films of, say, the past decade: like a latter-day Bette Davis, there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body, which here, despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film (perhaps its only saving grace), are done no favors. To her credit, the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess. No one involved escapes unharmed: Bruce Greenwood actually seems pained to be on-screen, though poor Jeanne Tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she's actually in something good, which had me thinking all the while, "Denial ain't just a river in Egypt!" Adriano Giannini, son of Giancarlo Giannini, star of the Italian original, "Swept Away...", is, like his father before him, immensely attractive, and isn't altogether bad (despite winning a Razzie nomination for "Worst Actor"), but, like almost everything else about this production, it all comes back to Madonna, on whose shoulders rest the blame. Why her? Why not her husband, director Guy Ritchie? Just who do YOU think was behind this remake? What actress wouldn't want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her, with only a relative nobody sharing the screen? Oh sure, Ritchie deserves some blame: surely he - or someone - ANYONE! - should have, and could have, taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on ACTUAL FEELING in her line readings (for her performance is so wooden it's a surprise the rest of the cast didn't get splinters), or at least display a semblance of warmth...but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole. Above and beyond anything else, this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it. A film like this, an "Odd Couple"-ish, war of the classes, should be light and fun, with leads who can bounce off one another with witty, even romantic, dialogue, for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded, really be? Honestly, I don't think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for; it succeeds neither as comedy (I defy you to laugh even once) or romance (Madonna's ice-princess routine precludes ANY chemistry). It's not even bad enough for us bad-movie lovers to enjoy. A real shame...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swept away by the awfulness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was visually a very pretty movie. The color of the ocean was so BLUE and the white sand beaches were so PRISTINE. The cinematography and tableaus created were so BREATHTAKING that the only pleasure one can derive fom this mess is an appreciation of the beaches in Sardinia. But all of that does not make up for a lack of plot or mischaracterizations of the protagonists. Madonna, who gets marooned on an island with a macho Italian steortypical guy reminded me of a petulant teenager. She related to her husband and Italain macho guy as a naughty teen would. No real depth of anything. The "funny" scenes were merely embarrassing. How could Guy Ritchie make something this bad? It doesn't make any sense after seeing Snatch and Lock, Stock. IT IS STOMACH CHURNING AWFUL people! I felt queasy with the slow motion fake-tears-chasing and the accompanying vertiginous piano: ping! ping! ping! This film was a romp on the beach with adults acting acting like thirteen year old dominant/submissives. (Madonna kissing macho's foot after she submits to him - bleh.)Most of the island scenes between these two adults were filmed like a home movie with the light shining on a worn out looking Madonna: "Look at me! See how buff and pretty I am! I can do push ups and dancie dance, and see how big my biceps are?" Oh my God. This was bad. Madonna doesn't act, she just plays herself. Just because she can cry on cue doesn't mean she is an actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and forget this. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna act, rent "Body of Evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in that one.In this film, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to mute the dialog. You won't miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop, and Madonna is so awful, it becomes amusing. Why they had to butcher the original film into this mess, I will never know; guess they thought it was "bankable". Madonna, as an actress, certainly is NOT.If you rent the original film from 1979, though, you will enjoy it, and the actors in it can actually act. 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the (mis)fortune to see this film at a showing in the US. Having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing, I am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on IMDB. The original film was a turkey, but an interesting one. It fitted into that early seventies, post 1969 revolution thing; this film just stinks of....... , well, nothing really. It's that bad.Imagine a badly done perfume commercial - see what I mean ?Madonna never could act, and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years. She looks worse and worse with every one of those years, increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat.Guy Ritchie, who has built his "reputation" on Lock Stock, could never direct either - his movies are shallow, badly cut, fashion shows. He doesn't disappoint here either; he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle.Please people, take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below. They are quite obviously business plants.Don't encourage Ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Madonna's "acting" is still a joke!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie married, it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers. If you've been through the ordeal of watching "Swept Away," then you know at that level it was a match made in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "octress" as she might have pronounced it in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. And that's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen: that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience. If there's any justice in this universe, she just blew her last chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather insipid if you ask me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Swept Away having little else to do, and part of me wished I had read a magazine or an opera DVD instead. Swept Away has few, if any at all, redeeming qualities at all, and there were times where I wished I could turn off the television but reminded myself that is not a fair way to judge a movie.Guy Ritchie's direction for starters is very unimaginative, and the camera work and editing don't have any real charm to them, the camera work is not amateurish as such but shows nothing out of the ordinary, and the editing could've been smoother at times.The script is very hackneyed, the comedic elements are forced and the romantic elements sappy. Also it has the feel of a bad 70s TV drama. The concept has been done to death but that wasn't necessarily a turn off, but the pace is turgid and the story itself doesn't have any interest at all.Likewise with the characters. They don't feel like characters or real people at all, just overdone caricatures. Jeanne Tripplehorn gets the worst of it, and her overdone performance suffers from it. Madonna only so far has impressed me in Evita, but her performance here is lifeless and disengaged here.Only two things have any real spark. One is the striking scenery and the other is the earthy charm of Adrianno Giannini. However these two are not enough to salvage the movie from being an insipid bore. All in all, not recommended. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what some of you are smoking, but i suspect it's potent.To call Swept Away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness. The acting is hideous and i'm not picking on Madonna here, we all know she's useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious. My back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines. The editing is so sloppy, it beggars description. The photography and composition (which in this era, competence should be a GIVEN for any film with a budget) are astonishingly inept, even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking. These are BASIC elements of filmmaking, if you can't get them right, you should seek another line of work. It's as contrived as a grade 3 production of Snow White, except nowhere near as well made or interesting.The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly acted and written, featuring breathtaking visuals - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair. The sexual tension feels real and immediate...those of you who found Guy Ritchie's version deplorable, should see it, it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema.Those of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even by Madonna's standards, this film is horrifyingly bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not for a moment did I think, as I slid the DVD into my player, that I would think this was a good film. I mean, it stars Madonna and, ten years later, even *I* had not seen it, so clearly I knew it was bad. However, I could not have prepared myself for how truly bad this film is. I mean really, really bad.About a rich woman and a migrant Italian fisherman getting stranded on a deserted island and inexplicably falling for each other, this film has absolutely no redeeming features at all. I have never heralded Madonna's acting skills, but in films like "Who's that Girl" and "Shanghai Surprise," she was not as bad as critics have made her out to be. But in this film, she did herself no favours...her performance here is absolutely the worst she has ever done. Watching made me cringe from the moment she appeared on screen to the moment the credits rolled, allowing for a sigh of relief. And, to be fair, Adriano Giannini's performance was not much better.I cannot begin to understand how in the world Guy Ritchie directed such a monumental pile of crap. And why did, Bruce Greenwood and Elizabeth Banks even sign on to appear in this? Just by reading the incredibly idiotic script, anyone associated to this film should have dropped it faster than a Kardashian's underpants at a basketball game.A monumental fail of epic proportions, even if you are a fan of Madonna, do not waste your time on this film. It made me lose any and all respect for her as an actress, despite her exquisite turn in "Evita." Ritchie would have been better off divorcing Madonna immediately than agreeing to make this ridiculous film. All copies of the film should be swept away and forgotten forever.</fullReview>

There was one other person in the audience when I saw it, and she left about an hour into it. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I've never walked out of a movie.But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they made a good film. The dialogue is laughable, the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's movie and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon."This is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's much worse than you can possibly imagine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plenty have people have talked about how this film is badly made, and Madonna is about the worst actress ever to burn up celluloid, and Guy Richie couldn't direct a cast of actors to the nearest post-office. All of which is basically true. Moreover, the film looks awful, with preposterously saturated colours, clumsy composition, banal locations and ridiculous costumes.But the worst thing about Swept Away isn't any of these things. The worst thing by a long way is the philosophy behind it. I went to see Swept Away because I thought it might be a 'so bad it's good' film: that, even if it was terrible, it might be kind of funny. How wrong I was. Here's the plot, in a nutshell: Madonna plays a nasty, rich woman, and the entire film is a long process of watching a man humiliate her, beat her and even rape her. At the end, she emerges a 'better' woman for all the abuse she has suffered, and is grateful to her rapist. Just to remind you: this is supposed to be a comedy. Ha ha ha! Because raping and beating women is just so darn funny! It's not funny, it's horrible. It doesn't matter how spoilt and nasty Madonna's character is. Seeing a woman undergo violence and abuse - and 'enjoying' it - is vile and would only appeal to a twisted mind.The film honestly left me feeling sick to the stomach. I dread to think what this film says about Richie's relationship with Madonna, but one thing is certain: he hates women. If you remade Swept Away as a 'hilarious' comedy in which a black person was beaten and punished by a white person until he/she started to love being a slave, and was pathetically grateful to his/her white oppressor, it would be banned. And rightly so.This is a sick, nasty film. If you haven't seen it, I really recommend that you don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was ridiculous, boring, and poorly acted. I loved some of Guy Ritchie's other films (notably Two Smoking Barrels &amp; Snatch), but Swept Away was just bad. It came nowhere close to the original. Once they were on the island I found myself hoping in vain that there would be someone else on the island to prevent Madonna from being in every scene. Cannibals would have done nicely...This is the first movie I have ever walked out of before the end. It was that bad. I read an article yesterday where Madonna said she was going to focus more on her family. Here's hoping she sticks to that. Biggest surprise of Swept Away: at 44 Madonna still looks pretty good in a bikini. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Paris Hilton in The Hottie and the Nottie, Madonna was the Wile E. Coyote of the big screen. No matter how many failures she notched up, she stubbornly refused to call it a day. As a recording artist, she never failed to push the limits and look good while doing it. As an actress, she seemed to be the only one who still didn't get it.Swept Away was a good case in point. (Initially, it was believed the Material Girl's sole reason for marrying Guy Ritchie was to snag a lead role at some point.) As did his father in the 1974 original, Adriano Giannini did a stellar job as the lowly first mate the female lead never missed a chance to insult. The visuals were nothing short of astonishing, especially the sea where the leads wound up. The writing was an OK thing. Alas, the sole problem was in the female lead, who simply could not be anything but her (at the time) 43-year-old self.But that sole problem was the rotten apple that spoiled the barrel. Ritchie later went on record to say that wifey would never be cast in any of his stuff ever again. Smart move, Guy.</fullReview>

It is always a disaster when she tries to have a lead role. Mind you, it must have been difficult to do something with this script.

		<fullReview>*** WARNING! SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN! *** This is a semi-autobiographical look at what might happen to Madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island. There's absolutely no challenge to Madonna in this role, and it shows. She's just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can't even get THAT right. I know what you're saying, you're saying, "How do you know this is what Madonna is really like, you've never met her!" Correct, I haven't, but we all remember "Truth or Dare", don't we? I know Kevin Costner does. You would think, in the year 2002, that Madonna might have learned something, one way or the other, from the "crossover" ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen. For goodness' sake, hasn't Madonna seen "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the film world HOW IT IS DONE!!! Mariah kicks Madonna's trashy butt to the curb in beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, you name it! All we see from this glimpse into Madonna's world is she's the only one in it.  If there's one thing to be said for Madonna, it is that she's consistent. When she was an MTV darling, she set the world of women's fashion back 20 years. Now, in film, she has set women's roles in film AND society back 20 years, by glamourizing all the most hated, horrible, reprehensible, odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them, qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don't possess. ***HERE'S THE SPOILERS!!! DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW...*** Here's the one good thing I will say about this film, and I really was impressed by it. They didn't go for the "Hollywood Ending" - Madonna's character lives. In the typical, happy Hollywood ending, Madonna's character would have died on the island, and her long-suffering, oppressed, whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife, and they both live happily ever after. But in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is rescued, and once more, this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife, and his life will once again become a living hell. *** HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never have so many raspberries been so well deserved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Madonna's career in the cinema is a strange one. One could easily dismiss films like this one and "Body of Evidence" as the vanity projects of a conceited pop diva who can't act for toffee but imagines that her ability to belt out a hit tune automatically qualifies her as the next Meryl Streep or Helen Mirren. (And there are indeed several other pop divas who are labouring under that particular delusion). And yet there is more to Madge's career than that. She is also capable of giving perfectly creditable performances in decent films like "Desperately Seeking Susan", "Who's That Girl?" and "A League of Their Own", and was particularly good in "Evita". Which makes it all the more frustrating when something as bad as "Swept Away" comes along. When I saw the film I assumed it was a rip-off of the successful eighties screwball comedy "Overboard". The main character in "Overboard" (played by Goldie Hawn) is called Joanna Stayton; here she is Amber Leighton. I wondered whether the Stayton/Leighton rhyme was a deliberate hint by the scriptwriter that the earlier film was his inspiration. Both Joanna and Amber are the spoilt and bitchy trophy-wives of wealthy businessmen. Both women go for a cruise aboard a luxury yacht, in the course of which they manage to alienate a working-class man (here a sailor named Giuseppe) by their arrogant and unreasonable behaviour. In both cases the tables are turned by a sudden stroke of fortune, meaning that the man now has the upper hand, allowing him to take revenge on his former tormentor. And (these being romantic comedies) in both cases the ill-matched couple end up falling in love. Since seeing the film, however, I have learnt that it is a remake of a 1974 Italian film of the same name. (At least it had the same name in English; the original Italian title was the less snappy "Travolti da un Insolito Destino nell'Azzurro Mare d'Agosto"). Adriano Giannini, who plays Amber's lover here, is the son of the actor who played the equivalent role in 1974. Nevertheless, I still feel that comparisons between "Swept Away" and "Overboard" are illuminating, because the films, despite their similarity in theme, are very different in tone and quality, "Overboard" being far superior. Part of the reason is the way the lead characters are played. Yes, Joanna is a prize bitch, but Goldie Hawn never forgets that she is acting in a comedy and plays her with an appropriate lightness of touch, preparing us for the transformation in the later scenes when Joanna's more human side begins to come through so that, psychologically, we can accept the romance which develops between her and Kurt Russell's character. (Logically, of course, the plot of "Overboard" is quite implausible, but screwball comedies enjoy a certain immunity from the laws of logic). Madonna, however, appears not to understand the difference between comedy and serious drama, playing Amber with a fierce earnestness far more appropriate to the latter, so that, whereas Joanna is amusingly nasty, Amber is merely hateful. In the later scenes we can never accept her as a person capable of love or affection. Beyond being the son of a famous father, Giannini has few qualifications for his role. His English is not good and he speaks his lines as though he had learnt them phonetically, without any real understanding. His main technique for expressing emotion is to rely upon a single expression, a farouche scowl, presumably indicating his discontent at his treatment by Amber. Giuseppe, incidentally, is a Communist, something which indicates how much Hollywood politics have changed since the Cold War ended. In any American film made before 1989, except perhaps Beatty's "Reds", "Communist" generally meant "fanatical enemy of democracy". In this film it means something romantically exotic and thrillingly dangerous, like some fierce but beautiful beast of prey. The film is also badly directed (by Madonna's then husband, Guy Ritchie). It does not flow smoothly and it is visually unattractive to look at, being bathed in a harsh, glaring light. Its main flaw, however, is neither the acting nor the direction but its objectionable world view. When Amber is shipwrecked on a deserted island with Giuseppe, he realises that she is unable to find food for herself and that his skills as a fisherman now give him the upper hand. He takes advantage of their situation not only to humiliate her but also to abuse her physically and on one occasion sexually assaults her. In real life these two would probably have ended up murdering one another, but this is Hollywood, not real life, and they end up falling passionately in love. To call this misogynistic view of the relationship between the sexes "objectionable" would be an understatement. Even "Neanderthal" seems inadequate, given that Neanderthal women were by all accounts hefty creatures, built like the proverbial brick outhouse and doubtless unwilling to stand for any nonsense from their menfolk. The critical and commercial failure of "Swept Away" finally put an end to the Material Girl's acting career. She could afford to shrug off the controversy aroused by "Body of Evidence"- a bad film, certainly, but by no means as bad as this one- on the basis of "there's no such thing as bad publicity", but when bad publicity turns to public ridicule even a confirmed attention junkie like Madonna must realise it's time to call it a day. The film swept the board at the 2002 Golden Raspberry Awards, including (inter alia) "Worst Picture", "Worst Actress" for Madge and "Worst Director" for Ritchie. (Giannini unaccountably missed out on "Worst Actor"). Never have those raspberries been so well-deserved. 1/10, only the fifth film out of more than a thousand to which I have given the minimum mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally watched this movie, because Rockenrolla recently came out (which I liked) so the shameful incidents of Ricthie's past have also been rehashed and I couldn't bare not knowing anymore. This wasn't a bad movie. The Postman was a bad movie, in a cheesy, enjoyable way. Fire Down Below was a bad movie. This was a revolting, misogynistic insult to intelligent audiences that should never have been allowed to see the light of day. The first part, on the yacht, was passable as comedy. It wasn't particularly funny, but you could see where they were going with it. When they get to the island though the film takes a very sinister turn, and from this point on the acting or the photography are not even worth a mention. Not because they are worse than average, but for me the deplorable and systematic degradation of a human being (not just because she's a girl) negates any possibility of a discussion of the film's individual components. No, the director working with his own wife is not the real problem. Frances McDormand won an Oscar when directed by her husband in the excellent Fargo. No, it's the bullying of the female character into subservience, as a result of which she learns her 'place' and falls in love with her 'master' - it very much reminded me of The Story of O, in its dehumanisation of the protagonist in which she becomes a willing accomplice. There are ways of teaching someone a lesson in humility - I don't know, making them wear yellow garters - but a mock rape is not one of them, even if the person is a stuck up b*tch. This movie should be banned, passing this as a romantic comedy, without the film taking a moral stance is a crime.</fullReview>

It's weird too because I like Guy Ritchie's movies. What on earth happened? As a happily married couple, they work together for the first time and then release crap?Everyone knows Madonna isn't the greatest actor, but she's been somewhat convincing in her other rolls, like "Who's That Girl?" and "Desperately Seeking Susan", however silly they may seem. In this one, her acting was atrocious. How did she suddenly become a WORSE actor than she already was???This movie MIGHT have been okay with better acting, but it's a pretty doubtful.

		<fullReview>A film has to be really bad for me to write a bad review and this one is really bad. I have nothing against Madonna and I enjoy many of Guy Richie's films but this was an obvious sign that while they may work well as marriage partners they do NOT work well in film-making. Madonna's acting was without any merit (it was horrible), her character was hokey and the nude scenes of Madonna were so flippantly thrown in that they weren't even a good distraction from the poor acting. The scenes themselves were badly spliced together, the cinematography was neutral and the storyline dragged on without a solid purpose. If you want to see a cute and popular version of this kind of film see "Overboard" with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. It's a bit dated but it has all of the elements that are missing from Swept Away and shows a couple who work well together.</fullReview>

The movie would have been more interesting if the castaways had cast away their clothing as in the original. After all it is supposed to be a movie about sexual dynamics. I would be surprised if the insistence on wearing bathing suits during the castaway sequences was Madonna's idea. The folks who made this film would have been wiser to have put their money into dubbing the fantastic original version in English and then re-issuing it. The original version was hilarious, I would love to see it again in English. However I would not recommend the new version to anyone. Thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2000: Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks work on "Cast Away", a film about one man's isolation, loss of all he holds dear and eventual salvation. It's set mostly on a desert island.2001: One evening at Chez Madonna, after the kids have gone to bed, Guy Ritchie watches "Cast Away" and the seed of an idea is born. He sees an opportunity to get away from the cheeky chirpy cockney gangster shtick that he's had to regurgitate since "Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels". He comes up with a clever twist - instead of a man on a desert island, Ritchie's script features a WOMAN. To make it extra special original, he calls it "Swept Away" instead of "Cast Away".Late 2001: Ritchie struggles to find an actress with the fine acting qualities that will bring his script to life. In an unguarded moment moment over the pasta and green leaf salad, he mentions his pre-production problems to his wife.2002: Another ghastly Madonna movie briefly breaks the surface before plunging like a lead submarine to join "Shanghai Surprise" and "Body of Evidence" in SucksALot Lagoon.

		<fullReview>I actually liked Madonna in Shanghai Surprise, but it's fair to say - based on the evidence of every other movie she's done - that she really cannot act. I wonder if it's deliberate?! I think she tries too hard, because there are glimpses of emotion there.Watch just the last 10 minutes of this movie, partly because it tells you all you need to know, but mostly because the rest of it is utter drivel - unless you want to see Madonna posing in a bikini, although even that spectacle isn't what it was (bit flabby here!)So why was this movie made? I can only assume she and hubbie were on holiday and lost a bet. Or maybe they won the bet. Either way, there is no rational explanation for this tosh.</fullReview>

You can't tell how bad Madonna is as an actress until you dare to watch this film. Anyway I think she just played herself, an overweening wealthy chick. In the beginning of the film Madonna mistreats the poor fisherman (she plays the classic bitch character), then of course just the two of them get trapped on a deserted island, and fall in love with each-other... big f***king surprise. But the end of the film is even worse. They will be separated forever, and Madonna cries out her heart because she has to stay by the side of her unabashedly rich husband. Ehh.. this movie is simply disgusting. This is all I can say, so please spare yourself the pain, and don't watch it. It isn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers) I had to turn this piece of crap off half way through so that i could go take a shower and feel clean again. This movie is a nasty, foul deposit in the great toilet bowl of cinema trash. It's like McClintock for the new generation. I'm not even going to go into the bad script or Madonna's overacting as a petulant spoiled rich woman. Or the fact that she has no hips, huge biceps, and a face that is haggard after too many years of strenuous exercise. See, if I had been stranded on that island with a bastard who hit me in the face, kicked me around, and then tried to rape me, there would be no feet kissing, master calling, or love scenes. I'd have bashed the cretin's head in with a rock while he was sleeping and jerked his carcass to keep me alive while i waited to be rescued. I could make up any story that i wanted to explain his death afterward. It makes me wonder, since Guy Ritchie wrote this screen play, what kind of relationship he and Madonna actually have. And what kind he'd LIKE them to have. Yes, her character was mean to the poor 'ol sailor-but he proved himself to be the biggest jerk imaginable in return. His life expectancy around me if he behaved that way would be minimal at best. There was a nasty overtone to this movie that left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It's not just bad-it is irredeemably awful and horrible. It plays like a movie production of those bad sixties Harlequin romances where the man dominates the woman and they fall in love because of that. Maybe Guy read his mother's on the sly? All I can say is-if that is so, get some therapy Mr. Ritchie. Because you need it bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I think MADONNA CAN ACT and to a good standard. Most of the films she has chosen to act in have not been the best scripts, but Madonna has done a decent job in each one of them, being sincere, natural and cute. Except this one. And i think I know what the problem is. Even I admit that Madonnas acting was not good in this one. And not just Madonnas. All people in this movie came across as amateur actors. But i think it is unfair to blame Madonna for it or for all of it. Actors always depend on the director and script writer. Has not anyone ever noticed how even A-list Hollywood actors at least in 50% of their films do a job that is mediocre and everyone has at least few films that are embarrassing? If the director is a visionary, had good rapport with the actors, has chosen the right actors etc, they do a stellar job.But with a different, mediocre, limited-minded director the same famous actors do a crappy job. It happens to everyone, but for some reason only Madonna gets ridiculed for it. But lets take another pop star, Justin Timberlake who also has done a number of acting jobs. In my opinion, most of the roles Timberlake has done are embarrassing and have amateurish quality. But somehow it has gone unnoticed. Because Timberlake is a man, perhaps? Double standards?I think the reason this movie went totally wrong for Madonna was that the director was her husband Guy Richie. In the history of film, it never has given any good results, being directed by or co-acting with your own husband or wife (or g friend/b friend). Most of such movies, involving famous actors have fallen flat.Like the movie Jennifer Lopez and Ben Afflek did together. Or Eyes Wide Shut (Kidman and Cruise). Etc. For some reason it does not work. Perhaps it is too close to home and off-work relationships get on the way. I think Madonna actually was a right sort of person for that role and I also liked the Giuseppe actor, they had good chemistry - but were badly scripted and directed. The original films remake with Madonna in title role would have been very interesting with a right director. Perhaps even Lina Wertmller herself, she would have pulled the right "notes" out of the leading actors.But I understand why Madonna wanted to make this movie. Unfortunately, it seems her husband did not take it seriously at all and directed it in a typical British dude style, making a joke out of an interesting material. Madonna might be this, that and third, but so are most of famous people. But for some reason people simply love ridicule her for her acting. She had only one floppy acting job, so stop bashing her!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Madonna fails at giving her husband some class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all the original is good and interesting for its exploration of the switch of power in relationships. It is by no means the all time classic every American thinks it is just because it was foreign. Madonna has always tried to make interesting choices in film (most of which didnt turn out as planned) instead of doing commercial turds like Jennifer Lopez (a complete no-talent with excellent management who knows to keep her in COMMERCIAL material only). Madonna has always been a chameleon artist who absorbs all she is exposed to and reflects it in her art - regardless of the results. While in England she picked up the accent and a husband. Ritchie's first film was entertaining because he was working with the ignorant cockney low class beer guzzling fist fighting English brute character hes so well accquainted with. Then he smartly re-made his first one for a second hit. Then he meets sophisticated Madonna who has the great idea of remaking this Italian film with not much commercial appeal - shes not playing a wedding planner or star hiding out on Knotting Hill -but with a great role she could exceed at given the proper chance. She tries to expose him to something deeper than what hes done in the past and asks him just to watch it. Of course he hates it (way too deep for this guy) until he realizes that the female character is beaten down by the male. It must have appealed to his cave man sensibility but he misses the point entirely. Because of his recent success - more in the UK than the US - he believes he is the genius everyone has painted him out to be, so he decides to RE-WRITE THE SCRIPT HIMSELF! Unbelievable. A stupid dim-witted script with lines like "Are we being punished because were rich?", constant cuts to his meat head characters who work as the yacht crew for their opinions, and a leading male who keeps beating his chest and saying "Now it Guiseppe's turn to be in charge" or "(thump thump thump)I am Guiseppe!". Poor Madonna tried but couldnt help Ritchies bad script (no actress could), his clumsy direction and crappy cinematography (the poor thing looks haggard and old). What she did do for him was take the blunt of all the bad reviews, press and slander. Because in our society its always the woman's fault if something goes wrong - think Adam and Eve. It is not the actors fault if the script is horrible, the direction a mess and everything else bad in a project. An actor can only try his or her best to contribute some kind of performance to the material given them. It is sometimes impossible. Poor Elizabeth Berkely was blamed solely for "Showgirls" as if she wrote, directed, produced and filmed the thing herself! All she did was try her best in an opportunity given and it wrecked her career but not anyone else's. The same applies here folks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new low for Madonna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playing an arrogant, too-rich, self-centered, childish, ego-driven, aging snot of an obnoxious diva, Madonna hits a new low giving an unconvincing performance as herself. As if having her irritating real-life exploits continuously thrown in our face by tabloid headlines and television bytes isn't enough, now the producers of this movie want us to pay admission to watch Madonna behave like Madonna. This is obviously nothing more than a vehicle for its producers to try to cash in on Guy Ritchie's one-hit wonder status, with Madonna thrown in ostensibly for marquee value. Or perhaps because she wouldn't allow anyone else to be cast in the part. Both Madonna and Mr. Madonna have talked at length in the press about how painful and agonizing it was to work together all day on a film set, then go home and be husband and wife. Neither, however, gave any consideration to the pain and agony soon to be inflicted upon audiences whose only mistake was paying admission to see this turkey. WARNING: Stay AWAY from "Swept Away". Even if you're a Madonna fan, even if you're a fan of Guy Ritchie's previous films, preserve your admiration by NOT seeing this movie. If you must, watch "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" again, or buy "Ray of Light", find a happy place, and pretend that this film never happened. With any luck, a project this bad won't surface again. It's not a curio, it's not a cult film, it's not even a "trainwreck" to be watched for unintentional laughs. It's not funny. Everything you heard and suspect is true; this is an utterly terrible film from beginning to end, a two-hour waste of time, and the worst film of 2002.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Congratulations Madonna!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start off by saying my housemate is Madonna mad; however I am not. Don't get me wrong, I have some of her albums and films but each time she is due to release anything he has our house going in to overdrive in preparation and Madonna is forced down our throats. So it will come as no surprise to hear that we were waiting with anticipation for this movie for over five months. At every opportunity he was downloading the trailer as a little teaser for himself, and if I had heard that voice over guy one more time I would have screamed! Then, as predicted, he sat us all down to watch it when it arrived. But as much as it pains me to say it I was awestruck. Very few films move me in the way that Swept Away did and the honesty of the emotion from Madonna was truely refreshing.I have always had the attitude that a person should only judge a movie once they have in fact seen it, so I have to say that I was absolutely appauled by the number of critics who 'knocked' Swept Away down in to the gutter, when many of them had not even seen the movie and therefore should have had no right to pass any judgement. What were they basing their opinions on? Or did they just hear the words Madonna and movie and think that this would be a good opportunity to belittle here acting ability? Never have I seen such rudeness.But to end on a lighter note this film is for everyone, male, female, single, together, adolescent or middle aged. This film is about comedy, love and heartache, so ignore the critics and form your own opinion. The crew and cast had fun making it so you might enjoy watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brief glimpse at Guy Ritchie's portfolio breaks the heart. Like a bat out of hell he shoots out and fires Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels at us - KABLAM! This is the best British director since Hitchcock, right here! I'm on the edge for the next one! Follows it up with Snatch - masterful, I'm sold. And then...?A Madonna music video. A Madonna short film. A Madonna feature film. This old narcissist hag wakes up one morning and suddenly thinks she's British, then spots a Brit who seems perfect for furthering her world domination scheme. Like Cartman's Trapper Keeper, she assimilates him, consumes him whole and turns him just another dead hunk of whale blubber on her big festering mass. And Swept Away is the offspring, the movie equivalent of Antichrist.Sean Penn, please pull this poor guy out before it's too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Madonna Tries To Emote</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This notorious film was released 13 years ago and only tonight do I finally get around to watching it. The extremely bad box office earnings and the scathing reviews made it a curiosity item I felt compelled to check out. It lived up to it's reputation.Madonna does okay in the beginning as the rich and annoyingly mean woman, but her later transformation into a devoted and humble lover to the Italian sailor, wasn't convincing at all. Her performance was basically a cardboard effort and she didn't fit into the character very well. I just kept seeing her as Madonna stranded on an island with a guy and trying to act for the camera.The scene where she pretends she can't sing and dance is laughable. And how convenient is that finding a small house on a deserted island and later on a full liquor bottle that was strangely not discovered earlier on!The film does have some good qualities though, such as the beautiful scenery, but that's not enough to carry a film. The scenes on the ship seemed to go better than the ones on the island, but that's only by a small margin. Madonna's arrogant meanness on the boat got so irritating after awhile that you can't help, but wonder why she wasn't tossed overboard at the start. Everyone on that cruise, even her own husband, it seems, regarded her as an annoyance to travel with. Understandable considering all she does is complain and hurl insults.Her later romance with Giuseppe doesn't improve things. The whole love affair plays out like a corny and badly acted "Harlequin" romance film and after the ending credits role, you can't help, but feel like you just wasted your time watching it. No wonder this did so poorly at theatres. It's the type of movie where the audience will feel 'ripped off' for paying to see it. I think this movie had potential, but it misfired instead. Beautiful scenery though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is not good, unfortunately. I wanted it to be acceptable, I tried to forget about the hundreds of bad reviews. But I have to say that this movie has the worst character development in history. She basically gets sexually assaulted and then she's in love with him like 2 seconds later. I actually thought he was raping her and I was very uncomfortable because I expected something funny. And then to see her falling in love with him makes the whole thing even more awkward. Sexism is very present and shocking. Some of the scenes are so long, unfunny and boring. Madonna, bless her, she's alright. You can't expect her to be a Meryl Streep.What I liked: The photography: It's beautiful but it's hard to make it look bad since the scenery is naturally gorgeous. I also really liked the ending because it's very unexpected and quite tragic if you really believe in their love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swept Away (2002)This is not a good movie, not at all, not even in the Ed Wood kind of way where you love awful scenes because they are so awful. These are not awful enough. Merely dull and familiar and bad and ugh.You can see, without trying, how it seemed like a good idea to the producers (who are like cash registers, remember). The story has a lot of winning Hollywood factors--a romance that rises against the odds and then faces a dramatic challenge before the final twists. It has a great locale, some nice foreign accents and a pretty boat. It also has Madonna, no small potato, and a potato who is willing to be an unpleasant character (with a buff body). She's a great performer on stage, and here she is trying to go beyond the MTV image. Give her credit.She does dance, all the same, and she does some swimsuit showing off. But as an actress, she really just doesn't have the stuff, or doesn't here, with this director (the thankfully obscure Guy Ritchie). The other actors are her equal, which doesn't say too much. One exception for me was not Jeanne Tripplehorn, who is dependably able, but Elizabeth Banks as a dull-witted American girl stereotype. Quite convincing...and an obvious foil to Madonna's not-dull-witted type.And speaking of types, the women are all in neat categories. This isn't a woman's rights movie. Yes, Madonna is strong in an abrasive way. But she becomes a "good" woman only after the man in her life "wins" her over in a the worst possible way. Some people will find this kind of force a way to work things out in a relationship, a wanting to be dominated. But others will see it as rape of one kind or another. This is a turning point in the movie and it's treated with television depth. And speaking of television, the whole series of scenes and characters might strike some people as glib and shallow in the same way as a lot of better television, the kind of characters that get "developed" in shows like Law and Orders. But on those terms, the movie is entertaining, too, at least in spurts. If there is a missed opportunity in the dreck, it might be a chance to go totally camp. The ending has such stunning clichs, a little push into even greater exaggeration would create total hilarity. Like if the ring flies up and goes "ping" on the helicopter window and she looks--looks where? How? Ah ha! There is hope.I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uncomfortably awkward melodramatics from director Guy Ritchie, here remaking Lina Wertmuller's 1974 critically-acclaimed political/sexual rabble-rouser about a Mediterranean cruise which goes awry for a bitchy socialite and a fisherman-manservant. Ritchie isn't particularly gifted with the actors (particularly not star Madonna, his real-life spouse), however he does clever, canny things with the camera and has a superb visual sense (he's aided by snappy editing but held back by the sub-par screenplay). The movie certainly isn't masterful, yet Ritchie knows his way around a romantic montage (as well as a fantasy sequence with Madonna tearing it up to Della Reese's "Come On-a My House"). Maddy's performance does improve once she and Adriano Giannini become shipwrecked on a deserted island, and solely as a bubblegum romance the picture does have intermittent appeal. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me, being a huge Guy Ritchie fan, I was so disappointed with this movie. Not what I was expecting...at all.The screenplay. In deed, it had an interesting topic, but the movie itself ruined all, so it became pointless, suffering many twists, and where most of the jokes tried to be funny because they had Madonna insulting Giannini, but in fact they weren't that funny and where constantly repeated.The performances. Madonna? Seriously, this was Madonna? The performance, wasn't that bad but still wasn't that good also. Not what I was expecting, at all. And Giannini. Is it me or he was somehow...bad, in this movie? I payed some attention to the part when they arrived to land, and I thought that the Italian actor, was, I'm not going to say mediocre, but still, wasn't far from that.But, what I liked in this movie, was some scenes that Guy Ritchie directed and were well filmed and edited. Like the scene, were Giuseppe is dreaming of Madonna dancing for him. That was well filmed and edited, and you could see some traces of Ritchie's trademark, that he used on previous movies. This was good, and also the fact where the characters' roles inverted. That was also interesting. But that's it, the movie... gosh.Ritchie's attempt to make a romantic comedy is ruined, and clearly, romance isn't is strong point. 'Comedy's Noires', it's his style so I hope he'll stick with that plan. But for this movie... Mr. Ritchie, what were you thinking? 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just basically a bad movie. There were some parts where I laughed, like when Madonna called Guiseppe names like Guido and PeePee, and Madonna did get better as the movie went on, but I couldn't finish watching it. The dialogue hinted at being great, what with the discussions on capitalism, but it fell flat. There were so many unreal movie moments that were just boring, like with Jeanne Tripplethorn (who was fine) and the dumb 14-year old having a Q &amp; A at the dinner table that lead nowhere (which was the point, but the dumb act would have been better played by Kelly Bundy). In my opinion, the root of Madonna's bad acting lies in her wanting to either be too much of herself onscreen or, as a contrast, make fun of herself, thinking that's what makes a great character, but I would say that humility for humility's sake diminishes believable character development. Nice Mediterranean scenes, though, and some interesting clothing, I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all for those who say Madonna can't act because she can't get out of herself, you are completely wrong. The problem is not Madonna, the problem is you. Your not willing to see Madonna as anyone other than Madonna. I'll bet the whole time you watched this movie you saw her character as someone who sings Like A Virgin. The fact is people are spiteful and don't want to see Madonna succeed in movies as well as music. Also, for all you who say she can't act, why don't you get your asses in front of the camera since you're such experts and show her how? And if she is such a bad actress and you truly believe this then why do you bother seeing her movies in the first place? Everybody giving this film a negative is review is not commenting on the movie like they should, but rather personally attacking Madonna. The movie as a whole is great. Acting and directing was done wonderfully. The music was absolutely beautiful. The movie is wholly entertaining all the way through. And being that I am obviously a huge Madonna fan I understand no one is going to take me seriously. I should say that I don't normally post reviews, but I am so sick of everyone intentionally trying to diminish Madonna's talent. Yes, Madonna has had a few misses with her movies, as every actor does, but Swept Away is not one of them. Think about it, the bad reviews started the second it was revealed this movie was being made. So to all you tightasses out there "Get a f***ing sense of humor, okay, lighten up!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Bad as I Thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen Swept Away when it was in theater's and only recently caught it on cable, late night none-the-less. While I wasn't disappointed by the movie, i wasn't surprised. Here's the deal, Madonna is a typical run of the mill wanna be movie star. Just like Julia Roberts, Helen Hunt or Brad Pitt, Madonna plays the same character in every movie she's in-an arrogant bitch. It's a role that mimics her real life, which is probably why she keeps taking these kind of roles. But to say she is any worse then the current crop of actors i just mentioned is to blame her unfairly. Swept Away isn't nearly as bad as people have made it out to be, its not that good either. Guy Ritchie does his magic on the film with its beautiful cinematography and the editing and pace of the film are nice. The supporting characters aren't bad either but a sure sore spot is Madonna. Maybe she doesn't like taking direction, maybe she doesn't like taking more than one take (which is what she is often accused of doing) but whatever the motivation, her performance is inconsistent. In one scene, in the tent, she begins to show true acting but then, as if she notices she beginning to act and gets scared, she returns to the wooden performance that so many have commented on. In a fair shake, she has been good in some movies, Who's that girl? was a a really funny movie and she was good in it too, a league of their own, Dick Tracy are good movies too. She seems to work best when the weight of the picture doesn't rest on her shoulder. However, most of her performances have been unworthy of the silver screen. Her recent announcement that she was retiring from acting came as no surprise to some and a sad note for others, for I believe, she can be good if the right script came her way. In summary, don't rush out to rent this movie, but if you come across it, watch it objectively, its not nearly as bad as some have made it to me.</fullReview>

There is no point during the duration of this film that to continue watching it seems like a better alternative than cutting off one's own genitals with a rusty knife.I mean, sweet mother of mercy, what the hell was anyone thinking when they were doing this? Madonna plays a wretched narcissist who is the single most unappealing character in the history of cinema. IS THIS MERE COINCIDENCE?!? Was Guy Ritchie delivering a thinly veiled cry for help?!Speaking of, the poor sap, he seems convinced that Madonna resembles something other than a giant raisin filled with antlers. He also seemed convinced of her 'ACTING... TALENT!' which makes most kindergarten Thanksgiving pageant acting seem nuanced and insightful.I hate this movie. I hate every stupid frame this movie possesses. I hate how the movie seems to think Madonna plays a sympathetic character. I hate how the male lead is a complete idiot through and through. I hate how the dialog is trying to be a throwback to 70's movies that had brains in their heads. I hate the stupid musical number. I hate that the movie never freaking ends, and then when it does end, it is the lamest ending possible.Seriously, it is one of the few movies that would have benefited from an 'it's only a nightmare!' ending. At least that would have made sense in context instead of the sappy trite we're handed. There are three-- count them!-- three good things about this entire movie.1) It puts Madonna in a lot of situations where she gets slapped. 2) It ended Guy Ritchie's career (for the time being). 3) I think it made me impotent.If number three sounds like a bad thing to you, then you wouldn't understand; no man wants to bring a child into a world in which Swept Away exists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swept Away has a very European feel: not just because it's set in the Mediterranean or because it stars Adriano Giannini or because it's directed by British film maker Guy Richie or even because it contains the occasional subtitle. Rather, it's down to the laid back story telling method and the lazy plot progression. It is clear to see why the film flopped in the US. A lack of intricate narrative and Hollywood ending was bound to leave many disappointed at the cinema. But does this say more about the expectation of the American audience than the quality of the film? Granted, it was no Oscar winner but the performances were more than competent all round and indeed, I enjoyed watching Madonna in this role.I have given this film a fair 5 out of 10. And believe me there are only a small handful of movies to which I would award a 10 so I can't be accused of overrating. I feel those that gave it a mere 1 out of 10 were being a little overzealous to say the least. Either that or they have been lucky enough to miss viewing some of the real tripe I've seen over the last 30 years or so.</fullReview>

Adriano Giannini was surprisingly good and made the film, There's big things to come from him. Madonna as an actor isn't the best however in Swept Away she did just enough to make it okay, although a better actress in the same role could have made an OK film great. The ending was unexpected and correct for what had happened, but a bit more added around the ending would have been better, still with the same outcome. This wasn't a waste of an hour and a half but could have been better had Ritchie took a step back and a longer look at the film as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it would certainly be a fitting choice of words for the state of Madonna's career. You know, I still have no idea why this movie would be as bad as it was. I have seen the original "Swept Away" from 1974, so I figured the remake would be worth a look.Boy, was I wrong.The main problem with this movie is the pacing. It's not just one section of the movie that's padding. The entire movie is just one piece of padding. It's vacant like an air bubble. Absolutely nothing of consequence happens. The uptight princess and the deckhand are stranded on the island, and after an hour and a half, NOTHING has advanced the plot. There are long periods of silence. Madonna just sits around and does nothing. The deckhand chops coconuts. There isn't even any romantic chemistry between the two lead characters. It's like Cast Away, except Cast Away didn't suck. And the acting-I guess Bruce Greenwood just did this movie to pay his rent, because he is bland and lifeless. The guy who plays the deckhand just drones on and on about nothing in particular. With a woman like Madonna, you would expect her to do something more in the film, but instead, you have to suffer through some droll Mambo-type number. The directing is horrible. It's horrific to think Guy Richie went from directing Snatch (a very good British gangster-mob flick) to this lifeless turd.Bottom Line: You know what? I'm not even going to give this movie a rating. It's THAT bad. If you're in need of a Madonna fix, go watch Dick Tracy. If you're in need of a Guy Richie fix, rent Snatch. Avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get it! Everyone seems to hate this movie! Now, let me say this: I tuned into this movie expecting to hate it. I wanted to have a laugh at Madonna's expense, just like everyone else. But then, something unexpected happened. Madonna actually had MY ass...you see, I really began to like this movie. I think that Madonna does perhaps her finest acting in this film, and I am not being sarcastic. I am aware that she has put forth her share of wooden performances. I mean, some of her films have been downright awful, and they suffered because of her inability to emote. But in this film, her husband (director Guy Ritchie, for those of you who live under a rock) manages to coax a real, flesh and blood human being out of her. He is able to achieve what many directors, save for possibly Abel Ferrara, haven't been able to do, and that is to make us forget for two hours that we are watching MADONNA. She melts into this character, and in doing so, I believed that she was a person other than MADONNA the celebrity. Good for Mr. and Mrs. Ritchie. I think that this film was fantastic, and I was very moved by it. I also think that Guy Ritchie's directorial style is brilliant, but that is not exactly a new phenomenon. But the discovery of Madonna's acting ability was the true gem here. Wow! Great story (even if it WAS a remake), great music, great mood, and wonderful casting if you ask me. I could have done without the other nondescript socialites on the yacht in the beginning of the film, but I understand that they were there merely for exposition.I hope that more people will give this film a chance. Even I was initially hoping to hate it, and be able to rip it to shreds, as many other people had. But I have discovered a wonderful film in the process, and I am so glad that Madonna proved me wrong this time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't get 'swept away' with the bad clichd reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing consistent negative views on this film I finally watched it on terrestrial TV and through certain flaws found many good points that have been ignored in favour of sardonic comments from the Madonna bandwagon bunch who tend to slag her off the minute she takes a new role on.Okay Meryl Streep she isn't but her acting in this film is quite good and she only struggles in the more emotional moments to the close of the film. I am no militant Madonna or Guy Ritchie fan and this film has an easy narrative, developed characters from Madonnas bitch to the leading man who had charisma, humour and the ability to get the coldest heart melt for him when things go sour.I would repudiate that this film deserved so many razzie awards and if their is a celluloid witch hunt in film making then this films been dunked on a wooden chair and burnt at the stake without a fair trial.This film is witty, entertaining, and has characters you feel for if you can get past the stigma that is inevitable when Madonna stars in a film and can watch it with the intelligence of drawing your own conclusions then you will find it has more to shout home about than to shout at Madonna or Guy Ritchie about.Recommended and better then the original with some good scenic imagery from a director who's only true rasberry was his latest film 'Revolver'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lot different from Guy Ritchie's other movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing I can say about this Guy Ritchie movie is that you can understand what the actors say. But, I also have to give it a little praise because I was expecting this horrible movie from reviews that came out when this movie was in theaters. While it isn't great, it certainly isn't a very bad movie. It had humor and was actually funny in parts. And who doesn't like to see a rich b!tch get what she deserves and get taught a lesson about treating people like dirt. It was funny with all the names Madonna made up to call the fisherman. And then when they are on the island, she has to beg and work for the fish, which before complained about on the boat. I wish the ending had been a little happier. I think the rich wife learned her lesson on the island and should have gotten some happiness in the end.FINAL VERDICT: No where near as bad as others may make you think. While Madonna isn't a very good actress, she does OK in this. Give this film a chance because it does have some funny parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I beat women, and I like it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All you get is some vaguely interesting dialogue in the first 15 minutes, but the rest of the movie is about how the male lead actor kicks, hits, slaps and terrorizes the female lead actress.Why?Because he can. But more specifically because he didn't grow up wealthy, because he envies rich people, because he's a communist, because he's angry at the whole world, but most importantly because he's a poor-unclean-scumbag-greek-abuser-of-women who sees his opportunity to beat and humiliate a white, upper-class woman. And he likes it. Alot.The script tries to justify and turn the tables but it just doesn't get the idea of right and wrong, it's ludicrous really. I'll explain...The female character is arrogant and insulting and does boss people around for the sheer purpose of doing so.But the whole idea of twisting this around for her breaks up at one very important word and that is "circumstances".This sole word is why the movie has absolutely nothing in the balance of right and wrong, eye-for-an-eye and any other similar concept.Because the circumstances for the greek abuser and the rich woman are completely different. While the greek abuser had a choice of working on the boat or not and taking her verbal abuse or not, the rich woman does not have a choice on the island, where it is simply do or die for her.This is what makes the movie so horrid, the whole taking extreme advantage of a person when it is obvious that she will do anything it takes for the sole reason of survival. When a person resorting to crying, pleading, and whimpering "you're hurting me", still continually gets abused, then it's simply not entertaining. It's sub-human cruelty at it's peak. This in conjunction with the whole pounding himself on the chest and continually reminding her what now the greek abuser is in charge, just makes nausiating scenes. The whole "kiss my feet and call me your God" is appauling. This sort of mentality should make every normal-minded person take distance in disgust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty in the destruction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't give this movie a vote. However, it's not because it doesn't deserve one because 'this was the worst movie ever' which is a phrase people seem to over use much too often. There are some interesting aspects of this movie. For instance, the plot line. At the beginning, you seem to know where this movie is going. You see Madonna, the rich bourgeois, and then you see the 'ship mate' if you will, scrubby, and low in all respects to Madonna's character. You know that they are going to fall in love.Yet, the best thing about this movie is that it doesn't become your typical love story. It becomes vile, and at some times (to some people) disgustingly unbearable. Their relationship becomes violent. And still, somewhat following the typical romance faux pas, the ending just... doesn't end. It isn't that happy ending that leaves us feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.We're left staring at two broken people. Changed, and then reinstated into their old lives without any forward motion except to remain heart broken and sad because of that forward motion now in the past.It was a movie that said, "Look. No happy ending. Do we get a standing ovation?"I honestly think they should. Perhaps the acting wasn't high quality. And yes, there were still some increasingly clich moments of "that would never happen." It's simply the idea that, for once, we didn't see the couple live happily ever after -- and truly, 50% of the time, 90% of the audience can relate to that more than the couple being swept off to England where they become princesses and princes and live happily ever after in one another's arms with a good mortgage, perfect children, and life with no other such problems after the movie reel is done spinning.There was beauty in the destruction of this movie. It left you feeling as foolish, and sad as the characters in it.I respect that quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I found this movie very amusing, the work of genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this delightful movie very, very much. Madonna's acting may not be Shakespearian, but she is perfect in the role of a filthy-rich, sassy, spoiled bitch who is suddenly confronted with a bold reality where her little world loses all meaning. I cannot imagine a better actress for the role. She does her best effort at being bitchy to the limit, in order to earn unanimous aversion from the audience. She fully succeeds: I hated her generously, and that's precisely the idea. On the other part, Adriano Giannini is a genius: he is natural, fits his role perfectly, is convincing and expressive, and his 'Giuseppe Esposito', a humble fisherman and ship handyman who rebels against his patron's abuses, instantly gets my enthusiastic approval and solidarity. Whoever does not like this movie just didn't grasp the message, and (in my humble opinion) would deserve to go thru an ordeal just like 'Amber Leighton' did, in order to learn some basic facts of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Madonna is a singer, not an actress. However, I think she did just fine in this movie. It has absolutely nothing to do with whom she married. She played her part of the snooty socialite turned humbled woman just fine. This movie was the perfect example of an unexpected, ragged love. I feel that it can be seen as one of the greatest love movies ever; it is tragic, it is something that could happen. It isn't like all the other love stories that have come and gone. It does not work out perfectly in the end, unfortunately as viewers will come to find. It was real, and not the fairy-tale romance we often see in modern and even older movies. The storyline itself made me realize through one line that sometimes what we want is not exactly what we need. I felt that was the message throughout the entire movie as Amber basically was stripped of her "good life" and was forced into being with Pepe and eventually becoming his lover. Call me crazy for loving Swept Away, but this movie made a deep point about true love, and love that isn't so real. It wasn't some overdone Hollywood flick. It had glamor and glitter, but it still held on to a piece of true human life.</fullReview>

I would recommend anyone who wants to see a funny, romantic film, go see this one. I was definitely "swept away" when I saw this movie and the special features on the DVD are very fun to watch.

		<fullReview>Nothing. I only read bad reviews about this movie, and it also has a 3,6 star rating. I don't understand why, because this movie is more than excellent. It's directed by Guy Ritchie and produced by Matthew Vaughn, the same guys that gave you Lock, Stock and Two Smocking Barrels, Snatch, Revolver and Layer Cake. And you can see that. The directing is excellent, the actors play their parts flawless, the locations are beautiful, the movie has its fun and its sad parts(in the first half i laughed out loud for several times, something that doesn't happen very often to me) and it also has a message. I watch a lot of movies, good ones in my opinion, but it's not often that i see one that actually makes an impression on me. Well this one made a really big impression. All the last reviewers said Madonna can't act. I don't see it. She played her part flawless by anyone's standards. My advice is to see it. You will be pleasantly surprised. My vote is 10/10, because i haven't seen a movie that moved me like this probably since equilibrium, and it's been a long time since that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overboard. Literally.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years Madonna has tried to prove not only herself, but the public eye, that she can act. Unfortunately, trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn't mix well.She seems to fare better when she's NOT the star of any movie: if you watch her in supporting performances in DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN (1985) or A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN (1992), she actually comes off looking good. Since the story revolves on other actors, the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default.The trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie, regardless the genre. Being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way, whether it be good, mediocre or plain awful, she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance. This is the crucial difference between Madonna and, let's say, Bette Davis, or Meryl Streep. The latter two, even if the movie were to fail (because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it, or because the script fell short, or because the actress per se was just not at her moment), there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb. Both Davis and Streep have had their share: Bette, having a longer career than Streep, in such fare as BUNNY O'HARE (1971) and WICKED STEPMOTHER (1989); Streep in SHE-DEVIL (1989). But at least there's been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance.Madonna, on the other hand, not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself, fares much worse, and even in the hands of someone as Woody Allen in SHADOWS AND FOG (1992), an inferior classic, she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff, maybe even nervous, as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn't let go.So here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two-character movie. Guy Ritchie, more known for action movies filled in masculine energy, seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of Michaelangelo Antonioni or Ingmar Bergman, who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease. And at 89 minutes, the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn, it doesn't feel sincere. From being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love, this has to be the most unconvincing 180 degree turn since Fay Dunaway's Laura suddenly discovered her passion for Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS (1978). Equally unconvincing is Adriano Giannini's nasty turn around the middle of the movie -- it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic -- and when he gives in to Madonna's love, it's too quick to be believed. Filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery doesn't enhance or add upon this "transformation" from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other.Trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well -- it only makes it drag, bog it down, and when Madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close-up, it feels she's trying too hard. Many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little. Hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s, early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion.Could the movie have been better? Of course. There are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again -- it's been done before, in OVERBOARD (1987), for example. It could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change (to ensure a moral tone). Much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more "silent" film look -- as in PERSONA (1966). It could have even been something of a thriller, providing that the Giannini character have a mean streak as Billy Zane had in DEAD CALM (1989). Even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for Madonna as the over the top, uber-control freak getting her comeuppance. But with its mean streaked humor, without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom, and without really defining Giannini's own character, this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really nice movie- DON'T BELIEVE THE CRITICS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake certainly can't bear the comparison with the original one, but if considered alone, without thinking' at the original, it's quite a lovely movie. Sincerely I can't understand why the critics blame it so much, but certainly this is not the worst movie of the year at all. There are at least 20 worst movies released between 2002 and 2003. The plot is very simple and the movie is actually short so it prevents the audience from being annoyed. The soundtrack is really beautiful and the landscapes are simply spectacular. We know that Madonna isn't the greatest actress in the world and in fact she's a recording artist, but declaring she's the worst actress of the millennium is completely unfair. I mean: there are a lot of talented and over-acclaimed actresses who made and still make embarrassing and over-commercial movies an nobody says nothing about that. Madonna with this small production movie directed by her husband didn't made such a disaster as everyone has said. A lot of critics destroyed it before having seen it only because she was acting there. I think it's a worth-seeing movie, you won't regret it 'cause it's an innocent, nice and enjoyable movie. Last thing: two final scenes were shot, a happy and a sad one; after the horrible acceptance at the first screening in which the happy end was shown Guy and Madonna decide to choose the sad one 'cause they knew the movie would have a sad end..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Madonna still cannot act, but she's never looked better. It bugs me that her idiot ex-husband (director Guy Ritchie) said, "I made her look old." The problem with this remake (of the superior 1975 film) is that Ritchie et al did not know what kind of movie they wanted. It starts out with a mesmerizingly surreal opening, but quickly descends into a silly mess of chip-shot one-liners (none of them funny or interesting). The cast is sub-par.... and for some reason, Bruce Greenwood keeps getting hired. That has to stop.It was also a mistake to let Madonna sings all the songs on the soundtrack herself which makes it look like the film is just a vehicle to promote her newest album.Toss this one back in the drink; stick with the '75 version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this a reasonably enjoyable, engaging movie although there were definitely cringe worthy moments - particularly during the frequent scenes of verbal and physical abuse metered out by the two main characters. The acting wasn't as awful as other reviews had led me to believe - and Madonna looked like she'd lived at the gym for a year before this was filmed. Unfortunately Madonna's character was so unlikeable in the early scenes, the turnaround on the island was just too short to be truly believable. Her character also alluded to a depth that frustratingly wasn't explained further - with comments like "you don't know what I've done..." , and while you want to like the Hero - it's difficult when the abuse scenes are taken too far. For a marketed Rom/com it had a massive downer of an ending. This would have to be a big part of why it died so convincingly at the box office! The rest of the film wasn't presented in a way that encouraged deep thinking - then suddenly there was a miserable ending that was designed to do just that to get more from the film - it just didn't work! The Island scenes were lovely though.....</fullReview>

This movie's point was distracted from criticizing capitalism's contradictions, which I guess this film wanted to talk about in the first place, by some sex dilemma expressed violently by ignorant sailor-hero. As saying more about the content(because everyone knows their acting was awful), this film's underlying criticism was not gentle, or sharp, but it was just revengeful. there was nothing but I-am-poor-but-happy sailor who wants to rape spoiled rich woman as I sought class in this film desperately. This poor quality of this film may have two excuses: either lack of talent of all staffs of this movie, or fragments of painful life in capitalism society which probably made Guy Ritchie crave vendetta by making this unhappy movie or by another way. I don't know what's to blame, but this movie is poor for sure.</fullReview>

They are on the trip with friends dumb blonde Debi (Elizabeth Banks), Todd (Michael Beattie), Marina (Jeanne Tripplehorn), and Michael (David Thornton). Crew member Giuseppe (Adriano Giannini) can't stand the constant complaints from Amber. Amber is left behind on the yacht and she forces Giuseppe to take her to the group outing. Their dingy breaks down and they're stranded on a deserted island. Giuseppe has had enough and starts bullying her around.Madonna is only part of the problem. She's not good enough of an actress. The character is written like a dumb blonde and Banks is infinitely better at playing that part. It's early in her career so it's impossible for her to be the lead. If not her, then Tipplehorn would have been fine. However Madonna isn't even the biggest problem. The character Giuseppe is even worst. There is nothing likable about either of these characters. He is abusive in a serious physical way. It is misogynistic which could work back in 1974. I don't understand what Guy Ritchie saw as funny in today's world. This is like a rapist's wet dream where 'No!' means 'Soon'. As I watched this, I wonder if somebody could make a horror movie from the same Guy Ritchie script. I don't think much of it has to be changed at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original 1974 Italian "Swept Away" movie when I was a teenager. Though my normal movie tastes at the time were for schlocky B movies, I have to admit that the movie made a big impression on me that stuck for years afterwards. When they announced this remake, I made plans to NOT watch it, considering how bad most remakes are and the fact that Madonna was going to star in it.But recently, this remake played on TV, and I decided to record and watch it, since I would not have to pay to see it. I just finished watching it a few minutes ago. What did I think? Well, I'll give the remake this: It's a good LOOKING movie. Colors are bright and vibrant thanks to the professional photography. And I will say that the acting on display is acceptable; even Madonna gives an okay performance.But ultimately, the movie fails in its intentions. There are some annoying montage/music video like segments that when they pop up really seem out of place for what should be a story about a close examination of two very different people. Another problem is that while the movie is about 25 percent shorter than the original, it feels a lot more drawn out than the original. The biggest problem with this remake is that it is lacking the original's bite. It feels for the most part very soft and bland when the original was angrier and more biting.In short, this is yet another unnecessary and unsuccessful remake. Even if you are a youth that turns your nose towards art and foreign movies, I would strongly suggest you all the same seek out the original Italian movie instead of this Hollywood remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not THAT bad. Really!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is NOT a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's weird, and it's definitely pretty mediocre, but its not bad and it doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the tripe that Uwe Boll keeps putting out, just to name an example. Beware: minor spoilers ahead! When the movie started, you can immediately notice how mediocre the acting is. The Italian accents on the boat's crew are all hammy, and none of the actors really stand out because they are all pretty much below average and stereotype characters. I have to admit; seeing this movie on television for the first time I didn't even recognize Madonna as one of the leading stars, but seeing as there are so many blond damsels like her in the acting world, you will have to excuse me.So what is this movie trying to be, exactly? A comedy, a romance, a drama? Well... To tell you the truth I still have trouble classifying Swept Away. The first thirty minutes or so, its almost as if the movie is turning into a lighthearted comedy with quirky characters and their contrasting personalities and social stature's. Basically: the first half hour makes you want to hate this flick. After the predictable plot turn where our two main characters get stranded on a deserted island, you expect the movie to turn into a Cast Away knockoff. But instead, the movie takes a complete 180 turn and what you get is this strange, but awkwardly enjoyable psychological game between the two characters.In the end, both of them are horrible people and it makes the audience question who to root for, which I think is actually pretty cool and daring. There's an obvious romance going on between them, but it's not going the way you anticipate it is going to be (not going to spoil anything).The ending leaves you thinking, not on a story level, but on an emotional level which I have mixed feelings about. The ending avoids any real clich's, which is good, but at the same time it excludes any sense of closure and I think a lot of viewers will have trouble with that.To sum up Swept Away: is it a good movie? Not really. Although in my opinion it does come close to being good at some points, but the hammy acting is keeping it down. It's definitely worth a rent if you want a surprising fresh mix of genre's. But at the same time, this mix is also the movie's biggest downfall; it tries to combine all kinds of elements of comedy, romance and drama into this weird mishmash of one story which you can't help but admire, but as a stand alone movie it doesn't exactly work in its favor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's fun and entertaining, but also thought-provoking and moving."Swept Away" is a 2002 remake of the 1974 Italian film starring Madonna and directed/written by Madonna's (then) husband Guy Ritchie.THE PLOT: A group of rich Americans take a private cruise from Greece to Italy where a spoiled middle-aged woman, Amber (Madonna), mentally abuses the crew, in particularly the first mate Pepe (Adriano Giannini) whom she constantly refers to as PeePee. The crew puts up with her pompous antics because she's the paying customer, but everything changes when Amber and Pepe are stranded on a deserted Island, putting Pepe in a position of control.For the record, I'm not a follower of Madonna; I neither love her nor hate her. In fact, I almost didn't watch this film because she starred in it, but I gave-in because I'm a sucker for survival-on-deserted-island flicks. I'd also like to point out that I've never seen the original '74 film, so I have no nostalgic bias."Swept Away" failed at the box office in 2002, but only because it was barely released to theaters and critics condemned it before it was even completed. It subsequently swept (away) the Razzies as the worst picture and a bandwagon effect developed with everyone jumping into the negative feeding frenzy.Is it really THAT bad? No. Not even close. "Swept Away" starts as a fun, entertaining farce and morphs into a potent social commentary and, finally, a moving love story. The movie will make you laugh, make you angry, make you cry and ultimately move you -- no kidding. But it will only have this effect IF you refuse to listen to the drivel of the cookie-cutter critics and give it a chance.As for Madonna, she's no Meryl Streep but she successfully makes you despise Amber in Act 1 and feel for her later on. She made me believe Amber was a real person. What more do you want? I'm not an anti-capitalist but the film effectively points out the flaws of this system. It also effectively reveals how money/materialism can't of itself give true happiness, love or fulfillment. Amber had everything but was the most unhappy, loathsome person you'd likely ever meet.One reviewer referred to the film as a "wife beater's fantasy" but failed to point out that it could just as easily be called a "Man torturer's fantasy" or "Man emasculater's fantasy." Let's be evenhanded with our appraisals.I admit the physical abuse of Amber on the island (slapping, kicking and especially the faux-rape) is disturbing and almost tempted me to tune out, but then I saw what the filmmakers were shooting for, the filmmakers being Madonna and her husband.In our society we've been misled to believe that mental abuse is less abusive because it's not physical. This film effectively shows that mental abuse can be just as bad, if not worse.***SPOILER ALERT*** During the first half hour Amber horribly torments and emasculates Pepe (and others) because she's a spoiled brat and in control. When the tables are turned and she loses control on the island Pepe utilizes extreme measures to de-spoil Amber. In other words, Pepe realized that Amber was so far gone -- so utterly spoiled -- that she literally needed slapped back to reality. This is in line with a biblical proverb "Blows and wounds cleanse away evil and beatings purge the inmost being." Let's face it, some people are so far gone (that is, spoiled) that they literally need the snot beat out of them -- that's the only thing that's going to wake 'em up to reality. Apparently Pepe realized this on the island and acted accordingly. Do I think he goes too far? Yes, but -- then again -- I wasn't the one mentally tormented for days on the boat and totally emasculated in front of others. Regardless, the story shows that his methods worked -- Amber was humiliated to the point of seeing life from a totally different perspective, a much-needed new perspective. Pepe's discipline ultimately brings out spiritual character in Amber to the point where she refuses to call on passing boats to save her from her exile (two moving scenes, by the way). Why? Because she's been delivered from the bondage of selfishness, arrogance and materialism; she has experienced true love, fulfillment, team-work, companionship and independence (remember, she DOES learn how to fish for herself) for the first time in her life. It becomes more precious than gold to her and she doesn't want to let it go.Again, I think Pepe goes too far with the physical abuse (in fact, I don't believe in physical ABUSE at all); he should've stopped with a couple of slaps, at most, but the filmmmakers are (evidently) saying she was so far gone that extreme measures were necessary. Besides, didn't she make her own bed, so to speak? Let her lie in it.***END SPOILER*** The fact that Madonna -- one of the most successful women in history and the original "material girl" -- utilized this film to make this point speaks volumes. Is it a sign of weakness? No, it's a sign of enlightenment and spiritual strength.BOTTOM LINE: "Swept Away" is much better than similar flicks like 1998's "Six Days, Seven Nights" with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche. Why? Because, not only is it fun and entertaining, it's also thought-provoking and moving. Really, what more do you want from a stranded-on-a-deserted-island romantic-comedy? Needless to say, those who go overboard with the negative criticism need to get real.The film runs a short-but-sweet 89 minutes and was filmed in Sardinia and Malta.The DVD features a 20-minute making-of piece with Madonna and Guy Ritchie interviewing each other. It's an entertaining, informative and revealing piece. The DVD also features 16 deleted scenes.GRADE: A- or B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm surprised that only one other person seems to have made the connection with J.M Barrie's classic. It's a story worth retelling, and this is a flawed but sincere attempt.There is a lot to criticize: Madonna's improbable and simplistic transition from shrew to squaw (waay too fast), the idealized sex, the washed out colours and inconsistent acting; but, for all that, I was able to suspend my disbelief for a while, and I thought the ending was spot on (and similar to Barrie's).Opinion here seems to be split between the lovers and haters. Both are off the mark in my view; this is a curate's egg of a movie and I can't honestly give it more than a 6. But it does make me want to find a copy of Lina Wertmller's original (Travolti da un insolito destino nell'azzurro mare d'agosto).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I love Madonna. But knowing limits is something else. From all the movies she has ever made, Evita was the only one that actually worked. She was being herself and acting was left behind because of all the singing and dancing and cheering. Uha. Here she succeeds in sinking the boat for good. And a good boat it was. What's with people complaining about the washed out quality of the film? It was the most memorable thing of it. Photography and everything else is great, the themes are wonderful... if only Madge had stayed down in London Town writing some more songs. But she'll keep on tormenting the cinematic world. Endlessly. So brace yourself, because here comes Madonna. Again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swept Away, the movie starring Madonna. When people heard Madonna in a lead role there will be a lot of perceptions and early assumptions. This movie received very bad review from the critiques. Unfortunately, the critique were extremely harsh about this movie. Admitedly, it wasn't the best movie ever produced but the movie did have something to offer. The cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful. The scene in the ocean was vividly blue and the crystal sandy beach were amazingly portrayed. The acting deserved much more credits. Madonna's acting wasn't as bad as what the critique let moviegoers to believe, however, beside few scene where she actually did stand out, there are few other scene that she can improve. The male lead also did a fine job. The movie moves quite slow but steady. There are a few questionable scene in the movie that needed more attention and needed to be further explain.The ending of the movie is quite moving and was beautifully done. This movie come across as a social commentary that turn to an unexpected love story. It wasn't the best movie ever produced and it certainly does NOT deserved to be known as the worst movie of the year. As a conclusion, Swept Away is a above average movie with above average acting and above average direction.</fullReview>

I mean, lock stock was good, he got me interested, got me thinking there was more to this guy than crooning blue heads in Vegas. Along comes Snatch avec proof he's no flash in the pan but with SA he seals the deal. Swept II - all too late in the coming arriving not a moment too soon. &amp; the casting, Madonna!!!!! How did he ever get her? Hopefully this film will be re-released in IMAX 3D so we can really feel the force of this powerhouse classic. SWEPT III - bring it on!!!A pen-ultimate piece of work. Sublime. All I can say is touch Lionel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing how bad this movie was I admit that I didn't want to go see it anymore. And the critics were so cruel. So time went by and I finally saw it on HBO. The movie is entertaining at times and will keep you watching till the end. The end of this movie was different you think that they will stay together but sadly they don't. To me the ending is realistic because not everything should be a happy ending,in life there are ups and downs and I think this is what the movie teaches.This movie has its moments and even though Madonna is not the best actress she does well in this movie. So to anyone who reads this, trust me, watch it and if you don't like it,well then thats your problem its really not that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean this in different ways. Madonna gets slapped around in the movie. (Really unecessary, the trouble between the two leads could have been shown differently.) Madonna also takes a beating for trying too hard to be a star not only as a singer and media icon, but also as an actress and she still doesnt get that it doesnt work! She should choose which a field she could excell in, instead of tiring everybody by being a jack of all trades. She comes off as a dilettante. You dont see Julia Roberts realesing albums. (She knows her strengths.)This movie flopped despite being ok. I was expecting something really bad but it was mildly entertaining. She was even ok as an actress. She should have done something like this years ago instead of forcing lame Madonna-vehicles on unsuspecting audiences. People grew tired of seeing her wish she was a super MOVIE STAR too. Shes absolutley best at dancing as she does for a moment in this film. She comes alive and its fun to watch. She even looks good too. In the rest of the movie she cant keep a close-up. Harsh words but she doesnt seem to see herself clearly. She has to have it ALL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very briefly, Swept away strikes me as Guy Ritchie filling in some spare time just to get a new swimming pool or whatever for his efforts. He is a talented director but this is not his showcase - I can't see any of that earlier energetic hunger for brilliance here at all. Basically, it is like taking your maths GCSE exam, not enjoying it and just scraping by with a D- with the minimum of effort. You are lucky in that you haven't seen it and I can save you the bother - I'm sure there are more exciting things for you to do like cleaning the house, taking the bins out or mowing the lawn; although mundane, at least these chores have purpose - Swept Away does not. Still, maybe his first taste of failure will kick start Ritchie into a much better film that we know he can make if given the proper motivation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoiler****This movie was just about as I expected. Could have been better with a decent lead actress( not Madonna) she is terrible as usual and should stick to what she does best-singing. However the scenery was beautiful and it was kind of intriguing watching her butcher this film.It was cheesy and unrealistic. Madonna gets stranded on a desert island with a poor fisherman, a crew member of the boat she belittled and offended. He turns the tables and makes clear that he is the boss on the island and she will do as he says. They fight, he slaps her and tries to rape her, they try to beat the crap out of each other, next thing you know they are making passionate love on the beach. They fall in love and when they both notice a ship coming to rescue them, she actually doesn't want to be saved and wants to stay on the island with him? Yeah right!At the end when she is on the plane going back to her life with her husband, Madonna is supposed to be crying but it looks so fake it is pathetic and funny.I did like ending credits and the music that was played. The final minute of the movie where you see the ring being thrown and sinking to the bottom is cool but too bad it was the closing to what turned out to be a very bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, It's not the worst...but still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented "Swept Away" expecting it to be the worst film ever, and was surprised to see that it wasn't. THAT being said, I think there is something to be said for not allowing your spouse to bully you into doing something (do you hear, Guy Ritchie?) First of all, the movie moved like a drunk snail. There was some really good dialogue in the beginning, along with good music and cinematography, but as soon as Madonna started speaking, I said "Oh Lord, here we go again!" The actor playing her protagonist (the son of the actor from the original I believe) was quite good.This remake is not in the least bit politically correct. Basically the Italian (not Greek) fisherman abuses her, and breaks her down until she gives in. The only way to show the nuances of the characters so that we sympathize with them though we may not like their behaviors, is to have good actors who can show all sides. Madonna cannot do that! She's so efficient at playing bitch, that after a while you start to ask yourself "Why didn't he just strangle her?" or "OK, she's been on this island long enough and has watched this guy long enough to know how to take care of herself, so why doesn't she just tell him to take a flying leap and break from him? Why does she hide from the rescue effort to stay with him?" The answer SHOULD be that she was as trapped with her husband and previous life as she is on this island. The fisherman, through his own anger, bitterness and brutality - breaks through all the walls she's put up. But since Madonna cannot seem to drum up real, emotional conflict and feelings, you don't quite believe her when she "reveals" herself. There is no real chemistry between them. She has a hard time crying and only really, truly did it on the helicopter at the end of the movie. But by then it was too late as far as the audience is concerned. Nothing is worse than a movie that doesn't make you care about the characters. All I could think was "Oh for God's sake will somebody come by with a boat and pick them up?!" And if I heard Madonna deliver one more joke in her flat, nasal way, I was going to put a shoe in the DVD player. She wasn't funny, which would have helped her character (and Madonna herself) garner more sympathy. For someone who prides herself in "pushing the envelope" and "challenging the status quo", you'd think she'd be a better actor. Stick to what you know babe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lina Wertmuller's original film was, of course, more complex and much wittier, but Ritchie's remake isn't the shipwreck of a film that most everyone is saying it is. Madonna does a right decent job of portraying her misery, which comes across in the form of utter bitchiness at the beginning of the movie, but contrary to what nearly everyone else is saying, I didn't hate her instantly - I saw a very lonely and desperate character beyond Amber's facade, so her behavior on the island (when the pathetic illusion of social structure is entirely swept away) was thoroughly believable to me.And Adriano Giannini, the son of the great Giancarlo Giannini, who played the Giuseppe part in Wertmuller's original, fares extremely well here - it is his characterization that truly makes the movie work. Sure, his fisherman is not very smart, but he's not a moron, as some critics wrote; he's smart enough to know when he's being played -- I disagree as well with a lot of critics who wrote that the two of them hated each other so intensely in the beginning scenes that you could smell it. I think he found her challenging and was attracted to her even as she was insulting him - that whole love/hate master/slave deal was lurking under the supposedly superficial surface from the get-go.Possible Spoilers -=-If anything, his character is mind-boggling naive -- thinking for a second that she could overcome her dependence on the social structure (that she was so miserable in at the beginning of the movie) once they'd left the island (because he wanted proof that the two of them - mismatched as they were -- could be together anywhere). Madonna's character knows herself at least that much and realizes this isn't going to be possible, that the world they created between them when life was stripped down to the bare essentials on the island could not exist anywhere else.What people seem to be missing here is that Amber is a slave THROUGHOUT the film - overtly for a time on the island, when he is the one who knows how to survive and she's eventually forced to acknowledge this superiority by her submission, which ironically frees her (as only true submission can). But she also had been a slave in her 'normal' life - a slave to money, social constraints, material possessions, blah blah blah -- all the things that make one completely miserable if one stupidly attempts to serve them. This is the true irony at the end - she goes back to being a slave to her superficiality because she cannot tell her husband that she's not going with him, that she knows Giuseppe wants to be with her even if she didn't get the note he tried to deliver to her. She is not in charge, she never WAS in charge, she is completely helpless, unable to say a word - she just subjugates herself to her husband and her old life by staying on the helicopter and leaving behind her only possible chance for real freedom. And so she ends up where she started out - miserable and empty - but now, even sadder, she has some understanding of how she has contributed to her own lack of freedom, to her own inability to make a change, a choice.</fullReview>

During the first part of the movie I was distracted doing something else, this is a good thing because if not, I would have probably changed the channel due to the fact of Madonna being in it. Closed minded, eh?

While not as much realism as in "Cast Away", there is just enough to avoid being *too* distracting. The real story is the changing dynamics between the man and woman from the beginning to the end of the movie. Madonna and Adriano Giannini do a good job on this without being too over the top. Not having the typical Hollywood ending for this movie was a good decision in my opinion. Sad, but more believable.Overall, a pleasing movie experience.

Madonna was not awful, and Adriano Gianni did a wonderful job reprising the role his father played in the original.The film does suffer in the transformation in the relationship between the two main characters. That aspect come across as if someone threw a magical switch and everything changed. The subjugation of the woman was more vividly portrayed in the first version, but I do not think that our current society could stomach that.While the original is undoubtedly better, this one is not as bad as was made out.</fullReview>

I just finished watching it several minutes ago...and I must admit, I was blown away by how shockingly decent the film was. Actually, I daresay it was a bit above decent; if I hadn't read the countless deplorable reviews of this infamous film, I would even think this was a downright great movie! Too bad my mind has been slightly clouded (nope, make that VERY clouded) by the overwhelmingly negative rap this film has earned. Well, hear this, skeptical moviegoers: IT'S NOT SO BAD! Really!! Yeah, that's right - I am praising "Swept Away"! (gasp!!!) So sue me! If you think any shred of taste in good film I once had has now been exterminated, you can maybe stop and listen first... I cannot believe most critics were destroying this as they did back when it was released late last year (to a dismal box-office performance, surprise, surprise). Indeed, I myself thought it initially to look interesting - until I was influenced by the near-universal animosity everyone was feeling for it. For WHAT?! Because it starred Madonna in another of her supposed vanity projects, directed by her own husband? Because it was inferior to the 1970s original (which I have never seen, so I shouldn't judge), which just happened to star the father of the actor in this version in the exact same role?? I don't know...please, help me out here!Granted, I can somewhat see why many people have slammed it...at times, its editing, cinematography, script, etc. can leave MUCH to be desired, but hey, it was nowhere near the garbage I was expecting when I reluctantly chose to watch it - simply out of pure, sick curiosity! I am easily fascinated by what are considered the "worst" films ever, and this shouldn't be stuck in that section. Nowhere near. Sure, it has its frequent moments of camp, and sheer stupidity...but I mean, c'mon! Were you really expecting a good artistic film to be taken seriously? Give me a break! I was laughing many times...sometimes at moments that were actually supposed to be funny, and others that were unintentionally funny. This film was fantastic other times...that bizarre singing/dancing sequence of Madonna in the yellow dress was disturbing and amusing at the same time! I liked it! "Swept Away" is by no means a classic, I don't think, unless it miraculously gains an air of importance as the years pass - when people finally recognize it as the severely, severely underrated work it is. Good acting (for the most part) from the hilariously vicious two leads, nice story (and for those who think it lousy or unoriginal - remember, it's a REMAKE!!), charming music, and one of the saddest endings I've ever seen...schmaltzy, yes, but hey...I'm an unabashed sucker for that type of stuff.This is one of the stranger experiences I've had watching a film, as I don't think I've felt this completely swayed before by a film so reviled! I actually enjoyed it, and that's starting to scare me! Oh, well...I have nothing against anyone involved, I think Madonna is a great talent. She seemed very courageous to me to take this kind of a role, in this kind of an environment. It's pretty memorable, and I hope she doesn't stop - even after this unexpected failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swept Away. A lot has been said about that Madonna - Guy Ritchie Movie, and most of the critics and reviews were very bad. A lot of anger is in the reviews - do they criticize the movie or Madonna? The movie at all is in the end very interesting, that means the plot, the scenery and the actors. Of course, the original is much better and had a meaning. this remake here lost a lot of the original spirit but has still a promising story to tell. It's a mix between comedy and drama, but never really funny and never really sad. Guy Ritchie failed in making a movie, that peaks the right tune for this story. but he had some funny ideas with the result of some interesting scenes. Madonna. She is definately not an actress, she has no background, she just tried it once again. But to be honest, she has a talent, but not everytime. You realize that if you watch the scenes, where she has to be the ritch bitch, she was awfull and not a single moment believeble. But when she is once on that island with this hot italien guy, she has some class. She's good in scenes that she obviously likes, and there are scenes, she's bad because maybe she thought, it was not that interesting to play. As an actress you must play every scene with passion, that's her mistake. Just because you see at the oscars the best scenes of a nominated actress doesn't mean the rest is not important. But, that's a point for her, she looked beautiful in Swept Away. There will be not a boring moment in that movie if you like silent art movies. There are, as I wrote, interesting parts beside the script and the bad direction - Which is, yes, very important, but look out in your cinemas, so much stupid movies are playing. In fact of that, Swept Away is a good little movie. Sorry for my English, I'm still learning:-)</fullReview>

If you intend to watch this film forget about any pre-conceptions of Guy Ritchie or Madonna films you may have as, although it has elements of both, it isn't really either. Swept Away has the slick and amazing cinematography you would expect from Guy Ritchie and Madonna is excellently cast. She provides some very moving, and almost comic moments in the film and it wouldn't be nearly as good without her. Beautiful locations, a moving storyline and sporadic use of italian dialogue make this film both compelling viewing and a twist on your average romantic film (which I'm really not a fan of). The storyline itself and an ending I didn't expect kept me totally enthralled. The comparisons between Swept Away and Six Days Seven Nights aren't really relevant as although they share a similar storyline, Swept Away approaches it in a completely different style rather than the rom com style chosen for Six Days Seven Nights. It's a completely different film. And well worth a look, even if only to make up your mind for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically, I thought this was an excellent movie: 1) ALL the actors were VERY life like, and that certainly included Andriano AND Madonna (who has been seen as too restrained or stilted by SOME viewers). Madonna is obviously working out physically very hard and professionally, and her body certainly shows it in the picture. She also portrayed the up-tight frigidity of her character VERY WELL, and this portrayal continues to convince me that she is a very talented actress. 2) All environs in the movie were ideally represented and the photography, especially of natural phenomenon, beautiful. The movie was worth the time just for the photography, but in my opinion it was also worth it just for the acting alone. 3) Great Quotes: "Would you really be interested in me if there were a choice?" "Maybe what I WANTED wasn't what I NEEDED." "Then was THEN, now is NOW." 4) Interesting Morale: Power is yours when you have what someone else wants; ie: $ for vacations; knowledge and strength for being marooned on deserted islands.Thematically, I felt a distinct blur between this movie  and Blue Lagoon(s) and Swiss Family Robinson and Robinson Caruso. This writing (content) of Swept Away pulls my rating down from its technical heights by producing something similar to, but not as thought provoking as the others in its genre.I'm glad I experienced SWEPT AWAY.Rating: 3/5;6/10 Bill Schaefer ephraim@chesco.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guy Ritchie's noble effort is beat up, knocked down, raped, kicked around, shot, stabbed, spit upon, punched, sodomized, and abused and left for dead by Madonna's dreadful performance. Her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this, and if you exclude ALL of the scenes that his wife was in, it's a fair movie at best. I think that the best acting job ever, had to be Guy comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to re-shoot. If you have an opportunity of watching Swept Away or clipping your toenails for 89 minutes...go for the extended pedicure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hate the game, not the player</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The masses always hate those who have made it to the top. The game is what's despicable, and one wonders what makes it worth playing. Personally, I don't know, but Madonna has gotten herself to the level she has in the game, and now everyone lurks in the shadows waiting to condemn her for not being perfect. But, the fact is that Madonna is an artist who has worked with tireless effort to be in the position to be criticized. So be it. One thing I admire about Madonna so much is that she is a truly determined being touching on every facet of art, creating it everywhere around her, helplessly drawn to yet another area where she can create yet again. So, she's not perfect here. She's not a trained actress. You only need to look at her effortless performance in the fantasy dancehall scene to see that she is brimming over with talent and mastery. Does that mean, though, that she should just stick to dancing then? Madonna is a force of Nature so much larger than life that it's impossible for her to stop there. She's learning guitar and trying her hand yet again at acting. All this at 40+. What have you picked up lately as a truly engaging serious hobby, or area where you'd like to improve yourself? Anyway. I liked this movie, actually. One area I was disappointed in is Madonna's delivery as the bitchy socialite Amber because it was grating on the nerves and not shrill as I would have expected it to be. Rather, it seemed this was Madonna playing herself in a mood of disgust with a street attitude. It was relentless. And maybe we should be disgusted and feel battered by it, but the pace Richie keeps is off and there is hardly any explanation in the script that comes across to explain why she is so embittered. Another area that really put me off was the tone of mental Dominance/submission that seemed excessively cruel for what was provided in the script and pacing. I can see that she might be broken down into adoring him as bread-winner, but it happened too quickly and conveniently to be believable. That said, I found Madonna, her performance, and the storyline much more convincing once they made it to the island, and her attitude broke down. Their sruggle to each be top dog was tangible, Amber's break down to at the point of at least cooperating was delicious, and I completely forgot I was watching Madonna in what's been called by the player-haters a stunt. I adored the resolution, and it's as it should be, I think. The DVD featurette is a pure delight. 7 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

You play basically the same rich bitch in every movie and lets face it, YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO ACT! There are no real words to describe this film. The main male character's accent was so hard to understand I had to put on the subtitles.Let's not forget that being stuck on a beach has been done before (Blue Lagoon, Cast Away) and these directors didn't stick in a pointless music video of the main star to kill time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, now I've got the DVD doing the multiregion thing and watched it :)The movie is very good, which is a surprise given the vile reviews. I can see why the critics didn't like it all the same - there's no sugar sweet plot coating, no Americanised accents from the supporting players, and routine violence against women. Madonna's performance is good and Adriano Giannini is brilliant too.It's funny, smart, entertaining, disturbing, passionate and political all in one. American critics were never going to like a film which has questions materialism and capitalism so blatantly - if Maid in Manhatan is the style section of the Times, this is the opinion section of the Guardian. It's comedy with a hard drama edge, and there's no cliched Hollywood "girl made good" or "bad guy with the heart of gold" here, just real people with their own prejudices, insecurities and inner demons.You can love the characters for all the wrong reasons, but you certainly wouldn't want to be stuck on a desserted island with them!While Ritchie has toned down the original's violence according to most reports, Amber is ugly, vapid and nasty while Giuseppe takes his revenge of her spoiled-rich-bitch character on her over the edge of decency. Neither is exactly redeemed by the end, which is a twist on typical Hollywood fare and stronger for it.This isn't Hollywood, and a better movie for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guido and Grandma on Gilligan's Island</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead The setup for the inexplicable and artificial antagonism between the rich lady and Giuseppe(or Peppe)the cabin boy, consists of a few scenes of her demanding this or that and him grumbling to the three sweaty kitchen workers when he goes down to get the coffee. Just so that we understand how mean she is, the script makes her call him Guido, nature boy and Pee-Pee. Yes, that's the caliber of the writing. When Madonna demands that nature boy take her out in the dinghy he demurs, because he knows the sea. But the plot must be followed, so they get shipwrecked on a beautiful resort island, and wouldn't you know there's a cute little furnished cabin waiting for them, plus an old tire to fashion into a spear gun. Of course it takes a little time to iron out the kinks of the relationship. He has to kick her backside and smack her in the face a few times, but in due course she learns to kiss his feet and they fall upon each other in a passionate embrace. Just so that we know they're in love, we're shown a 15-minute montage of them rolling around on the beach in various configurations of their shared clothing, with some isn't-this-romantic music in the background. Madonna is so taken with her young swain that she hides when she sees a yacht nearby. She wants to spend the rest of her life eating octopus and drinking island water from a coke bottle...and why not? But Guido wants her to prove her love by declaring it to the world, not just by doing him in the sand over and over. He flags down the next passing yacht and the next thing you know she's reunited with her husband...well, you can guess the end. Mr. Ritchie is not kind to his wife. A loving husband would have steered her to community theater to get this acting lark out of her system, not hung her out to dry in this turkey. I truly felt sorry for her. I know she did her best, but when you can't, you can't. And who on earth took care of the lighting? One of her old enemies? She doesn't look that bad in most photos you see of her. The one redeeming thing in this movie was young Adriano, who is capable of showing heartfelt emotion in spite of everything going on around him. His telephone scene near the end was something to write home about. I'm hoping he has a long and prosperous career in showbiz. Because of Adriano Gianinni, I'll give the movie 3 out of 10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*MAJOR SPOILERS*Watch it for the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writing and direction sanked Swept Away, from the word go. The last half of the movie is the best, and plays well. Madonna is definately more natural, and the film flows much better later on. I enjoyed the little dance lip-sync number, but it could have been written into the script a little better. When Pepe is demanding a dance and song, I kept expecting Amber to come out with "Is the sun getting to you?" or something along those lines. Many avenues like this are not explored. I think the film would have worked better with a more interesting power struggle in the middle of the movie. Pepe smacking around Amber, kicking her and threatening to rape her, doesn't help to enpower Pepe in the mind of the audience. Politics (capitalism vs communism) are brought up on the boat, but not mentioned once on the island. An issue that was very prominent in the original.I would advise that people not give up on it in the first 2/3rds, because the ending is worth the time. I found it very honest, and truthful. Sad.. but true. I was even a little teary eyed when Amber saw the red envelope.BAD POINTS: The characters were written too mean, and filmed badly. The hack job of the original script omitted several necessary topics to make the film work, and not enough creative license was taken to make up for it. GOOD POINTS: Yes, Madonna! She looks relaxed and confident. Adriano Giannini does everything he can with his role, and is very sexy, when he's not beating her up. The beautiful locations, and the reality of the ending also make the movie enjoyable. Rating 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad But Crowd-Mind Just Expects Madonna To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie fails and succeeds on equal levels, but not for the popular reasons you've heard. Madonna is very good. The rest of the cast was not. She gave a very realistic portrayal and has the charisma of an old movie star (she was a mix of Kathrine Hepburn and Marylin Monroe in "Whos That Girl" and its still shocking that it wasn't accepted as a good slap-stick comedy). Here she could have easily put Grace Kelly to shame, had she had a good director. This movie should have been remade but not by Guy Richie... he did not go into the sexual detail on the island that was needed and he hacked the cast out of the boat scenes and he wrote Madonna's character too harsh at the beginning. The ending is heartbreaking and fitting but it ends too fast and we dont feel that the characters are actually "in-love".I would go so far as to say the best thing about this movie is Madonna. The sets and her performance are the only 2 real good things about it. She has never really been a bad actress, but she relies on proving herself too much rather than doing what she is best at, comedy. The scene with her inside the boat where she is drunk is played to perfection. If we look at her career as an actress as a whole we can see she has had more good performances than bad.... A League Of Their Own, Dick Tracy, Evita, Desperately Seeking Susan- all great!Anyway "Swept Away" never even got pushed at the box office... the failure of this movie is Guy Richie's fault and he makes Madonna look bad only because no one actually got to see this film. It all has to do with crowd-mind and unfortunately everyone is under the impression that Madonna is not a good actress... but keep in mind thats what everyone thought about Monroe till it was already too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But not as good as it should've been, either. Taken as a very simple fable and nothing more, it works. Madonna's not great but she's better than she's been in 90% of her other movies. The cinematography is easy on the eyes...and Adriano Giannini is vava-voom (when he's not providing acting that's as one-dimensional as Madonna's). I was expecting a really awful movie but was surprised that it wasn't a total bomb. The first third is the hardest to get through (believe it or not, all of the actors are worse than Madonna). Once the two are alone on the island, I got pulled into it. Perhaps it was because I liked seeing Madonna get knocked around a little bit or maybe I'm a sucker for people on desertedislands (exception being "Cast Away" which bored me to death). It's a vanity project, to be sure, but there were many more movies last year that were farworse than this.</fullReview>

The end is fantastic, so Hollywood unlike, that I'm still with it on my head. Can't wait for the DVD: I wanna see more scenes with Jeanne Tripplehorn and Elizabeth Banks (both terrific, they diserved more screen-time) and that hilarious making-off.

Madonna isn't horrible in it, she's believable and gives her best performance since Dangerous Game and possible Susan. if it wasn't Madonna, we probably wouldn't be so critical. Jeane Tripplehorn as the pill-popping drunk is grand (be sure to check the deleted scenes). I'm sure that the movie doesn't make the political or social impact that the original did, but it's a nice alternative to the tedious romantic comedies of late. It's not the kind of movie that drove me to the theater, but the dvd made for an enjoyable night with a few friends and a bottle of wine.

		<shortDescription>A Madonna movie is critically savaged - Yawn!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am indeed a Madonna fan. So shoot me! That said, just because I am a fan of her musical output, doesn't mean that I am oblivious to the fact that when it comes to big screen forays, she doesn't always hit the right buttons, due in no small part to her limited range as an actress. Yet, I am constantly appalled at the amount of unfair criticism this woman receives regarding her acting career, especially when so called 'actresses' such as Jennifer Lopez are, in my opinion, far inferior to the woman the critics love to hate. True, she's unlikely to ever win an Oscar, but out of the 20 or so movies she's made, at least half of them have been above average and entertaining romps. Then we have 'EVITA', a film that proves if anything, given the right role, Madonna can indeed create big screen magic!'Swept Away' while by no means a masterpiece, is a decent enough flick, with fine performances, even by Madonna, and an engaging on-screen pairing. Yet, months before anyone on God's Green Earth had even seen the damn thing, critics were pronouncing it DOA! It seems that American critics these days have decided that they are above all other beings, obviously possessing psychic powers, in that they can now review films that they aint even seen. Now that IS talent. Or, could it be that critics these days have not got the courage to differ from each other, and feel the need to jump on the 'Let's diss the new Madonna movie' bandwagon, instead of giving the film the fairer shake it deserved. It's become a rather tired cliche if truth be told. Cowards, the lot of you!So, for those who aren't bitter, or being paid good money to knock other people's achievements, or for those who have the brains to watch a films with a non-polluted mind, I highly recommend 'Swept Away'. It's not gonna change the world of film, but compared to some of the other rubbish that 'Hollywood' is churning out these days, you could do a lot worse. So, go on, be the bigger man, I dare ya!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really wasn't THAT bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, first thing I'm going to do is establish my credibility. Yes, I have been a Madonna fan since 1983 and NO I do not think everything she makes is fantastic which I find annoying and cultish (you know, that glazed eyed look of her fanatic fans.) In fact, she's put out some real doozies (ahem... "Next Best Thing" anyone? What garbage!) Plus, I hated her album "Music" so this is to let you know I'm trying to be a fair viewer.Okay, the movie. Well, I watched it out of morbid curiosity. I had heard so much bad stuff about this movie I just really wanted to see why it was so horrible. You know what? It wasn't that bad.The storyline was somewhat interesting... facinating really... take two opposite persons with different morals and values that defy the other and put each one in a place of power over the other and watch what happens. It is somewhat masochistic in a sense. In other words, it really is a clashing of morals and defying them until the other gets fed up. The lower class Italian worker simply rebels more and more when he is being dominated by Amber... interestingly enough, Amber, the rich nasty woman, submits completely when she is in the passive position. She really doesn't even fight. Why? Because her place of power really is an illusion whereas his isn't.Regardless, all philosophical musings aside, you probably want the dirt on the flick. Alright, it's totally Guy all the way when it comes to filming and directing. You get his humor and camera angles from "Lock, Stock..." So if you liked that movie, you might get a kick out of this one.How was Madonna? Not bad. She was actually interesting in her character. She's starting to really loosen as an actress and beginning to forget the camera. Remember, I said BEGINNING.She's getting there. Also, it seems like she trusts her husband as a director so she relaxes a bit. She delivers her lines softer, but without as much emotion in the first half of the film. I truly believe Madonna should take acting lessons. She's too conscious of the camera and we as the audience are too conscious of the most famous woman in the world. And she's aware of this.Is this a problem? Yes, mostly due to the fact that she has a HUGE obstacle to overcome in order for her audience to believe her as an actress; she has to make her audience forget who she is in order for them to like her character that she's portraying. She did this 100% in "Desperately Seeking Susan" and 75% in "Evita."If she took lessons in acting, like she did with singing, I think she could go somewhere. Otherwise, her marketable product is what's truly knocking her down. What an oxymoron.Otherwise, the film was interesting. The scenery was just beautiful, especially the nighttime scenes. There are moments between the two main characters that are genuinely fun and tender. I liked the interaction between the two of them and how loving they are towards each other. The ending is truly sad which makes it more of an art film than a good movie.Still, I plan on renting it when it comes out. I wouldn't mind looking at it again. Recommendations: big bang viewers, don't bother. Insight to an artflick, something to chat about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will say having seen this movie that it was not Madonna's worst performance. And that seems to be what all the critics were attacking. She actually did rather well. This isn't a movie, however, that you have to see on the big screen. It is a Romantic Modern and Re-telling of something that might be a version of Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew" This was not a Genre that Guy Ritchie should explore, however. He, like Quinten Tarantino, should stick to Quick Tounged, Action, Gang Movies. However, he was a great Director for Madonna, and sees where she'd be good on screen. I personally believe Madonna should do action films where not much real acting is involved but Great action sequences (As she as proved she looks good doing with her latest video from Bond), and being Sexy, and that she is. As for Adriano Giannini, the main Character. Why has he been hiding behind the camera. He is great fun and watching this movie, you really think that this is what he is like.. well, This is probably the first thing you saw him in also, all the other times he's been off screen. And the only reason you saw this (if you did) was because you were a Madonna fan. Because they were the only people who knew about it. There was no publicity for the film and it seemed as though production company SONY had absolutely no faith in the film from the start. I am, however, glad they did it. Despite it's less than a scratch income and the box office, it is a descent Romantic Drama that you should not pass up if given the opportunity to watch. But if you didn't see it at the theater, don't be upset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the original Italian movie and of course when I heard that Madonna came out with a remake I had to see it. Sure she's not a "great" actress, but my opinion is that the critics based their reviews mostly on the comparison to the original movie...and of course, they all have their preconceived notions and beliefs on her acting skills. There are countless actors out there that give lame performances all the time, and while not getting the best of the critics they never get crucified for it. The minute Madonna makes a move on films, expectations arise to the extremes and in the end it's obvious that she'll get trashed for it. Therefore, this movie was condemned before it even came out. Madonna's Swept Away was not a bad movie in the sense it was portrayed. I thought Guy Ritchie borrowed the original theme of the previous one, turning it into his own story of two extremely different people who did not like each other, and their faint possibility at falling in love. Definitely leaving aside the political issues and gender roles that the original 70s Swept Away was all about. I really did not think it was a bad movie, nor do I think that Madonna acted all that poorly. However, if you're going to base watching a movie solely on her acting skills along with the bad criticism she always gets, chances are you'll pass...Which is exactly what a lot of people did, and really missed out on an simple comedy with a touch of bittersweet romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no Madonna fan, but I cringe at the amount of nastiness that seems to be pointed her way in general, and more to the point, in regards to this remake. The problem here folks is not Madonna. The problem is that this was not a film to be remade and if it was so essential that it had to be, it was certainly not a film to be made by or starring an american. The beauty and the success of the original was due to political and social barriers and classes that it presented. Something that has always been quite prevalent in european society and something that was also enormously fitting at the time of the original film's making. No, we don't like the rich bitch at the beginning, but Lina balances this with us not exactly liking her hired hand once on the island. There is much more violence and explicit sexual activity in the original yet it manages to balance itself between a witty comical satire and a drama. There is nothing offensive about these activities because what plays out on the island between the two characters is the differences, distances and realities of the two social classes. And through their fighting, humiliation and shift of power, not only do they come to some sort of mutual understanding - they also come to an existence that is the opposite of what they've known and it works. But... only in that controlled environment. We are reminded of the politics of the world once again when they return to civilisation and the movie then speaks for itself.Now, take all of that and fast forward it to 2002 and take out the italian class struggle and stick in an american (which makes no sense at all as regardless of how this country came to be it never has known the separation of aristocracy and the commoner) and you've already stripped the story bare of it's very essence. That is the essential problem with this film, not Madonna, not even Guy Ritchie. The only mistake that they made was deciding to make this their project. If one of the two is more responsible for the end result, it would have to be the director. It's his job to have a handle on these things. As for Madonna, yes, she's still not Meryl Streep, and yes, she's still stiff around the edges, but the failure of this film cannot be pinned on her back. There were financiers involved, writers, producers, a studio and a director. It is amazing to me that so many people are ready to pull out the poison pen and lay it on her shoulders.And by the way, I admire her for continuing to get in the ring. I wonder how many of the people who are so ready to tread all over her and put her down, would be brave enough to constantly get back up each time they're knocked down and try to better themselves and get it right the next time. That takes courage and when the world's eye is on you, it takes a hell of a lot more courage than most of us have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ritchie fails, Madonna prevails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been able to understand why critics are so quick to blame Madonna as an actress for the failure of some of her films. Yes, she doesn't make many good choices in her pick of films to star in but has always given 100% to all roles and is a fine actress. What sadly happens here is that she cannot save her husbands lousy script and labored direction. This would have been a fantastic role for her at the hands of more experienced writers and directors. Ritchie fails in the romantic drama genre. He's best in his macho action mode. Here his characters don't give you any reasons for their emotions. Why is her character so unhappy and viciously bitter? He never delves into character backgrounds but we get plenty of his signature male buddies. We are constantly taken back to the sweaty slobs in the kitchen for their macho opinions of whats happening on board. His attempts at humor are labored and boderline camp but never really funny. The scenes on the island quickly become a bore without any well written scenes that show two people falling in love. Its amazing Madonna can pull off a good performance given what she had to work with. The film wouldn't be any better with Julia Roberts or Meryl Streep (although neither of them would do it). And worst of all, Madonna, who always looks fabulous, was filmed to look awful. Its as if the director doesnt want anyone to see her at her best. The ocean recieved better cinematography. All in all its no where near as bad as critics would have you believe but I wish Madonna had had the chance to make the upcoming musical Chicago with Goldie Hawn as it was originally planned instead of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw 2 times the original SA by Lina Wertmuller and I have to say that Guy Ritchy deluded me. Right remake choose, not very good results. I loved the other made by GR movies and I was waiting for something better. This is an average movie, my rate is 6. On the opposite I don't agree that Madonna is a bad actress. I don't like so much Madonna as public person (but I don't know her personally). She is a good singer, average dancers, very bad guitar player, great showoman. People usually say that she can't act, I say she CAN act, and not bad. Off course she is not Greta Garbo but is for sure better than Isabelle Rossellini, Swartznagger or Ben Affleck. Any way I think that the people who did not see the original could find nice this movie,for sure in video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, to be sure... but not all that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Swept Away" recreates the circumstances leading up to Diana Ross' late career hit of the same name, with Madonna playing Miss Ross, and Rupert Everett as Michael Jackson! Just kidding. You know what this movie is about, and while it sure is plenty bad, it is not quite as bad as I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, there is NO reason to see this movie, but if by some twist of fate you find yourself in the theater and this is on, it could be worse. My friend, an obsessed madonna fan, and I went to this on opening night expecting a "Glitter"-like fiasco, but this movie is just bad, not spectacularly, over-the-top-ridiculous horrifying bad like Mariah's movie was.I didn't think Madonna was that bad. In fact, once she was on the island and became a little more pleasant I actually found her quite charming. She is a little frighteningly "healthy" looking, if you call looking like a skinned panther healthy looking. Halfway through the movie, my friend leaned over and said "she has been Botoxed within an inch of her life!" and it's true, if you look, her forehead DOES NOT MOVE.The movie is fairly provocative, and, I will admit, strangely moving and sweet in parts. In my screening, opening night in Times Square, these two women, who could not be described as critical of consumer culture, came in with their shopping bags and sat down two seats from me, and started yakking through the whole movie. I didn't mind, because I thought we were all going to start jeering at the screen soon, but what shocked me is that this woman started, once Madonna was on the island, saying a constant patter of "Yeah, smack that B*tch! What a F*cking B*tch! She deserves it! Smack her!" ...It was an eye-opener for sure.The one who doesn't emerge well from this film is Guy Ritchie...He just seemed to be pretty much flailing through the whole thing.The musical number was utterly nonsensical and superfluous (the other commentators here who LOVED IT are obvious studio plants... or perhaps I overestimate humanity's good taste). The ending also betrays the characters, especially madonna's character, by making her just a character-less wuss who goes along with whatever she's presented with at the moment. I think the ending was changed after audiences didn't like it, but the new, neutral one sucks just as bad. Look folks, you're scuttling this movie by dumping it in 3 theaters anyway, why not provoke the four people that do see it? But I have to say that after it all I am left with fond memories of this movie. And Adriano is sizzling white hot. I would kiss his feet any day of the week. Ah well Madonna... next time.--- Check out my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies at: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Swept Away tonight. I knew about all the negative press surrounding it. But, I'm glad it didn't stop me from seeing this enjoyable movie. Yes, I agree, she's not a great actress, BUT she's wasn't that bad! She did a fine job in her hubby's little movie. It was charming, funny and really well shot and edited. Guy Ritchie's good. He found ways to work around his wife's shortcomings as an actress. He didn't keep the shot long enough to show her bat her eyes too many times... And she was quite believable and funny too. Her co-star was great and their chemistry really worked. The movie explores gender roles and classes while entertaining the viewer with quirky characters and gorgeous scenery. Great soundtrack too! My suggestion is to ignore all the Madonna bashing and see it as if she were an unknown... that may be difficult, but not impossible! It's a treat! Oh, and Larry King was right.... you may need tissues!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes Guy Richie is a cool director...Yes anything Madonna touches turns to gold. Ok, I must admit that Shanghi Suprise was a pretty bad film. I sat down &amp; started watching this movie &amp; by the time it was over, I thought the film should have been called BLOWN AWAY! Because that is exactly how I felt after this great little film. Madonna plays a snob-stuckup rich woman (ala Goldie Hawn in Overboard) &amp; pulls a "Gilligan's Island" kind of thing by getting stuck on an island. The film has so many fun &amp; entertaining moments that if people go &amp; see it, then pass the word, it has the potential to be the sleeper hit &amp; have Oscar buzz. Congrats to Guy Ritchie for his delightful creation. (10) Z.</fullReview>

It was also interesting to see Guy Ritchie working on something other than the usual underworld mobster flicks ! He does have a slightly different view which turns ordinary things to something more interesting.It also has a great summer atmosphere, it smells Mediterranean summer to me and this is hard to find in films. It's a good romantic comedy to see with a girlfriend/ wife.I gave it a 6 because of poor Madonna acting .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similair to a 1957 picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture reminds me of a Keneth More picture from 1957 called The Admirable Crighton" whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant. Madonna did OK in some movies however this one doesn't fire. If there is any picture that show Madonna can't act it is this one.I am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of "The Admirable Crighton" but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then Hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad. to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail.The plot is loose and the acting is mediocre. The script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location. While many here have canned Madoona for all her acting I think that in films like "A League of Their own" was quite good and enjoyable and "Who's That Girl" showed a quirkiness of Madonna's style not shown before or afterwards. Other Madonna films are not as enjoyable and I would have liked a to see a Madonna Animation series with the character from "Who's That Girl" I like the music from these two films however "Swept away" remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so.everyone has a bomb right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many film critics are very quick to bash Madonna in film and it's easy to see why, but Swept Away didn't deserve the bashing it got... well, not all of it anyway. Okay, first thing's first, Madge's acting was below standard... blowing any sort of credibility she gained from EVITA right out of the sandy-beach water. As for direction... Guy Ritchie is a very talented director and it's not his fault the movie cost $20 Million to make and it only grossed $500,000 at the Box Office... his very stylized direction makes this movie worth seeing... quick edits, quirky music overlays... it's all their but as a follow up to Lock Stock and Snatch die-hard fans were expecting another gory crime caper and ended up with an understated romantic beach romp. If you open your mind you'll find it pretty lighthearted and funny with a very good message; 'money can't buy you happiness' and 'follow your heart'. Give it a chance, you'll be surprised!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hidden gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw swept away three years ago and with tears in my eyes at the end I proclaimed it a good film. This was before I read any of the reviews. Every review I have ever read on this film has been bad, even on IMDb! After seeing the movie again last week, I knew I had to post a comment.In my opinion, the good work that is Swept Away has been eclipsed by an enormous vengeful grouse against the union that is Madonna and Ritchie. True film lovers hate the idea of musician turned actress and to add to that she's married to a Director, this is seen as her even getting ready to jump deeper into the film game! It appears loathsome I agree but it's not enough to dismiss this film.Swept Away is a good film. Guy Ritchie handled it with a simplicity and innocence that is hard to find in modern films where everything is so contrived that you can almost see the seams holding it together. He gave us a complete love story that thoroughly dissects the art of falling in love from the first gaze to the bitter end. He added light touches of humor in just the right doses and kept the film at a useful moderate length.Adriano Gianini was adequate in his role. At times he over-acted but there were other times when his smile said it all and I agree that Madonna's acting was workman-like at best.My advice is forget about the whole Mr. Madonna tag that's been placed on Mr. Ritchie, forget that Madonna is just another female musician trying to enlarge her slice of the entertainment pie, forget ALL those bad reviews and see this film again for it is a gem! And a hidden one at that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swept Away the movie.. not MADONNA in SWEPT AWAY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film as a whole is thought provoking and challenges our thinking. It also, at times, disturbingly and uncomfortably a mirror image to what we are as a society which values material stuff. The acting is good - the fact that some people cannot displace Madonna the STAR from the character is pathetic. I mean do we really "forget" that it's Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Laurence Olivier etc when we watch them on the screen? Really.. The ending is frustrating but again this is another side of the movie that I find challenging. It certainly does not deserve the negative press it received. It is an uncomfortable watch - but by no means due to the actors in it. The material is very mature and the issues and dialogue, although at times corny, ring true to the state of our capitalist world and our modern values that we place on ourselves.</fullReview>

I own a copy of Swept Away and I won't be parting with it because i'll be watching it over again. After reading some of the negative comments I felt compelled to give my opinion. Swept Away has a good solid plot and a great emotional ending. All of the acting was good including Madonna's performance. I don't know what people were expecting from Madonna. I am not Madonna's number 1 music fan and I doubt that I even own one of her songs so I believe my opinion is unbiased. Its time people judged this movie for its content instead of jumping on the Guy Ritchie/Madonna b**ch fest bandwagon. Madonna looked good and played her part well. The ending is screaming out for a sequel. Please Guy read my comment and act on it. Madonna's in great shape right now. I want to see more! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was automatically dismissed as terrible, no surprises considering that it starred Madonna, Queen of the Razzies and bad films. The problem with this film from the beginning was that Madonna was cast in the title role, therefore her 'kiss of death' was smacked on the film.However, I am a huge fan of Madonna and I give all of her work a chance. Which is why I wanted to comment on this film.Okay, the story is very clichd and as you may know it is a remake. But the ending to me was very surprising and almost a mini-twist because it does not take the typical 'Romance' film ending and this was probably the best part of the story.Okay, Madonna will not win an Oscar any day soon, but her acting is not that bad, however her co-star steals the show. If you have seen Evita then you'll know that Madonna is good at playing herself, however her character in this film almost ridicules her real-life persona, which gives us a bit of a giggle.By far the best thing about this film is the beautiful scenery, it is worth watching just for that. Let us not forget that Guy Ritchie can be a very talented director and it shows in this film.What I am trying to say is give this film a chance, if you do not like it afterwards then fair enough!

		<fullReview>I would like to say that it's a great movie, but it's not. It's a great film. It's an artistic piece, and although the story is not the most well-written, it's a very enjoyable film. I loved the directing, and the cinematography. I think also, the editing was very well done, in a way that just goes to prove that they had more fun in post-production with the end results, than actually filming.I would also like to say that the performances are good, but they're nothing special. The two main characters, are obviously not meant for each other, and so it's a bit hard to picture them together. However, I enjoyed it greatly. There is some realism to it, although not a great deal of it. Madonna's character could have been played by many others, but since her husband directed it, it's quite obvious why she won the role. And, although the reviews on this were not very good, I still recommend it. It's the type of movie, you have to be a film connoisseur to really enjoy, and it does have an emotional element to it, that cannot be denied.For the kind of film that it is, I was impressed, and I would definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Rich, Spoiled Woman (Madonna) and a handsome Italian fisherman (Adriano Gianini) find themselves stranded on a Mediterranean Island Paradise. It's a island, where things of power and class are meaningless. At first, they truly deeply hate each other until there's differences come to a stop. They are suddenly are attracted to each other.Directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock ? Two Smoking Barrels) made a watchable sometimes funny romance film that is interesting to look at. Alex Barber's cinematography is the highlight of the movie. The film has some good moments but moments of mean-spirited, some viewers will be turned off. This is a Remake of the 1974 film, directed by Lina Mertmuller.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an terrific-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has 16 Deleted Scenes with/without commentary, theatrical trailers but the DVD best feature is the Jokey 20 Minute Featurette of Swept Awat is the most entertaining. Even Funnier than the Movie! The film isn't as bad as you might think. It was a Box Office Disappointment. The Film will survive on DVD. The Film is a Curio at Best. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

The first 30 minutes has a corny comedy feel and Madonna plays herself very well but the film deteriorates rapidly into a clumsy combination of mock-seriousness and soft-focus romance. The film reveals Madonna and Guy Ritchie's lack of focus and the project is narcissistic as a result. It's funny, though, in parts and Madonna has a touch of comic timing in the first part, but her attempts at serious acting fall flat. Ritchie's limp direction doesn't help, but at least he tried to make a non-gangster film. Best to watch the Italian original.</fullReview>

She DOES look bad, except in the musical scene. But like, she is supposed to be stranded at sea so therefore she can't exactly go touch herself up in the mirror every 5 minutes...get it? Otherwise, its a cute film to see with your significant other. Its nowhere near as bad as you may have heard. There may be even a little bit of a message at the end.

		<fullReview>*Spoilers*I am obviously in the minority having read the other comments, I really didn't think that this film was THAT bad. It is fluffy and enjoyable and the two leads are sexy and watchable. If it wasn't a Madonna film it would not have been panned and would have happily had a UK box office release, its certainly better than that similar castaway thing with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche!I think that is is unfair that Madonna is taking the flack for what doesn't work about this film as this is mostly elements of the plot and the direction. IN the first section on board the boat trademark Guy Ritchie direction was noticeable but annoying. I don't know where Guy goes from here - to be honest the film would have been better if he'd played it straight as the style of his direction after his first 2 films and a batch of "me to's" is starting to look tired. Madonna however looked great and was fairly believable as the bitchy socialite. I struggled however to develop any feelings for the Guiseppe character at this stage, he was too 'bufoonish'. There was no real tension or great build up to the 'shipwrecking' and I remember being shocked when Madonna complained that there was no cell phone - 20 minutes into the film and I still thought it was being set in the seventies!Unlike other 'castaway movies' you never felt any real concern for the survival of the characters but I much preferred the direction of this section of the film. The Guiseppe character starts to come into his own and despite the lack of chemistry with Amber is very sexy. The sex scenes ARE genuinely awful however (what was WITH those white boxer shorts?) I felt embarrassed for the cast as it was obvious that neither could let themselves go with Madonnas husband looking on!By the end of the castaway section and the return to Sardinia I really felt that the film was starting to work but what a pity about the ending, stylish but disappointing. Not much point in a romantic comedy with a tragic ending and since it isn't set in the seventies, why couldn't he just have sent her a text message after she took off!!!On the plus side the cinematography is great,(blue sea an even bluer eyes) I was fascinated by Madonnas wierd stringy muscles and thought that Guiseppe was much sexier than Guy - but then maybe that's why he wasn't allowed to take his pants off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually...not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adriano Giannini is the main reason to see this film. He is definitely his father's son, a strapping hunk of beefcake with real screen presence. Unfortunately, I've never seen his father's original performance so I can't compare the two but this flick worked for me as watchable entertainment. I also admit to being a fan of Madonna...'s music; her acting has improved quite a bit over the years and she was sufficiently compelling by picture's end. And who did not get a kick out of seeing her being slapped around comeuppance-wise? She plays [i]such[/i] a bitch in this picture!! The only scene which disturbed me was a sexual advance made upon her which was filmed a bit too erotically. Her husband Guy Ritchie does prove to be a decent director; this isn't like Rita Tushingham's "comeback" a few years ago under the helm of her talentless director hubby. The setting is primarily an abandoned Greek island so rustically beautiful that "Swept Away" doubles as a lovely travelogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie on DVD and i must admit .. I kinda liked it!! I am generally not a Madonna fan and I consider her like any other pop singer with a lot of nice hits but not more. I am usually rather very hard critic but there is something nice and attractive about this movie.. I can imagine that it is not the kind of movie I would like to see in a Cinema.. It is rather a nice entertaining for a nice cosy evening.I think that the acting was GREAT.. Madonna did her role as a snoopy upper class know it all rich woman very good.. and Adrianno Giannini in the role of Pepe did a great job as well. The music is gorgeous and if u ever have been to Greece you will understand why this music simply reflects the Mediterranean atmosphere in a fantastic descriptive manner. The plot has some weakness though and I believe it would have been much better at some points. There should have been more ? well I don't know exactly but I think that while it took too long to to present the first part of the story (the rich snoopy woman and the poor fisherman) the second - and interesting- part was somehow shorter.. I think it should have been more intense and dramatic.. the love scenes (if there were any) were a little bit weird.. (with clothes on!!!) and seems unoriginal?. By the way.. I agree with other Imdb users that it is somehow uneasy to watch Madonna muscular body.. I don't know why but it is not rather common that women have well lined muscles.. it is kinda bizarre in a way.. but in general I liked it. It wont be everyone's favourite.. but people who like romantic will find it interesting..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to be very honest. I thought the film was not going to be very good. Especially since it did not do well at the movies and the critics tore it apart. However, I decided to watch the film because I am a die hard Madonna fan. The beginning of the film was kind of bad. However, thank goodness that I continued watching for the scenes on the island. The interaction on the island was great. I believe it is the best part of the film except for the ending. The film did put tears in my eyes. On my rating scale, any romantic film that can put tears in my eyes is really good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVED the original film, and this is a very decent replication of it. It does lack some of the magic of the original, but all-in-all, it's just not the ATROCITY people make it out to be. I think its lackluster reviews are due mainly to people's expectations for it, and lack of experience with the ORIGINAL movie. It's like comparing spin-off and copy-cat TV shows to the original - the spinoffs and copycats are slightly different, and usually a bit inferior, but still good. 1. You must see the original before seeing this one. 2. You must watch the original, and this one, all the way through. Some parts of the film can be hard to take, and you have to make it through those, all the way to the end, to really appreciate it. 3. This is not a pleasant blockbuster joyride, and if you go in expecting that, you are going to be disappointed. The movie is built upon strong philosophical and ideological undertones, some of which may be hard for modern women to swallow (myself included!!). Some of the nuances of the original are lost in Madonna's rendition and the fact that many modern viewers are out-of-tune with the Cold War/Communism discussions of the original's time period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely surprised by this really potent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, it will not win anyone an academy awards (though those awards are rarely representative of the quality of movies, especially outside of the US), but I must say I was completely surprised by SWEPT AWAY. It had not been screened out of the US and went out straight onto DVD, which could have hinted something horrific. And it so happens that it is not bad at all. Even good indeed. Direction is good. Not Ritchie at his best but good. And Madonna is surprisingly potent. The movie was overall a nice experience. For the record, I wish those purists and ultimate critics that gave their 'comments' on the site would refrain from being so narrow-minded. My arts teachers always told me to never say that a painting (or movie for that matter) is not beautiful, but rather that I do not like it. Anyhow, Swept Away made my day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most common comment to this movie seems to be 'it is not that bad as you may think'. People seem to associate Madonna with bad acting, or even worse - bad movies. This is not the case. The film is a remake of an Italian film in the 70s, which I remember as having been much better, placing on a desert answer a spoiled mid-age rich woman and a poor younger fisherman. Class and sexual relations change drastically, as you may expect. The movie is not bad, it is just average, not too funny, and not too dramatical. Madonna is actually good, doing her best acting in my memory, and if the character was not that exagerated in the first third of the movie it could have been her first good role. Even such, the film - without being a masterpiece - is average, scrapping the border of being acceptable. 6/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So what did you expect??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a guy like Ritchie who has become an overnight sensation with a couple of silly pulp cinema pop hits and put him in the director's chair behind a story requiring an understanding of human nature and mature insights into man/woman love and did you really expect a winner? Well, "Swept Away 2002" is just as bad a the critics say and not worth the time. However, if you want to see just how bad it is, you can double time through it by speed reading the closed captions, slowing down to get the gist here and there, and make it from beginning to end in less than 30 minutes. For those who are into the somewhat worn theme of a man and woman marooned on a desert isle, the original "Swept Away" by Lina Wertmller (circa 1974) is worth a look. Good luck finding it.

		<shortDescription>1 OF MADONNA'S BEST MOVIES, NO MATTER WHO TELLS U OTHERWISE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Swept Away is definitely one of Madonna's best movies. She's perfect in the role, and she seems to have really enjoyed it. She proves that, yes, she can act, and she also can make you laugh and cry. I found the movie enjoyable from start to finish. I don't know what the critics were complaining about. True, not every critic hated the movie, but enough did, and the bad publicity more than overshadowed the good. The movie makes very good use of its one and a half hours, and it goes along smoothly. I was expecting it to be longer and would not have minded one bit if it had been. I did not enjoy this movie ONLY because I am a Madonna fan; I enjoyed it because it is a genuinely good movie. I have seen it twice already and will see it many more times. I highly recommend Swept Away. Give it a chance. And give Madonna a chance, too. She deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film lacks edge of original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film full expecting to hate it but I have to admit that its no where near as bad as some are saying. But the film lacks punch, and the original had plenty. I didn't think Madonna was bad in the film at all and you can make a case that its one of her better jobs of acting but the problem is where the focus of the story is pointing. The original film was making a bold statement about politics, classes and sexes but in this version director Guy Ritchie decided to go the easy route and make a romantic adventure film without any real edge. Adriano Giannini is cast in his fathers role and its hard to tell how good of an actor he is. His father Giancarlo is a magnificent actor who has the ability of communicating thoughts and feelings without uttering a word. He does it with his eyes! One of the most expressionistic faces in cinema history. His son is not like that and we shouldn't expect him to be. He has to rely on the material given him and this is just a watered down version of a much better film. Madonna still has a good body for a woman in her 40's but the close-up shots of her are suggesting she is getting older, and in one good scene she talks of competing with younger women. This was one of the very few interesting and revealing scenes. Watching Giannini take charge and boss around the spoiled Madonna I couldn't help but think that her marriage to Sean Penn may have been reminiscent of this. Its not a bad looking film and Madonna gives a better than expected performance but the whole story lacks guts and conviction of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swept away, wrongly swept under the carpet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK OK, it's no 'snatch' nor is it 'lock stock'. First of all, well done to Guy Ritchie for breaking potential typecasting! Do we really want a director that only directs the same genre of movie over and over? Granted they are great movies, but how about some respect for having the guts to go out on a limb? This movie was doomed to fail before it was even finished. The ironic thing is that people (and reviewers) went to see it knowing that it wasn't going to be another 'snatch' type movie and then slandered the hell out of it for not being so! Swept away is actually a decent movie with a lot of interesting and talented aspects to it.There is no question about Guy selling out! Come on people, Yes Madonna is the lead actress - that's about as far as it goes. Madonna generally is a pretty crap actress but she proved that she has the goods when you watch 'Evita'. Madonna's character wasn't sugar coated into a likable character at all, if anything - the opposite: She looks every one of her 70 years, she's a detestable rich bitch prima donna and she does nothing to neither endear herself to audiences nor deter the pre-emptive attacks on her own personal character and acting abilities. She seems to revel in the opportunity to poke fun at herself and how her acting is portrayed and the entire elitist lifestyle. Her role in this movie is one that is subjected to slapping, pushing, verbal abuse and other indignities, plus Madonna herself endures many hours of working in water -which is well known to be a very trying and physically exhausting place to be conducting a movie! So Kudos to ol' Madge for throwing herself into a role which you'd never expect her to do.The first thing that caught me with this movie is that it has a slight gritty cinematography to it - far from polished. There's a raw edgy essence in the visuals. The characters stand out in unflattering crystal clear lenses, and once the dialogue kicks in, it's even more unflattering to the characters. No one comes across as particularly likable (again, another gutsy element). I found the humour to be fantastic, it's very tongue in cheek and light hearted. Guy makes it clear from the start that this is not going to be a life changing cult movie of epic proportions. Rather it's something that has been done for fun, for a change, to explore the more enjoyable genre of an offbeat rom/com. You can 'feel' that the crew were having fun in the making of this, it reflects in the movie...So where are we? It has gritty camera work, unlikable characters, a generally detested lead actress and not a whole lot of substance or style - yet it works! The plot is weak and predictable yet it's the details that make this entertaining. Even the most hardened Madonna hater will be secretly giggling at her lines which are reminiscent of old school skit humour. Once Swept away reaches its pivotal point of the enemies on the deserted island scenario is when the real acting and script is pressured into credibility. In my opinion it succeeds admirably with only one or two moments of cringing... These primarily being when Madonnas acting is solely trying to hold the movie up in a crucial emotion based scene and a game of charades (yes that scene was beyond awful). Believe it or not though, they pull it off. There IS believable sexual chemistry, Madonna becomes endearing (somewhat) and it's a thoroughly flirty, fluffy and fun movie for the next 30-40 minutes or so. This is an amazing feat considering the first portion of the movie deliberately portrayed them to be unlikable and we all had doubts as to whether or not the acting would be able to achieve this. And before you know it, the very 'unhollywood' climactic finale arrives. These lead actors did this film justice! No soppy, sappy, gagging ending here, which was brilliant.So forget the minor plot holes, forget the moments where the acting could have been better, forget the tired and predictable plot and forget that YOU WANTED another typical Guy Ritchie movie. Pay attention to the subtle humour, the interesting cinematography, the almost haunting musical score, the talent in not relying on special effects and fancy wardrobe crews, the way the entire crew took a movie that looked atrocious on paper and injected a breath of refreshing originality into it. And if all else fails just remember that Madonna gets slapped, kicked, slandered and basically humiliated in it :)By the way, the special features on the DVD are surprisingly honest and candid - worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film was actually very, very good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get it! Everyone seems to hate this movie! Now, let me say this: I tuned into this movie expecting to hate it. I wanted to have a laugh at Madonna's expense, just like everyone else. But then, something unexpected happened. Madonna actually had MY ass...you see, I really began to like this movie. I think that Madonna does perhaps her finest acting in this film, and I am not being sarcastic. I am aware that she has put forth her share of wooden performances. I mean, some of her films have been downright awful, and they suffered because of her inability to emote. But in this film, her husband (director Guy Ritchie, for those of you who live under a rock) manages to coax a real, flesh and blood human being out of her. He is able to achieve what many directors, save for possibly Abel Ferrara, haven't been able to do, and that is to make us forget for two hours that we are watching MADONNA. She melts into this character, and in doing so, I believed that she was a person other than MADONNA the celebrity. Good for Mr. and Mrs. Ritchie. I think that this film was fantastic, and I was very moved by it. I also think that Guy Ritchie's directorial style is brilliant, but that is not exactly a new phenomenon. But the discovery of Madonna's acting ability was the true gem here. Wow! Great story (even if it WAS a remake), great music, great mood, and wonderful casting if you ask me. I could have done without the other nondescript socialites on the yacht in the beginning of the film, but I understand that they were there merely for exposition.I hope that more people will give this film a chance. Even I was initially hoping to hate it, and be able to rip it to shreds, as many other people had. But I have discovered a wonderful film in the process, and I am so glad that Madonna proved me wrong this time!</fullReview>

They are attended by a captain (Yorgo Voyagis) and servants (Adriano Giannini , he plays the role that his father, Giancarlo Giannini, played in the original movie) who are treated with humiliation . Madonna and Adriano Giannini are shipwrecked and stranded on a deserted island and the complications emerge .The pic blends comedy , humor with tongue in check , giggles , spectacular outdoors and results to be quite amusing but silly . The picture received awful reviews , although isn't a good film , it doesn't deserves the complete despise because there are amount of chuckles and the love story is touching . Interpretation by Adriano Giannini is likeness to his father (Giancarlo) ,he seems a similar copy (besides , being a remake to a Lina Wertmueller's film with his daddy). Madonna has a mediocre acting but appears herself more than fifty and some years old . Cinematography by Alex Barber is spellbound , the natural and wonderful island landscapes are colorful and glimmer . Music by Michael Colombier is jolly and agreeable . Direction by Guy Ritchie was regularly made . The US opening of the movie was so poor, and the movie was so badly received that it went straight to video in the UK, director Guy Ritchie's home country. This is Guy Ritchie's third collaboration with his ex-wife, Madonna, after her , uncredited, turn in the BMW short film, Star (2001), and the music video "What It Feels Like for a Girl" (2001) . Nobody understand as after realization some good movies such as Snatch and Locks , Stocks and two smoking barrels Guy directed this film such different to previous , but satisfying her wife Madonna . The yarn obtained lukewarm reception by the public ,as the plot is a bit ridiculous and embarrassing and the movie was a real flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Swept Away" - was written and directed by Guy Ritchie, starred Madonna and Adriano Gianini and based on "Swept Away...by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August" (1974), directed by Lina Wertmuller with Giancarlo Gianini playing the same role as his son 28 years later. This is a story of class and sexual struggle between a man and woman stranded on a desert island. Madonna plays Amber Leighton, the arrogant wife of a rich American pharmaceutical mogul (Bruce Greenwood) who travels on a private yacht from Greece to Italy with friends. Her constant bitching annoys a first-mate Giuseppe Esposito... (Andriano Giannini) I cannot believe that the same Guy who is behind stylish, energetic, funny, and full of wonderful tunes and interesting characters "Snatch" made it. Acting made me and my husband cringe dozens of times. The story, the dialogs, and the scenes between two main characters on the island were gross and tasteless. There were only three redeeming values about the movie. First, the beginning was kind of funny with Madonna playing the arrogant uber-bitch and I don't think it was too big of a stretch for her (I may be wrong). Second, deserted island and beach somewhere in Mediterranean sparkle. Third, and most important, the whole thing was only 89 minutes long. 1.5/10 - TV, first (and last) viewing</fullReview>

The actors are very good and very believable, the movie obviously totally different to anything Guy Ritchie has done before, but it was fascinating how he handled the change from gangster violence to the violence portrayed in this movie. At the same time it was interesting to see the relationship between the two leads devolop. As others have commented the ending was very emotional, and it would have been better if more time was given to the characters to explore their relationship.But after watching the movie from beginning to end I found no moments that made me uncomfortable or even boring, I would highly recommend this movie.If you don't want to take my word for it, watch it and judge for yourself...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed this movie during its release. Never heard of it until just now, 14 years later. Watched it on a retro channel on a Sunday afternoon.I never write reviews on movies, products, anything. But I have to say, after visiting the IMDb site to follow-up with some of the details, I am surprised at the low ratings and negative reviews. Thus, I speak.I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. I wonder what was different in my viewing and assessment than those of the harsh reviews that were written over a decade ago. I think it may have to do with the tension and emotional wounds so wide-spread during that time. People really did have a need to throw punches at almost anything and everything during those days.It thought Madonna was definitely the highlight. I enjoyed both actors, but she looked good and played the role exceptionally well. Her age was a factor in the script.I remember seeing her volunteering to sing for a relief benefit subsequent to the Sri Lanka disaster. If I remember correctly, that was a couple of years after Swept Away was released. I had not seen much of her since the 80's and 90's (back in the MTV funnel breasts video days, which I thought was cute), but whenever I saw her sing for that benefit I was so very impressed. She looked and sounded greater than ever. That's the way I saw her in the movie.There are some people whose looks and skills continually progress without climax. Madonna is one of those.</fullReview>

Actually, Elisabeth Banks is the one who can't act. But Madonna gets the job done. I thought she was brilliant in this movie. I have seen some of her movies, and didn't really like any of them, except for this one.I thought the whole "Giuseppe in charge" situation was a bit over the top (the situation itself, not the acting), especially when he assaults her, but, other than that, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie.If nothing else, it's worth seeing just for the scenery, and, for me, the gorgeous and charismatic Jeanne Tripplehorn, who, in my opinion, is majorly underrated as an actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swept Away (2002) * (out of 4) Guy Richie's remake of the 1974 classic has Madonna playing the rich woman who finds herself on a deserted island with a poor Italian farmer (Adriano Giannini) who decides to turn the tables and teach her what it really means to be a worker. SWEPT AWAY got killed by the critics and often times I think critic and fans are too harsh on remakes. It seems that most of the time the remake is just beaten to death simply because it dared to remake a great film. This here is in no way, shape or form better than the original. We can just throw that out right now and there's no question that there's not a single thing here better than the previous film. With that out of the way, there's also no question that we're left with a really bad movie. It seems a lot of people want to blame Madonna for the film's disastrous quality but she only deserves part of the blame. The majority has to go to her then husband Richie who doesn't do anything right here. Everything feels rushed. The movie has no laughs or romance. Nothing that happens is believable. The entire picture just has a rather cheap feel to it. There's nothing here that works in regards to the technical stuff. The only thing that saves this from being a complete bomb is the performance by Giannini who is the son of the actor who played the same part in the original. He's certainly not as good as daddy but I thought he was very much watchable and at least gave it his all. The performance would have been greatly used in a better movie but sadly everything around him is just bad. This includes the performance by Madonna. Who knows why she even thought she could do anything with this role but she's not believable when she's being the mean rich woman and she's not believable in any form that this character changes into. The two just don't have any chemistry together but a lot of the blame here can go towards the director and screenplay. There's some nice visuals but a monkey could put a camera in a beautiful location and it would still look great. SWEPT AWAY is a really bad movie but at the same time it's bad enough to where fans of bad movies should at least get a kick out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a good story. I actually let go of the fact that it starred Madonna. Who cares, she's cute and makes a good bitch. But its the scene and story that I liked. It was not predictable, it did not take place in NY or la, so that right there won my time. It makes you realize the beauty that being grounded has to offer. Some reviews on here stated viewers watched 10 - 30 minutes. Well, u have to give this one a little more time. Its not bad, a good chick flick to watch without hubby. Viewers here did not get the fact that they lost each other due to the husband knowing and interfering. Thats why it was sad. Its like these people gave up and didn't even watch the end.... Hello, if your confused, don't blame Ritchie, rewind it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie on TV, about 9 years after its release. I liked this movie. I didn't think Madonna was that bad. I actually thought she did a good job of portraying a horrible, uncaring, selfish person. Her transformation at the end was believable, but I would have liked more back story on why she was the way she was. Just because a person is rich doesn't mean that they treat everyone like dirt and have no manners. Her husband, for example, was polite to the crew. I also think that if the story had had a happy ending it would have been more popular in the US. It reminded me a little bit of "Titanic:" a rich girl falling in love with a penniless artist. Would Rose get off the boat with Cal or with Jack? In "Swept Away:" a rich woman falling in love with a penniless fisherman. Would Amber get on the helicopter or stay with Pepe? When Rose picked Jack, we were happy even though Jack died. When Amber doesn't pick Pepe, though not her fault, it is too sad and unsatisfying. I am trying to imagine if they reconnect in the future, but the movie ending doesn't leave much to hope for. I am unfamiliar with the original movie, so I cannot compare. This movie would be good to watch on a cold Winter night with hot tea or a toddy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that most of the reviewers were harsh on the movie and need to open their minds more instead of run with the flocks on this one. I really enjoyed this version of Swept Away--but I need to preface that with you must be in an easy going mood to relax and let go of all judgment and just be prepared for a good time observing the characters for this type of movie - I thought Madonna did a good job of being a spoiled socialite albeit sometimes over the top--but that was part of the comedy of it all in the first place--and she actually does show some range--the Italian fisherman character is also over-acting which I think is part of the comedy--However; it is the amazing last part of the movie that was MOST profound and surprising for me - and would be appreciated MORE by those who have been in a similar situation in their lives. It was a good thought provoking movie on love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as critics would have you believe this film was a capital crime for Guy Ritchie and Madonna, it wasn't. On the other hand, it also wasn't a sterling example of either star's full abilities. What it end up being was a lukewarm "remake" of a much more effective film in terms of sociology and human behavior in survival conditions - Lina Wertmller's original, "Swept Away... by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August."Countless reviewers have already expounded on the deficits of this film, so I'll focus on the lesser-known, positive attributes. I'll spare you the plot synopsis as you can read that in the film details.First of all, Madonna is believable (and rather comedic) playing the spoiled and acidic Amber. Guy Ritchie has stated that he believe audiences are accepting of Madonna in this characterization, and he's right because we all think she's like that in reality. As she travels through her arc to become a more compassionate person we lose that element of belief but there are moments when her transformation seems real.When she is playing Charades with Peppe (Adriano Giannini) there is a real warmth in her personality. She seems spontaneous and genuine. There is also a fantastic scene (probably the best in the film), where the two lovers (I'm talking Amber and Peppe here) seem to levitate into the sunset sky thanks to some clever camera work. The music selection is perfect - Mazzey Star's "Fade Into You" - and the wonderment in Madonna's eyes through her funny star-shaped sunglasses is a truly moving cinematic moment.To Guy Ritchie's credit, the production quality of the film isn't bad although it's obviously less gritty than his crime caper work. The cinematography and opening credits are clean and quite beautiful. The pop music selection is excellent (as usual for him) and once in a while he captures a great shot of the wife rollicking on diamond-white sands or wading in cerulean Mediterranean tides.The film's ending is a sad one and in more ways than than one. Madonna's talent for appearing "vulnerable and abandoned" is definitely lacking here (where is Juan Peron when you need him), and it is this transparency that seems to surgically remove most of the film's heart. It's a shame too because if she could've mustered the skills to be believably depressed, the other half of the film's circle would've been filled in nicely.This was far from the worst film of 2002, and in that regard I believe Mr. and Mrs. Ritchie got a raw deal. However, I believe it would be naive of them to think that this project was a good amalgam of their respective talents.</fullReview>

The performance of Madonna is very good, it's directed in pure Ritchie style, it even includes few unrealistic scenes, which adds a movie a bit of artistic note. The only thing that bothers me, is a quick turn from a well- positioned selfish bitch into a romantic -lust for love - wannabe. But the end scene makes it all worthwhile watching. All in all it's not a movie for my collection, but also there's nothing really wrong with it. It' s a movie with no extras, but a nice one to watch on a gloomy afternoon.

		<fullReview>I caught this film after the beginning and only gave it half a chance once I saw Madonna. Slowly but surely the film snowballed into a very sad love story that at the end showed Madonna's ability to act.She goes from flat to round and we see a very convincing character portrayal of a rich out of control woman who feels she is entitled to everything. What the plot does is put her in a position where she must change and she does, a little painfully. I think the story is truly timeless. You even get the sense Ulysses could have had the same fate. There were also a lot of interesting shots. The scenery in the film is beautiful and Madonna is in awesome shape. Also, the film is a subtle commentary on how sad feminist-entitlelist thought really is in American women these days. Women must see this film to see the power of nature and what self deception they practice when entitleling themselves to everything. If you're looking for a romantic comedy with serious undertones see this movie--its not for Julia Roberts' lightweights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... not least because all the naysayers appear to have gone after the wrong person! Actually, I have nothing against Richie's direction most of the time here; but after being just the tiniest bit bemused by the scale of "Lock, Stock's" success [6], and suffering through the abominable "Snatch" [1] (see my review elsewhere), at least the drubbing this film got has deservedly taken him down a peg or two...After watching this, though, I'm honestly puzzled as to why this was so badly mauled when "Snatch" was praised to the skies. Actually, no I'm not. Lets face it - it's Madonna; and deriding her film career seems to be the general-relaxation hobby of those paid to publish their opinions. I think if it'd've had Jeanne Tripplehorne in the lead-role and Madonna nowhere in sight, although the notices may still not have been glowing; the movie wouldn't have been yanked from theaters so gracelessly at least. Like I said, I'll cut Richie some slack for this, but for mercy's sake; if you're gonna go after someone so viciously, please make it HIM next time! Attacking Madonna's acting may have decent grounds, but the derision is notwithstanding disproportionate, and it isn't even sport anymore, really; I'm thinking that the public by-and-large got the message after "Shanghai Surprise"... !This'd make my 'desert island list' over "Snatch", anyday! As underwhelming as Madge may certainly be, her opposite lead Adriano Giannini turns in a good performance despite severely confusing script-motivations, at times. So "The Material Girl" is no great shakes as an actress - it's old news! Most harping commentators should either make more of an effort to come up with criticism that doesn't involve Madonna, or else pipe down some! By my own admission, the supplementary glitches are easily there to be found; but I'll leave people to make their own comebacks - that is, if the bandwagon of popular opinion hasn't already left them floundering in the sand; 'swept away' on a tidal-wave of hysteria far more reactionary than anything the film itself has to offer! (... and like I said, the elements ARE there... )5/10, or ***/***** in profile ratings system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that in the first place I saw this movie on DVD based on my curiosity to see how bad this film is, after multiple terrible reviews by almost every single review I read.But also to admit, I am quite surprised that I found that this movie is indeed a movie worth watching for. Guy offered you comedy, romance and tragedy all mix in one stylish way, and that for sure is intriguing of which I believe not every director is capable of doing. Despite I agree of it not being one of an all time favorite, but still I can't believe that this movie got a 3+ rating at IMDb. This one kinda reminds me the same case happened to Travolta's "Battlefield Earth", There must be some other reasons why people are disliking it and giving away bad reviews subjectively. Is it because the love story is not believable? I've seen worse unbelievable story. Is it because Madonna is so miscast? I've seen much worse casting and acting. So It's so kind of pity to see how many people just jump right into a bad conclusion before even giving it a fair view. All and all if you hate it all along...you still got to at least give some credits to the cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, i am a Madonna fan. No, i dont think she is a great actress. However, I feel Madonna has received unfair treatment for this movie. She carries the film rather well at portraying a snobby socialite who after days of dishing verbal/physical abuse at the hands of her yachts helpful/modest sailor,has to succumb to the same abuse thrusted upon her.The first half hour is Madonna at her most annoying! How cruel can somebody be? You pray for either a back-hand or a muzzle! Wait a minute,this is what she is suppose to be! MADONNA'S "ACTING" has brought out an emotion! OK now moving along, a big storm/shipwreck scene in which Madonna and the sailor guy are stranded on a remote island, gets the movie and Madonna into high gear! Realizing that she most depend on the sailors skills to survive(food,campfire,stc.)She becomes the vulnerable yet likable new person! A love/lust relationship develops (featuring an awesome song/dance fantasy number by Madonna) and the two eventually fall for each other. A big rescue arrives and the 2 go off back to their accustomed lifestyles.Madonna does a fine job at portraying her characters new found outlook. The film concludes with a rather surprising ending! In closing i feel this movie was rather entertaining and Madonna does have a decent acting ability. Give it a chance!</fullReview>

This has to be an enormously easy acting stretch for such a dedicated thesp as Madonna, who, it pains me to say, shed her own dominant personality for a nano-second and became her character. If you blinked you missed it, but there is a bit of a performance there, somewhere. Her co-stars are all better, though, even her fellow castaway, who's awful. They both get numerous chances for humiliation, cause there's very little of an actual movie here. All the points are made in the first ten minutes. I liked Ritchie's "Snatch" a lot but it is sad he sunk to make this just cauae he happens to be married to the leading lady. Didn't he see her other movies? Does being married to an aging superstar mean you lose all objectivity? These are yhe real questions the movie inspires you to ask. You don't even get needless nudity and sex scenes! What a gyp!! 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake was a limp vanity project. The brilliance of the original film was that underneath the bitchy and proletarian exteriors you had two people who were drawn to each other in a twisted and masochistic way (but hey, that's life sometimes). The problem with casting Madonna in this version wasn't that she can't act (who cares?) but she's too freaking old. Madonna and Richie might have considered this a tongue in cheek project (she's older, their relationship is reputed to have tempestuous moments) but a celebrity marriage is not stuff which makes for great political satire. If this film hadd the honesty of Wurtmuller's original Mr. Hunky Italian Guy would have spent his time fishing for lobsters while Ms. Over the Hill rationalized his lack of interest. Yawn. Sadly, this movie probably destroys the chance for a true remake. Those who don't think this was possible aren't being creative. Imagine two twentysomething Americans shipwrecked in the Carribean. She's a Jewish American Princess from Long Island. He's a black wannabe hip hopper from Harlem. This could have had the fire, humor, and relevance of the original. This remake, by comparison, is gutless.</fullReview>

Ritchie's tone was angular and edgy, the characterization of the miserable rich Americans on holiday tart, and you could tell Madonna was sinking her teeth into the role of mega-maintenance Amber, letting it rip acting-wise. Bitchin'! Nice to see her trusting a director. She's frickin' beautiful too, harsh island lighting notwithstanding: Guy Ritchie is just somehow not a vaseline-on-the-lens kinda director, ok people?

		<shortDescription>One of the Biggest Surprises of the Year...Yes, It's a Good Thing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a friend recently lent me the opportunity to attend an early morning trade screening just outside of Boston of the Guy Ritchie/Madonna remake of `Swept Away', I was more than a bit skeptical. I truly believe that Madonna could be the greatest actress in the world with the proper training and direction. However, I couldn't predict ANYONE being able to top Mariangela Melato's superb work in Lina Wertmueller's 1974 original, and if Madonna failed to do so, we all know this would mean another opportunity for critics and cynics and everyone outside of her camp to hound on her acting and wobbly film career.I started watching the film, and before long my fears were...dispelled. Yes, it's true, Guy Ritchie's "Swept Away" really is a good movie. In it, Madonna plays a rich, vitriolic socialite named Amber, and Adriano Giannini plays a poor, bitter sailor named Giuseppe. I'm not going to bother spilling the plot itself, because most of you know it anyway, and frankly, it sounds pretty stupid: the idea of a rich woman and a poor man trapped together on an island seemed stale when the original hit screens in 1974, and it's infinitely more tired some three decades later. But what makes both films work so well is the complexity of these two characters, and the notion that the confines of society, as opposed to innate human nature, may be the reason for human frailty. Neither character is particularly appealing alone, but together they spark in each other a sense of passion and intense sexuality that is rarely seen in conventional Hollywood love stories.The film stays surprisingly faithful to the source material, despite my early fears to the contrary. The much talked about "Come-On-A-My-House" sequence was certainly not even hinted at in the original. And the biggest omission (an unwise removal, in my opinion) is the original's famous sodomy scene. It would have been great to see Madonna's take on this most erotic of film sequences, but I'm guessing that this had more to do with husband Guy Ritchie's own uncomforability than anything else. This is a shame, because this is a great scene to begin with, and wouldn't it be nice to harken back to the days of unrestrained, borderline pornographic sex onscreen? Sigh.For the most part, though, I was surprised at how well Guy Ritchie adhered to the original film, and I commend him for it. Furthermore, he has not been bitten by the "Americanization" bug in translating the film to a new generation; in other words, the sumptuous characterizations of the first film are not simplified to appeal to contemporary, dare I say less intelligent, audiences. The lengthy discourses on Communism versus Capitalism have been toned down, but the clashing of ideals is still ever present enough, and this alteration is actually justifiable considering the vastly different sociopolitical climate of today versus Italy in the 1970s.As some one who was never very interested by Mr. Ritchie's film work in the past, I have to admit to being converted after this movie; he struck me as far more talented, and capable of a greater deal of depth, than his first two films had led me to believe. Attempting to remake a classic film is hard enough, but attempting to remake a classic European film for an American film market is about five times more challenging. After years of lousy American remakes of great European films, I was happy to finally enjoy a solid translation.And yes folks, Madonna is very, very good. I won't say "excellent" or "brilliant", because it's not her very best work nor is it quite as dynamic as Ms. Melato, but she proves that she is a damn good actress capable of much more than she is often given credit for. One of the few problems that I had with the original film was the 180 degree turn in the Raffaela character on the island; it may have showed off Melato's range as an actress, but for the character, it did not feel entirely believable. Madonna &amp; Ritchie have ironed out this kink quite nicely, and Amber's "evolution" on the island is easier to swallow and ultimately much more impressive; it adds dimensions to both the character AND the actress that were not present in the first half of the film.Similarly impressive is Adriano Giannini, whose father, Giancarlo Giannini, played the same role in the original! Giannini Jr. is not quite as good an actor as Giannini Sr. (who headlined many of Wertmueller's best works), but he's some one to look out for. He's much more strapping than his father, and he also boasts a tangible sexual presence that should take him far. I hope that the bad press the film has already endured won't stilt his career, because I'd be very interested in seeing where this chap is headed in movieland.Michel Colombier's score is superb, and brilliantly showcases the emotional journey of these two characters. In fact, I found it so personally stirring that I was reminded at times of Michel Legrand's legendary music for "Summer of '42", and this is particularly true during the final minutes of the film; fans can rest assured that the scene at the telephone is damn near as heartbreaking this time around as it was in the original. I am too familiar with much of Colombier's work but I wouldn't be surprised if he earned the film's sole Oscar nomination.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised, and wholly satisfied, by Guy Ritchie's take on "Swept Away". True, it does not match up to Wertmueller's original, but that's understandable; hers was a great film, his is a very good film. I would heartily recommend seeing the original first, as it will surely enhance your viewing of the remake. However, Guy Ritchie has managed to put together a memorable, entertaining, and refreshingly unconventional film that can stand quite nicely on its own, and thus I enthusiastically recommend `Swept Away'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing wrong with this movie per se, except that it's a bit simple. Madonna's previous movie 'The Next Best Thing' (which is an unsalvageble wrong-headed trainwreck; and yes one of the worst movies ever made) and the hate that greeted Swept Away, persuaded me to avoid it. But surprisingly it's not so horrible, and the attacks on it were just so much piling on.I was entertained. I was distracted by the settings. I didn't ask much more. And once Adriano Giannini disrobes, he is extremely easy on the eyes.People have asked why Richie would make his wife look so bad? Well, because the character has a moment late in the movie, where she has to confide she's worried about aging. As for her shrill bitchery. If Madonna had pulled her punches, the character would never emerge from Madonna's lifetime of transgressions, which already overshadow the movie.I'm no Madonna fan, but she can act better than me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the ratings would indicate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie last night, I can see why the ratings were so bad. There are no car chases, explosions, and not a single shot fired, save the one from the flare gun. Sorely missed, were the excruciatingly annoying "fade-to-whites" and fast cuts that ensure that nothing stays on screen for more than a split second. I also missed the nauseating hand-held camera shots.What fools. They ought to have had at least one scene with Stallone oder der Schwarzenegger blasting away 4,000 rounds with a machine gun. And that ending! Could "Guido" not have shot that helicopter down with a LAWS rocket??? The producers of this film ought to have known that the leisurely pacing, and lack of any and all of the above would not penetrate the drug-induced haze of the audience. What were they thinking??? However, if you don't need the gratuitous violence, etc., and care anything at all about romance, you'll find this a pleasant way to spend an evening.This movie rates a solid 6.5 on the Richter scale.Nomad</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I got pushed into watching this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the WHOLE MOVIE. **With all the critics backlash and the star (Madonna) a box office Bomb (other than her role in Evita) I was upset I was going to sit through this one, but I am sure glad I did.I was wrong, this little piece of cinema is Great. The acting is on par, the scenery was great and the remake alone stood hands above the original.Give this one a shot. You just might go away scratching your head thinking "why haven't I seen this before now."Not an Academy Award wining movie but This version of "Swept Away", is NOT that bad!Enjoy this, as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nail in Madonna's Coffin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Madonna has two kinds of fans. The first fan loves her music and will spend money to purchase tapes of her songs. The second fan is a fan of her body. As the actress, Madonna has earned her fan base with her well known and seen assets. While she won her Golden Globe from the movie where she sang,(fans of her music) her most popular movie was Body of Evidence, (where her other fans saw a lot of her. In Swept Away, Madonna is neither acting as the Singer or the Body. She is simply acting, and her fans can't and won't buy that. Although the story has been recycled and the direction of the film doesn't draw you in, the movie would have been an overall success if they movie worked toward one of the two fan bases that Madonna has. Even at an old age, Madonna knows what her fans want. Swept Away did not offer her fans anything. With a number of song solos and some nudity (not brief), Swept Away would have made much more of a profit and had better overall reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget everything you have read about Swept Away. This movie is great! Madonna was, once again, unfairly raked over the coals. After all I had heard about this movie I wasn't sure what to expect but I was "Swept Away." Madonna gives one of her best performances. It's obvious that anyone giving her a negative review was going after her personally and not her acting. She delivers big time. The movie is both funny and touching and holds you to the bittersweet end. I suggest you give Swept Away a chance. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critics were spineless in their analysis of this movie. Typically, critics posture as examples of open-mindedness, but quickly turn hypocritical when a story takes a view contrary to their own brand of en-vogue political correctness.The media is perfectly willing to jump up and applaud dramatic material exploring social taboos ranging from child sex to four thousand different types of murder, but when it comes to exploring the raw and uninhibited relationship between a man and woman on a desert island, and the primal gender characteristics that evolve the relationship, they get scared and run for cover - because it does not promote their ever-chi chi uni-sexist agenda.While not the best made film of 2002, this movie was actually an interesting story with a powerful statement about society, love and relationships, and on its own, takes a radical and even liberal look at these critical elements of our everyday lives.In their run for cover, aside from directly and personally picking on Madonna and `her husband,' the socio-politically driven critics tended to haphazardly pick at various elements of the movie such as:The film appears washed out - in my analysis, with this, the director found he could evoke a mood in the audience utilizing this effect. The white wash look imposed a hot, desert like feel which created a dry distaste of the lives the aristocrats were living. It sets up an underlying melodramatic tone that exudes in Madonna's character and reflects the harshness of her current life. Utilizing non-standard film traits is consistent stylistically with other Guy Ritchie films.Madonna is too melodramatic - once again, intentional flavoring that adds contrast as her character arcs throughout the film. It also sets up the humor we find in her drastic transformation. It is only because she was a `super bitch' before that we can at first enjoy when the tables are turned. Our enjoyment, of course, quickly turns to concern when we feel that Giuseppe goes too far by our standards.Unintentional humor - perhaps the audience is laughing at the very right time, yet the intently politically correct critic is simply offended that the audience finds these moments funny.The plot is improbable - welcome to movie land. The majority of plots and stories in general are improbable.About half the critical reviews I read admitted the reviewer's real problem with the movie and positioned the subject matter as dated, antediluvian, archaic, etc. This reflects their own fear that the movie might allude to some uncomfortable truths about human nature.Swept Away simply, but brilliantly breaks two people down into their primal roles as a man and a woman. In the film, absent the rules of a structured society, the physically dominant man assumes a role as the hunter gatherer and uses/abuses this dominance to subordinate the female character that once tormented him. The woman, Amber, who had found her previous plastic life to be unsatisfying, falls dependant on Giuseppe and uncovers a deeper meaning to her existence in the form of an animalistic carnal attraction that surfaces and drives her to a passionate relationship with him. The movie, unfitting with modern social mores, suggests that innate gender biased traits can form the basis for truly passionate and meaningful love.If we expound on this, the message is that men and women are inherently different and naturally gravitate to different roles in a relationship and that society, at least in some instances, can interfere with these deep rooted urges.It is a gritty, believable, yet a bit uncomfortable suggestion that perhaps gender roles do offer some reward in society. It was enjoyable to watch, humorous at times and a little painful at others. I give the director the benefit of the doubt and can assume that I was guided well through the story.The movie is far from perfect in that we don't particularly empathize greatly with any of the main characters, at least until the final few scenes of the movie, though I am not sure we are supposed to. Much of the dialog was not properly updated from the 70s to the 00s - the discussion about `chemicals' for example. Also, there are some embarrassingly poorly made scenes - such as when Amber and Giuseppe are supposed to be zipping along in a speed boat and there is not such as a hair moving on their heads, and every scene where the Mediterranean looks about as wavy as a backyard poolOne thing is for sure - the subject matter is surprisingly thought and discussion provoking and the movie is better than 98% of the other new release rentals out there. Rent it and talk about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a brilliant and rare story about true love and I treasured the gift of its message. I thought about it for days afterwards and it made me feel really good as I fully understood it. Madonna was brilliant. I feel people are bagging her because they are too busy thinking about the way it is shot instead of the message and what it delivers that is much deeper than the obvious and you have to watch the whole movie to see the whole message. It's not about lust or glamor, it is about true love. It could be classed as a B grade movie in some respects but only until you get into the story. The story is filled with wholehearted truth and ultimately the decision of a lifetime. It is about the choices we make in life that bring heaven or hell no matter how much money we have. The message expresses the reason we are on this earth. I loved it, it's full of strength and courage. It brought a gift to me and I recommend it to people. A rare watch and a movie for inspiration, that involves the heart and soul to work out. The way they portray this story works well with Madonna's energy and her persona, I had respect for her after this movie as it would be very difficult to play this role and it must different to the way she is a musician so i say congratulations to her. She would have worked hard. She was vulnerable and she was in the story, it was her, not Madonna as she is on stage and that worked. It is no surprise that this is not a popular movie because it is not common. A rare find, highly recommended to people who are interested in the core of the human being that needs nature to awaken the true instincts and deepest heart's desires. If you are deep and you love stories that stir the core of your being this is a blessing in disguise. Give it a chance 10 for the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Madonna's then husband Razzie winning director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Revolver, Sherlock Holmes), I had heard negative things about this film, mostly about the leading actress, so I was dying to see how bad it was, or whether I may disagree with the reviews. Basically Amber Leighton (Razzie winning - and nominated - Madonna) is the beautiful forty year old rich, spoilt and arrogant socialite, she is married to Tony (Eight Below's Bruce Greenwood) but nothing makes her happy. Her husband has taken her on a private cruise from Greece to Italy with two other couples, including with friends Marina (Basic Instinct's Jeanne Tripplehorn) and Debi (Meet Dave's Elizabeth Banks) and their other halves. She gets angry at all the slightest things on the ship, such as the food being served, and she seems to take all her anger out on first mate Giuseppe Esposito (Razzie nominated Adriano Giannini), and he is trying really hard to deal with it. When a storm forces Amber into a lifeboat, alongside Giuseppe, both of them wind up stranded in the middle of the ocean, and eventually swept away shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island. Giuseppe sees this as an opportunity to get his own back on the woman who has been bossing him around and making him really stressed, he forces her to become his slave and do washing, cleaning and fetching to earn caught food and water to drink. He is for a while very forceful and unforgiving towards Amber, but slowly as they spend more time waiting for help together they are developing feelings for each other, to the point when they have fallen in love. There is a point when one or the other think that going back to their lives on land is a mistake and it will tear them apart, but eventually this does have to happen for the sake of their survival. In the end they are indeed rescued by a ship, and Amber is forced to go back to her not very happy husband, while Giuseppe is heartbroken with his unsuccessful plan to propose to her. Also starring David Thornton as Michael, Michael Beattie as Todd, Yorgo Voyagis as Captain and George Antoni, Mr. Quereshi from Harry Hill's TV Burp as Chef. Many people will say that the only good acting Madonna has done is in Desperately Seeking Susan and Evita, and all say this is among the worst of her attempts, I didn't think she was completely awful, I thought in fact her character suited her, i.e. bitchy and self centred (like she can be), I agree with the critics Giannini does well getting his own back on her as the "master", but most of the other cast members, including reliable Tripplehorn and Greenwood hardly do much at all. The story I will agree is not all that original, it only came two years after Tom Hanks was Cast Away, so it is essentially the same sort of film, but with two people, no plane crash, and a hut on the island LOL, but there was a part of me that liked what was going on, I can see some of the reasoning for low ratings, but I didn't think it was an awful romantic comedy drama. It won the Razzie for Worst Picture, Worst Remake or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Giannini and Madonna, and it was nominated for Worst Screenplay, Worst 'Drama' of Our First 25 Years and Worst Picture of the Decade. Adequate!</fullReview>

I mean the casting isn't the only thing wrong with this either, Guy also seems to have lost his footing on his direction AND his writing, both in which are usually top-notch. Maybe it wasn't Guy running the show with his wife on set...if you catch my drift.Like the Ladykillers was for the Coen's maybe this will only be a minor setback with Guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In brief: 2 reasons to watch; funny dream sequence &amp; Madonna pedalling like a maniac in a head scarf on an exercise bike while smoking a cigar!2 reasons to leave it: Your too dumb to get the subtle irony and socialist nuances. Brilliantly shot Mediterrean scenery bothers your aesthetic. This film was a curiosity for me. All I heard was that it was awful, but I didn't know anyone who had seen it. The thought occurred to me that I had and seemingly those around me had had an opinion foisted upon them. So needless to say I rented it and gave it a look.Surprisingly this film was very watchable and I think it's clear why it did badly in America. The humour in the film was quite ironic and dark, and it also contained some rather overt anti-capitalist messages Most people don't like Madonna in films, so it seems surprising that one where she gets assaulted quite often would have more appeal than it did. I find her very watchable and she certainly plays the rich bitch with good handle between tongue in cheek and close to the bone comments about poor people paying for drugs and 'spirtualism'.The bad aspects of the film were its rather jumpy sense of flow. There are clearly three parts that don't seem to blend easily. The characters also jump about quite a lot and not wanting to give anything away, but there is very little transition from the people they are at the beginning and the people at the end.Madonna was accused by one reviewer as being wooden, I beg to differ; compared with the recent attempts of Keeanu 'two faces' Reeves, Will Smith (doing his bit for the environment by recycling the same character) Orlando 'two faces, one on loan from Keeanu' Bloom. Oh and of course who can forget Vinnie 'famous for being a bully' Jones. Perhaps I just can't see the wood for the trees. In any case I would watch this one again.I think Gianni is also a very warm actor who managed to find a clear path through a very complicated character. His presence in the film is very sexually charged but natural. The other characters in the film are also quite well rounded despite only rather fleeting appearances; Bruce Greenwood particularly as he subtly weaves his laid back persona seen by his friends with the darkly controlling man beneath. I also thought the ships hands were excellently performed rather like the mechanicals in A Midsummernight's Dream as a comic ensemble.On the whole it was in true Ritchi style, equally funny and darkly violent. There are two shots I did hate the weird rising up in front of the tree (if you haven't seen it, watch and try and explain to me!)and the close ups of Madonna at the end. Crying is hard to do on command and and Ritchie should have had the good sense to shoot it differently.Aspects on the film are quite intelligent; questions over money making and how women are viewed to name two and I would recommend watching it before you take anyone else's view.</fullReview>

No interaction by higher powers - (which makes entry by 'Big Brother' et al productions - Orwell exempt - a mere blot on the landscape) and the film is all the better for it. Ending is what you might expect fromt eh above so no spoilers.Man eventually gets to teach woman there is beauty in the world, as long as everyone gets to know their own limitations, and are willing to be taught by another if they wish to be respected.Lesbians and mamby (namby?) pamby oppression suspects have already lowered the voting reviews to confirm that they hate it - somewhat confirming they should not have been allowed to access the Internet in the first place - smack on wrist for keeping the handcuff keys so close to to the bedpost/kitchen appliance. This is a film where the whole cast has worked well, it works, and this version is a masterpiece.Watch it on a decent TV though, the scenery is there as an additive, (not an acting excuse), and it enhances the film i watched with the other half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful remake by the hottest team in hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, last night I was very very fortunate to see an advanced screening of Madonna's hot new film SWEPT AWAY. Since this event was part of a film festival and a charity event, there were a lot of giveaways before the film actually got started. The anticipation was killing me, I wanted to see it already but I had to wait a few more minutes. When the film starts, we see close ups of Madonna; her hands her face, her glasses her drink in one hand, her cigarette in the other. These images gave me flash backs of various Madonna video moments. As a matter of fact, a lot of things that happened in the film made me think, where did I see that before? Very early on I noticed that the man who plays Madonna's friend in the film was the same guy who played her Manager in the BMW commercial. I guess Guy likes to use the same people. Madonna was looking amazing. She was looking amazing through out the film as seen in all the pictures from the movie.You guys know basically the story, so I am not gonna go into too much detail about how they get from the boat to the island.Madonna is a rich bitch socialite in the film, kind of like most of the people that got in to see this movie last night. ..Anyway, we see Madonnas character always complaining about everything from the food to the shirts that the workers wear on the boat to the actual boat itself. The film has 2 main characters. Madonna is in practically every scene with the sailor played by Adriano Giannini (called Pepe).The crew hates Madonnas character and even her friends on the boat talk about her behind her back. Every night Madonna is seen playing cards and smoking. One night she comes up from the lower level of the boat for some air. She sees pepe and turns away. She was mad at him cause the other night she was a little bit drunk and ran into him on the boat and asked him if he wanted to dance with her. He refused saying, "I don't dance with people I don't like".Every scene was exciting and Madonna's acting was on par. The greatest moment in the film for me was the scene where Pepe asks Madonna to sing! She starts singing really badly and then you could make out the lyrics that she was singing which was `Come on a My House' and the fantasy sequence begins! (You've seen the photos, where Madonna wears that beautiful yellow Versace gown and that made the film for me. I wanted to stand and applaud right afterwards)They ultimately fall in love on the island and start playing some silly games with each other. In one scene they discover a whiskey bottle in the abandoned shack on the island. They start playing charades! This is another hilarious scene. Madonna truly shined here and really showed off her comedic talents.The soundtrack during the film was awesome as well. Guy Ritchie did a great job. I am not going to spoil the way it ends for you, you're just gonna have to see it for yourself. Over all is was a really well done film and I am so happy that Madonna finally took on a project that was worthy of her time. Much better than the original. My only complaint, I think it was too short!Everyone has to see this and recommend it to anyone and everyone they know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe true romantics and couples in love only can appreciate it. 'Zorba meets Moliere in Hell in the Pacific' is not of course The Remains of the Day but it can stay as a truly timeless romantic and humanist.My wife and I (both 30 with thousands of movies in our brains) caught this film by chance on TV maybe 10' after the beginning and got trapped. First by Adriano Giannini and his comedy character of the valet a bit smarter and more profound and philosophical than his totally self-centered spoiled and bored employers that think they know it all better than anyone just because they made money. (A classic theme since Moli?re and Beaumarchais). Giannini's Greek beauty combined with the incredible one of the Mediterranean sea made us think of Zorba and want to watch further. I later realized that the exceptional Oscar worthy music theme (single simple piano notes) also participated in captivating me.Only to discover Madonna in a role that was fit for her and that no one else could have played better and more truly. The comments here are very unfair. She's never been that good. She was a real surprise and a pleasant one. We want to see her more that way, in love and not sexual or aggressive only. Even if she is great too as the nasty boss. But anyone expects her that way and that is surely why they hate her. Both characters caught our sympathy and got us attached to them even if they could have been explored deeper. The story unraveled with them into an almost perfect timeless classic that blends one beautiful romance with social concerns that reminded us of Moliere and Beaumarchais. Except that in their time, these authors could not dare or maybe even imagine to create a love story between the valet and his nasty employer. There is also the deserted island and Robinson myth that is as powerful as the desert in Lawrence of Arabia. Of course the characters are not that deep here but it never seemed to be the ambition. Here it is closer to Hell in the Pacific except that the evolution of feelings between the two focused too much on their beginning and end but not enough on the turning point that is the most interesting. That is the only weakness of this story with its end that is very efficient but very unpleasant too since it seems a bit forced by a rule of being 'not as usual' that makes it actually usual. But this end sure helps the desired effect. Overall, we loved it and found it funny, smart enough, not pretentious, and heartbreaking.Thank you all who worked on this. You did not waste your time. Guy Ritchie took a risk by going totally classic and refusing being edgy as in his first and only masterpiece so far, 'Lock Stock?'. He failed commercially but this story will never go old and that will make it as durable with time. And that is already rare enough to be remarkable. WE WANT THE SEQUEL!!</fullReview>

You have to watch the entire film before you realize that it is truly well done; I did. But, isn't this what it's all about? Casting of this film was excellent. As a Madonna fan, she impressed me in this one. Now, I can't picture anyone else doing it. Guy Ritchie got all of the little details down to a tee. The film finally reveals a heart-touching story between an unlikely pair. This is an experience of bonding between two people stranded on a deserted island that would of never of come together otherwise. Few people in this world will ever experience this great love and romance. Unfortunately, if these were true people, it wouldn't have worked for them in the end once they were off the island. And, that is why Madonna's character pleaded not to leave and return to the real world. As you see, it resembled a Dr. Zivago ending. P.S. Does anyone know the name of or where I can get a copy of the opening song in the film? I looked at the soundtrack and it doesn't include it. Help</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people think it makes them look smart when they bash Madonna's films. "She's bold, she wears skimpy outfit, and she shakes her butt a lot, so let's bash her acting and that should cure our retardation!"... Well, not exactly. Madonna might not be an Oscar calibre actress and certainly is not on par with the likes of Jennifer Connelly or Charlize Theron, but she can act much better than many hyped actresses of today. I don't think Scarlett Johansson or Cameron Diaz act any better or worse than Madonna.The film itself is a very fresh concept. Yes, it's a remake, but a remake of a 70s obscure Italian movie that very few have heard of. So to me, and I suspect to most of the readers, the film is as fresh as tomorrow's newspaper.Something tells me that the low ratings and bad reviews might also have something to do with the acts committed by Guido on the island. Viewers, particularly women, must have been shocked and offended to the bone watching it. But I'd rather say that this is reality. People do that all the time, in some countries more than the others, but it is global and statistics are out there to prove it. It is not this film's fault if other film makers were too scared to show reality in their movies, creating one taboo after the other.Swept Away is a very interesting film that you WILL enjoy, if you can go past the rather dull first 30 minutes.</fullReview>
