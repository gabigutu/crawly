		<shortDescription>The Voice Matters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sexuality is a mysterious creature at times, determined by many different elements: the physical appearance of a person, the way their body moves, their attitude towards life, the way they express their emotions, their creativity, the subtle fragrance they give off, the way they talk, and sometimes an x-factor that can't be defined. What strikes me about Bardot's powerful sexuality is that cinema really hadn't seen anything like it before she came around. The closest example I can think of in American film might be Lauren Bacall in "To Have and Have Not," but even that misses the mark. Bardot was not only a beautiful woman but she had a fun, mischievous and freedom-loving spirit and a fiery mind lurking around behind her sometimes poorly written characters, and these things make her even more attractive. Plus, she had a great voice. Which is why I was stunned to see a trailer for _Et Dieu... créa la femme_ dubbed into English at the end of the subtitled version. The woman doing Bardot's voice sounded awful, and so much of Brigitte's sexuality was lost. Imagine Bacall telling Bogie "You know how to whistle, don't you Steve?" in a squeaky, high-pitched voice. Would she be as sexy? I don't think so. Yet people watching the dubbed version of this film are getting something similar. As far as the film itself goes, most everything has already been said in other comments. Bardot does a great job as Juliette - who else could have done the role so well? - and Jurgens was quite good as Eric Carradine. The setting is luscious and fits perfectly with Bardot's character and the overall mood of the tale. The music is excellent, from the title sequence at the beginning through the dance scene at the end. The story can be cliched at times and there are definitely machista elements. But it's not a bad story either, with good tension created between the brothers. The fight sequences, as someone else mentioned, are laughable and poorly done. But it doesn't really matter. It's Bardot's show all the way - from her nude Cinemascope sunbathing shot that opens the film, with the witty dialog between her and Jurgens, to her erotic dance that serves as the climax of the story. Along the way we get several nice scenes that show her broader persona, including the one where she sets the bird and rabbit free in the field, and the scene in the bookstore with the woman from the orphanage. But, for the sake of Dieu, don't see this movie dubbed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bardot's image embodied a unique combination of perversity and innocence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The image of a nude Brigitte Bardot stretched out on her stomach, as she appeared at the very beginning of "And God Created Woman," used to create posters that sold by the thousands and helped to popularize her initials, "B.B." The scandal she provoked launched the film and made it an unprecedented success? Her image embodied a unique combination of perversity and innocence, a mix she displayed in her powerful portrayal of the fascinating character in the film?a young woman, proud of her body, who ultimately rejects morality? However, this opposition to conventional behavior was more a declaration of intent than of reality? The film was actually a morality tale: the liaison of the heroine and her brother-in-law was severely criticized, and conjugal love triumphed over the other more sordid union in the end?The controversy of "An God Created Woman" lay not so much in the actual events, but in the female character's impudence? And even if Vadim's message has become dated, it nonetheless documents a difficult period of time and the frustration that accompanied a living, breathing, sexual fantasy, an object of desire, a symbol of sexual liberty? Sex was no longer voyeurism, as it was in George Lacombe's "The Light Across the Street," (La Lumi?re d'en face) but instead became a reality which called for one's attention?Seen in this way, it is incontestable that "B.B." and Vadim contributed to the liberation of sexual mores, almost presaging the Sexual Revolution?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brigitte Bardot explodes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Et Dieu... crea la femme" is Brigitte Bardot's breakout film. She explodes on the screen, overwhelming the audience (the male audience by sure). I bet that women, as well, are shocked by the thought that such a rival-bomb can exist. The movie itself have always been underrated. It was a scandal at the epoch and we can easily see why. Actually, the erotic atmosphere created by BB in "Et Dieu... crea la femme" is amazing even for today standards (immensely superior to that of current movies, in my personal opinion). At any rate, the scandal made the movie be automatically considered bad (needless to say, people went crazy to see it). Curiously enough, a dozen of years later several ugly movies were automatically considered good by the critics because of the scandal they raised! Now that our modern eyes no longer see the scandal, we may judge "Et Dieu... crea la femme" a nice film, made VERY special by Brigitte Bardot's presence. The stunning locations of a still tourism-free Cote d'Azur are beautifully photographed. The story is interesting and entertaining. Melodrama is systematically avoided. The script contains a good deal of typical French wit: sharp, cynical, but with a melancholic subtext. A couple of instances. The mature gentleman Eric Carradine, trying to justify Juliete's bad behavior "I am the only one to be guilty of that" and the old woman "Don't delude yourself, sir...". Again Carradine "I fell in love with a young girl and I gave money for her to marry another man. How do you call it?" and a friend "I call it wisdom".Bardot brilliantly plays Juliete, a remarkably interesting character. Probably, more than her free and mindless attitude toward love affairs, Juliete's true personality may be described as anarchist selfishness. She doesn't give a damn for others. She just does everything she wants, not caring people's opinions, prejudices or feelings. She loves animals, though. A further point of interest is that, according to her own autobiography, BB's personality has some in common with that of Juliete's. I don't comment Brigitte's sex-appeal. Words are not enough, just look at her and enjoy. The life at the village on the sea and the various other characters are described with accuracy. Jurgens, Trintignant and the remainder of the cast work well.The cult-scene of the movie is Juliete's Mambo dance. Here we understand what Europeans of the 1950s thought to be a torrid scene. We also see that they were right!Seeing the movie, many are displeased that (seemingly) a dose of heavy slaps turns the wild Juliete into a devoted spouse. That looks machist ideology. Well, to begin with, to beat guilty women is just a realistic and predictable behavior in the low class environment of a village of fishermen in the 1950s. But, above all, do you think Juliete-Brigitte tamed by few hits? Come on! She accepts the slaps only because in that very moment she has thought it good to take them. But who knows the future? Believe me, Juliete is far from being tamed, and the end of the film by no means coincides with the end of the story... In spite of possible criticism, I like "Et Dieu... crea la femme". Right or wrong, this film has a relevant place in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bardot launched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pfff... In all her 48 movies Brigitte Bardot never catches public imagination more thouroughly and efficiently than she does in 'et Dieu créa la femme'. Her performance in this movie really makes the sparks fly off your screen. Make sure you see the new, cleaned up version, by the way. You'll better appreciate its fine use of colors.By this statement we have captured the essence of 'Dieu'. There really is nothing more positive to say about this movie. But it is enough. More than enough. Surely no one could have played the role of Juliette better than Brigitte did. By wearing her long, blond hair loose, Brigitte suggest sexual availability. Paradise on earth is just around the corner, she tells us. And today Brigitte's message sounds as fresh and promising as in 1956. That's why 'et Dieu créa la femme' is immortal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Sexy and Ahead of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In St. Tropez, the orphan Juliete Hardy (Brigitte Bardot) is an eighteen years old woman sexually active and ahead of time, strongly desired by the wealthy middle age man Eric Carradine (Curd Jurgens). She has a crush on Antoine Tardieu (Christian Marquand), the older son that works in Toulon of a poor family that owns a modest shipyard, but he just want to have one nightstand with her. When Juliete's stepparents decide to send her back to the orphanage because of her bad reputation in the town, Antoine's brother Michel Tardieu (Jean-Louis Trintignant) proposes to marry her and she accepts, and she begins to love him. But when the Tardieu family decides to sell the shipyard to Eric and Antoine returns to St. Tropez, her lust for him blossoms again and becomes an announced tragedy.This is the first time that I watch "Et Dieu... Créa la Femme" and I found it a surprisingly good movie. The story is extremely sexy and ahead of time, and works mainly because of the extremely beautiful and sensual Brigitte Bardot. Her sensuality and eroticism is impressive even in 2007, and I confess that I felt in love for her. The IMDb Tagline "...but the devil invented Brigitte Bardot!" is amazing, certainly one of the best I have ever read in this outstanding site. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "?E Deus Criou a Mulher" ("?And God Created the Woman")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ooh La La!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every great actress has her breakthrough role--the one that really puts her over with the public--and for 22-year-old Brigitte Bardot, that role came in 1956's "...And God Created Woman." In this film she plays an 18-year-old named Juliette, who marries younger brother Michel (Jean-Louis Trintignant) to spite older brother Antoine, all the while being pursued by the wealthy, middle-aged Carradine (Curt Jurgens). It is easy to see why BB proved so popular in this film. She is indeed very beautiful, and writer/director/husband Roger Vadim shows her off to good effect. OK, to address the thought uppermost in the minds of my fellow all-American red-blooded pigdogs, we get to see BB in all manner of formfitting outfits (sorry, no nude scenes or swimwear), seducing Antoine whilst laying in the surf, teasing behind sheets and under blankets, and, most impressively, doing a frenzied mambo. I dwell on BB's physique because, really, it is what the film is all about. Personalitywise and characterwise, Juliette is a fairly tiresome, repugnant and conscienceless creature. But physically...ooh la la! No wonder Carradine says that she was born to destroy men! The film also boasts location filming in San Tropez, a town that here looks nice and quaint, if surprisingly run-down. The DVD itself is mighty fine, with an impressive wide-screen image, crisp color and adequate subtitling. Men, pair this movie one night with the 1935 Marlene Dietrich vehicle "The Devil Is A Woman" and you just might give up on females for good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And aren't we all glad He did?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pouty Brigitte Bardot in the movie that made her an international star. Is it me or does her nubile orphan Juliette bear the basic "accoutrements" of those legendary tragediennes of 19th century English literature like Tess of the D'Urbervilles or Eustacia Wye? It might explain Juliette's last name: Hardy. Except "And God Created Woman" is set in St. Tropez and is not a tragedy. Flat out, it's a middle-aged Frenchman's chic, paternalistic vision of the irrepressible nymphet. By paternalistic, I mean we know more about what the men in her life think about her than what she thinks about them or herself. Curt Jurgens' character (who, I think, stands in for director Roger Vadim) sizes her up quickly, and in the end, blows town with Christian Marquand who plays Antoine, the man she really wants. He's got her number; to him, she's the type who refuses to be tamed, who uses her obvious "gifts" to get what she wants, who's easily bored and distracted, and a slave to her whims. To Antoine, she is an incorrigible wanton; he has no faith that she'll change. But Antoine has his way with her (He figures it's what she wants, and it is), abuses her, and tries to wise up his younger brother (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who had married her. By chic, I mean Vadim always knew how to cast attractive people in his movies. Bardot isn't the only "hotty" here; Marquand matches her heat, watt for watt, and with less effort. There's a jazzy hipness to their look for which few directors besides Vadim had a talent. Still, when Juliette is rejected and runs back to her trusting husband, the movie fades from memory, and the last shot in the picture (of the street where she lives) recalls the landscapes Cezanne abstracted into modern art oblivion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the cinema created Bardot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the movie which launched Brigitte Bardot as the sex symbol of the fifties and sixties in the the role of the teenager Juliette. And this is really a movie about a woman. She fills the screen during the whole projection with her gorgeous and generous anatomy and also with her way of smiling, talking, laughing, walking and dancing in a mixture of flesh, fire and beauty displaying moreover her personality and her fears, desires and anguish. However she is no "femme fatale" and only a tender teenager who cannot be blamed for having been born so pretty, charming and physically well shaped and who sometimes appears almost like a defenceless child. The story involves not the classical triangle but a quadrilateral instead whose vertices are besides Juliette herself, her young husband, his brother and the rich middle aged businessman who covets her since the beginning. The end of the story is somewhat conventional but acceptable anyway. This movie was received like a bomb in the movie world shaking some moral canons and shocking a lot people although by today's patterns it can be judged as rather innocent. Anyway the story is simple,original and well conceived and the actors play well which makes it a good movie after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BB at her Sauciest in Vadime's Best Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This groundbreaking Vadim film made Ms. Bardot the hottest sex symbol on the planet back in 1956. Vadim was never much of a director, but he had great taste in women (Bardot, Deneuve, J. Fonda). Brigitte Bardot is a knockout as a spoiled and selfish 20 y/o who doesn't seem to know what she wants, but all the men want HER! No one walks down a street like Ms. Bardot. Beautiful location and good performances all around.It's too bad the dubbed version has a terrible voice used for Brigitte, but her physical presence carries it anyway. She knows how to move and hold your attention. Just an incredibly vibrant creature of the 50's. She has undervalued as an actress and no one was sexier or more sure of herself (at least ON screen). Best performance = Bardot. A 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bardot's star making vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though she had appeared in a number of other films this was the one that made her one of the greatest sex symbols in cinema and her life would be forever changed but the flip side of the coin is that film viewers would be changed forever also! Story takes place in St. Tropez, France where an 18 year old girl named Juliette Hardy (Brigitte Bardot) is making a bad name for herself cavorting with several of the male inhabitants in her area. She is told that she is going to be sent back to the orphanage but Juliette has an older admirer named Eric Carradine (Curd Jurgens) who is a rich developer and he wants to buy a local shipyard to build a casino. He convinces Michel Tardieu (Jean-Louis Trintignant) to get Juliette to marry him even though she is very much in love with his brother Antoine (Christian Marquand).*****SPOILER ALERT*****Michel and Juliette get married and she does learn to love him as he does but she still can't help but to flirt with Antoine and this puts friction between them. Finally one day Antoine and Juliette are alone and they make love and when word spreads everyone tries to convince Michel to get her to leave but he doesn't want her to go. Juliette has found someone that is willing to put up with her wild nature despite the fact that even she thinks it's better to leave.This film was directed by Roger Vadim who was married to Bardot at the time and even with the story being simple he knew exactly how to showcase his wife as a sex object since this was a side of her that he was familiar with. This is not a great thought provoking film or story but it's the perfect vehicle for Bardot to star in. There is no film without her and if you look at the type of shots used you'll notice the lack of close-ups as the camera seems positioned at a good distance away from a voyeurs point of view. The performances by the male actors seem a bit stiff but a veteran like Jurgens comes out the best and an actor with his talent can actually get away with lines like "That girl is made to destroy men". But I do disagree with critics that say Bardot just prances about like a brat and the scene towards the end of the film after she has just cheated on her husband shows her character at real odds with herself but lacks the maturity and self esteem to do anything about it. Vadim captures the colors of St. Tropez beautifully and this is a very colorful film to view. Not only do the colors of the area appear brightly but the blushing fleshtones of Bardot are equally showcased. The opening shot of the film shows a nude Bardot sunbathing and it helps set the mood which is carried through until the very end. While Vadim's marriage to Bardot was dwindling down this film started her on her journey as one of the most famous stars in cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AND GOD CREATED WOMAN made quite a stir when it was released in America in the 1950s. For its time, it was very sexy and shocking. Unfortunately, the film does not age well--and today is rather tedious and forgettable. My how times have changed.This film became famous for two reasons--and they're right above Bardot's bellybutton. She plays a bit of a bimbo and this movie is extremely sensual--for that it earns some points. But the script?! Yech!! The plot is rather silly and contrived at times, but completely gives way to silliness at the end. The end is so dumb and ridiculous that it strains my brain to think how they could have created such a stupid ending. My recommendation is to watch this more for curiosity sake than because it is a good film or because you are such a French film buff you MUST see it. FYI--the sequel (made with Rebecca DeMornay) is even stupider. While the plots have SOME similarities, they are quite different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And God Created Woman But What Do They Want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While any spoilers below are presented in vague generalities, one might appreciate this review more after viewing the film.It is preciously rare to see raw human truths portrayed in a work of art -this film succeeds. Brigitte Bardot plays the young orphan Juliette trying to come to terms with the power and curse of being a beautiful woman. She wants to have fun, she wants to be loved, but few are able to see past her beautiful body and irreverent behavior. One man tries to buy her love and another uses raw male sexual appeal. Both men fail to completely win her affection primarily because of their own inability to admit how completely they love and desire her. A third, most unlikely man, wins her affection by treating her with kindness and love, rescuing her when the world turn against her and defending her honor even against his own mother. When she betrays him, he responds physically, expressing outrage, and than offers forgiveness. It is at the moment of his physical expression of outrage that he wins her love completely. This film expresses the profundity of feminine attractiveness and provides a glimpse at the answer to the Freudian question, `what do women want?'. Expressing the answer in words risks oversimplification; however, one might say that women want the freedom to express their femininity and sexuality within the confines of a loving, supportive and respectful relationship.</fullReview>

And the characters can't resist making smirking sexual innuendoes - everyone who is not blind can see that Bardot is a gorgeous woman, but Vadim apparently thought that he had to beat us over the head with that fact.

		<shortDescription>Worst choreographed fight scenes in film history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a curiousity that seems to have achieved cult status by showcasing the early Brigitte Bardot--okay, so she's easy to look at, but as a character she invites no audience identification whatsoever. Nor do the always reliable actors Christian Marquand ("Flight of the Phoenix," and director of one of THE worst movies of all time, "Candy") and Curt Jurgens, as two of the men "bewitched" by this unlikable bitch. The only sympathetic role in the whole film belongs to Jean-Louis Trintagnant, as the younger brother of the Marquand character. And it is Trintagnant who is the unfortunate victim of the worst-choreographed fight scenes I have ever, EVER seen. Especially pathetic is the first fight with a dockyard tough: the blows and kicks are very obviously not connecting, and the sound effects are not only insufficient, they're out of synch with the onscreen action. The very worst John Wayne western from his pre-stardom period in the 3O's boasts better action sequences. Errol Flynn's legendarily awful "Cuban Rebel Girls," which resembles a home movie more than a film, has better fight scenes. In fact, I personally am but a community-theatre actor, and even I can fake giving and receiving punches better than Vadim's performers! Two things puzzle me: Why did the people who meticulously "restored" the film for DVD not upgrade the sound effects to at least partially fix these absurd scenes? And how did Vadim's reputation ever survive this demonstration of ineptitude? Or is there some "artistic significance" associated with hilariously awful filmmaking that I am missing here?</fullReview>

Attracting packed houses all over the place, getting businessmen to marvel at BB's most seductive performance ever.Now, more than fifty years later, 'Et Dieu ... crea la femme' may be qualified as a mediocre but entertaining French fifties-film. With nice coloring and a consistent story.Its immortality, however, is guaranteed by Brigitte Bardot as the orphan-girl Juliette. Her message is simple: Paradise is just around the corner.

		<fullReview>Set in the gorgeous seaside town of St. Tropez, French New Wave director Roger Vadim's retelling of the Garden of Eden bears watching (and rewatching). Monsieur Carradine (a German?Curd Jürgens) is an older gentleman who flirts with Juliette (the beautiful Brigitte Bardot, a French Audrey Hepburn). His goal: to build a casino. Hers??well, we're not quite sure. To live a carefree life. Here comes the heart of the film?what is her motive? What makes her happiest? Is it pursuing or being pursued? How innocent is Juliette?and how deeply can we look into her character? Juliette is a na?ve but driven. She must be aware of her stunning beauty. She bikes around town barefoot, and holds a steady but boring job as a bookseller. Eighteen, she lives with a foster family on the condition that she holds down her job and behaves. A spontaneous, young girl, Juliette has trouble sitting down or doing anything steadily. But she takes care of a rabbit (thoughtfully named Socrates). She decides to release Socrates into nature, but when he scampers off she has a change of heart and runs right after him. While she moves from one man to another in the space of an hour, she resents overhearing Antoine's (Christian Marquand's) flippant one-night-stand remark. Yet Juliette?who in no ambiguity represents the forbidden fruit, perhaps temptation itself?ends up hitched with Antoine's brother, Michel (Jean-Louis Trintignant). But when Bardot takes off on a sailboat and the engine catches fire (symbolizing Bardot's nascent marriage going up in smoke), Antoine rescues and drags Bardot ashore. They make love on the beach (off-screen, of course). But is Bardot sheepishly immature or an adulteress? The crux of the plot is that Carradine wants to build a casino. He has acquired all the land except for a property on the water. Enter the Tardieu clan. The mother is a stubborn widow who wants to keep the family business?shipbuilding?intact. Antoine is a pragmatist, and thinks now is the time to cash in. And the other two brothers?Christian, the younger; Michel, the middle?are indifferent. But the plot is thin. The real attraction here is the hypnotic presence of Bardot.It is a mystery how this film passed the French censors in 1956. While mild by today's standards, the film does tastefully leave most of Bardot's bits up to the imagination. But audiences' reaction? Think Elvis' pelvis.So Bardot is a thrill to watch on screen. A must-watch scene towards the end (be prepared: the film drags on) is with Juliette, intoxicated, dancing uncontrollably to an Afro-Cuban big band in the basement of a local watering hole. Wild, dynamic camera work. This film is also superb just for the breathtaking, unspoiled landscape scenes of the Cote d'Azur.If the film is a retelling of the Garden of Eden, then we are left to assume man has come from Bardot's rib. In fact, all of the energy and spirit of ? And God Created Woman radiates from her youthful vibrancy. The writers of the Cahiers du Cinéma were "knocked out" by it, and the film's dazzling quality is not lost over time. A must watch for New Wave enthusiasts or those looking for an early 400 Blows inspiration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Painfully dull Brigette Bardot vehicle, the one that made her world famous. Bardot plays a lusty young woman who must marry before she is sent back to the orphanage ([smile]). The man with whom she is actually in love is away and apparently never coming back, so she settles for his younger brother (Jean-Louis Trintignant, very lame in this early role). When the brother comes back, there's predictable trouble. The only good part of the film happens after Bardot runs away, expecting that her husband will want her to go. She finds a band practicing Carribean music, and she dances erotically to it. This was, I'm assuming, one of the first Technicolor films in France, and also one of the first in 'Scope. The color is great, but Vadim has no clue how to work with 'Scope. Everything's in long shot with only two or three close-ups of Bardot. What was Vadim thinking??? Brigette Bardot is obviously a gorgeous woman, but she's not a bad actress. When given good material, she can act. This is not good material, so her performance here is mediocre. 5/10.</fullReview>

What an awful film.&nbsp;*Extremely sexist and absolutely nonsense.*&nbsp;I mean, Brigitte Bardot's is only there to show her legs and semi-nude body _ of course, she's stunning. But why exploit her in such an outrageous and blatant manner? There is no character development whatsoever, we simply get to see a few caricatures; stereotyped characters popping out of nowhere while the leads_"also stereotypes, the 'whore' horny wife married to the 'typical' husband who loves his wife but needs to defend his honor_"&nbsp;and the couple is either *beep* or talking nonsense. There is also a background story between the husband and a bald old rich man who wants to buy his supposedly 'valuable' lands, story which is left unsolved at the end. Is really a miserable, nonsense screenplay.&nbsp;*More nonsense...*&nbsp;Also, why Bardot's character was shooting people in the street? I mean what the hell?! Probably the best example I could give of how nonsensical and moronic this film is. The ending is almost as moronic as this scene too.&nbsp;*DESPITE being extremely screwed, the editing makes the film interesting (at times...)*&nbsp;Yes. Is a very screwed editing work, have no doubts about it. BUT...it actually worked sometimes. In the first half of the film, there is really a nice pace -and not so many nonsense going on- and the film got even watchable at some point, and really interesting to look at DESPITE EVERYTHING. But the second half of the film is absolutely awful in that aspect.&nbsp;*Conclusion*&nbsp;I can firmly say there was no intention in telling a story in that film. The only thing director Roger Vadim wanted to do was show Bardot's semi-nude body, arousing the man around her. I said it. There is simply no artistic values in this film, there is no craft put in this film, there isn't even enough effort put in this film. Horrible. No matter how bad the censorship "cut" this film at the time, there is simply no excuse to why it sucks so bad.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was Bardot That He Created</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...And God Created Woman (1956) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sex kitten Juliete Hardy (Brigitte Bardot) has rich man Eric Carradine (Curd Jurgens) wanting her but she prefers the poor Antoine (Christian Marquand) but through some weird chance she ends up marrying his young brother Michel (Jean-Louis Trintignant), which sets off a wild love triangle. ...AND GOD CREATED WOMAN was highly controversial when it was first released due to its sexuality and it's easy to see why even when viewed today. While there's no nudity or sex scenes, it's pretty clear that the adult nature of the subject matter is fully played out and so much more than the type of "sex kitten" movies that were playing American drive-in's during this era. Heck, just compare this to something Mamie Van Doren was doing and you'll see what I mean. It's very easy to see why Bardot would become a star with this picture as she's certainly quite beautiful rolling around in the various sexy outfits director Roger Vadim has her in. With that said, there's also no question that the story here is just downright stupid, at times boring and never really makes too much sense. It's pretty clear that there wasn't too much thought put into the story outside of the various ways to show off Bardot and her sexuality. The entire love triangle was just laughable and I'm not even going to get started on how stupid the ending is. It's really too bad that a somewhat better story wasn't written because everything else is pretty good. This includes the wonderful cinematography that perfectly captures the beautiful locations. We're given some very good performances with Trintignant really standing out as the abused younger brother. Bardot is clearly the stand out here as she perfectly knows how to use her sexuality. The naive quality she brings the character is certainly something special. The film still manages to be quite erotic today but at the same time it's also dated somewhat to the point where most people won't see what the big deal is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retrograde melodrama that understandably caused a stir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"And God Created Woman," the movie that proved that men would see subtitled films if Brigitte Bardot was the star, is far from being a masterpiece, but it worked as cheap entertainment in the '50s, and still does today. Bardot's charms are on full display here: pouty mouth, tiny waist, and the "feet of a queen" despite her walking around barefoot all the time.The plot is pretty standard-issue for a tawdry little melodrama. Juliette (Bardot) is an oversexed foster child in St-Tropez, flirting with a suave millionaire (Curd Jürgens) and yearning for handsome local-boy-made-good Antoine (Christian Marquand), who rejects her. In order to avoid being sent back to the orphanage, she marries Antoine's shy younger brother Michel (Jean-Louis Trintignant), and events proceed from there without many surprises.The sexual and racial politics of the movie are terribly retrograde: Juliette's dancing to African mambo music signifies her descent into depravity, and the movie suggests that Michel needs to learn to "control" his wayward wife. The first half of the movie makes some efforts to establish Juliette as a sympathetic character--she loves music and animals, she won't deal with people who dislike her--but by the end, she is demonized as a woman who will drive men to their doom.Bardot is charismatic and has at least one terrific scene where she defies her husband's family, but the other actors don't do much with their roles. The lovely cinematography captures St-Tropez before it became a fashionable resort, and the oh-so-'50s jazz soundtrack is fun. Moreover, despite the plot's datedness and predictability, it's enjoyable to spend 90 minutes with an audacious melodrama, and to see why it caused such a fuss 50 years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"the problem with the future is that it always ruins the present", says Bardot at the beginning. my intuition relates this sentence with some of the role this picture would perform in cinema context in years to come.This is a really important film. From a sociological and cinematic point of view. Nevertheless, it is NOT a good film. It hasn't got a strong plot, a strong idea nor strong performers. But it has BB and a boiling revolution in cinema that was to come in just 4 years and that shows its claws here.Social phenomenaBrigitte Bardot popped out here. The first scene grants her a place in collective imagination of the western society. The rest of the film defines a new personality for sex symbol. The one which is not so much different than the ordinary person, only more beautiful. This is her film, and she's the only one you will remember after a very short time after watching it (her, not the character).Cinematic issues(1) I can't tell exactly how far Vadim was self-aware about what he was doing here, or if he predicted that he was, probably, beginning something which would bring consequences to our days. Anyway, what he wanted to tell with this picture, was his own story, in which Bardot was, at this moment, the main character. Carradine (Jürgens) was, i suspect, Vadim himself. Bardot is liberal, does whatever she wants, out of innocence and joy. Carradine is experienced, sees everything, or at least knows about it, allows everything, but always controlling in the distance, always caring for what happens and always planning over it.(2) The composition is not old fashioned anymore, even though the plot line and themes depicted could report to some classical light comedy, used to exhaustion until then. The camera movements are bold, though useless most of the times, Vadim is trying to change, even though he wasn't competent enough to make it worthwhile (that job would go to Godard, mainly, and Truffaut). Also the development-climax-conclusion form doesn't apply so clearly here.So, this film is (1) self-referential to its author and (2) searching a personal innovative way to expose a story (film about cinema). That makes it maybe the first nouvelle vague constructed film, 3 years before "4 cents..." and 4 before "a bout de soufflé". Here, as with Barbarella, Vadim introduces elements of innovation, that would change pop thinking and pop culture, without producing really good watchable films, almost on the contrary.My evaluation: 3/5 This an important worthwhile seeing NOT good film.</fullReview>

Get it at Amazon.)What do you do when you've got a sensuous, sexy wife who has a strong need to mate with the alpha male, even if that male isn't you? Why, you slap her around a little, and wow! she is swooned by your commanding style and your marriage is saved.This, believe it or not, was standard psychology back in the fifties. It was the hidden, 'Freudian' kind of subconscious understanding about women known only to the most experienced and sophisticated of men.I guess I need to say that this is not a very good movie and whatever you do, don't get the dubbed version. The woman reading Brigitte Bardot's lines sounds like an annoying cosmetics school drop out while the translations of the everyday French greetings and idioms are stupid in the extreme. I would say don't even bother with this, but this IS Brigitte Bardot at twenty-two, the cr?me de la cr?me of sex kittens displayed here in her bare feet avec quick shots of her perfect caboose and very pouty mouth. For all connoisseurs of the type, e.g., Marilyn Monroe, Liv Ullmann, and lately Drew Barrymore, women who radiate pure sex and sensuality, whose nature is so naturally warm and loving that they cannot resist stray dogs-or stray men-BB is not to be missed. I just wish they knew how to use a camera in those days and weren't so darn prudish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miss Bardot plays the role of innocent waif with a certain--well, innocence, that few modern actresses could pull off so well. Come to think of it, few actresses of any age could pull off. It is not just innocence, it is playful innocence. And at age 21 or 22 when she made this, Miss Bardot was young and innocent and playful.She, of course, marries the wrong brother to spite the one who actually wants her; she falls for the older man (played by Curt Jurgens) who wants to buy land for a casino in St. Tropez, but disguises his intention by pretending to build yet another ship building company. And this older man, who seems to want nothing more than to have her for a play-pal, ends up being structural to her life with her husband.She cheats on husband, unexpected denouement of reinforced love, of re-committed love, of under-appreciated love for that husband.I didn't find the movie shallow, trite, or obvious. And by the standards of 1956--even by those standards it was fairly tame for anyone who was used to visiting nudist camps. "Playboy" had just made an appearance about two years previous, and even by that standard, it was tame. It was a time before people confused sex with porn. The Legion of Decency condemned the film for the nudity, but certainly by modern standards, it is hardly shocking. (Shocking that there was a time that the Legion of Decency even existed, much less listened to.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Roger Vadim created Brigitte Bardot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first scene onwards where we see Juliette (Bardot) sunbathing naked it is clear that the only reason Vadim made this movie is to make his wife an international superstar. I'll have to admit that some scenes are really iconic. I already mentioned the sunbathing, but also the scene where Juliette walks out of the sea with her dress open from her belly and of course the dance scene at the end of the movie.Despite these memorable scenes (especially from male view) the cinematography is very average. We hardly see any interesting shots. The script is very poor with dialog and scenes not worked out very well. The most interesting aspect of the story is the band of brothers, or more specific the demolition of this band by the force of nature that is Juliette. She loves Michel but longs for Antoine who just sees her as a one-night-stand. Then there is youngest brother Christian who's character is somewhere between his older brothers but he's to young to really participate in the game. Where there's a real loyalty between the brothers at the start of the movie at the end they all stand against each other. Antoine will leave for good and Christian who adored his eldest brother is disillusioned by the behavior of Antoine. Michel is probably most damaged. His mother and brother despise him for hanging on to his marriage with Juliette and he faces a future with her that will only include more drama. Apart from the sunbathing the movie is not very interesting until Juliette has her affair with Antoine and the brothers fall apart. The scene where Juliette starts dancing in the café and Michel caught while living the life she wants to live is by far the best of the movie. Bardot is so sensual in this scene and the acting by Trintignant very intense. Nowadays the movie is quiet tame but I can imagine that it caused a stir in the mid fifties. So really enjoyable for the above mentioned scenes but no milestone in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen his film. Back in the sixties all the guys talked about Brigitte Bardot. Of course, the chances of seeing a film like this in our local theater were about nil. It's a decent movie in that we see why she was such a cinema presence. Her pouting mouth and bohemian being would be attractive to anyone in the male population. The story is certainly one that has been told many times. She is kept out of the orphanage by marrying a man who is still a child. Her reputation precedes her and he must endure the taunts of the local men, including one on his wedding day which gets him into a fight he can't possibly win. From then on her promiscuity and attraction to high testosterone carries forward. If a man fawns on her, he can forget it. Still, the guy really loves her and that is never in doubt. As this film ends, we know that the story will continue, bumps in the road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Vehicle Interesting Only for Its Social History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Vadim film is an extremely poorly crafted piece of work, interesting today only because of the social impact its star, Brigitte Bardot made. Her first major starring role, it presents her as a liberated, care-free woman and she presents a striking contrast to prior representations of women on the French screen.Her character's youthfulness, petulance, irrepressible energy and, on a negative note, selfishness, stand in contrast to previous women who were by and large either highly virtuous and prim and proper or gangsters' molls of dubious reputations.The appearance of this youthful character appears at the same time as ideas about teenagers and their importance as a consumer market were emerging in the English-speaking world, most notably the United States, particularly as the rock 'n' roll craze began. Indeed, Bardot's character perfectly captures the flightiness, impulsiveness and selfishness of so many female teenagers and the wild dance at the end makes the connection between music, consumerism and this new attitude.Other than that, though, this is a crudely-made film. The bright, sunlit scenes and bold colour may convey a hope and optimism but the cinematography is static, the pace slow and the narrative uninteresting. Bardot may capture youthfulness but that does not make her character any more likable, particularly with regard to her flighty behaviour and unfaithfulness toward her husband.Indeed, none of the characters are likable, meaning the audience quickly loses interest in their dull squabbles and selfish attitudes.Perhaps this film is best viewed as a period piece then. It may have captured the zeitgeist for youth in 1956 and caused a minor shock in the prudish United States but it does not stand the test of time. Bardot still looks modern and reflects the attitude of many teenage girls even today but the rest of the film is tired and stale.</fullReview>

I don't know if the original script showed a tin ear for dialogue or if BB really was much worse delivering lines than she was at using her body to act. But it looked like Vadim and Bardot had not perfected their styles and could not help making an artificial attempt at realism. What was looked on as cool in 1956 now looks hopelessly dated, a fate that has befallen many of the early efforts to be sexy and scandalous, but not bring the censors down too harshly. Not a great work of art, but amusing and interesting as a period piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And God Created Woman" - Bardot's intro to the USA.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although she plays an orphan of 18, Brigitte Bardot was really 21 or 22 when this was filmed. I was almost 11 when it came out, a movie I had heard about but had never seen, until this week, a VHS copy on free loan from my county library. The basic story - Juliette (Bardot) is a sexy, rebellious orphan about to be sent back by her host family, until she is proposed to and marries a nice young man. The young man's older brother, plus an even older and wealthy man, really want Juliette, but only as an object of physical attraction. She is confused, she is wild, but she also wants stability. After an incident with the boat and fire, and a drunken dancing display at the local bar, her two older suitors finally figure out she is too dangerous and leave town. Then she accepts her nice, young husband and begins her own desire to settle down. AND GOD CREATED WOMAN is not by any measure a great movie, but it is interesting to watch as an early vehicle for the sexy Bardot. The early "nude" scene has her on her stomach, and there is another in the bedroom, right after her marriage, but we only see her through a sheer screen. By today's standards of rating it would be a PG-13 movie.</fullReview>

But in the morning the bus and Antoine zip by Juliette's stop and she runs into the field to capture the rabbit she set free moments before. About to be sent back to the orphanage by her foster mother, she identifies with the rabbit. Antoine's younger brother Michel comes to Juliette's rescue with a marriage proposal and she accepts. Eric wants the brothers' shipyard as a casino site and brings Antoine back to St. Tropez. Life gets complicated.Bardot is incredible in the last scene, the way she dance is so hot, it is like she was making love to the screen, a wave of sexual healing from France, Bravo!</fullReview>
