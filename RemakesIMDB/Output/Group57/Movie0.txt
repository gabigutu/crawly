		<shortDescription>Staginess is not a flaw here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christine Penmark (Nancy Kelly) is the daughter of a famous writer, Richard Bravo (Paul Fix). She's married to Kenneth (William Hopper), a military Colonel who seems to spend most of his time away from home, usually on short-term call in some other city. The landlady of their apartment building, Monica Breedlove (Evelyn Varden), is obsessed with psychology, having even been analyzed by Freud. Because of this, she courts friendships with other intellectuals, including a criminology author, Reginald Tasker (Gage Clarke). But by far the most important character is Christine's young daughter, Rhoda (Patricia McCormick).Rhoda is oddly adult in her behavior. She goes out of her way to excel at everything she does, to be prim and proper, to seem amicable and innocent. However, in the wake of one of Rhoda's classmates falling victim to a drowning accident while on a school picnic, suspicion falls on Rhoda. As more facts come out, Christine realizes with horror that her child just might be a "bad seed".A tightly focused ensemble piece, heavy on dialogue and taking place primarily in one interior location, The Bad Seed is one of the better but more understated horror films from the 1950s. Because of its ideas, its unusual portrayal of a manipulatively "evil" child (and a weirdly cute young girl at that), and its nihilistic and abruptly mind-blowing ending, The Bad Seed was quite a shocking film in 1956. In my book, it still is. That's not to say that the film is graphic. Much more so than, say, The Haunting (1963), The Bad Seed is the classic example of how something implied and not shown can be just as effective and disturbing as something shown.Still, not everyone loves it, of course. "Staginess" is often cited with either a direct claim or an implication that that quality is necessarily a flaw. The Bad Seed's "staginess" is easily explicable. It is a film adaptation of a play by Maxwell Anderson, which was itself adapted from William March's last novel, published in 1954. It's easy to see how only minor changes would allow the film to be performed on a stage. However, I don't see The Bad Seed's staginess as a flaw. It's not as if plays are bad merely for the fact that they're plays, right? There seems to be some unspoken or unanalyzed attendant assumption that cinema shouldn't bear strong similarities to other artistic media and/or a belief that cinema should always be "naturalistic". I don't agree with either of those assumptions. Cinema can do many different things. It shouldn't all just be one way or another.Rather than being a flaw, the staginess of The Bad Seed is an asset. It catalyzed the effective "tell, don't show" attitude towards the film's violence. It allows all attention to be placed on the fantastic ensemble performances, and especially on McCormack, who turns in the best young female performance this side of Dakota Fanning. And it helps make the film feel like the parable that it is.Under director Mervyn LeRoy's hand, The Bad Seed is an extended meditation on two philosophical ideas--twisted psychologies and the nature versus nurture debate. It's not just Rhoda who has psychologically-rooted problems and dysfunctions, but everyone in the film. Christine is in denial, and shows that she has long been in denial, about her happiness, her life and her daughter. She continually tries to act as if everything is kosher and normal, but as the film progresses, she has periodic cracks in the armor, until the "breakdown" at the end--and even in the midst of that, she tries to act as if everything is okay and mundane. Monica, who keeps trying to psychoanalyze everyone (except the one person she most needs to psychoanalyze), tends to also intellectually browbeat or overpower them. Kenneth is an absentee husband. Leroy Jessup (Henry Jones), the apartment maintenance man, presents himself as just as twisted, deceptive and manipulative as Rhoda, and there is a pedophile subtext with the character. Claudia Fern (Joan Croydon), the head of Rhoda's school, seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and also seems to be in denial, as does Christine's father Richard, who also has elements of absenteeism and emotional distancing. Hortense Daigle (Eileen Heckart), the mother of the drowned boy, is an alcoholic, and her tragedy puts her over the edge. In fact, the only character in the entire film who seems well-adjusted is Reginald, and perhaps that's symbolic of his function as a criminologist.The nature versus nurture material is incorporated in an unusual way. Characters debate this to an extent, but most take the nurture side. However, the film itself makes more of an argument for the nature side, and Christine, despite being in denial, comes to believe the nature side, as does Reginald, the even-keeled character. In fact, William March (the author of the novel) believed more in the nature side, and said as much to colleagues while he was working on the book, including doing research into psychotic killers.What helps to amp up the disturbing qualities of the film is that Rhoda is manipulating the audience as well as she is manipulating other characters. Only very seldom does LeRoy have her "true nature" come through, and it's a shock to us in the same way that it's a shock to the other characters. The ending of the book was changed to be in line with the "moral code" for Hollywood films at the time, but the resultant, somewhat bizarre ending, is probably more shocking in retrospect than March's original ending would have been. There have been many horror films over the years with endings somewhat similar to March's. There haven't been many that end in quite the same way that The Bad Seed does.While the film would certainly require a bit of adjustment for many younger modern horror fans, it is well worth watching, especially if you've become acclimated to slower-paced, dramatic, understated horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another '50s movie way ahead of its time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the closing statement says, "This motion picture presents a premise that is daringly different."It may seem to be a self-indulgent thing to say, but in 1956, a film about an angelic looking child named Rhoda Penmark (the remarkable Patty McCormack, whose performance is absolutely brilliant, vicious, and mercurial...she transforms with ease from a sweetie-pie to a bristling monster and back to a sweetie-pie), complete with cutesy dresses, disarming curtsies, and blonde braids, who in fact is a homicidal, amoral murderer, was indeed "daringly different". After the generation of Shirley Temple's angelic dresses and bouncy curles and darling dimples, the idea of a perfectly beautiful little girl being a chillingly cold killer is unnerving to say the least. I love this movie, the controversy surrounding its theme: is a murderous personality inherited???The book HIDEAWAY by Dean Koontz may have been inspired by this classic B&amp;W film. Koontz describes the malefactor in that book in much the same way little Rhoda is contemplated in this film. Something missing in their genetic codes. "The fundementals of nucleotides, DNA proteins..."As in HIDEAWAY, where the reader was shocked to discover that Vassago's grandpa was a maniac who slaughtered his family, we discover in THE BAD SEED that there was a grandmother back in Christine's (Nancy Kelly) family who methodically murdered her own brood and then calmly left the country, never to be heard from again.Just the sight of little Rhoda in that infamous scene with the ex-con/yardman LeRoy is enough to have your hair standing on end: "YOU GIVE ME MY SHOES!!! THEY'RE MINE!!! GIVE THEM TO ME NOW, LEROY!!! RIGHT HERE TO ME!!!" Ooh!!! {{{Shiver}}}!!! That is one nasty little seed, that is!!! And not one any sensible person would dare mess with. Poor LeRoy learns this the hard way.Not a film for the easily upset or faintish. It's not a horror movie, but laden with truly horrific scenes. The "daringly different" premise is brilliant and far ahead of its time of the sweet, Mrs. Cleaver 1950s.A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assured portrayals of real characters in an amazingly chilling film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we have here is a fantastic classic horror film, which benefits from great performances from all concerned and a plot not typical of serial killer films. The film doesn't adhere to convention and builds its story around an idea that was frightening for the time - and still is to this day. The murderer in this film is as evil as any other; the only difference being that here the killings are committed by a decidedly amoral child. The film presents a good portrait of its star, as it presents its ideas very much from a child's point of view. The young girl doesn't see what she's doing as wrong as she is always given a reason to pass on the blame for wrongdoings, and this always comes across in a plausible way. The plot surrounding the atrocities is even more interesting than the central idea, as we follow the torment inflicted on the girl's mother. The situation that Christine Penmark finds herself in is the stuff of nightmares; just what can you do if you find that your eight year old child has committed murder? The Bad Seed makes excellent use of this dilemma, and the fact that it's incredibly easy to buy into the plot ensures that The Bad Seed prevails as an potently chilling film.The film is based on a stage play by Maxwell Anderson, and this comes across often as the film takes place in just a few settings and the whole thing is very stagy. This is, however, to its benefit; as the locations make the whole piece more claustrophobic, and the fact that we don't see the murders themselves benefits the film immensely as it allows the audience to spend more time considering the implications; which are what the film is actually about. The main reason why this film works so well is down to a great performance by talented child actor Patricia McCormack. McCormack presents a portrayal that finds exactly the right pitch between the sweet and innocent youngster that she appears; and the dark persona that lies just beneath her exterior. Nancy Kelly similarly gives a defining performance as her tortured mother, and excellently puts across a torrent of emotion. The acting is typically melodramatic, but all the cast somehow manage to keep their acting down to earth. Every scene in the movie is perfectly pitched and nothing is wasted as we are continually taught more about the characters and their situations. The climax to the film is fabulously poetic, despite being implemented on the producer's orders and overall, I really don't see much wrong with this film. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though Flawed and Stagy, Still Chilling After all These Years - Part One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Bad Seed" years ago, circa 1970, for the first time, and have seen it periodically over the years. When I first saw the film, as a child, I found the film, expectedly, quite chilling. I saw it again this afternoon, after not having seen it for about three years, and still find it quite disturbing. Now that we have IMDb, I decided to offer my thoughts. And so, I was shocked to find SO MANY comments about it...more than for any other film that I've reviewed on IMDb to date. If I add anything of unique value, great. If not, I'm happy to share my review anyway.Certainly, there are flaws, or perhaps only "unique differences", in this film. Primarily, it can very easily be considered a filmed play, as the staging, the dialog, and the entrances and exits of the characters throughout the film seem to be lifted directly from the stage version. Therefore, some may find the film a bit too sterile or unnatural in many ways. However, I think it is this very sterile, staged, stark-from-a-production-standpoint quality that gives the film an even eerier and in some ways far more realistic edge than might be found were it to be produced today for film, with far more slick and sophisticated sets, dialog, camera work, etc. The realism and pronounced disturbing quality of this version stems from the simple story itself, the psychological horror of which could be in some ways obfuscated from a much more sophisticated, big-studio, modern-day production. As for the subject matter itself, I know that the number of cases, historically, involving child murderers is actually low. Therefore, some critics have argued that to take a relatively rare phenomenon, such as the child murderer, and build a motion picture around it, portraying it in the vein of plausibility, can be misleading and dangerous, giving the impression, especially to younger viewers, that child criminals are more commonplace than you may think. I wholeheartedly reject this notion. The whole purpose of acting is to portray the entire range of the human condition with as much truth as possible, no matter how rare or commonplace certain aspects of human behavior might be. Though child murderers may be few in number, it's an area worthy of as much exploration, in film, as is an ugly, unrealistic alien telling us to "phone home" or the sinking of the Titanic. Even though this film possesses a definite "campy", staged, and perhaps even "cult" quality, it is chillingly effective. One reason for which this film works is due to the character of Rhoda herself, played by Patty McCormack. The smiling, blond, blue-eyed veneer of the child juxtaposed with the idea of her criminal potential (and actions) is just plain "creepy". Moreover, the less you see, in terms of the actual crimes she commits, the more you conjure. And, you continually wonder who her next victim will be. Furthermore, you wonder how many people will eventually "come on to her" and become aware of whom she is, and how that knowledge will affect their fate.Another reason for which this film works is because of the mother, Christine, played by Nancy Kelly. As we slowly watch her become aware of what has become of her daughter, we can't help but empathize with her predicament and her decision in handling it. The first few times I saw the film, just as I felt that Patty McCormack's portrayal and dialog delivery were probably mere replicas of what she offered on stage, I felt that Nancy Kelly's performance was affected and probably lifted directly from her work on the stage (I've never seen a stage version, nor have I read the book, yet). But in the case of Ms. Kelly, watching her realize what she has ultimately given birth to and raised is very heart wrenching. Moreover, I have always wondered if the use of her right hand was a direction given to her by either of her directors (for play or film), or if it was something she came up with herself. Two instances come to mind. In the first one, the manner in which she hits the table with her right hand as she listens to what is happening outside near her shed while Rhoda plays "Au Claire de la Lune" on her piano is very pronounced, appears somewhat odd and is perhaps symbolic. She seemed to be pounding her hand not only in outward denial and anger at the realization she now has of what her child is capable of committing, but as a means to torture and punish herself for having given birth to her in the first place. In the second instance, Nancy Kelly used her right hand again in a very pronounced manner when she offers Rhoda her vitamins "that night". Again, I couldn't help but wonder what symbolism she wanted us to draw from her gesture. It might be said that this very hand, which once comforted and fed her child all her life, has now become the tool that feeds the ultimate fate of her child toward the end of the film. (Again, not having read it, I have a fairly good idea how the book ends).As for how the ending/epilogue in the film was handled, practically everyone on this site who has offered a review knows that the use of the "casting call" was basically dictated by the mandates of the Hays Code. I'll just add that I find that the chilling effect of the story carries over to this bizarre "epilogue". I still find it a bit unsettling to see each of these actors take their bows, especially considering that some of the characters they portrayed would, in my estimation, appear stranger to a child than does Rhoda....particularly Leroy, when he bows to the viewing audience carrying his large pitchfork.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The devil wore dotted swiss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor 1950's classic that holds up well fifty year later. The film does have its flaws. Occasionally it has the feel of a staged play--at times it seems Mrs. Penmark has to answer the door every five minutes so as to get the other major characters on screen. The Freudian psychobabble and the altered ending add an unnecessary half hour or so to the running time. And the acting can be very overwrought (although the scene in which Mrs. Penmark is screaming in the apartment as Leroy screams outside--both counterpointed by Rhoda's untalented but very loud rendition of "Au Clair de la Lune"--is a moment of high camp horror on par with anything in "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?") Still the movie works, largely because of Rhoda, the eerily self controlled little murderess who despite her sweet smiles always looks at though her hair is braided a bit too tight. It helps that an actress was cast who was cute enough, but not too pretty--Patty McCormack looks like a miniature gargoyle when she drops the sunny mask and starts roaring. Leroy, the leering simple minded caretaker is almost as unsettling--the scenes in which he sadistically taunts Rhoda almost amount to a very twisted flirtation, as he is clearly more delighted than appalled by her capacity for evil (at least until he learns just how far this capacity goes).I haven't seen the 1980's remake, but I can't see how it could top the original, if only because evil little girls in jeans and T-shirts just aren't as scary as evil little girls with hair bows and starched frocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vividly memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My daughter, Rachel, always found this the most frightening movie she ever saw, and from a psychological perspective, it's easy to see why. Patty McCormack is magnificent as charming but evil first-grader Rhoda Penmark. Nancy Kelly is terrific in some scenes, but almost comically overwrought in others, as Rhoda's gradually terrified mother. Paul Fix deserves special mention in a strong performance as Kelly's father. And, Eileen Heckart is also a standout as the grief-stricken mother of a boy that we suspect Rhoda of killing. But, my personal favorite character is LeRoy, incredibly portrayed by Henry Jones. This is a characters I have never forgotten from the moment I first saw this one in the late 50's. "That Rhoda is smart, almost as smart as me", he repeats for the camera several times in obsessive fashion. The ending which differed from the play has disturbed a lot of purists, but I think it has a lot of merit. Altogether, I give it 8 out of 10, very memorable and extremely well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unusual &amp; Effective Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With some familiar elements of classic thrillers plus some creative turns, this is an unusual and effective thriller. Patty McCormack is memorable as young Rhoda, and the rest of the cast succeed in making their characters react believably to some nearly unbelievable situations. The story moves slowly enough to build suspense carefully, while still holding your interest the whole time.For this kind of story to work, it has to keep the tension and uncertainty without becoming obviously implausible or annoyingly overplayed. In "The Bad Seed", we see the tension and fear that build in the characters as the story develops, but events also unfold within an atmosphere that otherwise would be peaceful and normal, making for an interesting contrast that helps to maintain a good balance.Unlike the many banal movies made in recent years about serial killers and the like, "The Bad Seed" also contains some substance. The characters, especially the mother (played by Nancy Kelly), not only have to make difficult decisions, but also must fearfully attempt to understand the reasons for everything. It's a good example of how well a thriller can work when carefully made without a lot of extraneous elements, and it's a demonstration that a movie can have a tense, dark story without being shallow or superficial at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Rhoda Wants, Rhoda Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that stands the test of time because of the period in which it was filmed, its methods of filming and acting, and the level of knowledge of the subject matter at that time. It is truly a period piece and as such, it is a powerful chiller-thriller.A hit on Broadway, 'The Bad Seed' was translated into film as though it were a play; hence various commentators speak of its staginess and sometimes overwrought acting as if they were serious objections to the enjoyability of the movie. But does anyone complain that 'Dracula' was stagy and overwrought? No, because the movie is classic in and of itself, and so is 'The Bad Seed'.Translate your mind back to the early nineteen-fifties and 'The Bad Seed' takes on new levels of meaning and challenge. Christine Penrose, whose military husband is called away from home, is raising her darling daughter Rhoda on her own when things start slowly coming apart. Rhoda is the perfect eight-year-old, a pretty, intelligent and very affectionate child, in crinoline dresses and blonde braids, to whom everyone around gives praise and, often, gifts. She is always grateful and loving in her delight with what she gets. What is wrong with this picture? Rhoda wants something very badly, something she feels she won and has been unjustly denied, something that disappeared when its owner died a sudden, tragic death. So why does it turn up in Rhoda's possessions? Christine Penmark has no idea what is going on. Children were not believed to have mature personalities according to the psychology of the day, and the case of Leopold and Loeb was brutal and startling, and apparently a singular aberration, just a few years before the play debuted. There was then no way to explain what Christine begins to perceive: that Rhoda takes what she wants if she can't charm her way to it, and anyone who gets in her way she simply 'removes'. This wasn't supposed to happen in the 1950's. Today we may be more reliably informed, especially to the statistics that point clearly to the 'nurture rather than nature' explanation, but Christine is alone with her manipulative little murderess with no world-view to encompass what she faces. Her confusion and denial aren't weaknesses of character but the product of the general understanding of the day.It is not until she has a chance encounter with a criminal psychologist who posits the 'nature, not nurture' theory of criminality, and then digs more deeply into the dark secret of her own childhood that things begin to add up, and Christine Penmark herself unravels in as ghastly a manner as her life has done.The play is in black and white, and so are the performances and the ethics and morality of its message. Rhoda has only two sides to her: the apparently good, affectionate, perfect angel and the manifestly evil, selfish, deadly crocodile-brained killer. Patty MacCormack is excellent in the dual portrayal, and her performance as a child actress is an achievement seldom rivaled and never bettered.Nancy Kelly's utter devastation, step by step, is carefully crafted and touched with a dread terror that recognizes, though never states, that Christine knows that she herself is not safe around Rhoda, let alone anyone else. Her response to that knowledge is telling; she is the mother of a murderess, after all.The performances of Henry Jones as the unsavory handyman the audience ends up wanting Rhoda to put out of our misery and Eileen Heckart as the bereft and alcoholic mother of Rhoda's dead schoolmate are both stand-outs. Again, look to the time of the filming. People had no access to the psychiatric and sociological services both of these two characters needed in spades. People like them were out there in the 50's, more of them than we -- five decades or so later -- want to think, and without help or restraints we expect to come naturally now. Terrifying or pitiable, they were there when the movie was made.I read the book before I saw the movie, so I expected the original ending and was somewhat disappointed that it was changed. But the add-on tag is yet another level of good v. evil, one the audience might embrace emotionally if not intellectually, and perhaps more reflective of other beliefs of the 1950's, also.Beware if the Penmarks move in next door. They may not be good neighbors, no matter how much they smile and compliment you. After all, it runs in the family. Oh, and as Christine Penmark had to do, take a long look at your own....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eileen Heckart Is Heartbreaking ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as the mother of the drowned boy.... a performance that must rank with the best of the 1950s. Heckart repeated her stage role in the 1956 film with Nancy Kelly and Patty McCormack as the mother and daughter. Henry Jones (also in the stage production and excellent), Evelyn Varden, Gage Clarke, Paul Fix, Joan Croyden and Jesse White are good in support. Jones and Varden are especially good. William Hopper is and always was BLAH. But Eileen Heckart is superb as the drunken, crushed woman who knows there is something more to her son's death than she is being told. Her two scenes are riveting as she lurches across the room, begging for information, yet totally in control of the situation. Kelly, McCormack, Jones, and Varden are also good (if stagy) in their roles. Kelly seems hopelessly hammy but grows on you even though she seems to be imitating Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard most of the time. Great film, literate, interesting, riveting..... a must!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moral conundrums</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE) What a flock of moral conundrums this little movie throws at us. Rhoda is every bit a little girl. She is not evil. Basically, no one has to fear turning his/her back on the child. Well, almost no one; the point being she was never out looking for a victim. (SPOILER) This is the key point that LeRoy (Henry Jones) misunderstood about her, which proved to be a fatal mistake. He thought he could see right through her because he thought she was just plain bad, like him. She wasn't "bad" in the normal way of things. She loved her dolls and toys. She loved to read fantasies and have her mother read to her at bedtime. She loved to play imaginary hostess with her new tea set. She loved for adults to make over her. (BIG SPOILERS AHEAD) In this story there are three people we know she has killed. The little boy who won the penmanship medal she felt she was more deserving of. Old Mrs. Post in Baltimore, who promised the girl her fish bowl when she died. And, of course, Leroy, who threatened her. She was capable of great lies when pressed for motivations, but was unafraid and even forthcoming if her cover collapsed. To her there were very logical reasons for her acts. (SPOILER) That's what LeRoy missed. Had he realized that when she had reason, she would stop at nothing to achieve her purpose, he would never have turned his back on her after he threatened her security. The conundrum here is that she is only different by degree than many typical everyday people who dodge thoughts of right and wrong when it suits their purposes. (SPOILERS) When her mother realized Rhoda had committed murder, she told the girl to go ahead and burn the incriminating evidence. Her grandfather had let his daughter grow into adulthood without letting her know about her shocking roots. Her teacher, perhaps the only one who really understood what was going on, just asked the mother to move Rhoda out of the school, rather than going to the authorities with her suspicions.Then there was the bigger conundrum of our own attitudes about children. Rhoda gave out exactly what she thought the adults wanted from her - and she did it very well. She was the unreal, dream, story-book, Shirley Temple-like, non-sexual, pretty little girl people love. When things heated up, she by-passed the subject by turning on the "little girl language" the adults would eagerly eat up. Her selfishness was considered cute and natural. (SPOILER) Even at the end, most of the adults in her life looked on her as that wonderful story-book little girl. We do that a lot in this world, assessing one another by pre-determined stereotypes. Had Rhoda been publicly exposed, there would have been a clamor to analyze her behavior for the warnings we could look for in other children so "this kind of thing can never happen again." Many normal, innocent, sweet, pretty little girls would soon find themselves subjected to cruel psychological behavior mod preventive therapies. Sound familiar?Patty McCormack was phenomenal as Rhoda. You could see her "reading" adult faces for reactions to her words. You could watch the evolution of decision cross her face at key moments. Hers was never the face of sinister evil. But she portrayed real childhood; and she portrayed determination; and she portrayed hate; and she portrayed jealousy, anger, and rage; and she portrayed happiness and glee. Patty McCormack did not portray Rhoda as any one-dimensional troubled child. There was a depth to her performance that was every bit equal that of any adult, legend or not, in any movie before or since.</fullReview>

The way she would look and smile whenever she lied made me think about how bad of a person she was and the look in her eyes also would show how she knew that she could manipulate anyone who got in her way. feel that for it's time it was a very good movie. It had to do something right, since it was nominated for an Oscar. So in all despite the comment prior to this one, I do feel that it was a very good movie.

Excellent plot, acting, and characters. Patty McCormick is excellent as Rhoda, a cunning, charming girl with an evil mind. Other stand out performances include Henry Jones as Leroy the handy man, and Eileen Heckart as the grief stricken mother. The black and white makes the film even more surreal, and the acting is very intense in the scenes- just the way I like it. Little charming Rhoda proves that you have to be careful of sweet little girls. Beware and run !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Justifiable Homicide? Second Take Thinks Just Maybe.The Bad Seed 1956This is not a horror film, or a psychological thriller, not really. It's a kind of frightening parlor play, a small dramatic piece (based on Maxwell Anderson's actual play) that is less about the girl and her deviance than about the mother and hers.For Nancy Kelly is a complete wonder as the tormented Donna Reed style mother in The Bad Seed. Maybe she reminds me a little of my own mom, a 1950s paradigm of middle class civility and culture, not quite stuffy, not quite earthy, but warm enough and funny enough to be lovable from a handshake's distance, with what was once admired as reserve, or poise, or simply a lack of excess. These are all things that we need to feel about this modest and deeply feeling woman, trapped (in the Eisenhower-era) in a domestic home (a palatial apartment) with her one child. If this were set in a tough urban setting, or some hick stereotype of a back country farm, we wouldn't be quite as shocked. But in the house next door, no way.As 8 year old murderesses go, Rhoda certainly stands out. This precocious, cute villain is played to the precious hilt by Patty McCormack. She is so sweetly heartless (or heartlessly sweet) it chills and astonishes anyone who can keep from thinking of it is total camp. It isn't camp at all--to me, camp, and kitsch, are more willed than conditioned--and between McCormack's insouciant brilliance (she's ten during filming) and Kelly's hemorrhaging doubt, it's too much to take. You want to cry out and interfere. The one character who is not clueless, the mother's father, is so lifeless he contributes only some facts to his slowly suspecting daughter. And the one character who might help, the funny and unflappable and ever wise aunt living upstairs (played with perfection by Evelyn Varden) is clueless. Another two or three of the cast make caricature appearances that are part of the farce, but most remarkable must be the hired help, character actor Henry Jones. What did he tell the littler girl? "You're so cool you couldn't melt butter."Did I say that Kelly is a complete wonder yet? Well, Patty McCormack will blow you away, too, even a second time around. And these two actresses are the movie.Don't forget, this killer gene didn't actually skip a generation, did it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For most of the sequences ,the actors seem to be on stage ,but when you deal with such a far-fetched screenplay ,it does not matter .Anyway,the final cast and credits is a clever answer from Mervyn Le Roy to those who would blame him for the "staginess" of his movie.And if it were not enough,the director,imitating French director HG Clouzot at the end of his classic "Les Diaboliques" ,urges the audience not to spoil the ending!So I won't either! The movie was almost entirely filmed in studio and the scenes a director with a lesser talent would have shown are left to our own imagination .The lines are often so precise we really "see" the scenes which are told,almost in the same manner as the mother's bedtime stories.For people who like "diabolique" "hush hush sweet Charlotte" " whatever happened to Baby Jane" or "lady in a cage" ,this is a true delight from start to finish .Patty McCormack set a pattern for vicious nice little girls to come in plenty of horror movies in the seventies and beyond and even in TV series ,the likes of Nellie Oleson.She magnificently overplays ,and although her character is incredible ,she will win you over.The "it's not over when you think it is" trick is at least used three or four times ,climaxing in the scene with a divine intervention.best use of the French old folk song "Au Clair De La Lune"To be savored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky movie classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS THRGHOUT:This is a horror movie classic and strongly recommended to fans of horror movies/psychological thrillers etc. Bad Seed is an old black and white movie and a chiller about a girl named Rhonda who isn't exactly a happy, sedate child. To say the least.This is one of the oldest horror movies I've ever seen-and a great one!It does horror the way it SHOULD be done. Bad seed is a very chilling movie and Rhonda is quite scary. Any horror fan who wants to see a truly chilling movie should check this out. I have introduced many a horror purist to this and they always like it.Obviously horror movies are made quite differently now and usually aren't in black and white but maybe some should be as the mood is set from the beginning. This is a movie that doesn't need any special affects to scare. It's pretty chilling all on it's own. The atmosphere in this is right on the money. To sum it up with one word to describe it would be "spooky". It is one of the better scary movies I've seen and it would be extremely difficult for me to envision any horror fan of any age not liking this,it's a dark creepy chill fest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though Flawed and Stagy, Still Chilling After all These Years - Part Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the following paragraphs could not be included along with the rest of my review, here are my final thoughts.In the end, I think that this film works, and is definitely worth watching. As great as "The Exorcist" was, which for me is the definitive "horror flick", "The Bad Seed" is in many ways more chilling, perhaps because its story seems even that much more plausible than someone's being possessed by the devil. This film is, to a degree, definitely flawed. The dialog is a bit affected, and the character of Kenneth Penmark, played by William Hopper, is just too vapid. Moreover, the entire conversation among Christine, Monica, Richard Bravo (Christine's father) and Monica's brother appears completely "planted" and a bit awkward, though obviously serves some measure of establishment into Rhoda's character as well as foreshadowing. Even so, you will not forget this film. You might even parody some key lines throughout your life, as I have done. ("You're the prettiest mother", "Give me back those shoes, Leroy", and "Good Morning, Miss Fern", while making a curtsy).Overall, I highly recommend this film, and it should be watched periodically over the years, because you'll always catch something new, and want to study each character's contributions and mannerisms, even though the film is clearly stolen by Patty McCormack, Eileen Heckart, and, most especially, Nancy Kelly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Now there's a little ray of sunshine, that one."An occasionally riveting movie from the 50's about a sunny, charming, sociopathic little girl and her mother's desperate attempts to protect her and hide her nature. The Bad Seed sometimes makes the mistake of focusing too much on the dull adults, but overall, it's a solid movie. Good acting all around, and unlike similar modern movies like Orphan, The Bad Seed gets better as it goes along instead of imploding into an absurd mess. It feels a lot like a play, which is natural due to its evolution from novel to stage-play to film.&nbsp;I thought The Bad Seed was a sinister (and relatively timeless) gem of the 50's, and I'm sure it was quite controversial in its time. The ending was changed because of the Hays Code, in fact, and feels a bit like a cop-out as a result, but not to the extent of ruining what came before.&nbsp;Check it out if you're interested.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Pure Evil Emanate from the Environment or Does It Originate from Heredity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cute little eight-year old Rhoda Penmark (Patty McCormack), with the long blonde pigtails and big blue eyes, seems like any typical child her age. She always wears dresses, is polite, and even curtsies. Rhoda can even roller skate. But anyone that crosses her the wrong way is in danger, danger for his life. Rhoda is not beyond lying, cheating, or murdering. The scratchy-voiced, strained and suspicious mother Christine (Nancy Kelly) suspects that she herself was adopted into the nice Bravo family from a family of criminals. Is it possible that she has passed on her evil genes to Rhoda? After all, the amoral child has no conscience: she can readily read a child's book right after causing a drowning or she can play a musical piece on the piano after causing someone to burn to death.The Bad Seed may have been a bit talky and theatrical as it was adopted from a Broadway play with many of the original actors. For instance, ten-year old Patty McCormack reprised her role. Nevertheless it can be a bit unnerving for any parent of a young child who wonders how she will turn out. The subject matter is so difficult and the tension so obvious that the film director had the cast take bows after the movie's end. Both Patty McCormack and Eileen Heckart deservedly received Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress.By the way, what does the Nordic-looking Patty McCormack have in common with Cathy Carr, Dodie Stevens, Little Peggy March, Penny Marshall, and Bernadette Peters? The answer is that they are all Italian-Americans. Patty McCormack was born Patricia Ellen Russo in Brooklyn, New York.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That ideal looking family of the 50's might not be so ideal after all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>is what you'll be thinking after you watch this one. This film was trying to emulate what TV audiences found so appealing on the small screen at the time - the half hour or one hour weekly playhouse shows that brought a high quality stage production into your living room. Remember movie competition with TV was fierce at this time.The movie succeeds at parodying the premium that people of the 50's put on conformity to conventions so as to not stand out from the crowd and therefore being deemed "normal" whether you are normal or not. Because here disguised in blonde braids, an innocent smile, and a ruffly almost symbolically white dress is a human without a conscience - a sociopath. Worse, the sociopath is only nine years old. She wants what she wants when she wants it, which is not so unusual for a child. What is unusual is that she'll commit murder to get it. They don't have to be major things either. If she sees anything at all she wants and you are standing in her way, she removes you as dispassionately as one would remove a wall during remodeling.The problem is, this is no child of the slums. Instead she is being raised by a loving Leave-it-to-Beaver like mother in the most middle of middle class environments. The father is somewhat absentee, but he is so only because of military assignments. The mother knows what she has on her hands, though not at first. The wonderment of this film is watching Rhoda's mother discover the depth of Rhoda's true evil self and also discover a possible although controversial reason why she is the way she is. She has two problems at cross-purposes here. On one hand, having a conscience herself, she wants to protect society from Rhoda. On the other hand, being a mother, she wants to protect Rhoda from society's reaction to her. Oddly enough, she's not afraid that Rhoda will get the electric chair or even go to jail. Her worst fear is that she'll be locked up and studied and stared at as the human oddity that she is. Being different was the worst thing you could be in 1956.So here, on the surface, we have an ideal 50's housewife, the daughter with perfect manners, the patriotic husband serving his country. Underneath that surface we have murderous rage, secrets kept from grown children about their own identities, a suicide pact of sorts, and a tranquilizer pill popping and peddling neighbor to boot. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the Stage's a World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bad Seed," 1956's shocker about a homicidal little girl, is another of those motion pictures that, regrettably, a modern audience can't view in the same way as it could have been seen by those who were alive upon its release. So much more is known now about human psychology, and the world has been witness to child soldiers, school shootings, and other crimes perpetrated by children on both adults and other children that the film's shock value has diminished since 1956.Still, the movie deserves some credit for broaching a topic that, in its time, was both novel and disturbing. It remains a well-acted piece, aided in no small part by having most of the Broadway cast transplanted directly onto the big screen for this effort. And by having the main character be a ten year-old *girl,* who seems outwardly as sweet and perfect as a character out of a Norman Rockwell cover from the Saturday Evening Post, it still plays against one's expectations of how children are supposed to behave -- and what can lie beneath the surface of those childlike appearances.It is not, of course, without its flaws. As many of the other reviews have noted, it does almost nothing to disguise its stage origins -- characters are forever entering or exiting doorways, there are set-piece moments and speeches for many of the characters (Leroy the handyman even talks directly to the audience a few times), and one can imagine exactly how even the outdoor scenes, such as the picnic by the lake, would be done on stage, likely with a small spotlighted scene on an apron alongside the main stage. It's too bad that director Mervyn LeRoy didn't try to open up the picture more than he did, so that it wouldn't feel as if the movie were filmed while being presented in a theater.Still, what redeems "The Bad Seed" even for today's viewing audiences is the marvelous acting -- both Nancy Kelly as Rhoda's mother and Patty McCormack as the title character herself are wonderful, and McCormack, who must carry a number of scenes, is remarkably poised for a ten year-old. The film also benefited from having the likes of Eileen Heckart as the mother of the little boy Rhoda is suspected of having killed for a penmanship medal that, throughout the story, she just can't seem to give up.And for those who grew up in the television generation, there's the added pleasure of spotting a number of actors who would make their marks later on television, including future Perry Mason sidekick Paul Drake (William Hopper), Frank Cady, who would play general store owner Sam Drucker on "Petticoat Junction" and two other television series in the mid-1960s, and the ubiquitous character actor Henry Jones as Leroy, the only character who can see through Rhoda's facade of sweetness. Indeed, in some ways Rhoda presages Eddie Haskell of "Leave it to Beaver," alternately obsequious around adults and creepy around his peers. Considering that Leroy describes himself as the only person who's "just like" Rhoda -- something of a sociopath himself -- Leroy is the one character who allows Rhoda to show herself as she is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spare the rod and spoil the child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strange, quirky movie. Based on a stage play, several scenes in the film are very talky and they must have lifted several scenes directly from the play. Rhoda is such a devil child yet oozes sweetness, but I found her mother to be the stranger of the two. In fact all the grown-ups are played for fools by Rhoda. Even though we never see her do any of her dastardly deeds, we never once believe that she did not commit them. Backed up by a good supporting cast, and perfect casting by the way of Patty MaCormick, the movie does succeed. Despite her evil deeds, I felt rather sad when her mother gave her the sleeping pills. What I also found even more bizarre was her mother apparently shooting herself in the head and lives. What a bad shot yet her head is covered in bandages by the end of the film. The ending, when Rhoda gets electrocuted was almost comical. Now you see her, now you don't! The tacked on ending was rather silly with everyone taking a bow and Rhoda's mother spanking her. Give the audience credit for knowing the difference between real and make believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true classic which depicts a childhood sociopath like no other movie of its time. While the age of the protagonist (brilliantly played by Patty McCormack) may be a "stretch" (an advertised 8 year old), it nonetheless presents the contrast between a "good front" and "true evil." Rhoda is simultaneously the world's "perfect child" and evil incarnate, one minute pretending to host a "tea party" and the next, "palming" some matches to create more mayhem.Nancy Kelley superbly plays a mother who only begins to comprehend the depth of her child's psychopathology, and the neighbors (especially "Aunt Monica") remain delightfully "blind" to the "true Rhoda." Henry Jones (as "Lah-roy") plays a supposedly "simple-minded" yet crafty handyman who nicely sees through Rhoda's "false front." His creation of the fictitious "stick-dog" is unbelievable (yet somehow briefly frightening to Rhoda).Eileen Heckart, though she only has a few scenes, steals the movie portraying the bereaved mother of Claude Daigle. Frank Cady (alias Mr. Drucker from "Green Acres") plays her husband who nicely "tends" to his wife during her moments of despair (uttering a classic line, "Come Hortense" when it's time to drag his inebriated wife out of the Penmark apartment).This is a movie that is worth seeing, again and again</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again I found myself watching this film on TCM despite the fact I have seen it numerous times. There are many issues (mentioned by other commentators)that make this film hard to take given today's aesthetic. Yes it is "stagy", yes the acting is mannered, yes the main idea of the film is no longer shocking. Despite all of this you simply can't help but watch.The performances are truly wonderful. Kelly, McCormack, Jones and Heckart are all exceptional and the fact they and others played this on the stage shines through. They work as a well-oiled machine. Nancy Kelly is very over-the-top in parts but this must be viewed in the context of the style of acting at the time. Further, watch her performance multiple times and pay close attention and I think you will find her reactions are not so far-fetched in the context of the story, as she gradually realizes what her daughter is capable of. I used to think McCormack was too arch, but on further viewings it is clear this is a well thought out performance and very effective, one of the best children's performances I have seen.Beyond the acting, the film places a question that is very relevant today -- what drives children to commit unspeakable acts -- in a very simplistic setting. The frame work forces the viewer to consider the basic question of why and more importantly how would you react if you came to understand your offspring were evil.Don't be afraid of the things that make this film out-dated and stylized, instead give it a try and you won't be able to resist watching it again and again.</fullReview>

She is, that's true, but in the same way Faye Dunaway chews up Mommie Dearest and we all know what a hoot that is. Little Rhoda is a real stinker. The handyman had better "give her those shoes." The subplot of the mother's own identity is fun too. All in all, the movie is very 50s. You can almost see Wally and the Beaver coming down the street. Great! There is also some discussion about the formal introduction of the cast at the end which I've always found a very nice touch. Much older films of the 30s used to do that all the time. It's been said this film did it to show the characters were just flesh and blood actors and so their roles and the subject matter (especially Patty McCormack) shouldn't be taken seriously. See it. By the way, there is one review on this site by someone who says they saw the movie at age 12 that is very negative. Don't believe it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie should not be a filmed play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed by this movie which is a real icon from the 1950's, but it wasn't because of the story or the acting. I hadn't realized that before 'The Bad Seed' was a movie, it had been produced successfully as a play. Of course, lots of movie are adapted from plays, with all varying degrees of success or failure. But I don't ever recall seeing any movie which was as close to a filmed play as this one is. Let me tell you, this doesn't work, in my opinion. The acting techniques used here are all more suitable to the stage than to the more intimate, subtle medium of film, and little if any of the advantages that film has are used here.This is too bad, because it's a good story with fine actors. To be sure, many won't find the things I'm complaining about annoying or even noticeable. This was rather daring material for a major motion picture in the supposedly staid 1950's, and it has the same effect on viewers today who are used to seeing shows like 'Father Knows Best' from that era. The acting, though more appropriate to the stage, is all very good. I've heard some criticism of Nancy Kelly's performance at times, but she's doing what is required of her in this theatrical performance. Eileen Heckart is especially fine no matter what the circumstances are. For my taste, though, I wished they had adapted the story better to the medium of the motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No wonder Warner Bros. did its best to soften the theme with a curtain call epilogue. After all, the notion of an angelic little girl as a cold-hearted murderess was about as far from Ozzie &amp; Harriet 1956 as a theme could get. Not that the film is all that believable. The acting among the adult principals is pretty stagy, as though they're trying to reach the balcony. While, the otherwise excellent Henry Jones (LeRoy) camps it up as if he'll be otherwise overlooked. Little Rhoda (McCormack) certainly looks the part, especially in that white frou-frou. Plus she sounds appropriately heartless when her sweet Snow White turns into the Wicked Witch. On the whole, however, the movie doesn't wear well. It's too much like a stage play-- lengthy, talky, and static. No doubt, the theme was daring for its time, though the notion of a "bad seed" strikes me as not only dubious but pernicious, as well. As a result, I'm not sure whether to commend Warners or not. Anyway, the movie remains a curiosity, so it may be viewable on that basis.</fullReview>

The true ending had to be flipped and flopped to the detriment of the material and the post "The End" shenanigans almost ruin everything experienced before.Overall this is an interesting relic that should be applauded for its daring subject matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's something distinctly unsettling and familiar about this pigtailed little sociopath. Rhoda (ably played by an 11-year-old Patty McCormack) reminded me of when (as a child myself) I encountered one of these intelligent, prim, beautiful and deadly little spiders. My innocence at the time spared me the goosebumps I get now.A key component that works in this is the loss of trust. Once it's gone any normal relationship is doomed - sooner or later - to sleeping (assuming one can) with one eye open. The lies and doubts pile up until there are no reference points as all the depth markers disappear.Structurally and cinematographically the film is unremarkable for its time, but the story is generally compelling, the dialogue well paced and the atmospherics are conveyed discreetly enough that we scarcely notice as the plot and players engross us.The story moves slowly because it has to, at times it seems interminably slow - perhaps it was better as a play. To only get audio and Christine's face for the cellar incident was masterful. Nancy Kelly's expression tells us everything as she is visibly crushed between what she knows and her love for her daughter. The film is worth the time spent as it accelerates towards the end with the speed and momentum of a falling piano. When a plot fools me I invariably enjoy the film. However just when it should have naturally ended, it kept going. Even so it was entertaining.A generally good supporting cast with outstanding performances by Nancy Kelly, Patty McCormack and Henry Jones. If you like plotty thrillers that hint and use the viewer's imagination, this film will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still think of this haunting story and especially the heartbreak of both mothers. Heckart's crying and ranting is so heart wrenching. And then Nancy Kelly's realization. The acting is superb! Again showing how the 50's was an important decade for "actors' films". But the epilogue with curtain calls was the most disturbing. It never fit for me, but I've remembered it since I saw it in the 60's. I've always talked about that with friends--not the plot. When I finally read the book I was sorry for the plot change, but this had to do with the censorship. What a different attitude towards "horror": no punishment dealt out was not allowed. Quite a different social era. The music, or lack thereof except the melody "au clair de la lune", adds to the macabre atmosphere--desolation, emptiness and very subtle. No weird camera angles, but some unforgettable shots. Black and white, but never dull. Patty McCormick can't be praised enough for her performance--boy did we hate her character in the film which is risky business for a child actor! No Shirley Temples here. But the film hangs on Nancy Kelly and her character development, BRILLIANT!--when does that happen nowadays in action packed films? Never could see it again, and when I saw Bogdonovich's "Last Picture Show" I felt the same horror of people trapped in a fate/moment they can't change. My review is prompted by a 15-year old's suicide. In the documentary about the incident the children of the school were interviewed! The boy's uncle payed for his ashes to be sent into space with Gene Roddenberry's--he was a Trekkie, after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It leeched onto me from the very first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this back in the '60s when all that was available was late at night was a television. I wasn't feeling very well and couldn't sleep. As I recall my mother recommended this film. I was not into slow moving dramas but because I was a pre-adolescent male I developed a quick crush on Patty McCormack. She is so cute and proper. How could you not just want to hold her? But then the plot unfolds and your preconceptions of this cutie are ripped away. She is so evil. I hated that she made me fall for her and then shredded my reality. I knew this was 'just a movie' but she was so good in the role that I lost myself in the illusion. And then that ending came. Wow! I didn't like that at all. I was very upset and my mother could see that. She tried to engage me in conversation but I declined and went to go lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. I didn't sleep that night. I was haunted forever. When the movie was repeated later that year I declined to watch it. I couldn't take that trip again. Many years later, more like decades, I watched it again. Some of those old memories came back but I could distance them. This film is really quite a gem. For me, it has lost nothing of the disturbing quality - which is entirely its whole intention. Patty is still cute as the dickens --- and then she kills. The shell of very grim despair covers this film. None of the characters are flawless though and I ended up with a new perspective that the little girl ended up being a product of the dysfunctional environment. It's a bit of a difficult film to categorize. Is it horror? I was horrified. But compared to today's definition of horror it doesn't quite gel. It is definitely a stage drama but keeps waltzing out of generic drama every time it creeps back into horror. It most assuredly plays on the psychological. Hey, I might actually know someone like this -- and I'm not talking about ONLY the little girl here. Even today I do not think this is something I would invite just anyone to watch. It will disturb younger kids and even some adults. I would think most teenagers would not have the patience to sit through this. It has been compared to Hitchcock in some aspects, but I usually have a good time with Alfred. It is a disagreeable film. It is not fun. But it is powerful and has continued to concern me for over 40 years. The last film to do this for me was Lynch's "Blue Velvet" - but he didn't have any cute little girls in that. That quality alone puts this one into another realm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The overall look and quality of The Bad Seed was beautiful, the black and white visuals are incredibly deep and mise-en-scene perfectly juxtaposes the evil of Rhonda. Many reviews note the almost campy acting on the part of Nancy Kelly, but her acting is still sea levels above the acting in most thrillers today. Perhaps the most impressive element in this movie is the acting of Patty McCormack, who plays Rhonda, her obsessive behaviors and believably terrifying calm throughout the movie are incredibly well portrayed. Showing its time, the film was apparently forced by the "Hays Code" to change the ending in which Rhonda would have lived which was unacceptable at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bad Seed (1956)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure what to make of The Bad Seed (1956). After watching it I was definitely satisfied with the film overall, but there were some things I would have changed. First of all, the film takes much too long to get started. It's not until about forty minutes into the movie that the little boy who Rhoda drowns is discovered (and the real story takes off). The director should have shown some grim opening scene to peak the viewer's interest; possibly shown the dead body of one of Rhoda's victims. Also, once we figure out that Rhoda murdered the boy, her mother just pulls a story out of nowhere that informs the audience of someone Rhoda had killed in the past. This was not very subtle. I could have gone without the mother's dream, and realization that she was adopted. If less time were put into that aspect and more into the character development of Rhoda, she could have been a much more frightening little girl. There were some scenes that were unpredictable. I wouldn't have guessed that the mother would shoot herself, nor would I have guessed she would survive! I feel the ending was somewhat of a cop out though. It would have satisfied me more to see the mother be the one to take Rhoda's life. But to get struck by lightning?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW!!!! Rhoda is seriously the freakiest child i have ever witnessed in a movie; she is a little demon child. I really enjoyed the actors performances. everyone did a terrific job in creating a very realistic feel to the plot. I was honestly scared for anyone who was around Rhoda alone. I don't know if it was just how parents were during that time, but Christine was an absolute pushover. It was just one aspect of her character that constantly bugged me. Granted Patty McCormack gave Rhoda a persona of pure evil and dominance.I was totally shocked by Christine's attempt to kill Rhoda, after she had been so unassertive throughout the movie. Of course at first i believed both Rhoda and Christine to be dead, but again i was shocked. not only had Christine not killed herself, but Rhoda had also been saved. This made me think of the code, which does not allow any illegal acts to go unpunished, even if the villain is an eight year old girl. I was not unsatisfied to see that the final scene is of greedy little Rhoda venturing out to the lake to get the medal that, in her mind, was rightfully hers, where she gets what she deserves when she is struck dead by lightning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this movie gets categorized as Horror, I think it's more fittingly a psychological thriller... I think the main Horror elements are mainly missing - there is no grime, no true monster, merely the fallout of the murders. The main thing that carries this movie, in my opinion, is Christine, who slowly realizes that her darling daughter Rhoda may not be what she seems.From the beginning of the film you get the feeling that Christine doesn't trust her daughter fully - perhaps explained later in the film by the fact that she already has half-formed suspicions that her daughter killed their previous landlady. The horror of this movie is the horror we see in her face when she realizes the truth - her daughter is a sociopathic killer, devoid of emotion, who has killed a boy for a tiny trinket - a Penmanship award. The heartbreak and guilt in her face as the boy's grieving mother comes over is quite unnerving. This is a much more subtle movie than simply a "evil child murders people" film.Psychology is very present in this film, as the characters discuss the merits of the theory that certain evil tendencies can be passed on genetically with no amount of nurture able to change it. That's where the title comes in - Rhoda is a "bad seed," born without conscience, doomed by the genetic legacy of her murderess grandmother. I'm not sure if these theories hold up scientifically in modern day of not, but the "nurture vs. nature" debate is certainly still ongoing.This is a must watch if you prefer psychological horror and subtle suspense to outright gore. This "horror" is not an absurd fantasy - it could happen with anyone, anywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad to the Bone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently caught this on TCM for the umpteenth time and was amazed at how well it holds up after over 50 years. Yes, its dated in its style and acting, but it still packs a punch and is entertaining as hell! I wont bother to mention the plot as everyone else has described it well enough. A 50's mother begins to realize her perfect little daughter isn't what she seems. And on a parallel plane, she also comes to realize her own past is not what it seems. And when these 2 plot arcs finally merge, you have one hell of a climax. Director Mervyn LeRoy made the decision to film this as the staged play it once was. There were few attempts to open it up and few close ups. The film is composed of mostly medium shots. Most of the Broadway cast was also imported for the film and act accordingly (to the upper balcony). Particularly lead Nancy Kelly as the put upon mom. Her hand wringing/chest beating performance is over the top, yet it works wonderfully in this 50s setting. It's too bad the censors made them change the ending. But even the changed ending packs its own wallop. This piece of Eisenhower Americana (turned on its head), hints at the tumultuous 60s decade ahead. There are wonderful bits by Eileen Heckart, hilarious and heartbreaking almost simultaneously as the drunken, grieving Hortense Daigle (who came up with that name? LOL) and Henry Jones as the mentally challenged handyman (who catches on quite quickly to the goings on when the so-called smarter characters are still clueless); Evelyn Varden as the nosy, psychoanalyzing landlady, and of course, Patty McCormack giving one of the most chilling portrayals of childhood mayhem ever put on screen. Alex North's score helps the proceedings immeasurably. As an artifact of the 50s and precursor of many film genres since, this movie is hard to beat! Even the tacked on Let's Meet the Cast (It's Only A Movie!) epilogue cant spoil it. It's a great ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Seed Sprouted Oscar Nominations -Bad Seed ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific film showcasing the talents of a variety of thespians.Patty McCormack was quite convincing as the little brat who is capable of almost everything. Nancy Kelly, as her doting mother, is memorable but the real kudos for this film went to none another than Eileen Heckart for her memorable work as the hysterical mother losing a young boy to a murderer. Could McCormack be the killer? McCormack was just too much of the goody-goody. She really poured it on, but at times, you just wanted to slap her. Another great performance here was by Evelyn Varden, the doting landlady completely taken in by Rhoda. Henry Jones was given the role of a lifetime as the janitor Leroy whose simplicity masked a man able to unmask Rhoda, only to pay for his life for his actions. Heckart gives a near perfect performance as Mrs. Daigle, consumed with guilt, beyond being consoled as she sat on that couch and doted over the child she lost. Both Heckart and McCormack received best supporting actress Oscar nominations for their work. There both being nominated probably opened the door for Dorothy Malone winning in the memorable "Written on the Wind." Malone was deservedly awarded the statuette, but a case could have been made for Heckart's emotional outpouring in this classic film. Some things in the film were made very conveniently, such as Nancy Kelly, with her soft voice with the yes dear attitude, discovering who she really was. Nevertheless, the movie was a good one as we are forced to think about heredity versus environment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil Is, Evil Does Exist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most gruesome films ever put on screen is The Bad Seed. But as terrifying as it is, The Bad Seed teaches a lesson that has to be reinforced every so often. That pure evil does indeed exist and there are no root causes in environment for it's being found. You find it here in the amoral child Rhoda Penmark, and you will find it in real life in such disparate individuals as Osama Bin-Laden or Charlie Manson.We are fortunate indeed to have all the principal cast members from the Maxwell Anderson play that ran 334 performances on Broadway during the 1954-55 season. Nancy Kelly, Patty McCormack, Henry Jones, Eileen Heckart, Evelyn Varden, and Joan Croyden all came over from Broadway to repeat their roles. In the case of Nancy Kelly she won a Tony Award for her performance as the overwrought army wife who comes to the horrible realization she's raising an amoral monster. Henry Jones made his film debut in The Bad Seed.When the film opens we see what looks like an all American family with father William Hopper leaving his wife Nancy Kelly and daughter Patty McCormack for some army detail that will take him away for a bit. The family lives off post with landlady Evelyn Varden.McCormack is a strange child who doesn't seem to show real emotion like most of us though she makes a big show of affection when it suits her needs. When a boy from the school she goes to drowns and later a medal that boy won for spelling is found in McCormack's possession, Kelly is frightened out of her mind.The acting in The Bad Seed goes to levels of excellence rarely attained by a whole cast. It's as if the cast were a functioning machine, each part reinforced by the other. They all feed off each other's excellence. Nancy Kelly was nominated for Best Actress and Patty McCormack and Eileen Heckart were nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Heckart rules when she's on screen as the distraught mother of the drowned boy who's doing a little drowning herself in gin. Kelly, Heckart, and Joan Croyden who is the school principle all have suspicions about McCormack, but no one can prove a thing.Henry Jones who played so many delightful rustics on the screen is an evil handyman who suspects McCormack of the foul deed also. But it's different with him because it's a case of takes one to know one. He gets dealt with in an interesting fashion. The Bad Seed is a timeless classic, it could be updated and play today, tomorrow, the next century, the good and the bad nature of humankind doesn't change. The best summation of this film was actually delivered in another film, The List Of Adrian Messenger by George C. Scott when he comments that, "evil is, evil does exist".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This must have given Fifties parents nightmares...still horrifying today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been criticized for its staginess, and the characters seem almost laughably naive today. But seen as a fascinating period piece, this once shocking play still possesses a disturbing power. The idea of an eight year old murderess is still unsettling, and most of the credit must go to actress Patty McCormack, who is chilling in the role of the homicidal Rhoda Penmark.Nancy Kelly has the challenging task of carrying most of the movie, and ably conveys a mother slowly breaking down under the gathering suspicion that her beloved child is a calculating killer. If at times her acting seems a little too overwrought or stylized, bear in mind that acting styles have changed in the fifty years since this play was first produced on Broadway. I have seen the movie several times over the years, and was actually quite impressed with Kelly's performance in my most recent viewing.What mother wouldn't seem pretty over the top in her behavior, faced with the unbearable truth Christine Penmark must cope with alone? Someone else pointed out that today, various social and medical services and help would be available to people in traumatic situations, that fifty years ago simply didn't exist. The mother is desperately alone in her crisis.Eileen Heckart is genuinely uncomfortable to watch as the drunken, grieving mother of Claude Daigle. I felt she was absolutely convincing as the tragic character she played. People have used the word " heartbreaking" to describe her, and I agree completely.The film has a good, ominous musical score by Alex North, solid direction by Mervyn LeRoy, and excellent supporting performances, especially from Evelyn Varden as the doting landlady Monica, and Henry Jones as the sly, vaguely sinister janitor, Leroy.The Bad Seed has its share of awkward moments, dated ideas and unintentional humor. But the overall impact is quite powerful and it certainly deserves its reputation as a disturbing thriller. People disagree on whether it can be properly classified as a horror movie, but I think the description fits pretty well. Patty McCormack's star turn as the homicidal little girl is one of the creepiest portrayals I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film again last night and can't count how many times I've seen it. What I find fascinating is the that two leads, Nancy Kelly and Patty McCormick don't seem to fit with the talent of the rest of the cast, most of whom are very good character actors. McCormick plays the role of Rhoda as if she's in the stage play, but on film it comes off as over-acting. Nancy Kelly is too whiny and seems to swing back and forth between being terrified and oblivious, with no middle range. One minute she thinks her daughter is a murderer and then next she's leaving her alone to go grocery shopping if there's nothing wrong. If she's trying to convey denial due to the love she has for her daughter, it doesn't work.There are a couple of scenes that don't seem to accomplish anything as they end with someone having to go to dinner or lunch so everyone can just ignore the fact that they believe this child to be terribly disturbed and possibly worse. In this instance maybe we should consider the times in which the film was made.Something just doesn't flow right for me, yet, I watch this movie almost every time I catch it on television. I can't explain why, but maybe that was the intention of the film maker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Absolute Evil Is An Eight-Year-Old Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mervyn LeRoy's "The Bad Seed" of 1956 is a fascinating, macabre and very original Horror Drama, which is in no way effected negatively by its staginess, and the brilliant leading performance by Patty Mc Cormack is certainly one of the greatest child performances I have ever seen in a movie.Eight-Year-Old Rhonda Penmark (Patty Mc Cormack) appears to be the well behaved and kind little girl most parents would want as a child. Especially the family's landlady Mrs. Breedlove is delighted with the little girl's good manners and kindness. When Rhonda's military Colonel father (William Hopper) has to leave the family for a while to work, however, Rhonda's housewife mother (Nancy Kelly) starts to notice some very eerie things about her little girl...Based on a novel, "The Bad Seed" was a play before Melvin LeRoy filmed it, and the movie is indeed quite stagy in many aspects. This movie's staginess, however, does not effect it in any negative way, if anything it even enhances the atmosphere. As mentioned above, the performance by Patty Mc Cormack is superb, one of the best child performances I have seen. Mc Cormack manages to portray the epitome of evil as a little girl in a brilliant way. The rest of the acting is also very good, Nancy Kelly is great as the mother, Evelyn Warden, who should also be known for her role in Charles Laughton's "The Night Of The Hunter", fits perfectly in her role of the friendly elderly landlady and Gage Clarke is excellent as the malicious janitor Reggie.I would have easily given this movie 10/10 stars if it wasn't for one minor flaw. I usually don't write comments with spoilers, but it is inevitable to do so in order to give my reasons, soWARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD!"The Bad Seed" is an excellent film about the macabre topic of heritable evilness, and it would almost be a perfect film if it wasn't for the movie's ending. Petty Mc Cormack's portrayal of an eight-year-old serial killer could not be more brilliant, but the ending, which had to be changed due to the stricter moral code of the time, is unfortunately a bit ridiculous. Mervyn Le Roy originally intended the movie to have the same ending as the novel, which ended with Rhonda's mother dying and Rhonda continuing her evil murderous deeds. The 'Hays Code', which was a moral standard for motion pictures at the time, however, didn't allow for movies to let criminals get away with their crimes. Therefore crime couldn't go unpunished in a movie, which lead to a rather cheesy last scene. The movie could have certainly been even more brilliant if it had ended the way it was first intended to be. That doesn't mean the ending scene is terrible, however, it is just not quite as brilliant as it could have been. The movie remains an excellent, original and macabre film, and not only Horror-lovers, but every lover of film should see it.All said "The Bad Seed" is an excellent, and quite unique Horror experience that should not be missed by any fan of Horror or film lover in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throwing tantrums</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 'shocker' was meant to put the fear of God into us back in the fifties as a study in pure evil, (the killer is a child; a 'sweet' little girl in pigtails). Actually, it's hugely entertaining though the child's murderous streak never seems to be nay worse than a bad case of the tantrums and Patty McCormack as the nasty little tyke is very good at throwing them. In fact, for such a load of piffle, it's very well acted. Much of the cast had already played their parts on Broadway and were well-versed in their roles. Nancy Kelly is terrific as the put-upon mother who realizes her little girl may be a murderer. She wrings every ounce of pathos out of the part and is about as moving as the ridiculous material allows and Eileen Heckart, (as the mother of one of Patty's victims), and the wonderful and under-valued Evelyn Varden as the landlady are both first-rate. McCormack is great fun even if she does play to the gallery. The censors chickened out at the end and downplayed everything that went before reminding us that, after all, it was only a movie.</fullReview>

The biggest question she must face though is, if her daughter is truly a monster, what is she to do next? The ending is contrived. The book and play's endings were more appropriate.

		<fullReview>Ahh, The Bad Seed. Patty McCormack, Eileen Heckart, Henry Jones--acting doesn't get any better than this. A spine-tingling portrait of a true antisocial (psychopathic) personality--no conscience, no guilt, no humanity to speak of. What makes this movie all the more creepy is "Rhoda's" outward appearance as a cute, innocent-looking little girl with blond hair and pigtails. There is no visible sign of a monster inside. It's very interesting that this movie, made so long ago, brings up the age old question of nature v. nurture--a riddle we still haven't really solved all these years later. We can all take a lesson from Rhoda though, in keeping in mind that people are not always what they seem...and with a psychopath, if and when they strike out, you'll be amazed that they were capable of such behavior--but by then, it might be too late. Ooooh spooky stuff! Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Kelly and Heckart did receive nominations, although I think Kelly's performance was too over the top, although if a mother found out her daughter was a cold-blooded killer, she very well might have an emotional meltdown as Kelly was attempting to portray.

Many of the cast members were actually in the play production. So when you combine the stage-style of acting and Rhoda's character, it is a bit campy even though it doesn't try to be, but that makes it good. Some might criticise the acting, but I thought it was amazing, and if you research the awards and nominations the cast has received for the performances on stage and screen, you'll see that others thought so too. This movie's theme was way ahead of its time. I wish I could go back in time to watch the audience's reaction when it was in the theatre. This is one of my favourite movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mervyn Leroy directed this campy melodrama that stars Nancy Kelly as Christine Penmark, a seemingly happy wife and mother who comes to believe that her daughter Rhoda(played by Patty McCormack) is a heartless killer after a schoolmate of hers(who had won a prize she felt was hers) is found dead at a school picnic, and she now has possession of it. Eileen Heckart plays the boy's distraught mother, and Henry Jones plays the house grounds-keeper who also suspects the truth. William Hopper plays the oblivious(and mostly absent) Mr. Penmark. Acting is so arch or over-the-top that viewer may wonder if this is intended as a dark comedy, or misfired drama! Entertaining to a point, but not to be believed, with a truly silly, self-defeating wrap-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE BAD SEED has an interesting post "THE END" bit where a voice says "Ladies and Gentlemen, just one moment" and then every single actor who played a part is introduced. After this, there is a banner which says: "You have just seen a motion picture whose theme dares to be startlingly different. May we ask that you do not divulge the unusual climax of the story. Thank you." The film is overacted and overlong. The acting is over the top and cheesy (I don't understand the 7.2 rating). NANCY KELLY's acting is just plain awful. The scenes with her and her father (PAUL FIX) are truly hilarious with both of them trying to outdo each other. Frankly, some of the supporting characters were more irritating than the villainess - especially, EILEEN HECKHART who plays the drunk mother of the dead boy.There are some interesting bits like the discussions on the nature of criminals. PATTY MCCORMACK is quite good. But the cast is up to its neck in over the top actors and undoes all the good work done by PATTY. HENRY JONES as LEROY JESSUP, the gardener is the only exception. The scenes where LEROY and RHODA clash were quite amusing rather than sinister.(5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Suspenseful Film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is important for children to be raised with important role models that'll model and shape their behavior throughout their entire lives. It's important for children to be raised with manners and not become selfish, conceited, uncaring brats that'll do anything to lie, cheat, steal, or murder to get the things that they want.The overall acting in the movie was excellent. The perfect timing of the character's action with their portrayal was great. The suspenseful plot kept me interested and kept me wondering what was going to happen to the actors throughout the film. The overall lighting on the character's faces was soft but well focused. The use of the natural light shining through the windows of the home with the reflective shadows on the wall is fantastic. The back lighting in full shadow on Rhoda in a climatic scene was really good. The cinematography throughout the film was great. The slow moving close up scenes were shot well and displayed the characters well through all the dramatic climatic scenes.I would recommend anybody that's interested in watching a dramatic suspenseful mystery to watch this movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ham-Fisted Histrionics Surround One Mean Little Girl in a Spirited, Stagebound Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overwrought histrionics usually indicate a level of desperation with the material, but it is hard to resist the often over-the-top performances found in this sturdy, entertaining 1956 melodrama based on a Broadway hit by Maxwell Anderson two years earlier and a best seller by William March before that. Directed by Hollywood veteran Mervyn LeRoy and adapted by screenwriter John Lee Mahin, the movie's lofty credentials lend substance to the story's central notion of nature versus nurture when it comes to absolute evil, although the entire venture never feels like it left the stage.The subject is eight-year old Rhoda Penmark, the unctuous pigtailed daughter of Christine, a nervous mother whose own origins have remained a mystery. With her immaculate crinolines, Rhoda displays the smarmy etiquette of a trained android, plays abominable piano exercises and repeatedly asks her parents, "What would you give me for a basketful of kisses?" Something is amiss, however, when one of her classmates, Claude Daigle, turns up dead near a pier. A much sought-after penmanship medal calls to question Rhoda's role in the death, and then other deaths start to occur.LeRoy imported most of the Broadway cast for the movie, and apparently no one told them to tone it down for the cameras. The chief culprit is Nancy Kelly who plays Christine constantly wringing her hands, clutching her stomach and rolling her eyes in an otherwise escalating state of hysterics. By comparison, ten-year old Patty McCormack is almost subtle in showing Rhoda's malevolent culpability once you get past the artifice of her appearance. The supporting cast includes ham-fisted turns by Evelyn Varden as the irritatingly dense landlady upstairs, Henry Jones especially wild-eyed as slow-witted janitor LeRoy, and Eileen Heckart in the film's best performance as Claude's alcoholic mother Hortense. In her two brief but masterful scenes, she brings a palpable desperation to her character that taps into a deeper pain of personal loneliness and social exclusion.The film ends in a most contrived manner with a tacked-on curtain call by the cast that seems aptly ridiculous now. The 2004 DVD provides a pristine print transfer that enhances the sharp black-and-white cinematography by longtime veteran Hal Rosson. Moreover, there is an eminently entertaining commentary track by McCormack (now about sixty) and cross-dressing actor/writer Charles Busch ("Die, Mommie, Die!"). Much of the information provided is repeated in a fifteen-minute featurette, "Enfant Terrible: A Conversation with Patty McCormack", and a making-of short and a vintage trailer complete the extras.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting Performance by Patty McCormack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the Broadway play, the ending had to be toned way down to satisfy the rigid requirements of the Hollywood Hayes office of 1956 when it was made into a movie. Which is a shame as the first ending; quite apparent to the viewer, thank you Mervyn, is far better and much more satisfying.That said, this is still a stunning portrait of a child ? Rhoda Penmark (played by Patty McCormack who so deserved all the accolades accorded her) who is a complete narcissist and sociopath. She would probably be diagnosed with severe autism in today's world. She is literally incapable of feeling and will commit any crime to mold the world to her liking.In light of today's more sophisticated audience, the film owes much to its stage roots, but so do a lot of other good films and whether this adds or detracts from the enjoyment of same is entirely up to the taste of the viewer. Films are nearly always adaptations of some other media, whether books or plays, musicals or operas. And apart from the above mentioned tacked on Hollywood ending, this movie transitions well from stage to screen.For its time "The Bad Seed" shocked and appalled viewers. No one was quite prepared to believe this angelic, beautifully dressed polite little girl was guilty of wreaking so much unfeeling horror.Nancy Kelly plays Christine Penmark her mother, who lends great depth to a part which calls for her to slowly descend into unbearable grief and madness.Eileen Heckart plays Hortense Daigle a grief stricken mother, who manages to ring every drop of pathos from the character and also give one of the best portrayals of a drunk ever recorded on screen.William Hopper, son of the famous Hedda, has a small role as the absent father and other wonderful Hollywood bit players complete the cast. Mervyn LeRoy directed. Hard to believe he also directed the sweet and lovely "Little Women" ? the classic 1949 version - before "The Bad Seed."Not to be missed, a classic of its genre. And the music is haunting. 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though Flawed and Stagy, Still Chilling After all These Years - Part Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the following paragraphs could not be included along with the rest of my review, here are my final thoughts.In the end, I think that this film works, and is definitely worth watching. As great as "The Exorcist" was, which for me is the definitive "horror flick", "The Bad Seed" is in many ways more chilling, perhaps because its story seems even that much more plausible than someone's being possessed by the devil. This film is, to a degree, definitely flawed. The dialog is a bit affected, and the character of Kenneth Penmark, played by William Hopper, is just too vapid. Moreover, the entire conversation among Christine, Monica, Richard Bravo (Christine's father) and Monica's brother appears completely "planted" and a bit awkward, though obviously serves some measure of establishment into Rhoda's character as well as foreshadowing. Even so, you will not forget this film. You might even parody some key lines throughout your life, as I have done. ("You're the prettiest mother", "Give me back those shoes, Leroy", and "Good Morning, Miss Fern", while making a curtsy).Overall, I highly recommend this film, and it should be watched periodically over the years, because you'll always catch something new, and want to study each character's contributions and mannerisms, even though the film is clearly stolen by Patty McCormack, Eileen Heckart, and, most especially, Nancy Kelly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic 50s Greek tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would you do if you discovered your pre-adolescent daughter had murdered at least three people? How would you feel if your fear of being adopted was true, and your real mother was a serial murderer, as is her grand-daughter?This classic began as a novel and play in the 1950s and was fairly faithfully adapted to the screen (except for the ridiculous "moral" ending, tacked on by censors). The premise homicidal instincts might be inherited was shocking and controversial then, before Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacey made Rhoda's acts seem like child's play...The production is rather stagy but that doesn't bother me. Nancy Kelly gets her money's worth of hand-wringing and hysterics, but put yourself in her shoes. Your daughter is a ruthless murderer and she inherited this trait from you. Even after you confront her with your growing knowledge she murders her third victim and he burns to death in front of your eyes. What's a mother to do?Patty McCormack steals the show as calm, calculating, manipulative Rhoda, the charming, well-behaved little girl who acts the perfect child with most, unless you have something she _really_ wants. Relish her baleful stares, disturbingly candid remarks ("Why should I feel sorry? It was Claude Daig le got drowned, not me!"), and total indifference to the enormity of her actions, pounding "Au Claire de la Luna" on the piano to an almost unbearable volume and tempo to drown out her mother's screams.All of the supporting cast is excellent, with Henry Jones and Eileen Heckart shining in their roles. Even dough-faced William Hopper (of TV's Perry Mason fame) manages to pull off his (luckily) small role as Rhoda's loving and completely duped father.This movie can be viewed as a camp classic and you can laugh at Rhoda's hijinks and requisite reactions from Mom, or accept it as the melodrama it is and feel the increasing tension between Rhoda and her mother as the story unfolds to its inevitable conclusion (except for the tacked-on "end"). I do both depending on my mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It's one of those you can watch over and over and discover new things. I watched it again last night, for at least the 20th time since childhood, and I still noticed subtle character nuances I've missed before. It takes a long time to get used to the acting of Nancy Kelly, and for years I suffered through it to enjoy the rest of the movie, but now I see it as a fine bit of acting as a woman learns her child is a murderer.I've read the book this movie is based on, and as usual there are some plot changes, but it's a fabulous adaptation and I'm hard pressed to say which is better, book or movie. If you are one of those, like me, that loves old black and white movies, this is for you. A great glimpse into the past, it looks like things did when I was a kid, well, when I'd visit older relatives' homes, in any case. I like that, being taken back to a simpler time, before cable TV and PCs.Eileen Heckart is absolutely wonderful in this picture, as the mother of the murdered boy. She is the wreck I would be if my child died. Always a fulfilling actress, she fleshes out this movie with a stunning portrayal worthy of close attention.Paul Fix is his usually comforting self in this film. William Hopper, 50's eye candy. Henry Jones is aggravatingly likeable and turns in a fine performance too.Patsy McCormick, the murderous child, bears close watching in this movie, sweet one minute, horrible the next, loving while looking you in the eye, making faces when you're not looking.Please check this movie out, watch it intently, with no distractions, or you could miss something.</fullReview>

I suffered with Mrs. Penmark, was amused by Monica, thought Leroy was hysterical and cried with Mrs. Daigle. She marvelously represented every woman who has ever buried her child. But, Miss Rhoda truly frightened me. Patty McCormack did an unmatched job of playing a demon incarnate.

		<fullReview>Another one of those late night classics I "sneaked in" when I was eight, (when I was actually supposed to be in bed), THE BAD SEED still packed quite a wallop. Now, forty-some years since its release, the staid, somewhat static presentation certainly belies its stage play origins, and some of the acting borders on MST3K campiness. But it still retains much of its original ghoulish charm, and those only familiar with the noxious TV movie remake should definitely check out the original.Christine Penmark has a great life with a handsome, successful husband in the military, (PERRY MASON'S William Hopper) and the cutest daughter anyone could be lucky enough to have, Rhoda. With blonde pigtails and fetching freckles, Rhoda is precocious, charming, polite, gregarious, outgoing, vicious, vindictive, manipulative, calculating, homicidal...She's DENNIS THE MENACE with a sex change on a 'roid rage bender; Damien Thorn's demonic sibling in a pretty summer frock. She easily dispatches several of the cast members with the same kind of shrug and smile she would use to ask for milk and cookies, and Christine begins a little intuitive detective work, searching her own troubled past for the clues to why, as Rhoda's crimes and her darker nature become more and more horrifyingly apparent...Controversial in its day, I wish I could've been in the audience who attended its premiere. And the morality code be damned, I never accepted why they tacked on the "shocking" ending, though the times being what they were, I do understand why it was unavoidable. All I knew is that at the young age I was when I saw it, the concept of a little girl evil enough to make GOD strike her dead, scared the absolute Hershey squirts out of me!Most of the cast is from the original Broadway production, and though the acting seems more geared for the stage than screen and therefore appears to be overdone, I thought Nancy Kelly was fine as the emotionally disintegrating Christine. Considering what she discovers about Rhoda, as well as what she learns about herself, it's a wonder she wasn't MORE freaked out!Henry Jones as Leroy should've damn well been honored with a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the very least. He made such an impression on me, that for years afterward, I always thought of him as "toasted Leroy." And Eileen Heckart balanced humor and histrionics with tightrope precision as the mother of the little boy who becomes Rhoda's first victim. Though you can't help but laugh at her at some points, your sympathy for her pain is always palpable.It would be hard to do a bad movie with all these veterans around, and Mervyn LeRoy knew that. It's only too bad he didn't attempt to open things up a bit more to let the movie out of its "playhouse" cage. Still, it remains a classic, in spite of the fact that with what kids are capable of today in places like Santee and Columbine, the subject matter is sadly enough, no longer sensational or unique. Which is a lot more chilling realization than this movie could achieve for today's audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although, after 43 years (as of this writing), "The Bad Seed" tends to creak a bit, it still ranks with some of the best chillers of all time, and the stagebound, one-set atmosphere only adds to the suspense.The performances are what really make this film. Although Oscar-nominee Nancy Kelly goes more than a bit overboard as Christine Penmark, the rest of the cast are all right and perfect for their roles. Patty McCormick still exerts a chilling presence as murderous little Rhoda ("She killed the critics . . . and most of the cast!" Jerry Lewis remarked on Oscar night. "She has a date after the show with Peter Lorre, this child!"), Eileen Heckert perfectly conveys alcaholic dispair as Claude Dagle's bereaved mother, and Paul Fix is his old, reliable self as Kelly's journalist father with a terrible secret. Towering above them all, however, is the late Henry Jones, as nasty caretaker Leroy Jessup, who gets his memorable cumuppance about half way through the picture. Jones, who died earlier this year, was never Oscar-nominated for this role, and it's a shame. In many ways, he's the best thing about the picture.Even though the tacked-on-at-the-behest-of-the-Breen-Office ending wasn't in the original play, it doesn't matter. This is still a first-class thriller!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the first ever evil child movie. Patty McCormack plays Rhoda, a sweet little child with a penchant for murder. On a school field trip, a boy drowns. McCormack's mother, Nancy Kelly, begins to suspect that her daughter may have played a part in it. This subject must have been exceptionally shocking back in 1956. It had to have been really hard to accept. I'm guessing this because the writers overexplain every detail down to the bone. It drags the film out interminably. McCormack is actually excellent. Yeah, she overacts a little, but compared to most child actors of the era, she's very good. The only other performance in the film I really liked was Henry Jones, who plays the Cajun maintenance man who is, at first, the only one smart enough to see that McCormack is evil. Everyone else in the film overacts so badly that the film often becomes hard to sit through. Of course, based on a play, the film is overly stagey (it even ends with a curtain call). The final scene in the movie is also pretty unintentionally hilarious. The film was hugely popular in its time, and was nominated for four Oscars, three for acting. The McCormack nomination is understandable. Kelly's nomination is sort of embarrassing, but Eileen Heckart, who plays the constantly drunken mother of the murder victim, is one of the truly unbelievable nominations in the history of the Academy.</fullReview>

The performances range from overwrought bad acting to wooden bad acting, save the performances by Henry Jones and perhaps Eileen Heckart. Special mention must be made of Patty McCormack's performance. Some have praised it but I found it dreadful and completely unrealistic Apparently the adults in this film suffer from the same delusion Joan Crawford did in "Mildred Pierce" and are unable to see what a horrible little brat Rhoda is. The script is ludicrously bad, made worse by the terrible acting by the leading actors Nancy Kelly, Evelyn Varden, Paul Fix and William Hopper. The final deus ex machina scene is destroyed by the narrator's "wait a moment" and the introduction of the cast. It then descends into inanity with Rhoda getting spanked by her mother.</fullReview>

It actually might have been good.But - With that said - When it came to the (completely unbelievable) murderous determination of Rhoda, a mere 8-year-old (unconvincingly played by Patty McCormack) - Along with the outrageously over-the-top scenery-chewing of actresses Nancy Kelly and Eileen Heckart - The Bad Seed (whose demented, little story actually did have some potential) quickly deteriorated into one of the most laughable misfires of 1950's horror imaginable.Had The Bad Seed been skillfully edited down to just 90 minutes, then, yes, perhaps, that might have helped to save its undeniably ludicrous story-line from becoming a total write-off.But - When I seriously considered (into The Bad Seed's already-nutty mix) the Leroy Jessup character (as the absurdly antagonistic caretaker) - Along with the preposterous "lightning strikes" scene - Then I'd have to say that this film, pretty much, amounted to being nothing but absolute rot. (Yep. Right to its very core.) *Trivia note* - The Bad Seed was directed by Mervyn LeRoy, who 18 years earlier had (believe it, or not) co-directed "The Wizard of Oz".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can one be born to kill? That's the question facing Christine Penmark in Mervyn LeRoy's 1956 film The Bad Seed. The bond between mother and daughter is a strong one, so strong in fact, that it will often skew a mother's perception of reality. Even when all the evidence begins to mount against Christine, she still holds the hope that her little girl is innocent. Nancy Kelly stars as the disillusioned mother, William Hopper as the absent father, and Patty McCormack as the devilish child who's desperately trying to pull the wool over her adoring mother's eyes to protect herself from her many misdeeds.Rhoda Penmark (Patty McCormack) is the epitome of perfect; she is respectful, well-mannered, and overly courteous. She is every mother's dream, even the overseer of the apartment she lives in, Monica Breedlove (Evelyn Varden) wishes she was her own. Rhoda is the apple of her father's eye, and when Col. Kenneth Penmark (William Hopper) has to leave his wife and daughter behind for his military duty, 8-year old Rhoda is devastated. The absence of patriarch Kenneth leaves Rhoda and her mother Christine Penmark (Nancy Kelly) to manage the home together. Christine loves her daughter dearly, but when a series of unusual events begin to happen around her daughter, she begins to question her seeming innocence. While having lunch with friends, discussing whether or not people are born bad, Christine hears a radio interruption that an unnamed child at Rhoda's school has drowned. Fearing Rhoda's safety, Christine begins to panic, only for guilty relief to set in after learning it was a little boy that had died, not Rhoda. Treading softly, thinking Rhoda will be devastated that one of her classmates has died, she is alarmed that all Rhoda can think about once she is home is food. When Christine finds the penmanship medal the deceased boy was awarded that Rhoda felt should have been hers in Rhoda's jewelry box, Christine is convinced her daughter is a murderer. What is a mother to do when she finds out her precious only daughter is a cold-blooded killer, and if she has inherited that gene, from who?The Bad Seed was extremely dialogue-heavy, and it is not surprising to learn that this was an adaptation of a play, based on a book. It plays out very much like a play on screen, even ending with a cast parade, much like a play production finishes. The benefit of such a dialogue-heavy film is the poetic banter exchanged between the actors. Some of the most beautiful Shakespeare-esque insults were delivered in this film. I was overall quite pleased with this film, it was a very well-done early psychological thriller. The film's 50's period feel added to the suspense of the narrative. The film suffered a little with typical 50's over-acting, but its big Achilles heel is the need to wrap it up with a bow at the end. The ending is incredibly contrived, and director Mervyn LeRoy missed a brilliant opportunity to end the film in a far more believable and suspenseful way. I only hold LeRoy partially accountable, I understand it was 1956 and there were certain expectations for a film at the time, but Hitchcock had made 20 features by now, and LeRoy should have been more adventurous. A better ending probably would have etched this film into the history books more than it is currently. The real driving force of this feature is the bond between mother and daughter. Christine, even faced with mounting evidence of her daughter's evil deeds, is unable to accept the difficult fact of Rhoda's guilt. Much of her reluctance comes from issues with her own family and her unwillingness to abandon her daughter. The revelation of her daughter's misdeeds also comes at a time when Christine has been abandoned by her husband due to his military service. Admitting Rhoda would mean that Christine would be alone, an overwhelming fear of hers. Christine also feels responsible, as if her bad genes have made Rhoda a killer. Mothers overlook a lot of faults in their children, The Bad Seed shows just how far that blind eye will go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bad seed was one of my favorite black and white films since I was a kid. I watched the movie with my dad and really enjoyed the movie, I thought it was a really great story, a little girl that seems innocent and sweet but is actually a murderer. It is actually quite a creepy, because the little girl is so manipulative. And there is a lot of creepy of scenes like the scene where Rhoda is walking at night through the thunder and lightning storm to the lake to check on the body. The feel of the movie was very dramatic and dark lighting throughout the film to show the horror in it. The evil look Rhoda gives when her mother hugs her. The creepy man in the film who knows everything Rhoda has done but doesn't tell anyone, he just goes up to her and tries to scare about what she has done but threatens to tell the police. So she kills him later on by setting him on fire. And the mother knows its her and is very bothered by the fact that while they are watching and can hear him screaming that Rhoda is still playing the piano.The ending scene the mother knows she has to do something so she gives Rhoda some pills that kill her and then she goes into the next room we don't see her but we hear the gun shot of her shooting herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film can be said is I have seen the originator of the crimes against children, than the "orphan", "Joshua" films are slightly better. The little girl Rhoda became the killer behind is because of his grandmother is a notorious criminal. Although this view is difficult to convince, but at least give a certain explanation. Another highlight is the performance of the three actresses in the film. Plays mother Nancy Kelly and the victim's mother Eileen Heckart since Needless to said played girl, Rhoda, Patty to that kind of cold, ruthless, cruel, irritable, irritability, capricious show incisively and vividly, it is no wonder that three people get the following year Oscar performance category was nominated.As the thriller do different. Will focus into a genetic the criminal potential child, describing rarely involve children crime is composed of, which "rascals" performance is quite good,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>evil prevails with its most innocuous disguise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cinematic interpretation of William March's controversial novel, with its cast mostly borrowed from its sensational theatrical adaptation, THE BAD SEED is directed by Hollywood veteran Mervyn LeRoy and under the restriction of the Motion Picture Production Code, it changes the ending from its source novel and the play, where something as far-fetched as the wrath of God is served as the ultimate poetic justice. Having said so, a grade-A ensemble cast smashingly chews up the scenes and charges a melodrama with a salvo of scintillating magnetism, psychological suspense and cogitation with hindsight.The story is a substantial shocker, the nitty-gritty boils down to whether a child can inherit the criminal genes from his or her forebears without any environment influences, aka, become the bad seed. On the surface, the life of Christine (Kelly) is perfect, she and her hubby Colonel Kenneth Penmark (Hopper) love each other so much and their eight-year-old daughter Rhoda (McCormack) is a doll. But after a tragic incident, which cost a boy's life, happening during Rhoda's school picnic, Christine has to grip with the most horrific thing could ever happen to a loving mother, the revelation of her own descent from a notorious psychopath and murderess, and now the demonic genes have turned Rhoda into a conscienceless, double-faced killer, who perversely resorts to murder to get what she wants. What a mother should do with her bad seed?It is a hell of mental roller-coaster, most of the story, happens inside their apartment, various characters barge in and out with a flourish of imposing pretences, a typical setting for its dialogue- driven, performance-showcasing material. Three members of the cast are honoured with Oscar nominations (one leading, two supporting), Nancy Kelly, whose over-the-top acting method miraculously melt well into the upsetting plot-line, her portrayal of Christine's turmoil is just what we can expect from a theatrical dab-hand, but Kelly multiplies the magnitude with all she get and the effort is tremendously moving, histrionic in a surprisingly wonderful fashion.Nominated in the BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS category, Patty McCormack (who is co-leading on my list) is another Hollywood child prodigy whose later career is exclusively overshadowed by her star-making role, she nails this rather dark character with pitch-perfect fusion of precociousness and affected innocence. Another nominee is Eileen Heckart, who is a humdinger and upstages everyone else as Mrs. Daigle, the heartbroken and intoxicated mother of the dead boy, literally has only two major scenes, one must see her with one's own eyes to believe how emotive and powerful she is. The entire cast is swell, Evelyn Varden is garrulous as hell as the landlord/amateur psychiatrist Monica, Henry Jones is vacuously evil as the caretaker and Joan Croydon appears in her sole film work as Miss Fern, the hard-bitten principal of the school."Au clair de la lune" will never sound the same after one realises its sinister undertone, THE BAD SEED is a sensation-arousing piece of theatrics, it is immensely satisfactory (even with such a ludicrous upshot), heralds the advent of a new sub-genre of horror where evil prevails with its most innocuous disguise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Killer Kid Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A housewife (Nancy Kelly) suspects that her seemingly perfect 8-year-old daughter (Patty McCormack) is a heartless killer.I was actually much more familiar with musicians influenced by this film than the film itself. The Electric Hellfire Club sampled it for "Book of Lies", and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds took their name from the film... pretty cool. I think one can see why it is so popular.The film also received numerous Academy Award Nominations: Best Actress Nancy Kelly, Best Actress in a Supporting Role Eileen Heckart and Patty McCormack, and Best Cinematography (Black-and-White) Hal Rosson. I find this very surprising, especially the double supporting actress nominations. Of course, to my knowledge, they won none.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theatrical,well acted &amp; decently creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment we start watching the movie,we are quiet sure that the little girl is the 'evil one' or 'will do something soon'.So,let's not be delusive about the main plot.Thus,the movie boils down to acting &amp; how well the suspense is held together.Rhoda,is an 8 year old,'perfect' child,born to Christine &amp; Kenneth(a Col. in the US army) However,she doesn't have a friend circle,gets angry at high pitch &amp; WANTS the medal! Christine is a doting,semi- hysterical mother,who is as happy as she is surprised,by Rhoda's spotless behavior &amp; mannerisms.An early glimpse of this doubt comes, when Christine questions Miss Fern about Rhoda.Soon enough,we cut across to Christine's home,where a small gathering discusses about Monica's(the affable,friendly neighbor) 'Freudian problems'.The same afternoon,news breaks that a child from Rhoda's class has been found dead.It turns out,its the medal winner! Almost immediately,the audience asks,'Did Rhoda have anything to do with it?' This is followed by a heart wrenching scene involving the parents of the drowned boy,Miss Fern &amp; Christine.However,the gripping factor of the movie comes a while later,when Christine's father arrives on the scene.Theatrical in approach,but very well acted,the soul of the plot resides in those moments.The movie also has another intriguing,but a bit stereotypical character,LeRoy,the cleaner.This is a guy who wants to see the bad side of the 'perfect girl' and is constantly after her: teasing &amp; scaring her.But it doesn't end too well for him,as one of his narratives gets too close to reality.What follows is Christine's blind love for Rhoda,even as she continues to commit murders.This leads Christine to the verge of insanity,where she decides to liberate herself &amp; Rhoda from the trouble..once &amp; for all.The climax is very apt,and seems to be reminding us,"Justice will be done"The plot of the movie,rests pretty much on a conversation,that takes place near the mid of the movie.Can brutality be inherited? Is every killer born the same? Can we change them via environment? How can parenting contribute? Can a child really be a murderer? The way the movie pans out,makes it clear how the writer thinks! The rest is left up to the audience.We are also shown how the lives of the ones at the receiving end,is affected.Eileen Heckart does a terrific job as a drunk,heart-broken,insecure but doting mother.'The Bad Seed' is an engaging watch,with a pretty nuanced performance from Patty McCormack.Underrated.Worth a watch.Verdict: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad about the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it's not the director I have to blame for that illogical ending but it's the Hayes Code that spoiled the party. But if I do away that ending and replace it with the novel's ending from William March I really cannot fault this movie. Even though differing from the book as in leaving some characters out (only 1 Fern sister instead of 3 and Leroy's wife is not in the movie), adding Christine's father Richard Bravo as "living" character and scrapping the scenes where Leroy interacts with his wife; the movie captures the spirit of the book perfectly. Well the movie feels stagy which is normal because it was a play before it became a movie. Also most of the stage players would eventually reprise their role in the movie which probably shows why the characters work so well together. Really everyone plays their role sublime no one was miscast. Kudos mostly to Nancy Kelly as mother Christine and the young Patty McCormack as little Rhoda. She would eventually feature as titular character in the Mommy movies in the 1990s where she shows similar personality treats as in The Bad Seed but there as an adult. It doesn't matter how many times I watch this movie and that it is old and tame to today's standards. It's message remains powerful and disturbing. The icing on the cake are for me the interactions between Rhoda and Leroy. Both of them are interesting character studies, a mean bully versus a manipulative child that sure gives fireworks, literally! But also the case of mother Christine is seriously an interesting one and that of serial killer Bessie Denker who was based on a real killer and the inspiration of March's novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie rendition of the huge Broadway success!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've just watched this movie on Warner Bros really splendid DVD, you'll probably be surprised to note that none of the players or crew won any of Hollywood's most prestigious awards for their efforts. I would have thought Nancy Kelly a certainty for Best Actress, Eileen Heckart likewise for Best Supporting Actress and young Miss McCormack honored with a special statuette for the year's most outstanding juvenile player. This didn't happen, although all three were actually nominated. Nevertheless, the movie did become Warner's top-grossing domestic release of the 1956-57 season. The movie was based on Maxwell Anderson's stage play, rather than William March's novel. In fact, "based" is probably too flimsy a word. My estimate is that maybe even a hundred of the movie's 129 minutes, is Anderson. Just about all that screenwriter John Lee Mahin has done is to move a few scenes out of doors. Fortunately, these scenes do give an extra punch to the narrative, so I'm not complaining. However, to revert to my opening lines, I'm really surprised that the really superb acting of Eileen Heckart could be defeated by Dorothy Malone's forgettable performance in a forgettable film, namely Douglas Sirk's soapie, Written on the Wind. Likewise, both the engrossingly sympathetic Nancy Kelly and the simply brilliant and overawing Patty McCormack should never have been defeated by Hollywood's anti-Broadway lobbyists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is surprising about this film is the way Mervyn LeRoy was able to blend the ordinary with the unthinkable so seamlessly. A beautiful family living in a lovely apartment in a lovely neighborhood with helpful neighbors and the little girl with the pigtails is a ruthless killer. As Mom puts the pieces together her sanity is tested and she makes an extreme decision that doesn't work out the way she plans but I won't give away the ending because it's a "shocker". The movie is suspenseful and brilliantly acted especially by the little girl's mother whose name is Christine and she is played by Nancy Kelly. Also noteworthy is Eileen Heckart who plays the distraught and always drunk mother whose son was murdered by the little girl, Rhoda. This movie is worth watching not only for the performances but for the theme that a child can inherit sociopathic tendencies from a distant relative. Suspenseful and well executed, you will definitely be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely well acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Housewife Christine Penmark (Nancy Kelly) will be confronted with a chilling reality: the fact that her seemingly innocent daughter Rhoda (Patty McCormack) is actually a cold blooded killer. Rhoda does seem to work awfully hard at winning over people, and manipulating them. Some people are blind to her machinations, but not everybody is. The supposedly simple minded gardener Leroy (Henry Jones) knows the score. Christine will have difficult decisions to make, as she is torn between maternal devotion and grief for a victimized child and his mother.Themes of what produces evil in the young - is it heredity or environment? - are resonant in this deliberately paced but riveting film. As directed by Mervyn LeRoy, it's very obviously based on a stage work, a Broadway play by Maxwell Anderson. The performances are excellent but one can tell that they were perfected on stage. The dialogue is florid and witty, and delivered with gusto. LeRoy clearly trusts the material, always relying on the actors to sell the story without falling back on any directorial flourishes or visual gimmicks.Young McCormack, who's among those who originated their role for the theatre, truly is a talent to behold. Her character of Rhoda is slick and a tough nut to crack. Eileen Heckart makes the most of her two scenes as the victims' mother; she shows up drunk at the Penmark apartment determined to find answers. Kelly delivers a performance of real emotional power, and you believe her at every turn. Jones is superb as the smarter-than-he-looks gardener, and Evelyn Varden, William Hopper, Paul Fix, Jesse White, Gage Clarke, and Joan Croydon all create rich characters as well.The "Hollywoodized" ending does come up with a deus ex machina that may not sit well with some viewers. Up until then, things are played realistically and matter of fact.If one goes into this expecting something more like "The Omen", they'll likely be sorely disappointed.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A housewife suspects that her seemingly perfect 8-year-old daughter is a heartless killer. Christine Penmark seems to have it all: a lovely home, a loving husband and the most "perfect" daughter in the world. But since childhood, Christine has suffered from the most terrible recurring nightmare. And her "perfect" daughter's accomplishments include lying, theft and possibly much, much worse. Only Christine knows the truth about her daughter and only Christine's father knows the truth about her nightmare. It is a true classic which depicts a childhood sociopath like no other movie of its time. The overall acting in the movie was excellent. The perfect timing of the character's action with their portrayal was great. The suspenseful plot kept me interested and kept me wondering what was going to happen to the actors throughout the film. The cinematography throughout the film was great. It a very disturbing and terrifying little piece of cinema that still holds up almost perfectly to this day. The Bad Seed is a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly disturbing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you really think about the concept behind, The Bad Seed, it truly can be taken as a very dark, disturbing film, but I think that is partially why the film works. I mean, everything just fits, down to Rhoda being an only child ( the stigma that comes with only children) and her having pig- tails ( the stigma that pig tails signify innocence). What I think really worked is that Rhoda didn't die in the end, regardless of her mothers attempts, yet her mother is the one who commits suicide and dies. The director leaves the end up for interpretation in that you are lead to believe the little girl will continue to commit more murders, but one may never know. Also, the fact that she survived ingesting an entire bottle of sleeping pills is a little sensationalized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Children are Hard on Everyone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nancy Kelly reprises her stage role as a mother who discovers her daughter is really disturbed, disturbed enough to kill another person, in "The Bad Seed." I saw this in the late 1990s and I thought it was time to see it again and give it another shot, remembering my impressions of not liking it that much back then. After seeing it recently, I think I can put some thoughts down on paper, so to speak. The performances by Nancy Kelly and Eileen Heckart were very good, especially Eileen as the mother of the boy killed. I think the heartache of both mothers is what really makes the film so hard or unbearable to watch, in terms of realism and what the viewer is made to go through (in watching this.) But the biggest criticisms I have of the film is that it was too stagy and/or talky, showing its stage roots and it was much too long. And, the performance by young Patty McCormack was ominous and chilling beyond words. The agony on the mother Nancy's part was in fact very hard to take, particularly after learning of a shocking revelation, which leads her to take drastic action. Ms. Kelly won a Tony on the stage for her role and was nominated for an Oscar but lost. The script must have written by a very intellectual person as it contained several words I didn't even know what they meant, even though I'd heard of them. So, it was a well made film with good regard for its characters and their plight, but their personal torture and being talked to death really got to me by the end of the picture. Interestingly enough, the ending had to be changed for Hollywood (In the stage play, nothing was ever done about the little girl.) If you want to see how Hollywood treats little girls who murder, watch this if you must, but be prepared for over two hours of desperation and agony. Oh, and the characters will have their problems, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You would not want to be the Mary to this Rhoda....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Bright Eyes", Shirley Temple stood up to bully Jane Withers. On "Little House on the Prairie", feisty Melissa Gilbert put up her fists to defend herself from spoiled Allison Arngrim. But Jane and Allison had nothing on young Patty McCormack's Rhoda, a demon seed ever if there was one. Polite almost to the point of annoyance, Rhoda smiles sweetly, impressing her teachers with her manners, and certainly, nobody (especially mother Nancy Kelly) realizes what lingers on inside the mind of this evil being.If you ever want to annoy someone or play a practical joke, simply start humming Rhoda's theme which she plays consistently on the piano just to aggravate mommy. Love does not exist in the heart of this child, only a passive/aggressive desire to manipulate others to get what she wants. What she wants more than anything here is the medal given to a fellow student, and at a school picnic, goes out of her way to do just that. The dead boy's pathetic mother (an excellent Eileen Heckart) visits her since the boy was last seen with Rhoda, and this makes mom Nancy suspicious, especially when the medal mysteriously turns up amongst Rhoda's belongings. Grizzled handyman Henry Jones (also unforgettable) knows the evil that is Rhoda, and pays miserably for his knowledge.The very theatrical play made an entertaining movie that needed to change certain elements of the story to pass the censors, taking away some of the shock, if not the horror. Kelly, McCormack, Heckart, Jones and Evelyn Varden (as an aging upstairs neighbor who naively adores young Rhoda) all repeat their Broadway roles, and well-deserved Oscar nominations went to Kelly (Best Actress), McCormack and Heckart (Supporting Actress). The play brought up questions in regards to child psychology and as to how human minds are framed from the moment they are young, and in some cases, mental illness or evil is pre-destined. It isn't anything society today hasn't dealt with, so the power of the play has been somewhat diminished. The film was somewhat made silly by an unnecessary "curtain call" that ended on a sour note for those who had seen the play. But for the most part, thanks to the direction of Mervyn LeRoy, the film remains a solid shocker and Rhoda gives birth to future horror children, making her the perfect "Bride of Damien".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This black-and-white classic tells the fictional story of Rhoda, a charming little girl very mature for her age and well-mannered. She happens to be spoiled and has dark secrets though, such as an unknown past with a serial killer grandmother and the mysterious death of a little boy in her class who drowned. Could Rhoda be responsible? The only one who suspects it is her mother.The Bad Seed was made when very little was known about the mind of a criminal. There were theories as to what created criminals; whether it was growing up in a bad home or whether it was inherited. This movie goes with the latter. It has excellent acting, great soundtrack and even a comedic scene at the end credits where Rhoda's mom says, "and as for you..." and begins spanking Rhoda with a sick grin on her face, it's hilarious. Patty McCormick pulls of the convincing role of a creepily sweet yet disturbed child. This movie inspired films such as Orphan (2009), the Paperboy (1995), the Good Son (1993) and Mikey (1992). It's an amazing movie, I also read the book, in screenplay format, in school. Both are great and the movie is one of my favorites, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Mesmerizing After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been more than forty years since I was first enthralled by this superb thriller, and it came on Turner Classic Movies the other night and I was mesmerized and on the edge of my seat all over again, as I am every time I see it.Adapting stage plays to the screen is a risky business; sticking too close to what took place in the theatre usually gets a film labeled "stagy" by critics, and it isn't a compliment. But I see no problem with what Mervyn LeRoy did here.Apparently LeRoy saw the play on Broadway and was so taken with it that he brought it to Hollywood with all of the principle actors (Kelly, McCormack, Varden, Croydon, Jones, and Heckart) repeating their stage roles. And in directing the film, he made no attempt to have his actors tone their performances down as he might have done. Stage acting and film acting are very different: stage acting is BIG, with the cast working to make sure that everyone in the theatre, from the front row to the last row of the balcony, hears everything. It is not easy. It takes a great deal of training, and this training is on display here in a way that you do not often see in a film. The result is almost the experience of seeing the play in the comfort of your living room.The story is legend by now: Rhoda Penmark (nine-year-old Patty McCormack in one of the most chilling performances by a child ever given) is outwardly the picture of the perfect little girl, her dresses immaculate, her pigtails never out of place, her manners perfect to the point of being old-fashioned. But this little girl is an amoral predator who when she wants something is quite willing to kill to get it. The story, however, is really about Rhoda's beleaguered mother Christine (Nancy Kelly in a performance that won her a Tony for the Broadway play). She is not completely ignorant of her daughter's peculiarities when the film begins, but all she has is a vague unease. As the story progresses, she discovers things about Rhoda, and about herself, that lead to a shattering climax.Also in the cast are Eileen Heckart as Hortense Daigle, the grief- stricken, drunken mother of a little boy Rhoda has murdered, Evelyn Varden providing much-needed comic relief as landlady/busybody/amateur psychoanalyst Monica Breedlove, who dotes on the little monster and with the best of intentions never has the slightest clue what is really going on in the Penmark household.The whole ensemble is great, but in the end the film belongs to Nancy Kelly and Patty McCormack, who deliver what I consider to be two of the best female performances of 1956.This picture may not be everyone's cup of hemlock. The stagy performances make the experience unique; seasoned theatre goers will probably settle back and revel in it (as I did); film buffs may find it overblown and hard to take. But whether you love it or hate it I dare you to forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Col. Kenneth Penmark (William Hopper) is going off leaving his perfect wife Christine (Nancy Kelly) and his perfect sweet daughter Rhonda (Patty McCormack). Monica Breedlove (Evelyn Varden) is the talkative landlord from upstairs. Leroy Jessup (Henry Jones) is the simpleton handyman who has a nasty streak. He sees through the little girl's innocent facade. The mother is concerned about her callousness especially after a child drowns at school.This is an interesting horror from this era. I would have like to see this directed by Hitchcock in his prime. I think it was a minor mistake to use the stage actors for the movie version. There is sometimes a real effect that a movie star has on the screen. This movie needs that kind of star power to push it over the top. The little girl played by Patty McCormack is effectively creepy. Henry Jones puts in a complicated performance as the creep. Eileen Heckart throws in a big performance as the drunken mother of the dead child. However the ending is a problem. I understand that has to do with the code, but it just ruins it with an unnatural wrap up and I'm not talking about the lightning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this story contains a lesson it might be this: bad children should be spanked. Or maybe it is this: those that sow the seeds of destruction must reap an evil harvest. Something like that.Whatever one's philosophy on the subject, this is more a filmed play than a bona fide motion picture. It does boast excellent performances, though-- most notably by Patty McCormack as the homicidal child. However, as good as the overall production may be, it still comes across a little too stagy. A few gripes here. Some of the dialogue about psychoanalysis is rather heavy-handed. A few scenes should have been trimmed to avoid prolonging the inevitable: the title character's comeuppance. Interestingly, she does not get her just desserts in the play the way she does in the movie. I'll leave you to ponder that as lightning strikes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film Despite Mixed Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I do enjoy this film and recognize its importance on countless imitators, I did have some quibbles about it. For starters, as others have pointed out, the movie has a distinct stagey quality to it. Obviously it was based off of a play and that might account for it. It even used many of the same actors from the play. Still, one would think a veteran film director like Mervyn LeRoy would do a better job adapting it to a different medium. Another complaint I have is something that is generally seen as one of the film's positives: the performance of Eileen Heckart. She was even nominated for an Oscar for her performance. However, to me she is very over the top and unbelievable. My previous experience with Mrs. Heckart was mostly from her television work, which I always found enjoyable. Here her role is that of a grieving mother driven to drink. She is drunk in all of her scenes I believe. That exaggerated drunken behavior might play well for the stage, but on screen it comes across as a little cartoonish for such serious material.Still, despite minor problems the movie works and works well. It moves along at a good pace, telling the creepy and sometimes chilling story of this little girl who is "born evil." Time and countless other films about evil kids might lessen the impact of this story just a bit for some, but I find it all holds up quite well. Rhoda Penmark is rotten through and through. You find her annoying at first, then quickly realize there's something unnerving about her. Some might find fault with the concept of genetic evil and reject the film on that basis alone. I don't necessarily adhere to it myself but it doesn't bother me to explore alternative ideas or theories, especially in works of fiction.One final note: another complaint I've seen is that the movie changes the ending of the play and novel. Without spoiling that for you, I'll just say both endings have merit but I actually think the movie ending works best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about children that makes them so godd@mn creepy? Is it their youth that makes the aspect of horror so unique? Or is it their innocence that deceive us? I really don't know. I've been afraid of killer children all my life and I never quite understood it. I just went with it. And this movie holds up well for me. Not only is the little girl sweet, charming and just downright adorable, but she is a freaky little f*ck. Even though we've been through this whole psycho children movie thing before it's still kind of shocking that this movie was made in the 50s. And it may be the best if not the first film to have a child who is unbelievably psychotic. My only issue with it is the ending. I won't give it away but it's kind of a cop out. But in this time period I can understand why it was in the film. The audience weren't ready for it to go in this direction so the movie tried to put a big smile on their faces. It was corny but whatever. Aside from that the acting is solid. If you like evil creepy children then check this movie out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie with one MAJOR Flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT I've been watching a lot of old movies lately and I stumbled across this one and I rather enjoyed it; well most of it anyway. This suffers from what most old movies of the like suffers from...the need for "a happy ending." I would have preferred it either end with Rhoda getting away with everything or her mother successfully murder/suiciding. However the movie instead went for the most contrived ending I could think of. Even though the ending was not what I would have hoped for the rest of the movie was top notch. Warning though...if black and white movies give you hives stay far away. However if you like old movies and don't mind them in black and white this is a good movie to see, I would recommend it, even with the silly ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit creaky at times, but this is still a very compelling film which is ahead of it's time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not nearly as daring as you might see today, but back then it was pretty bold to do a movie with this type of subject. It's a bit creaky and stagy at times, but I really liked the film overall. I wouldn't say it has a ton of suspense, but the more psychotic Rhoda gets, it certainly does give the film an eerie type of feel. I also dug the slow burn type of build it had going for it. We know right away that something is not right with Rhoda, and that she's heartless, but it smartly lets us use our imagination for a little bit before fully revealing how demented Rhoda is. Bad Seed is also propelled by a wonderful cast. Patty McCormick is legendary as Rhoda. She is downright creepy at times, and is definitely not a kid I'd want to parent. Her manipulative &amp; evil showcase was awesome to watch. Her chemistry with Nancy Kelly (The Mom) is excellent and often powerful; speaking of Nancy Kelly: I felt for the woman in this movie; her character goes through some emotionally draining stages as the Mother who hates what her daughter has become, and I easily empathized with her plight. I adored her. William Hopper is your standard wooden actor from the 50's. His "plastic" style was a bit of a groaner, but he had his moments. The ending is one that will stick with you for a little while; at least it did for me. It's not necessarily disturbing, but it will make a mark in your mind with how it is done.Final Thoughts: I would not recommend this to younger viewers. They will most likely be bored to tears; however. For adults that want an old school psychological study that is ahead of it's time, they will be richly rewarded. This is a great film, and I recommend it highly8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One bad seed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the creepiest and most chilling stories I've ever come across, "The Bad Seed" is the story of a woman (Christine) who slowly becomes that her seemingly sweet, innocent, intelligent daughter, Rhoda, is actually a brutal murderer. Mervyn LeRoy's cast is simply impeccable from Nancy Kelly as the heart wrenching and difficult role of Christine. It's mesmerizing to watch her character develop as she begins to realize what exactly her daughter is capable of. Patty McCormack's Rhoda, however, is certainly not to be messed with. Just looking at her and being reminded of what Rhoda did is enough to give you nightmares. Despite all the darkness it carries, The Bad Seed is beautifully put on and not one to miss... no matter how badly you might want to!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a psychological drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad Seed is a 1956 thriller film directed by Mervyn LeRoy, and stars Nancy Hopper as Christine Penmark and child-actress Patty McCormack as Christine's daughter, Rhoda Penmark. The film opens with Christine's husband leaving their home for an extended military duty. Rhoda initially appears as a polite, obedient teenager who is devoted to her family. While discussing school activities with her neighbor, Monica Breedlove (Evelyn Varden), we learn that Rhoda is upset with losing the penmanship award to her schoolmate, Claude. Rhoda then attends a class outing, and during the event, Claude appears to have accidentally drowned. Soon we learn that Rhoda has somehow obtained the penmanship medal, and when Christine confronts her daughter in regard to the medal, Rhoda begins to show her true character.The Bad Seed is a psychological-drama. One observes during the film the interactions between mother and daughter. Christine is confronted with the prospect that either her daughter is a sociopathic murder or a victim of circumstances. It is interesting to note that during the scenes with Rhoda present, the cinematographer uses low angle positions for filming, giving the audience the constant perspective of the child. The movie runs 129 minutes, and as expected with movies produced under the Hayes Code, retribution for the crimes committed are expected within the story; the film contains a surprise ending to address this requirement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You just gotta love movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin with? It was so delightfully campy I just couldn't help but love it. Mervyn LeRoy, a solid director, didn't do a great job. The movie is unbelievably theatrical. Long shots, wide angles, characters walking in and out and delivering monologues. Sometimes it found it hard to believe that I was watching a film from a helmer of 'I'm a Fugitive from a Chain Gang'. But it doesn't matter. Everything here is so goofy that it's entertaining. At the beginning I thought this was going to be unwatchable - and then time after time things were happening that made my jaw drop. How about the truly Hitchcockian line about Monica's therapies: 'She's been spread out on couches from New York to Los Angeles'? Or the scene when, talking to her father, Christine suddenly regresses into being a little girl and discreetly mimics Rhoda (wonderful acting from Nancy Kelly here - totally unrealistic but very imaginative)? Or the fact that - in that same scene - the three characters go through almost a whole decanter of gin in just seconds?Leroy's mostly an awful character. His scenes are irritating. He talks to himself (explaining the plot), his conversations with Rhoda are way overlong - and then, out of the sudden, he gets one of best worst lines I've ever heard in a movie, the one about blue electric chairs for boys and pink electric chairs for girls. It would ruin a good movie - but it elevates a truly bad one into a masterpiece. Some things are completely and wonderfully absurd. When little Claude drowns, Christine worries she'll have to have the Big Talk about death with Rhoda. Then we're told that they used to have a neighbor who fell to her death (so there WAS a necessity for the Big Talk before!)from a spiral staircase and Rhoda has inherited her crystal ball. Boom! Without any introduction we're given a Suspicious Story From The Past and right away we know that little Claude wasn't Rhoda's first victim. So arbitrary. So what? There are more endings here than in 'Return of the King'. It could end on a gunshot. Or in a hospital ('You'll ALWAYS have Rhoda'). Or when Rhoda plans sunbathing on the roof with Monica. But no, we have to wait till the lightning to see 'The End' card. And then, as I was laughing my bottom off, came the introduction of the cast and the spanking. Just wow. People who want movies to be realistic (whatever that means), who can't suspend their disbelief, who look for good writing and technical brilliance probably won't enjoy all this. But if you love movies enough to appreciate weird, little, unintentionally funny and delightfully outrageous things scattered among the total mess of a plot or characterization - watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of sugar and spice, but nothing nice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredibly engrossing, suspenseful, scary film. What makes it unforgettable is the way it makes the viewer feel uncomfortable throughout. The tragedy of little Claude's murder was presented in a very profound, pathetic way. It took an extremely talented child actress like Patty MacCormack to portray the bright, cute, and sweet little monster that could manipulate adults with ease, fly into a violent rage, and display a calm demeanor with no hint of remorse when confronted with her unspeakable crimes. Nancy Kelly was a very gifted actress and her portrayal of Rhoda's mom stood its ground beside MacCormack's powerful performance.Why Kelly didn't have a long and distinguished film career is beyond my comprehension.She, along with William Hopper, a great actor who played the father flawlessly, were soon relegated to guest spots on innumerable television shows for the remainder of their careers. This just wasn't right. Eileen Eckhart's performance as Claude's grieving mother made you squirm - it was all too real. How an actress could nail a part so perfectly is a thing to behold. I understand that most of he cast was also together in the Broadway play immediately preceding the film. I never saw the play, but I wonder if it ended right after Rhoda's mom shut the door to her bedroom and we heard.....(I'm not going to say it)....to me, that would have been the most powerful ending imaginable and I wish the credits had rolled right after that moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fairly Good Suspenseful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene is a nice bit of fluid camera work and does a good job of providing an intriguing tidbit of foreshadowing. The acting is also effective at building the suspenseful mood of the movie, especially Nancy Kelly's portrayal of Christine Penmark.The ending felt a bit tame and I can't help but feel the censorship imposed on movies of this era (and possibly particularly in this case due to the nature of the subject matter) prevented the movie from fulfilling its full dramatic potential.The message at the end about how daring the movie was and asking viewers to keep the ending secret was an interesting touch, but the way all the actors were credited also detrimentally reduced the residual effects of the mood for which the movie was striving (again, perhaps driven by the censors?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bring them back here, Leroy...RIGHT HERE TO ME!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not enough people, especially my 80s/90s generation, know about this film. This was evidenced to me when I was 'Rhoda' for a Halloween party a couple of years ago...pigtails, frilly gingham dress, blood soaked mary janes, Fern School penmanship medal and all. No one knew who I was, even when I told them. Hopefully I convinced at least a few of them to see this horror masterpiece! Nothing's creepier than an 8 year old blonde, blue eyed, sickeningly sweet serial killer. Rhoda Penmark is like the 'little girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead'. When she's good, she's very very good and when she's bad, she's horrid. In the beginning you are more annoyed by her sweetness than endeared by it and that's good because it helps you transition to seeing her as the bad guy later on. The same is true of Leroy, played by the talented Henry Jones. Right at the start, you don't like him much. He seems like a pervy degenerate who gets his kicks picking on a 3rd grader. So when Rhoda sets him on fire and plays the piano while he's screaming and burning to death in the backyard, well, let's just say I wasn't as upset as I might have been otherwise....and that in itself is disturbing! Patty McCormick as Rhoda gives an amazing performance, especially considering she was only ten or eleven when she made this film. The quick transitions from sweet to psychotic are as good as any veteran actor. She's just spooky! Nancy Kelly as Rhoda's mother, Christine, is amazing. She's almost regally lovely, calm, and is just as cool and calculating as her daughter, only not in the same way. Instead, Christine's energy is spent subtly manipulating information out of her father and others and trying to protect her little girl from what she feels is at least partially her fault because of her genetics. All the while, she's having to deal all of Rhoda's 'problems' alone, being a military spouse who's husband has been called to Washington right before the you-know-what hits the fan. Her act of desperation toward the end of the film is totally understandable and ultimately forgivable. Talk about a lot on your plate! Monica Breedlove, the landlady played by Evelyn Vardon is a treasure. The ultimate busy body who, though she has the best of intentions, is always sticking her nose in where it doesn't belong! In the end, she winds up being the luckiest person in the film! My favourite character is, without a doubt, Mrs. Daigle. Eileen Heckart is one of the gems of this era. Great character actress. And this film is no exception. The pitifully sad, yet amusingly drunken mother of Rhoda's first victim (the first one that takes place in the course of the film anyway), little Claude Daigle. Her performance is one of the best I've ever witnessed. She has you almost falling on the floor laughing at her spot on 'drunk' (I've always thought that Carol Burnett must have stolen her 'drunk' as well as some of her 'Eunice' from Hortense Daigle). But then she'll deliver a line in which you can just feel the grief at the loss of her only child and you well up with tears. Outstanding. Period. This is a fantastic film that everyone should see. It's a mystery/horror/thriller that is really top notch from concept to plot to acting and direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tightly-wound Nancy Kelly (as Christine Penmark) thinks pretty preteen daughter Patty McCormack (as Rhoda) may be homicidal. The film asks you not to reveal the end, which was god-awfully altered from the play. "The Bad Seed" retains all of its theatrical glory, however. Whatever the psychoanalytical pretensions once were have been upped with pure hysterics. The stagy construction makes it the perfect antidote for the more often seen sickly sweet 1950s family... Mother and daughter from hell are twice upstaged by a delightfully bourbon-soaked Eileen Heckart (as Hortense), who exits with pieces of the scenery stuck firmly in her teeth. The three actresses won "Academy Award" nominations, with Ms McCormack winning a "Film Daily" juvenile award and Ms. Heckart taking home a supporting "Golden Globe" for the year. Also award-worthy, though arguably less campy, are "Aunt" Evelyn Varden (as Monica) and handyman Henry Jones (as Leroy).******** The Bad Seed (9/12/56) Mervyn LeRoy ~ Nancy Kelly, Patty McCormack, Henry Jones, Eileen Heckart</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bad Seed - A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad Seed is one of my very favorite films. I consider it a classic. The movie has a great cast including Patty McCormack as Rhoda Penmark. The movie is basically a film version of the stage play. The only thing I do not like about this film is the Hollywood ending. In the novel and in the play it is Rhoda's mother who dies and it is Rhoda who lives. For some stupid reason the makers of the movie felt it was not a good idea to have the original ending. A cast call at the end was also added, with Rhoda's mother giving her daughter the spanking she has always deserved! This part of the film doesn't bother me as much as the changed ending. A made for television remake of The Bad Seed was made. It is very dull, but at least they stuck to the original ending. If you purchase the DVD of this film, you get the added bonus of watching Patty McCormack talk about her role. Ms. McCormack has continued in acting up until this present day, but she will forever be remembered for this classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A woman comes to the horrific realization that her sweet little girl may be a heartless killer. This is an absorbing drama that probes the question of whether certain personality traits are inherited or nurtured by the environment. Kelly is good if a bit too mannered at times as the mother while McCormack is effective in her film debut as the bratty daughter. Most notable among the supporting cast are Heckart as a grieving mother and Jones as a mentally retarded janitor. The ending is silly, but was forced upon the filmmakers by the production code of the time. Ideally, the film would have ended about ten minutes earlier. Still, it's well made by veteran LeRoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Semanticists, I set ye a task. Here are two ladies. One is named Christine Penmark, the other Hortense Daigle. That's all you know about them. Now tell me which is the properly bred upper-middle-class wife, and which is the hapless drunken slob.Congratulations! You have just won for yourself a brand new Sherman M-4 CONVERTIBLE with sleek and athletic lines, genuine leatherette upholstery, and a 75 millimeter cannon on top! Yes, there's power to spare under this baby's forty-foot hood! Mrs. Penmark's (Nancy Kelly's) husband Colonel Penmark (William Hopper) must leave his wife and eight-year-old daughter, pretty, prim Rhoda (Patty McCormack) for more than a month because he's called to temporary duty in Washington, DC, and because the script always calls for the man to be away from home during emergencies.Nevertheless, everyone in the house is happy and content, even the effusive Mrs. Breedlove (Evelyn Varden) who lives in the apartment upstairs. Well, I guess Leroy (Henry Jones) isn't especially happy, but then he's never happy unless he's being mean to little Rhoda. Leroy is the shambling, resentful gardener and handyman. He drinks, goofs off on a pile of straw behind the furnace, and taunts and teases Rhoda whenever he can. Just plain sadistic, you know? But -- at that -- he's a much better human being than Rhoda. It develops that when Claude Daigle wins the penmanship medal at Rhoda's private school, Rhoda followed him out on the wharf when no one was looking, snatched the medal from his chest, and pounded him over the head with her cleated shoes until Claude fell into the water and drowned. Nor does Rhoda show any remorse whatever, not even the semblance of it.The stricken mother, Hortense Daigle herself, (Eileen Heckart) makes two visits to the Penmark apartment, trying to find answers to some unspoken questions about Claude's death, since Rhoda was the last person to see him alive. It's a bravura performance. Hortense lurching about the neat living room, swilling down her hostess's bourbon, while Mrs. Penmark looks and listens with a mixture of pity and disgust. Mr. Hortense -- I mean Mr. Daigle -- stands apologetically in the background, twisting his hat nervously in his hands.Interesting movie. I hadn't seen it for years. It's marvelously structured. One revelation follows another flawlessly and everyone plays his or her part until the tragicomic climax. The play, which is what we see, was written by Maxwell Anderson and the movie directed by old timer Mervyn LeRoy ("Little Caesar" inter alia).I think LeRoy must have been kind of tired because he lets these outrageous performances slip past him without modulation. Everyone overacts, except Paul Fix, who has, I suppose, been around in movies long enough to know better. William Hopper doesn't overact either, come to think of it, but he can't bend his talent one way or the other because it's limited to a single shtick. (He brings the same qualities to this part as he does to the scientist in "Twenty Million Miles From Earth.") Even the most casual conversations sound half hysterical. Nancy Kelly is the guiltiest of parties. She trembles and whines hoarsely with astonishment and disbelief, trying, I guess, to reach that old feller in the last row of the theater, the gray feller with the ear horn.A proper Hollywood ending is tacked on to satisfy the moral code of the time, completely draining the ending of its bitter irony. Struck by lightning? The point illustrated by the tale is that one can inherit a predilection for crime and murder that appears even in childhood, just as there are mathematical whiz kids and Mozart had mastered music by the age of six. The notion is dismissed in the film as "specious" (twice). I don't know why. What the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual calls "anti-social personality" -- it used to be "psychopathy" -- shows up fairly early in life, although the kids generally set animals afire instead of obnoxious gardeners. We're on the brink of some startling revelations in neuroscience regarding the genetic loading of some of these conditions. We'd all better start girding our loins for a major effort at denial. The alternative may be guarding our loins.None of these remarks detract from the story itself. It IS nicely structured, although I would have preferred one pointed visit from the boozed-up Hortense, rather than seeing a pointless repeat performance. Patty McCormack does a good enough job for a child. She seems a little older than eight, and with her pigtails, short frocks, and white socks she looks like a somewhat smaller Lolita. Instead of melting her with a 40-million-horsepower arc of electricity, I'd have sent her to a therapist. A few sessions with bizarre, tender, salivating Dr. Edgar H. Humbert might have straightened her out pronto.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Freakish Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its somewhat stagey direction, and occasional over-the-top theatrics, The Bad Seed is not a flawless film. But neither is it a bad one either.Imagine: A seamingly perfect and ideal '50's household, with all the right elements in order. When there is a loving mother, a blonde lady-like angel of a child, a dependable and caring upstairs neighbor, all living in what seems to be a happy existence , what could go wrong? The answer is just about everything. Christine Penmark is a woman determined to keep her life, and the lives of others around her, in order. Her daughter Rhoda is the pinnacle of elegance- a well mannered gem;the icing on the cake for all that come in her presence. The first nick on this polished surface occurs when Christine's husband leaves for military duties, and Christine is left to keep everything running in ship shape. We find out from Rhoda's schoolteacher, Miss Fern, that Rhoda has a mature quality to her personality which makes Christine somewhat weary of her daughter. This "quality" separates her from her classmates, and sets the stage for mayhem to come.The mayhem here takes place when a classmate of Rhoda's named Claude Daigle, "accidentally" drowns in a lake while playing outside. It turns out that Rhoda was the last person to have seen Claude before his death, and soon after all eyes turn to her. While everyone is in a fuss over Claude's death, it's the prime suspect Rhoda who acts as if nothing happened. She does not have a split-personality, but she does have psychotic tendencies driven by jealously, rage, and confusion. Soon after the Daigle boy's death, his lush of a mother comes knocking at the Penmark's door demanding answers. Physically unstable and emotionally wrecked, Mrs. "Hortense" Daigle comes into play. She knows that the teacher and Christine are keeping things from her, but she doesn't know what exactly.From this point on, the film reaches new depths of oddity, and leads up to a (somewhat) predictable ending. One mystery unravels after another, resulting in nail-bitting suspense. Below are my individual performance reviews: Nancy Kelly: As the film's lead performer (despite the title), we can see Kelly desperately grasping for attention that she should already have. It's easy to see why. Maybe not early on in the film, but somewhere on down the road, it becomes visually obvious that Kelly reprised this role from Braodway. Her over the top theatricality and dry raspy voice become increasingly irritaing and cringeworthy. This especially becomes a problem when the audience is supposed to sympathize towards this woman. Too bad for her, as it sucks away any sympathy the audience might have for her. Nancy Kelly's choice of character development is interesting here; we get to see her embarrass herself by choosing to play the part as she did on the stage, and has us question the notion of the performance this could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yowza! What a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the movie itself was enticing, the ending was surprisingly dull and, well, not good.The whole time I'm watching this movie, little Rhoda carries out crime after crime and goes unpunished and only her mother suspects something. The move itself was intense, especially when Rhoda showed her true colors. Other than that the movie was quite plain.Towards the end, after Rhoda murders LeRoy, Christine, not knowing what else to do, overdoses Rhoda with sleeping pills and after putting her young, almost dead daughter to bed for the seemingly final time, goes to her room and shoots herself. Original? At the time, maybe.Not surprisingly, little Rhoda lives and her mother ends up in a coma, which she eventually comes out of. After admitting to her husband in a late night phone call that she has committed a great sin, we fade to the final scene where little Rhoda is at the pier trying to fish out the Penmanship metal her mother dropped into the water below. And as she's fishing for the metal, thunder strikes her. End of story. Whether it was supposed to be a taken as a message from God or Karma i don't know. But the ending didn't do justice to the rest of the movie. I feel it could have been wrapped up in a nicer, more satisfying way.However, if you've seen the play the ending differs. Instead of Rhoda dying, Christine dies. At the hand of her own daughter. And the last thing we see, as the lights fade to black, is Rhoda with a devious grin on her face as if to tell the viewers, "I'll be back." I can't say the movie was totally bad, just the ending. It's probably one of the most interesting horror films from the 50s that I've seen so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the acting in this film might feel way overdone by today's standards, if you think in terms of theater performance rather than film you'll be fine. I think the acting suits the script pretty well here and adds a kind of artificial, "too good to be true" feel to the main family, which is not an entirely inaccurate description, as we find out as the plot unfolds. My wife discovered this film accidentally online, and we watched it together for the first time tonight. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and will probably watch it again sometime in the near future.I don't want to spoil things for anyone so I won't give much detail. I will say, however, that although the dialog sounds pretty out of date now ("Great Scott," the doctor says at one point, and no one cracks a smile) it does a pretty good job of conveying the tension between the various characters and keeping the viewer wondering what's going to happen next. Similarly, the lack of fancy camera effects might make the film seem slow to modern viewers, but I found that the still camera and limited locations matched the pace of the script and worked with the story rather than fighting it. And there are some good surprises laced throughout the story. Really well balanced as I think back on it.A good film, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes B&amp;W, plenty of dialog, and a good mystery. If these things don't appeal to you, then you'd be better off skipping this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious and morbid, sometimes at the same time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely ridiculous, but that doesn't change the fact that it's utterly delightful. It is the story of a mother and her young daughter, the mother an adopted child who worries about her real inheritance, and the daughter a sociopathic hoarder of trinkets who kills anybody who gets in the way of her getting what she wants. The story is based on a play and was made during the production code era, so it's pretty stage-y, but that doesn't change the humorous and at at times awesomely dark nature of its storytelling.The movie oscillates freely between slap-stick comedy and morbid Gothic drama. Sometimes it's hard to tell if the movie is being intentionally funny or not. For one thing, it has witty, precise dialog that nonetheless gives way to two inherent themes: Freudianism and Eugenics. On the other hand, it directly makes fun of both concepts in its own dialog. It embraces and detaches itself from its own dark underpinnings, at time lingering on a medium shot of a mother poisoning her own daughter, and at other times gracefully allowing the horror to occur off-screen while the events are told by the exclamations and reactions of the characters, such as the burning scene. And more poignantly still, the movie oscillates between fantasy and literalism, a change that brings upon the most obvious and yet most perfect use of deus ex machina in cinematic history: the hilarious "God smites/The End!" ending.For fans of camp and fans of legit horror, this movie offers to both. For weirdly idiosyncratic moments of American history, this movie stands alongside Invasion of the Body Snatchers as something oh-so-obvious, and yet oh-so-realized. A genuine classic (whether cult or critical).--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this gem at my mum's house (yeah, I spend lots of time there!), and I was floored. I actually liked the "Staginess", it gave the sets a different feel than other films, and the actors all seemed to be right at home there. I really believed it was a house! Perfect performances from all involved, especially Rhoda's mum. I admit it, I was literally bawling my eyes out near the end (You all know the scene!). I have almost never felt such profound sorrow for anyone in a movie, but the poor mother just broke my heart in ways I never knew were possible. I really cared about her, seeing her suffer that way was unbearable. I'm so glad I watched it, even though it made me cry like that. If you watch until the credits are done, you can see Rhoda getting spanked! That was the perfect balance to end the story. A truly awesome film, and I really can't praise it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would you give for a basket of kisses........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A basket of hugs?. A well-staged thriller that delivers a few twists. Patty McCormack as Rhoda is appropriately chilling and manipulative. A wonderful achievement for the young actress.Basically Rhoda is a girl loved by most, but suspected of foul play when her mother learns of the untimely death of the Daigle boy. Mrs. Daigle (well- portrayed by Eileen Heckart) visits Mrs. Penmark, she is drunk, upset over the death of her son. Rhoda says to her mother, why can't she just get another boy at the orphanage?.There are some very good scenes with Leroy (Henry Jones) who taunts Rhoda, and learns the truth about her. Nancy Kelly is a bit over the top as Mrs. Penmark, using lilting and sing-song stage talk, but the story still works despite this. Her husband is portrayed by the rather wooden William Hopper (You may recall him as Natalie Woods father in "Rebel Without a Cause"). There is also a noteworthy performance by as Penmarks adoptive father, who tries to keep the secret from his daughter.Overall this is an unusual and highly recommended thriller. Some have complained about the ending, but that was a common ploy during the era, to have a strange twist. You may also want to compare this to the remake with Blair Brown and David Carradine. Carradine is appropriately creepy and steals the show in that film. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creep and camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a child drowns at a school picnic, a middle-class woman begins to believe that her over-achieving angelic 8-year old daughter might be responsible for the death. Whoo--this movie is quite a curiosity. Obviously both a product of and constrained by 1950s American culture, "The Bad Seed" is surprising, horrifying, silly and campy all at the same time. It is based on a play and comes across as very stagey, but that doesn't hurt the film. In fact, the bantering performances and dialogue are its best assets. While little Rhoda (Patricia Mccormack) is more grating than creepy at times, Nancy Kelly is fantastic as her mother who slowly loses grip with reality. But my favorite character is Hortence the Lush, played by Eileen Heckart. Her amusing yet convincingly depressing portrayal of the grieving mother is one of the best Movie Drunks ever. The movie does seem dated at times--the "nature vs nurture" arguments between characters are used to conjure fear, but are amusing at best to a modern audience. Also, due to the "moral code" of the times, some parts of the movie had to be switched around. Certain parts that were effected seem sort of tacked on and annoying, but also creepy when considering that they are supposedly more "moral." However, the fact that such a daring movie was made in the 50s is quite an achievement. At the end, the characters are introduced like in a stage play, as if to say "It's okay! This was all just pretend!" Overall, a good movie for both the creepy and the camp factors. DVD includes commentary by Mccormack and campmaster Charles Busch ("Psycho Beach Party").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilly and psychologically disturbing... I love it! (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, the scariest movies are psychological thrillers that can actually happen in real life. I saw this movie the whole way through last night and got a case of the chills.The story centers on a mother and a daughter's dysfunctional relationship. After an incident involving a little boy's drowning occurs at the Fern School, Mrs. Penmark becomes suspicious and wonders if her seemingly innocent daughter, Rhoda, may have played a part in the death of Claude Daigle (especially since the headmistress, Mrs. Fern, informed Mrs. Penmark that Rhoda was the last person to see Claude just before he died). There are many clues throughout the film that highlight Rhoda's dark secret- mainly objects given to her after their original owners die.Complete with a surprise ending, a brilliant plot and exceptional actors (Nancy Kelly and Patty McCormack are excellent!), The Bad Seed is beautifully played out. This is how horror movies should be made.</fullReview>

Nevermind that the ending was mandated, the film is still dark enough that it is undiminished. Parts of this film reach levels of chilling electrification that rival the greatest noir films (particularly the interactions between the daughter and the slow handyman).The philosophical questions raised are equally dark: the eponymous indictment is particularly pointed in a world that has gone mad for genetic determination.A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insight into a psychopathic personality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are those among us--and they are not few--who are aliens walking the Earth, just as much as if they were visitors from Alpha Centauri. These are the psychopaths, or (more politically correctly), the "antisocial personalities;" individuals, in human form, who cannot love and who have no conscience. Truly, they are not human. The outward form is the same, but these humanoids have been made without the soul.They are not all criminals--many live ordinary lives as successful businessmen/women or factory workers.Their distinguishing characteristic is that they have no feeling of empathy or of common purpose with other people and no regard for the feelings of others; in other words, they have no humanity. They will torture an animal just to see it writhe; they will take an old woman's savings in a con; the murderers among them can kill without any real remorse. The only remorse they feel comes when they are caught, and only because they were.Many are quite intelligent; nevertheless, they tend to have a blind spot in making the same arrogant mistakes over and over. Many spend the majority of their years in confinement for this reason.They can be extremely sensitive to what others want from them, and can find words which convince others of their affection or sincerity; but they have none, and never will have. They cannot be rehabilitated; they can only sound as if they have been. That, they can do convincingly.Ted Bundy, the clean-cut, earnest, intelligent, gentleman killer of young women was one.The fictional little girl depicted in this totally absorbing movie classic is another.Don't miss seeing it. Don't miss meeting her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sowing the seeds of evil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad Seed is directed by Mervyn LeRoy and adapted to screenplay by Maxwell Anderson from the novel of the same name written by William March. Anderson had also adapted for the stage play as well. It stars Nancy Kelly, William Hopper, Patty McCormack, Henry Jones, Eileen Heckart and Evelyn Varden. Music is by Alex North and cinematography by Harold Rossen.Is there such a thing as Bad Seed? Where I grew up there was a violent family of four brothers, each one would think nothing of doing a Begbie on you. It was the first time I heard the saying Bad Seed, with the conversation basically saying that their father was a psychopath and the four lads just inherited the violent tendencies by way of Pops. It's this theory that drives LeRoy's movie, only here it's a young "butter- wouldn't-melt-in-her-mouth" girl who has murderous leanings courtesy of her Nana's iffy genetics.The theatre origins are very much evident, there is no hiding this fact, with the acting (some of the actors are held over from the play here) very much as if playing to an open auditorium, while at over two hours in length there's an over stretching of the talk heavy material. However, this is a very engrossing piece of horror cinema, pulsing unpleasantness and mood oppressive by way of black and white photography and a musical score that underlines the blending of sweet innocence and sinister evil.McCormack as the Devil Child is outstanding, likewise Jones as the simpleton handyman who recognises evil when he sees it. Kelly, Heckart, McCormack and Rossen were all Academy Award nominated for their respective work in the film. As for the much discussed finale? Personally I have no problem with what transpires as regards mother and child. Oh for sure the ending to both the novel and play is far darker and dramatic, but there's a campy bizarreness in this Production Code influenced denouement that befits the whole production. Though the end credits curtain calls by the cast members is pushing it too far? 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a crazy film, I didn't really get into it, it's not my style of movie. The little girl drove me nuts from the beginning, most of the characters did, especially when they practically worshiped Rhoda. The plot just seemed too ridiculous, most of the characters just seemed really ridiculous and stupid. The father annoyed me because he seemed to be obsessed with his daughter and seemed to be more in love with her than his own wife, until the end, when his wife almost dies, that's when he seemed to really love his wife. I think the only really clever character was Leroy, he seemed like the one who was the murderer, but became a victim in the end, which was very unexpected! So I was left with a feeling of disturbance and disappointment. This was just an okay film, I thought the acting was very good though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a young girl named Rhoda Penmark, who happens to be a mild-mannered and sweet child, but then incidentally kills a child during school (or whatever). While her adoptive submissive mother thinks that she is the kindest daughter in the world, she realizes that Rhoda might've killed the child.Did she? Well, yes she did. At the beginning, she tells stories about her self-importance, but if you keep watching the movie, you'll notice that it's SHE who actually killed the child.Let's note that I HAVE NOT seen the remake of the Bad Seed (1985) or The Good Son (1992) yet, but this original was a classic among my childhood memories. I've always loved the bad seed. It was an original classic. At this rate, I think children would enjoy this film too and I'm sure old farts would.Patty McCormack's acting was superb. And including the whole cast; they all seem like I was watching The Bad Seed in reality. The script was more than enough good. The storyline, well, short, but the movie is long and it would still attract viewers.From films like Children of the Damned (1964) or Village of the Damned (1960), this film would NEVER be any better than these. It's a true classic to watch over and over again. These horror films were the best of the'50s and now, they spook the crap out of you nowadays such as movies like Insidious (2011). This movie is nowhere near the spookiness of this movie, instead, it's about drunk people and children killers.People who would like to watch a movie that's not that scary, then this movie is for you. I didn't think it was half-bad, and the movie isn't as scary as those nowadays, but it's still pretty creepy. The acting is OK and no spirits.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally faced my childhood fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad Seed (1956) This film is one I saw on TV as a preteen, and it has stuck with me ever since. I've had many opportunities to watch it again, but I resisted out of pure fear. It was on TCM today, and I finally decided it was time to face my fear and I'm certainly glad I did. The main reason being that now, as an adult, I don't even view this as a horror film whatsoever. It played so much like a Broadway play (which it once was) with each line delivered a bit louder with perfect enunciation. Some of the characters were more relaxed, but McCormick and Kelly were very wooden and melodramatic. Since this film, I've lived through the teen fright night horror films we used to rent for fun in high school with Michael Meyers, Freddy Krueger, and the like. I even let my husband talk me into watching the first Scream movie which traumatized me so much that I gave up the horror genre altogether. Also, I've seen countless thrillers, mysteries, and suspense films. I'm sure I'm desensitized by modern Hollywood now, but The Bad Seed seems campy and utterly unbelievable now. The ending, thanks to the Hays code, is mild. So mild, in fact, I was watching it and wondering what in the world I'd been afraid of all of these years. However, I think it would creep any child out now or way back when. Therefore, facing my fear confirmed I was leery of only a distorted childhood memory. For that reason alone, it was worth seeing one more time.</fullReview>

I remember watching this movie when I was younger and it made quite an impression on me and was really scary. I thought this little actress did a great job with her part. I really felt sorry for the mother-what could she do? I was on the edge of my seat for this whole movie-I didn't know how this monster would try to kill next, her mother? her grandfather? The idea of passing down a murderous gene that perhaps skips a generation was fascinating. I also noticed how Rhonda sort of adopted the southern-type accent of the janitor.

		<shortDescription>An "Oman" of things to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Rotten to the core without a conscience or sense of fair play little eight year-old Rhoda Penmark, Patty McCormack, always gets what she wants even if she has to kill to get it. We see this strange behavior of Rhoda at the very beginning of the movie "The Bad Seed" in her going ballistic over losing the coveted school's penmanship award to her classmate Clyde Daigle.At the school's annual summer picnic Rhoda chases Clyde out to the lake and bashed his head in with a log leaving him to drown. It's after Clyde's death that Rhoda, instead of covering up her crime, takes a vital piece of evidence that will eventually link her to his murder: His best penmanship award medal. This kind of action on Rhoda's part is repeated again in the movie when she sets fire to handyman LeRoy Jessup, Henry Jones, in the basement burning him to death. LeRoy who's a bit retarded was a lot smarter then he looked in knowing just what Rhoda was up to, he found the murder weapon in Clyde's death, and paid with his life for it.Why is Rhoda such a monster? What makes her do the things that she does? How can such a sweet-looking girl coming from a loving and caring family turn into the homicidal sociopath that she's became at such a young age? It's all in the genes baby all in the genes and those genes, or seeds, comes from Rhoda's mother Christine, Nancy Kelly. Christine was adopted by Chicago crime reporter Richard Bravo, Paul Fix, after her own mother abandoned her at the tender age of two. It was Christine's biological mother who was a psychotic serial murder who's seed she had embedded in her DNA. That "bad seed" that luckily didn't effect Christine was to show up years later in her daughter Rhoda!A bit dated but still powerful film about how our genetic make-up or DNA has a lot more to do with our actions then the environment that we grow up in. You can see that the movie "The Bad Seed" has a lot of difficulty with coming up with a satisfying ending in that back in 1956, like even now in 2009, you couldn't have an eight year-old girl end up paying for her crimes, by being sent behind bars or even executed, like an adult would. The movie had to have inserted into it an act of God, not the courts, to mete out justice for Rhoda in order not to shock, any more then it already did, its audience.Despite the films very overly contrived ending, which wasn't in the book that it was based on, "The Bad Seed" was well ahead of its times in the science of modern criminology. Not in its somewhat mumbo-jumbo explanation of how our DNA can effect us but in showing that even the most innocent of all of us, young children, are in fact very capable of committing crimes comparable to that of the most hardened and career criminals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychopath !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In its most simple way, Psychiatry defines a psychopath in its upper grade as a person that can't establish affective bonds with or towards his equals. A Psychopath character can live his entire life without hurting anybody as long as no one interferes with what he really wants; but if that happens he will simply remove the obstacle even through murder if necessary. Psychopaths know perfectly when they do wrong (and that's why they stand trail for their actions), but they just don't care because they can't feel love or kindness towards others. So far many scientists believe this abnormality can not be cured.Rhoda Penmark is perhaps the best sample of a psychopath ever to appear in films. The girl looks mild, sweet and likable but because of what she is she turns into a monster whenever she doesn't get what she wants or what she thinks she deserves in a usual way; she also knows her wrong doing and that's why she lies every time she has to hide her crimes, but none of this bothers her at all.With Rhoda as the main character "The Bad Seed" is an excellent thriller where the perfect psychopath is even more terrifying because she is just a little girl, played very convincingly by a young Patty McCormack. Nancy Kelly renders a good though sort of uneven performance (with some overacting every now and then) as Rhoda's mother who inevitably comes to realize what kind of a person her lovely daughter really is. The rest of the cast gives a great support mainly Eileen Eckhart as the devastated mother of one of Rhoda's victims.The final outcome, with a sort of "Divine Justice" focus, seems too casually adequate, but back in the middle 50's murderers in films were not supposed to get away with their crimes."The Bad Seed" is an excellent film in its genre most shocking for its time and stands as a really good one 50 years later; a classic thriller in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unless ye become like children, you cannot enter the kingdom of Heaven . . . Not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad Seed (1956) is a unique "must see" horror movie, the rest is commentary. The plot is surprisingly simple but the ramifications of this simple plot are frighteningly complex.The Plot: Rhoda (Patty McCormack), is a sauve, cute, adorable, picture perfect, frilly dressed, polite, pigtailed, blue eyed, blond, eight-year-old child, that is a perfect angel. Pop the hood and you'll find a brain that appears angelic yet, covertly rivals the deviousness and ruthlessness of a demon from hades. If anyone either says "no" or stand in her way, her "gift" quickly becomes apparent. And, there are no limits to her "gift" for getting her way (as attested by the body count around her). Now, drop this little dumpling into a 1950's town and a "Leave it to Beaver" family and stare in shock. Near the end, anyone who crossed Rhoda was probably dead or wishes they were. All the while, Rhoda seems invincible and unstoppable, that is, until a lighting bolt blows her up (That's right, a lighting bolt blows her up). The End.This flippant plot summery doesn't do justice to the many contributions of the minor characters who greatly contrast Rhoda and greatly magnify her self justified sociopathic personalty. They are:Claude Dangle, a little boy who "stole" Rhoda's spelling bee medal by winning the spelling bee fairly. Rhoda got "her" medal back after Claude had an "accident." The Handyman (Henry Jones), is an uneducated, low man on the social totem pole, but quickly perceives Rhoda true nature (evil). Alas, because he is a hick, everyone tells him to shut up and go away. Later he teases out the truth about Rhoda's path of destruction and soon after, he has an "accident." (You will love Rhoda after seeing this fine piece of work)The writer Richard Bravo (Paul Fix), Colonel Kenneth Penmark (William Hopper), Monica Breedlove (Evelyn Varden), and most of the town folks think Rhoda is just the cutest little sweet pea. Some talk about bad children and psychology, but do not make the connection. Only towards the end, do a few start to suspect otherwise.Rhoda's mother, Christine Penmark (Nancy Kelly), eventually connects the dots of dead people and not only believes Rhoda is an evil child. She also concludes that "bad seeds" seem to run in her family after Christine finds out she was really adopted. After an emotional breakdown, or two, and Rhoda's confession of additional "accidents," Christine decides to euthanize Rhoda and commit suicide, but fails both attempts.The direction of the film and the sets were sparse and clean. This may be a cross over from The Bad Seed starting out as a stage play. Yet, this technique works very well for this film because it is the people and their eery interactions and not the sets, that is the film's main focus. The technique of using unseen violence was just as effective and disturbing as shown violence. The scene where a person is set on fire and all you see are other peoples reacting to the event is unnerving.Now, to the frighteningly complex ramifications of this film's simple plot. The Bad Seed is really a debate of whether nature or nurture makes people who they are. Nature proponents believe people are hardwired and cannot change their "nature" no matter how much reprogramming is done. Nurture proponents believe people are who they are taught to be and nature can be overcome. Over the past couple hundred years, society seems to swing back and forth on this debate and no answer is definitive (frankly, I believe it is a mix of the two). This film seems to strongly favor nature while the characters debate this idea and mostly take the nurture side. In the film, the nature versus nurture debate is skillfully integrated and doesn't sound dictated. Christine realizes with horror, that she was really adopted. Christine is also told her biological family was mental, but she was normal since her foster parents raised her correctly (nurture). Christine, after much anguish, believes her child just might be a "bad seed" because Rhoda actions shows she may have inherited a propensity for murder from her grandmother (nature).The other ramification of this film was the ending. {The original ending had Rhoda surviving, and her mother dying. The Motion Picture Production Code (Hays Code?) in effect at the time, however, required that "Crime shall never be presented in such a way as to throw sympathy with the crime as against law and order." The usual interpretation of this was that criminals weren't allowed to "get away with it." Because of this, the ending was changed: Rhoda's mother survived being shot in the head, and Rhoda herself was killed by a bolt of lighting by a lake}(copied from trivia section). The societal standards in 1956 could not handle the possibility that Rhoda would be free to continue unhindered (one could also joke that Rhoda wanted to study law and go into politics when she grew up). What was 1950's society to do? Put her away for life? There were no witnesses or victims to testify. By all accounts of the law, she could walk free. Thus Deus ex machina by lighting bolt. I believe the moral dilemma of this hard hitting movie also lead to the unusual cast call at the end. This is likened to a Shakespearian play when everyone dies at the end then gets up and takes a bow to shake the audience from their shock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Trading Places", they looked at the issue of nature vs. nurture. "The Bad Seed" throws that argument's validity into question. Rhoda Penmark (Patricia McCormack) looks like a cute little all-American girl, but there's just one problem: she's an evil, cold-blooded murderer. And she can trick anyone into trusting her, even her mother Christine (Nancy Kelly). You can think what you want about this girl, but believe me, she will kill you - probably in the worst, cruelest way possible.You will probably never look at any child the same way after watching this movie. That's the sign of a really good movie: it makes you suspicious of supposedly "cute" people. But from here on, no one is "cute" anymore. There is only pure evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beautiful little blonde girl...such angelic perfection...such cold-blooded heartlessness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First as a father of 2 girls and a boy, it was fascinating to me to see a beautiful little girl interacting so warmly with her daddy. Patricia McCormack, who played 8 year old Rhoda Penmark, was simply as perfect a vision as God has ever put on this earth, complete with long blonde hair, a beautiful face, ever-sweet ever-ready smile and a lovely winsome demeanor that would cause the heart of any dad anywhere to skip a beat with moments of blustery pride and joy.The underlying and pervasive theme of this tragic movie is death...stalking the family from place to place, ever present. Nancy Kelly playing Christine Penmark the mother of Rhoda, becomes consumed by her own birth misfortune and subsequently that of her daughter's. Christine discovers her own origin was of a woman diagnosed as a "bad (genetic)seed", who was an unapologetic mass murderer who killed for specious reasons without a grain of remorse. As if being stuck in the realms of a nightmare, Christine assembles an evidentiary puzzle leading her to believe that precious, angelic Rhoda is actually genetically predisposed to be a 'bad seed' and as well, a mass murderer who will wield her motus-fatale without the restraints of conscience.That in a nutshell is the framework of this marvelous movie. Now for the verdicts...The Bad Seed's theme is awesome and I dearly hope someone with the skills of Stephen King will produce a remake, circa the modern era.Nancy Kelly was allowed too much reign to overact. Her part was a run-on that never quite let the audience have an area of safety...a calm time. As Christine she seemed to too quickly jump to the conclusion that Rhoda was a murderer. It didn't quite seem that she struggled with the unbelievability of it enough, though she did visually struggle on and on and on. Her acting is good in much smaller doses. I can't really see this movie as being so much about the mother, rather than the daughter Rhoda, who I found to be infinitely more fascinating. Kelly's role was so omnipresent I actually began to avoid looking at her during those excessive monologues.I think it was unfortunate that in the end of filming, Kelly's name was first on the marque, when that notable position should have been reserved in Patricia McCormack's honor.Eileen Heckart as Hortense Daigle, the mother of the deceased little boy played her role with consummate artistry. She was convincing as someone wanting to derive every essence of her precious son's death. So successful at suffering her soulful pain was she, that I found it very uncomfortable viewing any scene in which she appeared. Like Kelly, Heckart's performance was a bit over-dramatic and prolonged for a movie audience and would have been more fitting for a live theatre audience, where every syllable of every utterance must be LOUD enough for all to hear. The nuances that usually add ambiance to a movie, were gone completely from her character.Henry Jones as Leroy Jessup, the retarded gardener played his part in a more timely fashion. His dialogue was much shorter and more to the point and in some sense that left me wanting to hear more from him. Repartee's between he and Rhoda were the essential elements that brought my interest to rapt attention. He was the second most interesting character in this play/movie for me, personally, and was the one I feel most viewers would have wanted to see interacting more often with the angel child from hell. A nice touch would have been for Leroy to have successfully bribed Rhoda to an extent that we viewers would have wanted very much to see her do away with him. William Hopper as Col. Kenneth Penmark was a perfect choice for the part of Rhoda's daddy: handsome, gorgeously blond like his blonde daughter, loving, strong and seemingly influential in his daughter's life. When the movie started I felt he would have been more involved in the discoveries regarding his daughter...yet to the very end of the movie, he was oblivious to Rhoda's satanic side. In a reality by any other name I think daddy Penmark appears to have been too much out of the loop. In the Stephen King remake Village of the Damned (1995), where children who were conceived by unknown origins virtually take over a town, both mothers and fathers become aware of all those precious children's inner indifference to humanity very quickly. That was realistic even in a short piece of fiction.Here in The Bad Seed, I think daddy Penmark was a bit too oblivious, though as they say nowadays I could still suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy the movie.Patricia McCormack was the perfect casting for Rhoda. She was immaculately beautiful with her long blonde pigtails, her beguiling femininity and her perfect face and handsome stature. As if all that weren't enough she was suave, articulate, willfully unrepentant and incorrigible. I found that unconflicted combination to be incredibly interesting.This movie was about Rhoda. The director and writers should have lessened the 'ham-time' spent 'on-stage' by Nancy Kelly and Eileen Heckart, and then perhaps Patricia McCormack's own nomination would have led to the actual Oscar prize.Patricia was the only '10' in this fascinating movie. Except for the minor matter of serial killing and fatal cunning, I'd love to have a daughter just like her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMO, every performance in this shocker is realistic. A wrong belief about this movie is that the ending had to be changed to meet the movie code. Actually, Anderson had his own rule that good should always prevail, which he had to violate in the stage play to keep it consistent with March's novel. Anderson actually preferred the movie ending. This movie dealt with what was a very politically incorrect idea in the last half of the century, that behavior is largely genetically determined, and comes to the generally current opinion as opposed to the easy idea prevalent at the time. I grew up in the 50's, and this movie nails life in the 50's. All of the characters are from my youth, in a time when tragedy was more common.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most peculiar movies ever made. I'm tempted to say it's a great film in spite of itself, but really it's just a happy train wreck. Of course there's the camp value--but somehow the movie transcends even that. It actually works on its own terms--even if those terms are blatantly uncinematic and embarrassingly dated. The overripe dialogue is acted out with such gusto (if you've ever wondered what it means when an actor is said to "indicate," just watch this movie--you'll understand in an instant) that it goes beyond "heightened," beyond "stylized," even beyond "camp." While it was opened up to a degree from its stage source, many of the scenes play as if the stage script (with it series of arbitrary entrances and exits) were being strictly adhered to; and damn it if it doesn't work... after a fashion. Ultimately though, it's the fascination with the story that's the hook. I first encountered the work via a TV movie remake in 1985. Having read WINTERSET in high school, I couldn't comprehend the "based on a play by Maxwell Anderson" credit for the TV film, so it prompted me to do a little digging. Not too long after that I had an opportunity to see the original movie and I was stunned: stunned by the broad acting; stunned by the stilted dialogue; stunned by the changed ending (which I realized even as I was watching it, must have been demanded by the Hays Code); and finally dumbfounded by the "curtain call" (if you've already seen the movie you know what I mean). Oddly though, in spite of the artifice of the acting and dialogue; in spite of the embarrassing naivet in presenting its thesis; in spite of living in a post-Columbine age when children who commit horrible acts now seems commonplace; and, even in spite of the ludicrous ending--or maybe because of all of these things--the movie is still effectively unsettling. For better or worse, it's not a movie that you're likely to forget anytime soon.</fullReview>

This movie just shows parents that there is no such thing as the perfect daughter because girls just like boys are gonna get into trouble and get dirty thats a part of life. u can clean your kids and there clothes when they get dirty but how do u change your kids when there heart gets even dirtier?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the question that was tossed around when this movie was released. I read the book before I ever saw the picture and must comment that in Hollywood's style they of course couldn't leave it alone. The ending of the book is different. But the movie was and still is a riveting view. Patty McCormack's career was never the same after this role - and she became typecast as Rhoda forever. But I guess if you were to be typecast this would be a great role by which to be remembered.It forever asked the question whether behavior was inborn or learned - and are we products of our genetic makeup? - or do we have free choice, and can overcome our genetic inheritance with environmental enrichment? I think at the time of it's release many people queried whether adoption was a good thing and what kind of trouble were you taking on when you knew nothing of the genetic background of the child you were adopting.A true psychological characterization of a psychopathic personality in that they are unable to feel care or concern for anyone but themselves and that their priorities are always putting themselves first. They have no morality because that is a concept they are incapable of understanding.Although the movie reminds one of watching a play, it is probably because it came from a stage play before being made into a movie. Probably dated by today's standards and a little over-dramatized (Nancy Kelly's character) the message it conveys and the questions it asks are still being debated today - some 40+ years later. A good thriller - the battle of good vs. evil continues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfect little 8 year old Rhoda (Patricia McCormack) is a murderer. When this was released in 1956, it was for adults only. A movie about a murderous child was very shocking back then. Sadly, though, it isn't anymore. Still, this movie is very scary and still packs a wallop. Patricia McCormack is brilliant as Rhoda--you see the sweetness swing right into evil and back...she should have won the Oscar for this. Nancy Kelly gives a heart-rendering performance as her mother. You can feel her pain and confusion over what to do with Rhoda. Evelyn Varden is fine as the talkative landlord, although she overdoes her adoration of Rhoda a bit. Eileen Heckart is annoying and overacting as an alcoholic. The movie never shows any of the murders...you just hear about them later and in one truly terrifying sequence, you hear a man screaming in pain as he's burnt to death. Very effective. The film is pretty obviously adapted from a stage play (LOTS of talking) and is a little overlong. Also the psychology is a bit far-fetched..."inherited evil"? Come on! Also, they changed the ending (for the censor) and added a silly little epilogue that single-handedly wrecks the tone of the movie. Still, worth watching. Just turn off as soon as "The End" appears on screen. NOT for children!!!!!!</fullReview>

It's wonderful.Then, it's all topped off with the curtain calls. I guess the producers decided that the notion was to terrifying to just end the movie, so they bring out each actor to take a bow.

		<fullReview>Here's a classic that will leave you on the edge of your seat. This Warner Bros. classic "The Bad Seed" will leave sending shivers down the spine of movie goers.Though there were some limits in the 1950's on the decency of thrillers and horror films. The real factor of this film is "think you know you own daughter, THINK AGAIN!"Patty McCormack playing Rhoda, really reminds me of a particular pop star: CONFIDENTIALLY SPEAKING YOU KNOW WHO!(only less dangerous) Rhoda did put the "P" in "Princess" and "Precocious". Killing the young boy for a gold pin. And would have the nerve to cover it up?The mother who loves her daughter has a shady past herself: Her mother was a killer herself. And was trying to be rash on ending the curse by killing both Rhoda and herself. She didn't prevail. That simple handyman wasn't as simple as anyone thought has. He was on to her like a flea on a dog. I think the movie version of the hit play was neat. In the play Rhoda did more killing. In the movie, justice was served! If the law couldn't stop Rhoda, Mother Nature will. Was it worth it, Rhoda? Just for a silly gold pin? I thought it was cute when Nancy Kelly finally puts Patty McCormack IN HER PLACE! (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!)IT WAS GOOD! 5 out of 5 A 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a trade-off between an authentically scary kid and adult actors making all too unsubtle attempts to 'act' (Ham anyone?). Rhoda's mom (Christine) is overwrought as can only be seen in the fifties, and her emotional regression is campy schlock. Patty McCormack herself is shockingly good as the kid; who seems to have mastered a fuller emotional arc than most kids &amp; even adults can muster (See Bonnie Blue Butler in GWTW, through every kid in the last 7 decades of movies). Watching this manipulative little horror switch between continually-revised untruths, to angry self-excusing tantrums, to flattery will make you good and angry! She's not the omen, and she's not a villager of the damned, which are both less creepy. And that's what's effective about it; in the end there will be no supernatural cop-outs.The movie also presents the nasty, trashy, drunken aspect of fifties low culture right in the living room of polite and presentable respectability. The juxtaposition is startling and freakish. Eileen Heckart is a drunken force to be reckoned with, voicing everything it's forbidden to say in the fifties. She's like Grace Zabriskie going to pieces in Twin Peaks. It also revisits the main plot point of Great Expectations with the shuttling of a pivotal little girl away from low origins.It's also a very funny artifact of the era. Christine learns her kid is essentially Satan, and her neighbor thinks the solution is more vitamins! I cannot have a conversation with my mother (at her prime in this era) without her pestering me about vitamins. I kept wanting the movie to be brave enough to kill this kid, so the divine judgment at the end is a hoot.The idea that badness emerges genetically after skipping a generation like hemophilia, is pretty goofy. More likely, children are born with distinct temperaments. I have a self-involved sister like Rhoda, completely unlike the rest of the family.It's interminably long, but definitely worth a viewing, in a way that Whatever Happened to Baby Jane is just not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say this film has many supporters, including many film critics. It seems some have gone so far as to call this a near- or cult-classic. Unfortunately I'm not one of them.The acting seems over-wrought and over-baked, as though the players are still on the Broadway stage. Perhaps they couldn't rid themselves of certain theatrical gestures they used for so many stage performances.As for my reaction, I found the proceedings pretty implausible and predictable. Most of the revelations and reactions seemed downright hammy. This is not to say everyone's not trying their best. Patty McCorick by the time the film was made was pushing eleven years of age, and the camera catches it.The lightening climax seemed tacked on and abrupt, followed by unbelievably ridiculous cast bows. Director LeRoy must have stayed home that day.Still, there are some who give this effort a high rating. To each his own, for they obviously see something here I surely don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Proof positive of the impact of this film is the number and frequency of reviews that have been posted and that continue to be posted.Why is this film so compelling? Nancy Kelly. While the little girl is a focal point, it is the slow unravelling of the Kelly character that makes this film so interesting. She knows. We KNOW she knows. She just won't admit it... and in the meantime, people keep getting killed.The film also asks us... what would YOU do? Probably just what the frustrated mom does.Eileen Eckhart won an Oscar for this and Ms. Kelly should have too. This is one creepy flick. It was made to make you feel uncomfortable and it sure does.A murdering child. A sickly, sweet, murdering child. And each time, as we feel like killing the brat just as Henry Jones does, we meet up with Nancy Kelly and remember that this is a small, dysfunctional family. So what WOULD you do? Without her daughter, the mother's life is useless, so everything has to be based on a blood soaked lie, with the little girl at the helm.Moral lessons... overindulgence makes for killer kids.Great stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A filmed play, with the actors projecting to the rafters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone made the unwise decision early on to stick as close to the hit Broadway play as possible in adapting "The Bad Seed" for the movies, including having several key actors reprise their roles, including Patty McCormick in the lead as a sociopathic youngster in long pig-tails. The piece has not been rethought for the screen, and what works on a bare stage doesn't always deliver in the more intimate medium of cinema. So it's not all McCormick's fault: she delivers a performance of a headstrong, evil child in a perfunctory, overly-rehearsed manner and probably deserved the accolades she received at the time. It is a very demanding role for a youngster. However, there are no shadings in the dialouge for McCormick to pick up on, and she's not fresh in the part. Worse, she's directed to be too terrific--enunciating very clearly and loudly, as if to reach the back row, all the details of a complex human being are ironed out. This couldn't possibly have been intentional, as the rest of the cast members are handled in the very same way. It's so forthright, uneasy, repetitive and awkward, it becomes a static transformation of stage material onto film. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nature vs. Nurture? No contest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is quite dated in that it sides strictly with Mother Nature in the child-raising debate. Yet self-esteem-deficient Mrs. Penmark (Nancy Kelly) is at least partly to blame in this story of sick family dynamics -- she is almost pathologically polite to her eerie daughter, even after she realizes that 9-year-old Rhoda is a triple murderer! Blonde, pig-tailed Patty McCormack is perfectly cast as the sinister grade-schooler, Kelly does well as her tentative parent, Henry Jones excels as a needs-a-life handyman who mercilessly teases the girl, and Eileen Heckart, though overdoing the boozer bit, is moving as a tragically bereaved mother.This movie is entertaining but omits some crucial facts from the book. It never makes clear, for example, that Mrs. Penmark is the biological daughter of a serial killer, thus explaining her murmuring of "bad seed" after she has tried to kill herself. Compensating somewhat for the movie's faults, the "Au Clair de la Lune" musical score runs as an ideal counterpoint to the relentlessly obsessive plot. The version of this cult classic that I caught on public TV in NYC stopped some 10 minutes short, so I learned of the conclusion -- again, somewhat bowdlerized from the book -- on Wikipedia. Still, this movie satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very bad seed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a 8 year old boy's drowning a mother starts to question her perfect little girls innocents.The bad Seed is a film way, way ahead if its time. So ahead of its time that it still fits in with films of 2013. It has aged so beautiful like Elvira, you'll have a hard time telling it was a 1956 movie. The only thing giving it away is that it is black and white, but even so I think if this movie was made today it should be done in B&amp;W. B&amp;W add's so much to this film it gives it so much charm and makes the film so real because it is such a 'dark' film that being in B&amp;W it really enhance that.The Acting in this film is some of the best I have seen Nancy Kelly gives one hell of a performance along with Patty McCormack who were both nominated for an Oscar along with Eileen Heckart for their acting. Nancy plays Christine Penmark the mother of Rhoda Pennmark played by Patty. The two together was so great at times I had forgotten that they were acting and not really mother and child, they made me forget I was watching a movie at times. They were so real I truly feel they were robbed out of the Oscar. The acting in Bad Seed is so memorable it stays with you for a long time. Nancy plays the tormented mother so good she is very haunting. Patty plays an emotionless perfect child so well she is truly a frightening kid, I would never wanna meet her. . Eileen Heckart plays Hortense Daigle the mother of the boy who was killed she becomes the towns drunk and she plays it so well you well forget that she is acting sober even her speech is very sloppy. Henry Jones who plays Leroy needs a shout out he was definitely great to watch.The film was also up for best cinematography giving it a total of four Academy Award nominations. I do agree the camera work in this film was great there was some dolly's shots and even a jib shot I know these kind of shots are nothing new but for some reason I just like to see them in older films. I also liked how most everything on screen was always in focus I always love that. What makes this movie complete and makes it so ahead of its time is its dialogue, the dialogue is easy to listen to they use simple words and don't try so hard to be so proper. They even toss in a few slang words like 'holler.' The dialogue is definitely not 1950's its very true and real. I really did enjoy this film. Its a easy and awesome watch. It is along the lines of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane and Rosemary's baby. If you are in the mood for a really good old B&amp;W film look no more The Bad Seed is the film for you. It is well written and well acted its a master piece I hope it is not soon forgotten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary stuff, and very real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the play upon which this film is based years ago, and was given the kind of fright that one has for a wild animal or a machine gone haywire. The instructor reassured a very scared class that nothing like this ever happened. I asked someone I knew about such matters if the material in the play actually happened in real life. They assured me it did, and that said instructor was wrong.The Penmark's have almost the ideal daughter. She's perfect in nearly every way, except that she doesn't seem to have a whole lot in common with anyone, and seems fairly self serving. Can a bright little girl with braided pigtails and perfect blonde bangs be a criminal? Is it possible at the tender age of eight?A lot of the comments I've read on the bulletin board regard how the child needed love, not be ignored, or may have been mistreated. The problem is actually far more simple than that, and it's actually a hardware issue in the brain that no amount of therapy nor medication can solve. But, the arrogance of self assuredness, like some of the doctors portrayed in this film, believe otherwise. But, it was the 50s, and bringing this condition to lay audiences who were incredulous and in disbelief. After all, could this really happen? They must have thought this film was out of the realms of science fiction (my forte).The film itself is shot in the usual 1950s style; lots of masters which means the actors have to carry the film with their performances, and no amount of editing will nor can conceal any flaws in the story structure. And the acting is top notch. It's not really overstated, or no more so than American films of the time, but is appropriately near melodramatic during moments of high tension.Nancy Kelley plays the beleaguered mother who slowly discovers the awful truth about her only daughter, played by a very young and talented Patty McCormack. We have a characters who's into psychology played by Evelyn Varden who puts on heirs of knowing how the human mind works, but fails to see anything wrong within the family she serves. The two real experts and the slow handyman who knows more than anyone else played by the magnificent and venerable Henry James (known for tons of TV and film work).Theories are postulated, secrets exposed, evidence discovered. Things happen. And the we the audience are scared.It's estimated that one in four human beings is a psychopath. Which means that every fourth person you meet and interact with, is someone without remorse and incapable of empathy towards others. They are essentially governed by their reptilian instincts which uses high intellect for a vicious survival strategy (to put it in scientific animal speak). Is that what we have in this film? Is our darling little girl really just a human being in form only? You have to see the film to find out.I'll say this about the movie; the play is scarier. It truly is. Things happen in the play that the Hayes code and office obviously frowned on, and the production was no doubt altered for that very reason. So, if you think the film is scary, then you haven't seen anything yet.As per my title, this is a very real scenario, although from the literature I've read female psychopaths are a little more rare than their male counterparts, who tend to be more identifiable with violent or anti-social behavior. Regardless, the film portrays a nightmare for every parent; one that is worse than losing a child.I don't have too much more to say about this film, other than I wouldn't watch it alone if you're squeamish. See it once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You may never look at an innocent little child the same way again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood had dealt with the precocious little girl before with the likes of insipid movie starlet Shirley Temple. But by the mid-1950's the sweetness and innocence of the diminutive lassies with pigtails and pretty summer dresses had been tarnished by the advent of youth movements, and particularly the media attention of juvenile delinquency. The parental fear of something sinister brewing within their own little treasure is addressed in The Bad Seed, and the horror archetype of the creepy, evil child was thrust onto cinema goers, a tool of the uncanny and frightening monstrosity that still finds an audience in modern cinema (Insidious (2010) or Mama (2013) for example).But compared to the more direct horror of our modern child-monsters, Rhoda Penmark (Patty McCormack), the titular 'bad seed' of this narrative, presents herself as a wholly innocent girl, clinging onto parents and adults, subtly manipulating them with a pristine veneer, but hiding churlish glee. In early scenes Rhoda's doting landlady, Monica (Evelyn Varden), notices that whilst Rhoda's contemporaries wear the fashionable styles of the times (jeans and t-shirt), she still wears the attire of idealism - it seems, even in the '50's this vision of childhood is a lost image of Victoriana. But this is a petulant child, one of those girls who could 'scream and scream' until she gets what she wants (I've encountered a few adult "girls" who have the same temperament - encounters that are largely unpleasant).After losing a gold medal award at her school, Rhoda and her school friends go out for a picnic, and, off-camera, she pesters the little boy who had rightfully won the award. At home her mother, Christine (Nancy Kelly), holding conversation largely about the hot topic of the time, psychoanalysis - a preoccupation that is thinly thread throughout the film, - hears on the radio of the news that a child at the school picnic has drowned becomes fraught with anguish. But on arrival home, the precocious Rhoda walks in stating that the incident was "fun". This detachment from the event concerns Christine, but as time goes by, the mother begins to suspect that Rhoda is not an innocent in this death, and begins to unravel her daughters manipulative nature, believing eventually that Rhoda is a murderer.Aside from the heavy Freudian psycho-babble presented by the intellectuals that surround the Penmark family (the father, Col. Kenneth (William Hopper) is absent during Christine's mental collapse, away as he is for work), the film also portrays another social issue that still is topical today, the question of nature and nurture on the subject of child-rearing. As mother casts doubt upon the validity of her child's innocence, and begins to see the manipulative make-up of the girl, the issue of her own hereditary and parentage comes into question. This highlights rather naively, that there would be no way that a child raised in a stable home could commit any kind a atrocity, and that this behavioural trait is strictly for the lower classes. But this is a minor quibble.The film came to the screen through novel written by Willaim March (who died the same year of publication, 1954), then through the stage production written by Maxwell Anderson, to the screenplay written by John Lee Mahin and directed by veteran director Mervyn LeRoy. It is brilliantly cast, and particular attention should go to McCormack's performance. As a girl who presents innocence, but has the ability to snap and commit murder, she brings those juxtapositions with bravado and skill. It is also a quite frightening performance. It was a low budget film that garnered four academy award nominations, and introduced the concept in horror cinema that the monster is not always the uncanny icons such as the wolf man, but that the monstrous lives within humans. This, four years before that horror trope began its enduring mark on cinema with Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). You may never look at an innocent little child in quite the same way again.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a series of strange incidents and deaths surrounding the locals around her, a mother struggles to believe that her innocent-appearing daughter is behind it all and tries to keep her secret from coming out despite the fact that she keeps on acting the way she does.A lot more classy than it should be with the subject, this one still turned out alright despite the fact that it's a lot longer than it really should've been because it has to deal with the classiness of the situation first and foremost. That also makes this one far too long for what it should really be about, and that really tends to be noticed in the beginning where it tends to show the kid off as really being demented with her fake appearance and behavior that is far too sweet for that time-period, but once the death-toll begins to mount, it gets a lot more interesting and fun, even if due to the classy feel and overlong nature, it's still not as over-the-top as it should be. The last half is where it really gets enjoyable with a fantastic finale, but overall this one is just too long to really get anywhere.Today's Rating-Unrated/PG: Violence and children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bad Seed (1956)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bad Seed was an interesting movie about a young girl who turns out to be a heartless killer. The little girl, Rhoda, killed a young boy at a school picnic so she could have his medal. Rhoda believed that she deserved this medal because she thought she was the better writer. when ever she spoke to adults she was very mature and "perfect", acting like how a good little girl should act. During the film Rhoda's mother finds out she was adopted and was actually the daughter of a famous murderer killer, and believes that is why her daughter is stone cold killer. I give this film a 7 out of 10 because it was a very interesting movie and was good but I don't really enjoy these type of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Girls Go To Hell?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Purely by coincidence, I watched two movies in one day (presumably the only two ever made) that are attempting to link criminal tendencies with genetics. Both "The Bad Seed" and "Twisted Nerve" (the other one) controversially suggest there's a direct connection between the protagonists' deviant murders and their mental inheritances. The main difference, however, is that the latter film is a provocative, mildly sleazy and in-your-face shocker whereas "The Bad Seed" is a very stylish, eloquent and sophisticated period piece that moodily builds up its suspense towards an remotely uncomfortable climax. Personally I always cherished a huge devotion for (horror) movies dealing with murderous children. Considering the time of release and the obvious lack of explicit bloodshed, it may not be my favorite 'evil child' movie, but it's undeniably a pioneer in genre and thus a hugely important trend setter for later horror movies. Cherubic 8-year-old Rhoda Penmark is the seemingly ideal daughter: polite, intelligent, helpful and well-mannered. Her mother Christine slowly starts to notice, however, that Rhoda reacts extremely fanatic and relentless to certain things, like for example the spelling contest at school where she missed out on winning the medal by a narrow margin. But when the boy who did win the contest then mysteriously drowns during a school's picnic in the park and Rhoda is the one who was last seen with him, Christine has real reasons to get concerned. She gradually witnesses the dark side of Rhoda's character and righteously begins to wonder if her behavior could be linked to her own awful childhood memories. Probably the year 1956 was still a bit too soon for such a disturbing central premise, but what a shock-impact it must have made! The script is adapted from a stage play by Maxwell Anderson (which must have been even more shocking to behold) and that's admittedly the biggest problem I have with "The Bad Seed". There where other reviewers around here surefooted claim the film doesn't at all suffer from the typical stage-restrictions, I think it does. It's a slightly overlong film with a minimum of sets and art-decoration. And even though practically all the performances are marvelous and unforgettable, the film is exaggeratedly talkative and some characters' monologues - like, say, those of the incredibly overactive landlady Monica ? should have been a little more succinct. The entire final act is simultaneously brilliant and tacky. The "first" climax, where you actually expect the film to end (or, as in my case, hope the film would end) is staggering and efficiently shocking. The "second" and ultimate climax, on the other hand, may look tremendously spectacular but it's thoroughly unconvincing and doesn't at all fit the tone of the film. The end sequences are just clear evidence that Hollywood had to follow a strict set of rules regarding morality and that the right punishment overcomes those who commit crimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy but Campy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Homicidal children make for riveting movie subjects. However, they're also profoundly disturbing, so most filmmakers try to ascribe, if not justify, the moppets' murderousness as peer pressure ("The Sailor Who Fell From Grace from the Sea"), abuse ("Sling Blade"), or, well, Satan ("The Exorcist," "The Omen," ad nauseum). But in "The Bad Seed," William March (novelist), Maxwell Anderson (playwright) and Mervyn LeRoy (director) present us with darling little Rhoda, a pigtailed perpetrator who doesn't appear to be suffering any abuse (although Daddy doesn't seem to be around much) and seems relatively free from demonic possession (although she does throw one mean tantrum). No, they argue, Rhoda the Ripper is genetically pre-disposed to being a sociopath, i.e. just a bad seed. (Actually, with her mania for order, preference for things to people and utter lack of empathy, poor Rhoda seems to have some dangerous, high-functioning form of autism, but I don't know if that word even existed in the 1950s). But that's a horribly depressing thought, so they offset Rhoda's evil with some of the most stilted dialogue and histrionic acting in film history.No child, killer or no killer, has ever behaved as perfectly as Rhoda. She's neat (to the point of OCD), polite, and appears to adore her mother ("I always tell people I have such a nice Mommy! Such a pretty Mommy!"). And no mother has ever been more devoted, or suffered more operatically, than Christine Penmark, Rhoda's mom and carrier of the bad seed thanks to her own late mother, apparently a serial killer. (Um, there have been very few female serial killers in history, and why did it have to be the mother's genes that messed up little Rhoda? Feminists, sharpen your knives.) It's a tragic, compelling role that Nancy Kelly overplays with stagey gestures and melodramatic line readings ("Oh, don't START!"). Ms. Kelly won some acclaim on Broadway in the same part -- all the critics must have been sitting in the back row. Patty McCormick is excellent as Rhoda, Henry Jones is commendable as the creepy caretaker who tries to menace the wrong little girl, and all hats should be off to Eileen Heckart, a trouper and a professional who takes on thankless (and horribly named) role of Hortense Daigle, the drunk and despondent mother of poor Claude, a little classmate whom Rhoda may or may not have offed. In a film where everyone else is ridiculously well-mannered, she staggers into the Penmark whom, insults everyone, hints that she used to be something of a good-time gal and finally collapses on the sofa, from exhaustion as much as despair. We're supposed to pity her. Instead, we envy her since she seems to be having a blast. Still, even with all the absurdly exaggerated (or restrained) elements, "The Bad Seed" is going to get under your skin. I recommend watching it with your family -- really! -- and having a long, enjoyable argument afterwards. I guarantee that someone will like the ending (my sister did), someone will hate the ending (my Mom called it "Hollywood crapola"), and someone will make a rude comment about Hortense Daigle ("did anyone wonder if ol' Claude fell off that pier because he was nearsighted if he said SHE was the most beautiful Mommy in the world?" quipped my brother).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This broadway theatrical production does not transfer well to the screen. I found it too talky. Nancy Kelly overacts more than William Shatner has ever done. Some of the other performers turn in credible performances, I liked Henry Jones. I find the entire production is over the top from start to finish. Kelly's performance is good for a laugh or two, however, the subject matter of the film is not very funny. I would buy the video just to have this unique movie in my collection.

		<fullReview>This film was surprisingly unsettling for its time and its subject matter. We've seen lots of films where the lil' one goes bad (the good son, etc...) but this one is quite cinematic i must say. The highlight for me was composer Alex North's score. Beautifully Eerie would be the word to describe it. North's scores have predominantly used contemporary harmonies and dissonances. This is another great example of his superb style. Too bad we couldn't see 2001: a space odyssey, with his original score. Back to the Bad Seed: The lil' girls acting may seem over the top sometimes. Today she could've been diagnosed with Tourrett's syndrome or maybe overdosed on ADHD pills. But then she was just a nice little girl with a little temper every now and then. One other minor fault is the explanations about the nurtureful qualities of psychological behavior, to help the audience understand what's going on. Everyone remember "Psycho"? How we are told by the police what multiple personality disorder is? Remember how unnecessary that line feels today? Well, the Bad Seed has some of that as well. But overall it was quite a delight, and an examination of the anti-thesis of the happy american family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This filmed Stage Play is an interesting little melodrama. It's as creepy now as it was when I saw it as a teenager. Simplistic by today's standards, they didn't have the benefit of 25 years of genetic research and clinical data that makes the plot defunct now. If you can suspend your beliefs for the duration of the film, you will be chilled and irked by the realistic performances captured herein. Black and white films are not just poorer cousins of today's color and special effect wizardry. If that were the case, then few would be reading books for pleasure today. The film comes from a time when one was required to do more work when watching. More Work? I have enough to do already you may be thinking. Too true. Well, if you need to be entertained and no more than that, then you may want to save this film for another time. Just don't dismiss it out of hand. It is worth viewing and now has historical value as well as a good story and fine acting. Please keep in mind that good stories and fine acting are simply never outdated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when I was a child and it DID keep me awake and in therapy for a few years. Gotta say though that watching it recently was an utter joy. I haven't laughed so much on my own in ages. Nancy Kelly's hysterical squeaky voice kept creeping up in octaves as the 'terror' increased. Everyone was comfortably played in 2D and the (SPOILER ALERT!) 'basket full of whatever' drove me nuts. Then again see above... The only reality check was Eileen Heckart whose tortured distress was palpably heartbreaking and dare I say it realistically amusing at times. So much more could've been made of this 'idea'. I guess by the time 'The Children's Hour'was made, kids had better acting coaches or could simply act.(SPOILER ALERT!) Yes, it WAS too long, though 'the shoes, the shoes' made up for it but the ending was like being slapped awake. Nancy's Norma Desmond turban in hospital was a killer. I find it hard to believe that she was 36 at the time. Put it down to the stress of the seed.Does that mean she was 10 when she starred in Jesse James with Tyrone Power? A must see with friends and a glass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For many movie fans, "The Bad Seed" is either a cult film, which implies that they feel the movie has qualities that most viewers miss, or a guilty pleasure, which indicates that they know that the film is flawed, but they love it despite those weaknesses. For me, "The Bad Seed" is definitely a guilty pleasure.Despite a competent director, Mervyn LeRoy; excellent black and white cinematography by Harold Rosson; and a fine Alex North score; the stage origins of the film are not only apparent, they are emphasized with a thud before the final fadeout. With few exceptions, the performances, particularly by Nancy Kelly and Eileen Heckart, would have worked well when the audience was sitting in the second balcony, but, given the intimacy of film, even the heartbreaking work by Ms. Heckart appears histrionic and broad. Only Patty McCormack's Rhoda, the story's central character, works well despite its obvious theatrical underpinnings. When some of the supporting players, such as Paul Fix, appear on screen and skillfully underplay their parts, the over emoting by Kelly becomes all the more apparent.Long stretches of dialog that tediously expound the theory that criminal behavior can be inherited also slow the proceedings and add to the wordiness of the film. With all of the aforementioned negatives, why is "The Bad Seed" so addictive that I have seen it repeatedly over the years? Looking like a refugee from "The Village of the Damned," young Patty McCormack is a key to the film's appeal. Her amoral, emotionally dead, cloying, and obviously patronizing Rhoda is unforgettable, although viewers could certainly wonder how naive the adults around her could be not to see through her act. Actually, the uneducated, intellectually stunted gardener/janitor, played with diabolical relish by Henry Jones, is the only adult that Rhoda cannot con with her angelic act.The slowly unraveling plot, as Rhoda's mother finds clue after clue and comes to a devastating realization, is great fun and teeters on the edge of camp. Rhoda's transparent exchanges with her parents ("What will you give me for a basket of kisses?" "I'll give you a basket of hugs.") are groan-inducing, yet key to the internal logic of the movie. Perhaps one reason that the film is so repeatable is that viewers hold out hope that eventually the adults that Rhoda so easily manipulates will see through the pigtailed brat and give her the thrashing that she so richly deserves. For those who share W.C. Fields's dim view of children, the blonde, angelic little girl, who is flawlessly polite and curtsies daintily, fulfills all of their suspicions about the true nature of children. Whatever flaws the film may have, "The Bad Seed" is compulsive viewing and draws one into a world of its own fabrication, where shamelessly emoting adults can be manipulated by the obvious lies and patronizing mannerisms of a demonic ten-year girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering it was made in 1956, The Bad Seed is a pretty effective chiller. The only real comment I have is about the acting. It is all over the place. Little Patty McCormick is outstanding, as is Eileen Heckart as the grief-stricken mother of the murder victim. But Nancy Kelly (the mother) is SO bad it is painful to watch. She is so melodramatic and over the top that it almost makes the movie campy or a B status. Too bad because the rest of it is first-rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maxwell Anderson play fails to register as strongly on screen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Bad Seed' is derived from a very theatrical stage play that, when transferred to the screen, shows its stage origins too clearly. A more natural performance by over-the-top Nancy Kelly would have made this taut tale more believable, but Mervyn LeRoy has done nothing to tone down Kelly's overwrought portrayal of the mother who discovers her precious daughter is really the daughter from hell.Patty McCormack scores heavily as Rhoda Penmark, the pig-tailed blonde, blue-eyed beauty everyone thinks is an angel in disguise. Her scenes with Henry Jones provide some real shivers. Jones, as the handyman who comes to know too much about Rhoda, should have been nominated for an Oscar for his unforgettable, pathetic creature. As it is, McCormack, Kelly and Eileen Heckert (as the alcoholic mother of a dead boy) were all Oscar-nominated although none were winners.Nancy Kelly overacts to a painful degree in a plum role that she originally created on stage. She lost the Oscar to Ingrid Bergman of 'Anastasia'. The major fault in the film lies in the stagey over-acting that seems to permeate all of the performances. This provides unintentional humor when least expected.As with many a theatrical or book property, the ending of the play had to be changed to comply with Hollywood's 1956 production code. The result is a less than satisfactory conclusion without the more dramatic shock appeal of the play. Nevertheless, although uneven and overlong, it holds your attention throughout and makes you wish you were watching the original play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Furstration, anger, and surprised. These are the emotions that I felt throughout this entire movie. I was frustrated and angry that the mother never did anything to really punish her daughter until close to the end of the movie. I was surprised when the mother tried to kill herself after giving her daughter sleeping pills. At first I thought 'finally, this girl is going to get what she deserves.' Then when the mother went into the her room I seriously thought the movie might end there, but when the gunshot went off I was shocked. Also, when Rhoada turned out to be OK after her overdose I was also shocked. The acting was incredible, especially from Nancy Kelly and Patty McCormack. I thought it was pretty good acting coming from a child. I think, though, that this is the first time the the realism for both the story in the movie,and in real life isn't that believable. In the movie, the mother first doesn't believe that it's possible for her daughter to be a killer. Then when she finds out the truth, she doesn't tell anyone because she knows that no one will believe her. As for real life, I sure have never heard of an eight-year-old child being a killer.I like how the director, Mervyn LeRoy, presented the cast after the movie. He presented the cast as if it was an end of a play. Which makes sense since the story was originally a play, and Mervyn LeRoy has directed plays in the past. The movie was good, but in my opinion all the mother had to do was exactly what the mother did after the credits. Spank her daughter and tell her that she is bad!</fullReview>

But the movie was nevertheless riveting, a superb and daring drama, spellbinding and very witty.

		<shortDescription>Not just "Bad"....it's truly AWFUL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scanning the other readers' reviews, I'm really wondering if I somehow saw some other movie altogether. This film ranks near the top of the "ALL-TIME WORST" lists in several categories: Atrocious, amateurish acting (worst offenders? Nancy Kelly, Evelyn Varden, William Hopper), extremely poor writing (yeah, yeah, it's the venerable Maxwell Anderson and all that--but some of this dialogue is just DRECK!) and ham-fisted direction by Mervyn LeRoy. One can hardly forget for one minute that these actors are just parroting the same lines, by rote, that they performed hundreds of times on stage. The central offense of this film is the over-the-top, scenery-chewing and inappropriate performance of Nancy Kelly. She strikes absolutely the wrong note in just about every scene and her bizarre body language and just plain odd line readings are impossible to take seriously. Most amazingly of all, she was nominated for an Oscar for this film (as were Patty McCormick and Eileen Heckart for "Best Supporting Actress"...HUH?). Mervyn LeRoy was clearly asleep at the wheel of this runaway train. Very sloppily directed...these actors were clearly crying out for some kind of guidance, but it seems that LeRoy merely said, "Just do whatever you did on stage!" Even the often wonderful actress, Eileen Heckart, is allowed to flail her limbs and stumble roughshod through her two scenes--with some direction, her performance might have been somewhat contained and touching, rather than the campy harridan she 's allowed to present. And finally, Patty McCormick. Okay, she's memorable alright...but her stagy, disingenuous performance in this film is pretty tough to take. Again, had she been taken in hand by a firm director, it might have worked. Instead, what we're left with is a real hoot-fest. Perhaps it's not fair to give "The Bad Seed" only 1 star...since if you're as "into" really bad, campy films as I am, this is an excellent choice. If you surrender to the fact that this film is NOT to be taken seriously and enjoy it for all its wonderful badness, you're in for a treat!</fullReview>

Campy best explains the mood of this flick. Plus it is WAY TOO LONG! This story could have been a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode with no trouble at all.

		<fullReview>"The Bad Seed" is a movie based on the play, based on the novel, of an amoral little girl who commits murder. That's about it. I had heard of this play and movie since as far back as I can remember... as a child my parents and other adults would tell me about the movie, and it sounded like a classic theme and timeless story. At age thirty-three, I finally got around to seeing the movie and I can tell you it is peanut diarrhea.First, the dialogue and staging? every character's mouth is packed full of stiff, stilted paragraphs that don't resemble human speech in any way. My favorite example: "Well I'll be a middle-aged mongoloid from Memphis..." Since the movie is just a filmed version of the play, we're stuck in one set the entire time, and it's where our characters talk, talk, and talk some more- in spite of the fact that there's not enough story to sustain the weight of the words. Claustrophobia and endless talking are not a good combination.Then we have Nancy Kelley, as Mother to "bad seed" Rhoda. Miss Kelley is mannered, theatrical, and sings every one of her lines as if she were doing backup vocals on a Ray Charles record. There is an insanity to her- Kelley, not her character- that is more than a little unsettling. Her sing-songy delivery makes much of her dialogue absurd, especially when she has to convey anger, hurt or fear. The acting of Patty McCormack as evil child Rhoda is tolerable when she's angry, but infuriatingly saccharine when she's "fooling" others by acting pure and innocent. We get it- she's bad but she acts sweet. Next!The bizarre introduction to the film- and even more bizarre epilogue- renders the entire story null and void. We're introduced to the cast- just in case the "ignorant" audience ever forget this was just make-believe- and Nancy Kelley spanks Patty McCormack, grinning ear-to-ear, evidently a fitting punishment for a multiple murderer! We can laugh about it now, right?Wrong. This is a sloppy, ridiculous embarrassment, and one of the most-dated and obsolete movies since "Anatomy Of A Murder." I wasn't expecting "Citizen Kane," but I did hope to discover why this movie was so famous, and so well-remembered by people who had seen it. I should have checked the expiration date: Best If Viewed by August 1957.GRADE: F</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>completely undermined by a pretty HORRIBLE ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is aching for a remake to correct the horrible ending. Up until the very end, this one a very creepy and entertaining film about an evil sociopathic child. This child has absolutely no conscience and will even kill for the smallest reasons--all because she is just BAD! I especially like when the neighbors start to catch on that this child is like Lucifer, Jr. but the parents use denial to convince themselves that their little girl is just "misunderstood" (yeah, "misunderstood" just like Hitler). Ultimately, though, the mother is faced with the fact that the kid is an evil spawn and she MUST kill it! The only complaint I had at this point, and it's a minor one, is that the dialog was a bit over-the-top and the film seemed stagy (it was after all adapted from a play). Now, as of 95% of the way through the film, I would have given the film a 9 or a 10--it was that good and suspenseful. BUT, again and again, the movie did not end when it could have but lingered on and on. For example, it COULD have ended after the mom tried to kill herself and the kid. It also COULD have ended after the little girl made it sound like she was going to kill Aunt Monica to get her pet birds. But, the movie ends with an out of the blue lightning bolt that zaps the demon spawn and turns her into charcoal! Huh!??! Unexpected this was--but also really stupid and contrived.PS--My ORIGINAL review was a little different, as I remembered the movie as having ended differently--badly, yes, but different. But, after seeing the DVD again, I changed my review to reflect the ending on the DVD. Later, I checked the Leonard Maltin guide and it indicated there WERE different endings to the movie--the original "cop out" Hollywood ending (with everything ending happily) and the DVD one which consisted of God hitting her with a lightning bolt at the end. Once again, both these endings were dumb--one too ridiculously upbeat and the other just completely out of left field and goofy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick has become an icon - even "The Brady Bunch Movie" references it. However, the translation from stage to screen in the mid-Fifties left much to be desired. Nancy Kelly's Tony-winning turn as the mother translates poorly to film, although she gained an Oscar nom. Eileen Heckart is amazing (another repeat from Broadway), and she steals the show as the murdered boy's drunken mother. Patty McCormack is not even remotely frightening in the lead, as her mannerisms are those of her original stage performance, and they come across as a parody on film. Henry Jones as LeRoy is equally cartoonish, and William Hopper, as the father, seems daft, at best.The old censorship code robbed the film of the original novel and stage ending. The "curtain call" finale must have seemed ludicrous, even in 1956.Yes, I recommend this film for its kitsch value - it's one of those film history necessities. However, I'd love to see another remake (I have no memory of the 85 TV-movie version, although I did see it), with a truly sinister child in the lead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic Child Exploitation Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bad Seed" was one of the first stories to employ the gimmick of a young child as murderous monster. Bill March's novel starting things off, followed by Maxwell Anderson's stage play, and later John Mahon's screenplay.While there's some medical and psychiatric case studies confirming such possibility, the odds for this happening are extremely rare. Thus when it's put up on the big screen it takes on gargantuan proportions--much more so than when enacted on the stage.The movie seems stagy and contrived, though the hard working original theater cast certainly tries its best. Too, by the time little McCormick did the film she had aged some, which the telling camera reveals in closer shots. The imposed censorship changes (like the final "bolt from the blue") hurt the film's impact, while the "cast call" as "codetta" which seemed silly in '56 looks incredible today. Thank "The Bad Seed" for such as "The Exorcist" and its spinoff "The Omen." Yes, these young "bad seed and possessed monsters" are mere ploys to intrigue and titillate horror/mystery fans, while having little basis in real life. Mervyn LeRoy's direction is serviceable, as is Alex North's appropriately quirky score.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considered "shocking" in its day (largely on the basis of PR), "The Bad Seed" remains little more than an interesting relic today. Yes, I saw the film on its initial release (I was 12). Even then, it didn't work -- as a film. From all accounts, it DID work on Broadway as a play.Nancy Kelly, Patty McCormack, Henry Jones and Eileen Heckart reprise their stage roles here. Interesting that only Heckart understood the different requirements for film acting and stage acting. Her two brief scenes are the only honest (and heartbreaking) moments in the film.Even director Mervyn LeRoy apparently hadn't the professionalism to alter the others' stage (and stagy) performances that had been set in stone during the Broadway run.Nancy Kelly's odd, idiosyncratic sing-song line delivery is pathetically "attention getting." "Watch me act the hell out of this," she seems to whine in every scene. Banging the table repeatedly while Rhoda plays that infernal piano as smoke billows outside and the yardman screams is NOT acting. It's indicating. It's commenting. But then, Kelly's every on screen moment seems to be "commenting" on her character's plight, rather than inhabiting that character. As an archival record of her stage performance, its valuable in revealing a certain style of acting that, in the '50s, was already becoming rapidly outdated. Kelly never enjoyed much of a film career, or a stellar stage career, for that matter.McCormack is effective, for the most part, until her "big scene" where she reveals the truth of what happened at the picnic. Then, her limited acting skills are all too visible. She has two levels: phony sweetness and phony hysterics. Phony sweetness (when you know the kid is really a murderer) plays, for awhile. Phony hysterics in a child psychopath is the wrong choice (though it may have worked well on stage). Instead of jumping from "sweet" to "rage" without any transitional steps (always one sign of a poor actor), a "real" psychopath would have used the moment to launch into tearful "vulnerable" pleas for understanding. A far more effective and subtle choice -- both for an actor and a psychopath (all psychopaths are actors, after all).Henry Jones' portrayal veers too close to a baggy-pants vaudeville comedian to be remotely plausible. Jones was an excellent actor. But not here. "Ham" caricature wasn't needed: real sympathy was.Only Eileen Heckart delivers the goods. The clash between her performance (which is the real thing) and the rest of the cast is startlingly obvious -- even to a 12 year old audience member."The Bad Seed" couldn't work today -- or even a few years after it was made. It was never a great play. It relied completely on the "shock" value of its theme. On Broadway, perhaps its most disturbing element was its ending -- yet that was jettisoned for the film version because of the "moral" dictates of the times.In the play, Mommy dies and Rhoda survives to kill another day. "What will you give me for a basket of kisses," Daddy asks. "I'll give you a basket of hugs!" Curtain.Not here. Instead, we are treated to a tacked-on ending where Rhoda (in a noisy thunderstorm in the middle of the night, no less), sneaks out of the house and onto the pier to retrieve -- what? That penmanship medal Mommy threw back in the lake? One forgets. It doesn't matter. The orchestra and sound effects department whip up a frenzy of a storm while little Patty McCormack is required to -- what? Walk? That's it? Then, BOOM! Deus ex machina. God takes care of the plot by obliterating the little actress, uh, Rhoda, with a bolt of lightning. Then the camera pans up into the trees.But wait! There's more! Cheapening an already cheap shot of a film even further, we must now sit through "curtain calls" of the actors as they appear, smiling, in the doorway of the Penmark's apartment. (Get the symbolism YET? "Penmark" and "penmanship medal?" It was that kind of play.) This bizarre sequence ends with Nancy Kelly mock-spanking Patty McCormack on the sofa.Presumably so the presumably terrified audience can presumably return to their normal lives after the presumed shocks of this presumed thriller.Even At 12, I knew I'd been ripped off. And the film looks worse with age. A deservedly ignored anachronism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrendous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so tired of people applauding films just because they are old. This film out &amp; out sucked. Not scary, not funny, not clever or good for 1 minute! Absolutely awful. An utter waste of time &amp; I can not stand when people say to please not remake this. Why not? Worst case scenario it won't be as awful. I've heard about them remaking this and took advice to rent the original. To hear it was nominated at one time is unacceptable. Geesh. The same year Giant came out this actually graced that stage. I recommend you do not waste your time. save your money.Stay home and watch American Idol. The girl on that show would be more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don?t bother watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie features quite possibly the worst acting I have ever seen, on the part of the young girl. The mother is the best actress in the film. She comes across as believable, as do many of the minor characters. Unfortunately the little girl with her whiney cooing to her mother is just plain bad. This is a very bad thing since the ability of the girl to manipulate others is a key factor in making the film seem convincing. Plot wise this film reminds me of some 1980?s movie about a psychopathic nanny or child or cute family member. I believe that this theme is played out, and wasn?t that good to begin with. It may not have been played out when The Bad Seed was released, but poor execution spoil any sort of innovativeness. Plot twists mostly consist of someone getting killed, so the film relies on shock value to keep the viewer attuned. I can?t imagine why this film has gotten such good reviews, unless it has been rated mainly by the sort of people who turn to AMC to find out what they like and to MST3K to find out what they don?t like. Is watching this movie worth your time? I very much doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake for a suggestion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must tell you that I do not approve for this movie because it is not the movie I want to see. Even I think Patty McCormack is a wonderful actress playing a villain. Perhaps a remake of this movie as a suggestion because now that high definition and digital sound are in theatres. Even I think Dakota Fanning would play a wonderful Rhonda for the remake. Amanda Detmer; Renee Zellweger or Mary McCormack would make a wonderful Rhonda's mother. Emilio Estevez or Charlie Sheen would make an excellent Rhonda's father. I think the remake should be even more different than the original version because I think this is an excellent idea.</fullReview>
