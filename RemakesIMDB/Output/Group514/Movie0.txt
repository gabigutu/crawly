		<shortDescription>Major Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest trick this movie pulls off is in fooling its audience that it is a piece of fluff. Admittedly, it is to a certain extent, but nobody is more conscious of the limitations of the genre than the makers of this film themselves. The satire on the mistaken identity disaster is so well done here that every scene contains valuable clues and cinematic winks at the viewer. Is it plausible that a 30 year old woman can pull off acting like a 12 year old? The initial response is no, which Billy Wilder and Ginger Rogers reinforce through the disconnect between Rogers' SuSu and the precocious reality of the adolescent set. The pedophilic subtext of the film seems to be a remarkable case of flipping the proverbial bird to the often restrictive framework of the romantic comedy genre. Rogers' inability to escape predatory advances - whether it be by grownups in the big city or 13 year old military school boys - is an ironic point well made by Wilder; this film indeed seems an exploration of extreme fate. Take the inevitable wedding of Pamela that occurs regardless of the identity of the groom, or the fact that on every date Rogers is subjected to go on with a Cadet, it becomes the exact same date. More to the point, the connection between Ray Milland's Major Kirby and Rogers does not change as they meet with Rogers taking on three separate incarnations. The film is indeed deceptively smart; because it refuses to beat you over the head with the fact, it is still absolutely unassuming and lovable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder and his excellent collaborator, Charles Brackett, knew what the movie going public of the time wanted to see. So, it's not a surprise they achieved a great hit with "The Major and the Minor". One has to go back to the time this film was made to realize what the creators of this comedy accomplished. This marked the first Hollywood film Mr. Wilder directed and his touch is everywhere. The movie stands the passage of time."The Major and the Minor" works because of its two stars. Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland were versatile actors who showed perfect chemistry in the film. Both do excellent work guided by the masterful hand of Billy Wilder.Ginger Rogers' take on the little girl is fine. Of course, we, the viewers, know what is going on, but to the rest of the people she is nothing but the innocent, and young SuSu Applegate. Ray Milland, on the other hand, is proper throughout the film until the end, when the mystery is solved. Mr. Milland's timing is impeccable and he makes his Maj. Kirby a sort of absent minded "uncle" to the young SuSu.Billy Wilder showed a flair for this type of comedy. He got wonderful supporting performances from Rita Johnson and the disarming Diana Lynn, as the two sisters with different viewpoints on everything. Also, the opening sequence involving the incomparable Robert Benchley shows us a lecherous man who has hired the grown up Susan for a scalp treatment, that in his mind will lead into something else. Mr. Benchley and Ms. Rogers are hilarious.This film established Billy Wilder as a director who went far and enjoyed a long career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's Directing Debut - "Su-Su you're a knockout!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder, like his contemporary Preston Sturgis, gained attention in Hollywood at Paramount Studio as a screen writer. And oddly enough both decided to become directors because of unfair feelings towards the work of director Mitchell Leisin with their scripts. Wilder did not like Leisin's work with MIDNIGHT, and Sturgis did not like his work with REMEMBER THE NIGHT. It was unfair because Leisin did not have the cynical edge of Wilder and Sturgis, but Leisin was into bringing a more human element into his films (oddly enough, in later years, Wilder would too). They both got permission from Paramount to direct - Wilder a little after Sturgis did, because Sturgis had demonstrated he could be quite successful as a director. THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR is Wilder's first film as director, and his first comedy. He demonstrated in it that he was above average in his ability to direct, getting the first good performance he got out of Ray Milland and an equally good one out of Ginger Rogers. He and his partner Charles Brackett did the screenplay here - a simple story of a woman who gets fed up with her failing life in New York City, and decides to return (however regretfully it may seem) to her small mid-western town. But Susan Applegate has a problem - she hasn't enough money for her ticket by train. Then she discovers she does have enough for her ticket if she can convince everyone she is a very tall teenager. So she does, as twelve year old "Su Su Applegate". Complete with pig-tales and a balloon (and temporarily accompanied by Tom Dugan, who agrees to be her "father" for a price) "Su Su" gets her ticket, only to be cheated by Dugan out of most of the remaining money she was carrying (she does kick him though!).She ends up hiding from suspicious conductors in a private sleeping compartment with Major Philip Kirby (Milland), who is returning to his job at a military academy after a fruitless attempt to get into the war effort (it is 1942). Kirby is engaged to the daughter of the commandant of the academy, Pamela Hill (Rita Johnson). What he doesn't know is that Pamela is determined to undermine every attempt he makes to get a war job. She has connections through her father's friends, which she uses like an expert. It helps that Philip has an eye problem (though not a major one).Because she is traveling alone, Philip takes Su-Su to the academy until they can have her picked up or driven to her home. She becomes an instant social success with all of the cadets - most of whom test out their young libidos on her by demonstrating how the Nazi blitzkrieg by-passed the Maginot Line (you have to see it to believe it). Only one person is not taken in - Pamela's sister Lucy (Diana Lynn). Lucy is going to be a scientist, and she can tell that Su-Su is just too well developed to be her age. But Lucy and Su-Su soon develop a close friendship (as Lucy eventually admits, Susan is far more of a sister to her than Pamela ever was). So Su-Su's secret is safe - and she and Lucy soon are trying to figure out how to counteract Pamela's efforts against Philip.The film has many lovely touches, like Su-Su taking over the switch board (the cadet who is caught as a result, and who has been listening to "My Mother Done Told Me", looks angrily at her and yells out "A woman's a two-face!"). There are also the appearances of Robert Benchley as the amorous Mr. Osborne, who knew Susan as Susan in New York, but meets Su-Su at a dance at the military academy (Benchley's son is a cadet there). He goes crazy trying to figure out where he met this girl before. But best is the interaction between Milland and Rogers, one highlight of which shows Wilder at his wickedest (and would not be repeated in 1940s comedies again). Trying to get little Su-Su to be careful with the cadets, "Uncle Philip" gives her a "birds and the bees" lecture. She asks him if he thinks she is attractive. He looks carefully at her, and says, "Why Su-Su you're a knockout!' She leaves, and he shuts the door smiling. The smile has a touch too much teeth in it - almost a sensual smile. And Milland realizes it...and a moment later he cringes thinking that he is becoming a potential child molester.Will Philip get his wartime commission? Will Pamela get defeated, and Susan eventually reveal herself to Philip as a grown woman (she likes him very much)? You have to see the film to see how it works out. It also has the added attraction of Ginger Roger's mother Leila playing Susan's mother. Altogether a capital film, and a good directorial debut for Wilder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's directorial debut is one of the American cinema's classic screwball comedies. Ginger Rogers is electric as the blue-collar gal whose adventures begin when she dresses herself up as a youngster so she can afford to ride home on the train (she only has half-fare). Robert Benchley heads a magnificent supporting cast, and Ray Milland acts his role to a "tee." If you've never seen this, you are in for a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I understood how reviews are selected to be displayed as the IMDb-approved review. The current one for "The Major and the Minor" is a major disgrace. The movie article the little girl picks up at Penn Station is NOT "Why I Hit Women," by Charles Boyer, it is "Why I Hate Women." It's a joke-- obviously too subtle for some-- because Charles Boyer is of course one of the great lovers of the screen, one everyone would have known when this film was released in 1941. It's similar to when Ginger Rogers' character as a girl on the train is asked to speak Swedish for the conductors, who question her veracity. She answers, "I want to be alone." Again, this joke is something every movie viewer then would have known as an allusion to Swedish film star Greta Garbo. "The Major and the Minor" is a marvelous film and deserves better treatment on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just amusing fluff?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The enjoyable performances do a lot to help this film rise above average, and they are what initially made me love this movie. And even though the basic plot seemed to be mere fluff to me when I first saw it, I'm now persuaded that this movie definitely runs deeper. After reading other comments here that delved into the themes, I thought of a particular scene that struck me as odd when I first watched this. At the station, when Ginger first gets the idea to pose as a child, a mother is looking at magazines with her two children- a boy and a girl. The young daughter insists on buying a movie magazine and reads aloud from the cover, "Why I hit women, by Charles Boyer." The way the child says this and the very fact that this particular line is included just stayed in my mind as I watched this film. Others commented on how Ginger's character is always suffering predatory advances- both as an adult and as an eleven year old. Now I see it differently when I think of the scene where Ray Milland is looking at her with one eye closed and telling her what a knock-out he can tell she'll be in a few years. Well of course, he's really looking at a 30 year old, but he believes she's a child and I think this really brings up issues of how sexualized (and maybe preyed upon ?)women are at any age, whether they are adults or children. Well, that really makes this an odd and interesting movie, mixing some risqué topics with highly enjoyable, light-hearted fluff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Falls for Minor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Major and The Minor" is director, Billy Wilder's, first directorial movie, and it was a hit. About 90% of Billy Wilder's comedies were hits. It's an adorable story about a New York City working girl (Ginger Rogers) wanting to go home to Iowa, but not having enough money for the train fare so she goes as a minor (12 years old). Along the way, she meets a Major from a boys military school (Ray Milland) and gets involved with his life unintentionly and falls in love. It is an unusual story, but it works. The chemistry between Rogers and Milland is perfection. They made a great team. In 1944, they made another terrific movie, "Lady in the Dark", which was a comedy with musical numbers. This was Ginger Rogers' best movie and Ray Milland was her best leading man. They complimented each other. Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland had something in common, they could do comedy and drama easily. Not many actors can do that. My favorite thing about this movie is the romance, but the next thing I liked is the supporting actress, Rita Johnson, who was a superb villain in comedies. She was always fighting to get the guy. I won't say the movie is dated but you do notice the movie represents the 1940's during the war years; it shows how the people looked and acted differently than they do today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Billy Wilder film stars Ginger Rogers as a grown thirty year old woman passing herself off as a twelve year old kid, PLEASE!! The storyline is unbelievable BUT....made very funny and watchable by its stars.Susan is a woman who is fed up with New York. She left her little hometown to find happiness in the big city, only to find it filled with disappointment. So she decides to head back home on the train. When she gets there she finds that she is short funds. Not knowing what to do she gets a hairbrained idea that she could simply pass herself off as a kid to pay less!! When the conductor on the train gets wise, she runs and hides in the compartment of Ray Milland. Ginger makes little SuSu(Susan) so cute and delightful and Milland is funny and sweet as the(obviously blind) military school teacher. It sounds stupid but it isn't really. Give it a chance and you'll love it. ENJOY!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers plays Susan Applegate who wants to leave New York behind and go back home to Iowa.But she doesn't have the railway fare so she disguises herself as a 12 year old girl to ride half fare.At the train she meets Major Philip Kirby (Ray Milland) who takes "the little girl" with him to military school.There little Susu is surrounded by all the boys because she is a knock out for a 12 year old. The Major and the Minor from 1942 is a Billy Wilder comedy with some funny moments.It's not his best work but it is much better than many comedies nowadays.Ginger Rogers is brilliant in the lead.She makes a great kid even though she doesn't seem like a kid.In 1955 they made a remake for this called You're Never Too Young with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, which was also funny.This movie is a must see for every Billy Wilder fan because this was his American debut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A foretaste of even Wilder things to come!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This almost insane concoction is delicious fun, a portent of some of the even funnier moments that Billy Wilder and his collaborators eventually brought to the screen. The cast, given the difficulty inherent in the script (Do all of these people really believe that the adult Miss Rogers is barely entering pubescence?), is note-perfect, especially Diana Lynn, as Lucy Hill, whose powers of observation allow the audience to recognize that there's at least one character on to the central ruse that sets the plot in motion.Mini-SPOILER to follow: Who can forget an inebriated Robert Benchley's invitation to a rain-soaked Susan Applegate to shed her clothes and step into a dry martini? How did Wilder and Brackett get away with it back when the Production Code shackled the naughtier inclinations of Hollywood's more sophisticated professionals? I'll bet that line alone resulted in an "Objectionable in Part for All" rating from the ever-prudish Legion of Decency!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Wilder's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susan Applegate (Ginger Rogers) gives up on pursuing her dreams in New York, and decides to return home on the next train. Not being able to afford an adult ticket, she pretends to be 11 (12 next week). This plan is rough to start with, and gets more difficult when she meets a handsome military man (Ray Milland) on the train...Billy Wilder had gotten sick of his writing being taken by directors and butchered from his original vision. This marks his directorial debut, and it is a brilliant piece of film. Is it his masterpiece? Probably not. But I'd say it is better than many other of Wilder's works.Can Ginger Rogers pull off being 12? On one hand, clearly not. But, at the same time, any actress that could would probably not be able to be the woman that is hidden underneath the child disguise. For the most part, the transformation is impressive, even if not completely believable.I absolutely loved this film, and have not found myself more engrossed by a classic film in a long time (and I do watch plenty of classics). If you love Billy Wilder or Ginger Rogers, or want to get acquainted with either one, I would say this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Major and the Minor is a lot of fun. Ginder Rogers and Ray Milland are outstanding in this romp about a young woman who is tired of life in the big city and wants to get home to a small town in Iowa. She convinces a ticket agent to sell her a child's ticket because she doesn't have enough money to get a regular fare home.She passes for 12 years old which was frankly hard for me to believe. But still, Rogers is endearing and Milland is perfect as a Major in a military school. Early on look for Robert Benchley who plays a rich hotel resident wanting more than a combination egg and shampoo treatment. Rogers real life mother can be seen at the end of the film playing same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lifetime favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it as a young teen becoming addicted to the wit and charm of so many of the films of the 30's and 40's. I loved it for its humor, for Rogers' combination of sass, guts and tenderness, and for the way it winked at its own unlikely premise. I'd never given a lot of thought to the Lolita-esqe subtext addressed by many here. What strikes me about it now is that it's just one element of the theme of sex-as-potential-exploitation that's woven throughout--from the ogling of Susan in New York, to her unpleasant encounter with Benchley, to her exhausting attempts to avoid male teenage libidos at the military academy. What makes Wilder's treatment of that theme so wonderful, and perhaps why his films are not merely shallowly risqué, is the way that potential is just observed, rather than being the whole point of the movie. The point instead, in this film as in his later ones, is the capacity of mature, clear-eyed adults to navigate past sexual predators and through their own cynicisms to find love. POSSIBLE MINI-SPOILER: That theme is epitomized for me in this film in that last scene where Rogers is gloriously, luminously revealed as an adult, taking charge of her life and sexuality with eyes and heart wide open. I think that's really why I love this film. That, and the fact that it's charming and hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Can Suspend Belief, Ginger Makes It Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was charmer, with some funny moments and two attractive likable leads in Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland. This is one of those classics I really enjoyed when I first watched it but dragged too much when seen recently. Sometimes, the more you get used to modern movies, the more some of these classic films can seem too slow. This is an example.Also (and I am a classic movie fan despite these comments), this film is another example of how much viewers were asked to suspend belief in these older films. Here were asked to believe that no one would suspect that a grown-up Ginger Rogers couldn't pass as a 12-year-old? One look at the very female-like Rogers and it's previous obvious she's and adult, especially at the dance near the end of the film.Well, if you can overlook that, this is still a fun movie. Sometimes the dated dialog and attitudes of the time period make it all the more fun. Rogers was a great comedienne, not just Fred Astaire's most famous dance partner. She is the big star of this film.There is a bit of "Lolita" mentality in here as Milland begins to fall for this "12- year-old." They never really tell you here whether Milland knew how old she was all along, however. The end the film a bit too abruptly as the two run off to get married!!!! As I said, there are lots of holes in this story but it is entertaining enough that you don't care. Of note, too, is that Rogers' real-life mother plays her mom in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out Of Wet Clothes Into A Dry Martini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paramount Pictures finally gave Billy Wilder a chance to direct his own material with The Major And The Minor. This rather interesting comedy depends a great deal not on just Wilder's writing and directing, but on the considerable comedy talents of Ginger Rogers to put it over. It's not easy for an actress in the full flower of maturity to pretend to be an adolescent, but Rogers was certainly up to the task.Rogers plays Susan Applegate from Stevenson, Iowa who has had just about enough of New York. After trying several professions and making no headway in any of them, she's ready to cash it in and go back to Stevenson, maybe marry a local guy there. But cash is the problem when she comes up just short of the fare from New York to Stevenson. What to do, but pretend she's a child and travel for half fare.A rather interesting set of circumstances has her stopping off as a guest of Ray Milland whom she has 'fooled' into thinking she is only an early teen. That doesn't sit well with Milland's fiancée Rita Johnson, a real ice princess who suspects something's up. And Johnson's sister Diana Lynn knows there is, but doesn't care. Milland is an instructor at a boy's military school and the sight of his female guest sends the cadets into hormonal overdrive. Milland's feeling a bit antsy around Rogers though he can't quite figure out why.Wilder showed that even in his first film he was a master at slipping stuff by the censors. In a recent biography of Billy Wilder that was more important on this film than most because the subject matter was weaving dangerously close to pedophilia. Paramount was disposed to let Wilder have this project especially after another of their writers a couple of years earlier showed he had the directing chops. But Preston Sturges was given a tryout in the studio's B picture unit with The Great McGinty. The Major And The Minor was an A film all the way because Wilder was able to sell Ginger Rogers on the story. He also brought the film only slightly over budget which definitely insured he would have a directorial career at Paramount.Robert Benchley is also in the film as a lecherous old goat who is the one who finally sends Rogers packing to Iowa after putting the moves on her while she is trying the profession of masseuse. Wouldn't you know it, he turns out to be the father of a chip off the old block in the person of Cadet Frankie Thomas. Benchley's scenes in the film are precious indeed.The Major And The Minor still holds up very well after over 60 years, no doubt because of the risqué subject matter. It's a film definitely guaranteed to make you a fan of the talents of its director and its stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'll try and be a better lightbulb, Uncle Phillip."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder began his career in Hollywood as a screenwriter. However, dissatisfied with how directors were treating his screenplays, he yearned to have greater creative control over his films. Though he had co-directed a single film in the past, the ultra-obscure French drama 'Mauvaise graine (1934),' it wasn't until 1942 that he was given a genuine opportunity to display his directorial talent, and a penchant for audacious comedy. On the surface, 'The Major and the Minor (1942)' might easily be mistaken for a silly, fluffy screwball comedy ? and it works quite effectively when viewed as such ? but closer inspection reveals an abundance of mature, and even slightly scandalous, themes coming into play. Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland co-star in Wilder's improbable but highly entertaining satire of inherent human sexuality, loaded with unsubtle innuendo ("Why don't you get out of that wet coat and into a dry martini?") and difficult romantic situations. It must have taken a bold director, indeed, to present a grown man falling in love with (what he believes to be) a twelve-year-old girl; a contentious subject even today.Ginger Rogers plays Susan Applegate, a proud and independent woman living in the city. Wilder doesn't shy away from revealing the darker, even somewhat predatory, sexual nature of most men, and the camera shows countless male heads turning towards Susan as she passes through a hotel lobby, each pair of eyes eagerly passing over her attractive body. When a married scalp-massage client (Robert Benchley) mistakes their appointment for something more than a massage {the early stages of Wilder's preoccupation with marital infidelity}, Susan decides to return to her quaint, uncorrupted hometown, only to find that she lacks the money for an adult train ticket. In a burst of genius, she decides, in order to claim a half-fare ticket, to masquerade as a twelve-year-old, her appearance drastically altered by styling her hair into pigtails, wearing children's clothing and carrying a balloon. That any intelligent human being would actually be fooled by such a scheme is highly debatable, but if the viewer learns to suspend ample disbelief, then many laughs are due to follow.Ray Milland plays Major Philip Kirby, a handsome and respectable military man, who meets Susan {now using the childish moniker "Su-Su"} on the train, and takes to her almost immediately. After intense flooding brings their train to a halt, Kirby agrees to bring Susan back to his residence at a boy's military school, where she is immediately the sensation of the college. As a young girl, Susan's experiences with male sexual desire change little: the hordes of gawking and opportunistic men give rise to equally-rapacious hordes of gawking and opportunistic boys, and even Major Kirby himself, to his horror, finds himself becoming attracted to Su-Su, as her "mature charm" begins to exhibit itself. In a particular sequence, one that the censors no doubt would have watched warily, Kirby attempts to explain to Susan the "birds and the bees," likening her female attraction to a light bulb surrounded by moths, and, one eye clamped firmly shut, suddenly declares her to be a "knock-out!" Billy Wilder's first feature film is audacious, well-written, brilliantly-acted, and, most importantly of all, very funny; it deserves to be seen alongside the director's other various classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High-spirited nonsense...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers usually has sparkle and ladylike gumshun to spare. Still, in Billy Wilder's "The Major and the Minor", her dry, pithy wit and grounded charm are given a real workout. A woman in her twenties must disguise herself as a preteen in order to pay the child's fare for a train trip. After her secret is discovered by the train's officials, she takes refuge with passenger Ray Milland, who is (fatefully) near-sighted. Parts of the picture work a strident sort of magic, most certainly due to Wilder's adroit pacing, however the star performances do help. Milland is very loose here and, although she eventually begins to wear down one's nerves, Rogers is a straightforward presence on the screen (she connects with the audience in a direct, likable way, as if she were an old friend). Remade in 1955 as "You're Never Too Young". **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I've been to a masquerade, mother"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly delightful and rich comedy, with serious undertones. The first film directed by Billy Wilder, "The Major and the Minor" deals with assumed identity and role playing, as would many of his films, including "Some Like It Hot" and "Kiss Me, Stupid," and as his earlier screenplay for Mitchell Leisen's "Midnight" (1939) also did. The film is full of allusions to what it means to be an adult, among them, a reference to a tadpole that metamorphoses into a frog. On a larger scale, there is reference to the likelihood of a world war, and the kind of national responsibility that would be required in that event. It is of course inconceivable that anyone would ever mistake the adult Ginger Rogers for the 12-year-old that she pretends to be, and that is part of the fun (and there are some unsettling Lolita elements attendant to Ray Milland's attraction to her).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a word I like to use, but this movie is SUPER.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, the only reason I watched this movie was because Ginger Rogers is in it. Then, as I got further and further into the plot I discovered that-- SURPRISE! This is a really good movie. I know, it sounds cheesy, that's what I thought too, but after seeing The Major and the Minor I had a new favourite comedy classic. Susan Applegate is sick and tired of being "stared at, glanced over, passed by, slapped around, brushed off" and generally humiliated. She decides to leave New York and go back to Stevenson, Iowa. She gets to the train station, but since she came to The Big Apple they've cranked up the rates about five bucks, which was more back then than it is today. She notices a little girl boarding with half-fare and gets an idea. A bunch of nutty stuff goes on around the train, then she winds up at a military base. Everyone (except Lucy) thinks she's twelve years old, so she has to go on a bunch of dates. She's even pretty as 12 year old "Sue-Sue", so she has a full schedule in the blink of an eye, leaving no time to escape. After that point a lot of things go on, but sooner or later she gets home and lays on a hammock, looking wistfully at a porch light surrounded by moths for days on end. You'll understand once you watch it, so HURRY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with many that THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR is a marvelous light comedy with a few serious undertones, but I doubt that pedophilia has much to do with it. Co-author Charles Brackett's diaries (recently published) give not a hint that he and Billy Wilder had any such subtext in mind. Wilder climbed onto the Lolita bandwagon years after TMATM had been released, but so far as I know prior to Nabokov's notorious success he hadn't said a word about any such thing (Billy also said that Ray Milland had absolutely no sense of humor, which seems unlikely given Milland's success in EASY LIVING as well as here, not to mention his fine handling of the black humor in DIAL M FOR MURDER and in other films). So far as I know, the only hint of such a subtext occurs at the end of the 'light bulb' scene, and I'll try to give an alternate explanation of that in due course.It seems to me that the serious subjects underlining TMATM are the thought that people believe what they want to believe, and that there is a subconscious part of the mind that can realize things that don't quite break into consciousness. The first is a commonplace, the second an idea that goes back at least to Homer. The main example of the commonplace comes when the college committee lets the Major off the hook for having SuZu in his train compartment overnight. It seems clear to me that they immediately accept Ginger Rogers as a 12 year old child because they want to avoid scandal, they want to exonerate the popular Major, Pamela wants to believe that the whole incident was innocent, etc. The vicar even calls it "a wonderful solution" or words to that effect. What adult has really been fooled by her charade other than the Major with his poor eyesight and infinite gullibility, except when they'd wished to be fooled?Similarly, a lot of people accept consciously what they're told (that this is a 12 year old girl) while subconsciously noticing that something isn't right. Lucy tells SuZu that she isn't 12 because she acts like she's 6. Notice that Susan Applegate never acts like she's 6 again after realizing that she'd been overdoing it. The quips become very mature from that point on ("Are you sure you're not mulling over yesterday's lesson?"). There's no real reason to believe that the cadets were ever told SuZu's assumed age, and they sense that they've lucked into a lot more than a youthful companion! I'd say that that's what has begun to penetrate the Major's consciousness in the Light Bulb Scene, that this really is "a beautiful young lady" rather than a precocious child. Notice SuZu's struggles to keep a straight face while the Major is fumbling over the facts of life. A part of the Major has noticed, too (and we should all notice how subtly brilliant this performance by Ginger Rogers is).Be that as it may, I'd say that the ending of the movie would play better if we assume that the Major realizes the truth before coming to Iowa, having been told by Lucy (after Pamela's marriage to someone else, why would Lucy keep up the pretense?). Then his immediate acceptance of the adult Susan at the end makes sense. However, Milland really doesn't play it that way. Oh well.I'll close by emphasizing that the movie is very funny, Ginger Rogers is superb in it (her use of various voices is terrific) and Milland is excellent, as are all the supporting actors. The switchboard scene is as good as they get. Wilder was off to an excellent start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers was lucky in that she wasn't pigeonholed into being a specific type of character and that she can play a variety of characters in different roles. She demonstrated a real knack for comedy here, in Billy Wilder's first job of direction. Ginger Rogers can't afford an adult train fare to Iowa, so she disguises herself as a pre-teen, and from there the film progresses into one long funny con-game.I loved watching Ginger assemble her little girl outfit in the bathroom of the train station. Granted, even without makeup and with her hair in pigtails, Rogers does not look 12. However, that is also part of the comedy of the film. Co-star Ray Milland's character has poor eyesight in one eye and as a result, he cannot tell that she simply looks too old to be 12. I thought Rogers looked very pretty with just minimal makeup and with the darker hair.Milland's character's fiancee's sister, Lucy, was hilarious and she was the one person who called Rogers out on her farce right away. Lucy is the real brains in the film and she actually says what the audience is thinking: "She doesn't look 12!" I loved how she blackmailed Rogers into helping out Milland whom Lucy seems to genuinely care about. She does not like her sister. And good for Rogers for being a 20-something ( actually a 30-something) who could still fit into a teenager's clothes! The squeaky voiced cadets at the school were funny with them all having the same pickup line about Sudan. I especially liked the cadet who thought he was more sophisticated because he was from New York. The actor played Nancy Drew's boyfriend Ted Nickerson (Ned Nickerson in the books) in the "Nancy Drew" films with Bonita Granville.Robert Benchley was great as Rogers' old customer who by sheer coincidence is the father of the New York cadet. He always did the befuddled sophisticate very well and with great dry humor.There were many things in this film that I recognized from I Love Lucy. 1) Rogers' hair treatment on Benchley with the oil, eggs and painful massage is similar to Lucy's scalp treatment on Ricky when he thinks he's losing is hair. 2) The cadets sing "Sweet Sue" on the way to picking up Rogers. That song was the song that the Ricardos and Mertzes sing in the "Breaking the Lease" episode. 3) Benchley's character's wife played Mrs. Benson in the episode where Lucy and Ricky moved into the 2-bedroom apartment.What was so interesting was the whole angle of an adult pretending to be a child who is falling in love with an adult who thinks she's a child. I thought it was strange when Milland complimented "12 year old" Rogers on her legs saying that they were a "nice shape" (or something like that). That seems like a strange comment to make toward a child. It's not something you'd see today in film.I liked that Milland's character kept meeting Rogers at all these different ages: 12, 20s, presumably 40s-50s and didn't really seem to question it, only that it was remarkable how all these ladies look so much alike.I saw this on the Universal DVD (although it's actually a Paramount film) the other night, and Robert Osborne's introduction is great, but it is a bit sad seeing him looking so hearty and strong in this eight year old DVD release versus the downturn his health has taken recently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being entirely unfamiliar with Billy Wilder's work (indeed, I haven't seen any of his classics), this is his first film that I watched since I started reading Cahiers Du Cinema's excellent Masters Of Cinema introduction to Billy Wilder. The film's plot is deceptively simple. What appears to be a light hearted comedy is in fact a very effective way to evoke moments of uneasiness about norms and cultural conditions of age (difference) that still resonates with today's audience. Some of the humor is rather vulgar (although this makes sense in the context of Wilder's upbringing and oeuvre as I have read), but the film still provides a few laugh out loud moments.Cinematographically this film might verge a little on the plain, but it does have a few beautifully glamorous shots of Ginger Rogers. Rogers is an absolute charm here and her chemistry with Ray Milland is wonderful. I also thought Rita Johnson as the antagonist managed to bring great screen presence to her rather shallow role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Major and the Minor is the kind of movie that holds up very, very well ? and yet could never be made today. Know why? Because it's about a grown woman who pretends to be 12 years old (!) in order to pay only half fare to get home from NYC to Ohio and falls for a grown man along the way. That may sound innocent enough, but of course the grown man finds himself falling for the grown woman whom he believes is 12 years old. In hindsight, that's a little creepy.But here, it's not. This movie is hilarious. This was Billy Wilder's first movie as a director, and the faith placed in him by the studio ? and the movie's stars, Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland ? paid off handsomely. It's hard to believe now, but Wilder had already earned three Oscar nominations for writing before directing a single film. He wound up with a pretty decent career.Rogers plays Sue Applegate, a young lady trying to make a living in New York. Frustrated after a year in the big city, she decides to head back home; trouble is, the train fare has gone up by about $5, and our gal Sue doesn't have enough. So she gets this funny idea ? she'll dress like a kid, complete with pigtails and a balloon, and pay only half fare. Sue's plans hit a major snag when she's found out by the conductor, and she hides in the compartment of one Major Kirby (Milland). Hilarity ensues when Kirby's fiancé finds Sue ? known as Su-Su ? with her betrothed, but soon all of that is cleared up and "Su-Su" must spend a few days with her friend the Major.Shenanigans ensue, as you might expect. The movie is witty and delightful, with some zingers zooming almost faster than one can process them. Rogers and Milland are at the top of their comedic game, too. Among the talented supporting cast are Robert Benchley ("My only regret is that I have but one wife to give for my country"), Diana Lynn as the fiancé's sister, and Rogers' own mother Lela, playing, yes, her mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good comedy movie by Wilder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot during the second World War, "The Major and the Minor" is one of the first film of Billy Wilder. I have seen four movies of this director and they were excellent, mostly "Some like it hot" with Marilyn Monroe.This movie relate the story of Susan Applegate, tired of working in New York, decide to go back to hometown in Iowa. Despite the fact as she doesn't have enough money for buy his train ticket at full price, she decides to dress like a twelve years old girl for buy a train ticket at half price. Once in the train, she will meet an officer of army who will attach to her.We have a good time when watching this because it's a bit hard to imagine a thirty years old woman dress like a twelve years old girl... and who succeed! I think Billy Wilder is good to find good actors to his films, as to how they play as their physical. It's the case in this film because the principal actress is beautiful. Some scenes are a bit boring and break the rhythm of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A minor film proves to be Wilder's major breakthrough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thirty-something Ginger Rogers has the impossible task of fooling all other characters in this film into believing she is a twelve-year-old kid. She gives a good performance and carries the film effortlessly, but you'd have to be blind to believe she was a pre-pubescent child. Some may get a kick out of seeing a grown woman wearing knee-high socks while carrying a balloon, but in this day and age they'll probably find more graphic ways of feeding their fetish.The script gets her into kids clothes by raising the cost of her train fare back home so that she can't afford the cost. Ginger hits on the idea of passing herself off as a kid so that she can travel half-price, but army Major Ray Milland takes her under his wing when she sneaks into his compartment to hide from suspicious conductors. The film starts pretty brightly with some amusing gags, but unaccountably loses its way once Ray and Ginger disembark from the train and the action is transferred to the military college at which he's stationed.This must have been pretty risky subject matter back in 1942, a fact borne out by the way that Milland's incipient attraction to 12-year-old Ginger is explained away by his 'bum eye.' At the end of the film he doesn't seem even remotely surprised to discover that the person he'd though was a gawky little girl is in truth a lush, full-bodied woman. Couldn't believe his luck, probably?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ginger's new clothes make for a wonderful comedy romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who can't see the humor in this film, it might help to recall the Hans Christian Andersen tale, "The Emperor's New Clothes." Of course the 31-year-old Ginger Rogers, playing an early 20s Susan Applegate, couldn't pass herself off as a 12-year-old ? even a taller, more mature looking 12-year-old. That is part of the hilarity of "The Major and the Minor." The obvious charade to viewers was shared by most of the characters in the film who first met Su-Su. When Susan scrubs the makeup off her face, and changes her hair, clothes, walking and talking, she does appear younger. But certainly not 12. And who really believed she was 12? Or, more to the point, if anyone didn't believe her, what would or could they do about it? The train conductors didn't believe she was 12. But were they going to search her for her real ID? Were they going to toss her off the train? It's a little different take on "The Emperor's New Clothes," but one can see the pickle people were in who refused to believe Su-Su (the young Ginger/Susan) when she said she was 12. So, the conclusion of most was suspension of their disbelief and just acceptance that she was an older 12-year-old than any other they had known. And, with that quandary understood, viewers can go on and enjoy this movie. And what a wonderful comedy it is. I agree with the several reviewers who saw the great chemistry between Rogers and Ray Milland, as Major Kirby. I think they and the entire cast and crew of this film were having loads of fun making this movie. I can imagine cast members not being able to keep a straight face for some of the scenes. Or the crew cracking up with laughter at some scenes. Every thing about this film is excellent. The cast are all very good. The directing, editing, scoring, writing, camera work and all technical aspects are spot-on. But the winning combo of Rogers and Milland is what ultimately makes "The Major and Minor" a huge success. The performances of the two leads are outstanding. Their expressions, glances, and mannerisms are right on target funny for the various scenes. This is one hugely entertaining and funny movie. It was made when the U.S. was less than a year into WW II. Its time was before the war, as Maj. Kirby talks about war being imminent. It was great entertainment for people on the home front then, and it's every bit as funny and enjoyable today. It's a wonderful movie for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable early Billy Wilder comedy, big on laughs if short on realism. To enjoy this film, the viewer really has to suspend disbelief and see the film through the same (convenient plot device) "gammy" eye with which Ray Milland's Major Kirby character obviously can't tell a 12 year-old girl from a full-grown thirty year old woman.Ginger Rogers has a lot of fun playing the capricious pre-teen girl who causes havoc with the hearts of a group of 300 young army cadets, starved of female company, who can't believe their luck when the vivacious and pretty Su-Su (Susan Applegate) comes into their midst. This comes after a chance meeting with Milland on a train journey back home away from the lecherous middle-aged denizens of the hairdressing company she works for in the big city and after her cover has been blown by the suspicious ticket attendants on board.Eyes do pop at various points in the film however as this fully-fledged woman hots up the blood of pretty much all the young men around her and one can imagine the censor casting a weather eye over proceedings. One youngster cops a full lip-smacking kiss off Su-Su, (thinks - would the censor have allowed the converse - an older man kissing a much younger girl?) while another is happily prepared to forget his fiancée for a romp with her, but the biggest somersault in veracity happens with Milland's character who only in the final reel manifests his inexplicable growing attraction to the young girl, when she conveniently steps out as at last an adult and immediately wins his heart.Putting this slight Lolita-ish unease to one side (not so easy of course in these more cynical modern times), the playing is excellent by all and they're given ample opportunity by Wilder &amp; Bracken's script. I liked the clever inversion in Rogers' character when she has to play her own mother near the end to prolong the illusion and her scenes with "14 going on 34", Lucy, younger sister of her erstwhile rival for Milland's attention, waspishly played by Diana Lynn, are amongst the highlights. Milland is fine in a sub-Jimmy Stewart part (although Stewart would never touch subject-matter like this).The great Billy Wilder effortlessly takes us from one improbable situation to the next and there's a fair smattering of funny one-liners and comedic situations. Best gag for me though was the topical sight-gag at the cadets' ball with the parade of Veronica Lake-obsessed young girls only further accentuating the different-ness of Rogers' Susan, although Rogers' response to a request to speak Swedish with Garbo's "I vant to be alone" (whose "Ninotchka", Wilder of course co-wrote) is also a gem. There's even an up to the minute war reference uttered by Rogers which probably wouldn't have gone unnoticed at the time by the viewing public.So as I say, probably best to swallow an innocence pill before viewing, but this vintage comedy will amuse and delight viewers of all ages.</fullReview>

Wilder's directorial debut gives some indication of the fabulous films to come, but fails to be particularly memorable. The screenplay by Wilder and frequent collaborator Brackett is amusing enough but does not rise to the level of "Sabrina," "Some Like it Hot," and "The Apartment." Rogers seems to be having fun, although it is hard to swallow that people would believe she, 31 at the time, is 12. Milland is smooth as the caring major, while humorist Benchley is well-cast as a lecherous old man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder often rode roughshod over public perceptions of "good taste" and in this film he started as he intended to carry on.It may not be the movie that immediately springs to mind when you mention his name or indeed that of Ginger Rogers,but they combine perfectly here. It is,as many have commented,sheer nonsense in terms of the plot,but so disarmingly played that you are happy just to sit and watch the cast having fun. Miss Rogers passes herself off as a young girl on a railway train,cons Mr Taylor,an Army officer, into helping her then has to re-invent her real self when she finds she is falling in love with him.A deliciously slight and silly fable that Mr Wilder's cynical eye does wonders with. Miss Rogers is enchanting as the young "Su - Su" if not particularly convincing as a schoolgirl who melts Mr Taylor's heart. She accompanies him to West Point with all the predictable high-jinks that Mr Wilder's wry approach gives a fresh spin to. Mildly naughty for the time,"The Major and the minor" is still funny,smart and clever nearly 70 years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improbable but amusing comedy gets a lift from Rogers, Milland and Lynn...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A saucy comedy about a woman not having enough money to leave New York City to return to the mid-west by train, is made even more enjoyable because the leads are played by GINGER ROGERS, RAY MILLAND and DIANA LYNN, all of whom have the benefit of a very good script written by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder and directed by Wilder.Rogers, of course, in real life would hardly be able to pass herself off as a twelve year-old unless someone had extra bad eyesight, but we have to accept that premise in order to enjoy the story. She tries hard, but the expert photography reveals her to be much older (and shapelier) than any mere twelve year-old child. However, it does give her the opportunity to enact a comic impersonation of a bratty and willful girl who finds herself being chased by all the young wolves at the military academy run by Major Kirby (RAY MILLAND).DIANA LYNN is the only sensible one in the cast, aware from the start that Ginger is impersonating Su-Su Applegate and handing her the riot act unless she agrees to cooperate with Diana's scheme to dissuade sister RITA JOHNSON from entrapping Milland in marriage. Ginger is only too glad to cooperate and the scenes between the sassy teen-aged Lynn and the adult Rogers are among the funniest.Milland shows a distinct flair for romantic comedy--particularly in the scene where he's asked by Su-Su whether he finds her pretty. Looking at her with one eye shut, he exclaims: "Su-Su, you're a knockout!" And it's precisely this edge to the humor that makes the story a bit uncomfortable in spots, with Milland seeming to leer at her with a Lolita complex.ROBERT BENCHLEY figures prominently in the opening scene set in Manhattan where he summons Rogers for a scalp treatment with an ulterior purpose in mind. "Why don't you slip into a dry martini?" was one of his better quips before Rogers gives him "the treatment".Funny, witty and not completely believable--but nevertheless a pleasure to watch because the performances are so enjoyable.</fullReview>

Ginger Rogers is spot-on as Susan (Su-Su) Applegate, and Ray Milland plays a winning, if naive, Army Major. The chemistry between the two is almost unsettlingly electric from their first encounter aboard their westward train. Interestingly, several years later, Wilder was asked about, and confirmed the film's edgy "Lolita" overtones. In several ways, it was a dance around and about the Hollywood censors. Rogers' character falls hard for Milland's, and much intrigue ensues as a result. Noteworthy: humorist Robert Benchley, founder of the "Algonquin Round Table" and staff writer at the "New Yorker," is a standout; and check out Ginger Rogers sneaking in some amazing tap dancing along the way. I found it a very sweet and well-conceived (if largely unbelievable) film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Susu You're a Knockout!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Major and the Minor is the film that me fall in love with Ginger Rogers, turning me into the obsessive fan I am now. Miss Rogers is Susan "Susu" Applegate, who transforms her 30 year old body into that of a 12 year old, and does so completely convincingly, and in my view, the finest performance of her career. I question how many actresses would have the ability to do such a feat. Of course being a super fan I would say that she should have won an Oscar for this acting marvel, but I doubt the Academy would pay much attention to a weird little irrational comedy like this. Oh yes, weird, that is our key word here. If the premise of a 30 year old disguise as a 12 year old in order to get half fare on a train ticket doesn't have you raising an eyebrow, then how about throwing her into a military academy with 300 male pre teen cadets. The whole family can enjoy The Major and the Minor, the kids can enjoy the smart alecky humor, and the adults can enjoy the sexual innuendo....centered around children. That's one of the things that makes this movie great, it's so wrong on many levels (yet feels so right, or something like that), but contains that kind of innocence and naivety that only classic Hollywood can pull off. The British Board of Film Classification gives the film a current rating of "U", with the description, "contains very mild sex references", although I believe that's a gross understatement. Imagine if Lolita was a screwball comedy, you would have a result somewhere along the lines of The Major and the Minor.Ray Milland is an excellent leading man, well a leading man to a character whom he thinks is a child, (yes this movie becomes more wrong the further I analyse it). I wonder how must have felt delivering such lines as "You like boys Susu?, 300 of them, all they're all yours". The ending of The Major and the Minor itself is disturbing on a number of levels. When Major Kirby discovers Susu is actually an adult and they presumably now fall in love as seen in the final scene, is he going to fantasize that he's going out with the 12 year old Susu? My other favourite cast member here is Diana Lynn as an intellectual child planning to become a scientist. This kid is so bad ass, I'm actually quote jealous of her. Normally kids in movies tend to get on my nerves, but not when they're able to outwit the adults, as seen here.Of course this is Billy Wilder's American directorial debut, and already he has made the first in a long line of masterpieces. Exploring his films (including those he has written) I feel has been a journey for me through the annals of classic Hollywood and for helping to shape my sense of humour. The Major and the Minor marks another milestone in that journey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Susan Applegate (Ginger Rogers of "Top Hat") has had enough of New York. She tried a little of everything, even massaging scalps. An older man, Mr. Osburne (Robert Benchley) tried to get her to have a drink with him so she cracked an egg on his noggin and left in a hurry. Unfortunately, luck eluded her in the Big Apple. Finally, she decides to return to her hometown of Stevenson, Iowa. She has been saving ticket fare for the trip. Indeed, she has kept $27.5o, and she aims to use it for her fare back. Imagine Susan's surprise when the railway clerk informs her that the fare has gone up. Now, she has to fork over $32.50, but she doesn't have it. Stepping aside to let a mother with her daughter and son purchase tickets, Susan feels beaten down by this setback. She gets an idea when the mother buys tickets for her children. As it turns out, children ride for half-price. Susan changes her apparel and hair to more closely resemble a child. She enlists the aid of a shifty, but respectable looking gentleman. He is checking the phone coin returns for spare change. She persuades him to buy her a ticket. Shrewdly, the panhandler keeps the change and puts Susan aboard her train. Although she has gotten aboard the train posing as a child, the suspicious conductors are not entirely taken in by Susan's subterfuge as a twelve-year old. They make her stand up for inspection. Miraculously, she makes a narrow escape, but she is living on borrowed time. Eventually, they catch Susan on the rear observation platform smoking a cigarette. Susan manages to tuck the cigarette into her mouth before they can catch her. They interrogate our heroine, but she says nothing until she cannot withstand the smoke backed up in her mouth. She blows smoke, conceals the butt in a napkin, slings the napkin aside and scrambles out of their reach. They pursue her through the train and she gives the two conductors the slip when she enters a sleeping berth. Little does she know she has entered the cabin of Major Kirby (Ray Milland of "The Lost Weekend") and he allows her to remain in his compartment. Of course, Kirby doesn't realize that Susan is masquerading as an adolescent. He falls hook, line, and sinker for her act, and later all the cadets at the Wallace Military Institute where he returning are captivated by Susan. Initially, however, Kirby's fiancée believes that he entertained a woman in his compartment. Naturally, everybody is considerably relieved when they learn Susan is only twelve.Major Kirby, it seems, has been trying to get into the armed forces before war breaks out, but his fiancée, Pamela Hill (Rita Johnson of "Broadway Serenade") wants to keep him safe at home for herself. Pamela invites Susan?she is called Su-Su by everybody?to share a room with younger sister, Lucy Hill (Diana Lynn of "The Kentuckian"), who hates her older sister. No sooner have Lucy and Susan met than Lucy sees through Susan's disguise. Such is her animosity toward her sister that she refuses to divulge Susan's secret and they become closely-knit gals. Kirby presents the cadets to Su-Su and they flock to her. These uniformed brats are beside themselves with her. Each has the same line when it comes to necking and kissing her. They explain the strategy the Nazis used when they refused to attack the Maginot Line with their infamous blitzkrieg and brought about the collapse of France. Before long Susan is realizes that she has gotten herself into something bigger than she imagined. She also comes to detest Pamela and does everything she can to help Kirby get into the war. One amusing scene occurs at the institute's telephone switchboard. Finally, Pamela catches on and threatens to expose Susan if she doesn't leave the school. Susan caves in and lets Pamela win. She returns home to Stevenson to live with her mother. In this case, Ginger Rogers' real-life mother Lela Rogers plays her mom. When she least expects it, Major Kirby calls her up and reveals that he is passing through Stevenson on his way to the West Coast. He wants to come out and visit Su-Su. When he arrives as Mrs. Applegate's home, Kirby is sad that he doesn't get to see Su-Su. Susan learns that Kirby didn't marry Pamela. Pamela married a cadet who is the son of a wealthy man. Kirby leaves without realizing the stunt that Susan has played on him. While he is waiting for the train to arrive at the depot, Kirby spots a hot dish at the other end of the platform. Of course, it turns out to be Susan. We fade out to happily ever after as the couple are heading for Nevada to get married.Writer &amp; director Billy Wilder of "Some Like It Hot" made his Hollywood debut as a helmer on this polished comedy. Charles Brackett co-wrote the screenplay, and Wilder and Brackett shared screen credit as the scribes on a number of Hollywood classics, such as "Ninotchka," "Ball of Fire," "Five Graves to Cairo," "The Lost Weekend," and "Sunset Boulevard." The dialogue is swift and snappy and often conceals multiple meanings. The idea that a fully grown woman would deceive people into believing she is twelve years old must have seem rather risqué back in those days when the Hollywood censorship office, the Production Code Administration, was charged with protecting the morals of middle-age America from profligate filmmakers. Today, "The Major and the Minor" seems hopelessly innocent. Wilder makes certain that the action advances at a breezy pace with both Ray Milland and Ginger Rogers generating a little charisma along the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is about a woman who wants to go home, but did not have enough money for full fare on the train. She dresses as a 12 year old to pay the child's fare. On the train she gets mixed up with Army Major who teaches at a boys' academy. The movie is dated for the time it was made. There is one joke in the film about Veronica Lake. Some people might not know who she is now. At the time when this movie was made, she was a big part of old Hollywood. The plot is silly but delivers on comedic merit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young woman (Ginger Rogers) passes herself off as an eleven year old in order to get a half fare train ticket home to Iowa. On the train ride she meets a major (Ray Milland) of a small midwest military academy and by circumstance stays at the academy for a few days, still posing as a child. The cadets sense this is no ordinary adolescent and wait in line to court her, though her real target is the major. At the house she rooms with the younger sister (Diane Lynn) of the major's fiancé, who is immediately suspicious. In fact both of them (the fiancé and her younger sister) are suspicious. With eager cadets chasing after her and the fiancé on to her ruse, the only person left in the dark is Milland, whose vision problem is the only thing standing in his way from active military service, which he is desperate to get. Granted, the overall premise is just slightly shaky but the execution is perfect, with jokes flying around constantly, the film weaves a seductive little story with Rogers and Milland at their best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's hear it for the NFT. At LAST they're mounting a season of well-made, sophisticated, accessible films that appeal to a WIDE audience and not the usual half dozen academics augmented by the best of Rent-A-Pseud. During November and December it will be possible to view every film that Billy Wilder directed but not, bizarrely, those he only wrote - like Ninotchka, Midnight, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife, Arise, My Love, Ball Of Fire, Hold Back The Dawn for openers. Lest I seem a tad critical of the NFT I must hasten to add that they HAVE screened a Wilder retrospectively previously, something like THIRTY years ago, in the interim members have been able to slake their unquenchable thirst for Inuit Subculture, New Voices from New Guinea, The Best Lottery Money Disasters and/or anything else the selection committee feel will alienate the most fans of REAL cinema. Be that as it may we do have a chance to wallow, albeit briefly, in some of the Best cinema extant beginning with this, the first movie that Wilder directed at what had become his home studio, Paramount. Even today it holds up remarkably well and the screening I attended was punctuated with appreciative laughter throughout so in 1942 it's reasonable to assume that it was spellbinding. Ray Milland had starred in Arise, My Love, written by Wilder and would appear to great advantage in The Lost Weekend in which he had considerably more to do than display a respectable profile and a modicum of charm. In retrospect it's easy to credit Wilder with making Lolita while Nabakov was little more than a child himself but such is the skill and professionalism involved that paedophilic subtexts would barely have risen their uncomfortable heads in 1942. All hands acquit themselves superbly not least Diana Lynn as a real precocious teenager who sees through Rogers in nothing flat. Roll on the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The set-up is a comic spin on the romantic longings of older men pining for little girls; and for young boys longing for older women. It's amazing that some of this made it past the censors.The scene where Miss Rogers' character is passionately kissed by an underage boy; and the earlier scene where Mr. Milland's character comforts her in bed on the train and how he begins to admit he is developing feelings for what he believes to be an 11 year old girl, is depraved. The film subverts wholesome values with a story that is heavy on the Freud mumbo jumbo and too clever and too ridiculous for its own good.Again how did some of this material make it past the censors? Is it because the elements are presented in the guise of a comedy, and that comedies are not supposed to be taken seriously?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers pretends to be twelve-year-old Susu in order to save on train fair during the war. She's bunked in a compartment with Major Kirby, Ray Milland, who doesn't see through her disguise. He grows fond of her nonetheless and they stop off at a military academy for teen-aged boys where Milland is stationed for the moment. All the horny boys, thinking Rogers is their age, put moves on her. But she is finally undone when she runs into Robert Benchley, who remembers her from a hair salon or something. She escapes, her adult identity intact, and goes to her rural home. Still believing that Susu is only twelve, Milland visits her home and talks to Rogers, now disguised as her own mother. When she discovers that Milland hasn't gone through with a marriage he'd planned, she reveals herself, he twigs to everything, they clinch at the railroad station, cue the swelling romantic waltz, fade out.In its own bland way it's kind of funny -- dated, to be sure, but it has its amusing moments. (A cadet who has deserted his post for a date bops his way backwards into a room, only to find it filled with outraged superiors.) All those squeaky-voiced cadets illustrating the Blitzkrieg by insinuating their arms around Rogers. The teen-aged Diana Lynn who immediately sees through Rogers but becomes buddies with her and clams up.But it's mostly pretty tepid stuff by today's standards. There are smile-inducing awkward situations but not many tag lines or outrageous gags. Not many gags at all. Fred Astaire, it's been said, gave Ginger Rogers class and she gave him sex. It's true enough. But by the time this film appeared Rogers could no longer pass for twelve years old. She looked thirtyish, which she was. That's not a criticism of Rogers herself or of her performance. Nobody looks young forever except me.But think of how much more involving the movie would have been if there HAD been some succulent Hollywood dish who looked fundamentally mature but was actress enough to pull off the role of a young teen and who could LOOK it too. Only Ellen Page comes to mind but there must be others.And I suppose one couldn't expect too much in the way of outrageous humor, which would seem built into the script itself. The movie code and the contemporary audience might applaud multiple deaths and a panorama of pain on the screen but let us never see a grown man glance at a twelve-year-old knee.Billy Wilder, who co-wrote it with Charles Brackett, was given the directorial duties. He'd do much better with a latent status movie -- based on sex rather than age -- a little less than twenty years later with the superb "Some Like It Hot."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film with brain-dead casting that manages to kill what's good about the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, the audience is supposed to accept that Ginger Rogers, aged 31 at the time, is posing at an adolescent! This is patently ridiculous and if anyone could possibly pull this off, Miss Rogers was NOT the one! Had the film starred a very young-looking and less developed lady (such as Leslie Caron or Audrey Hepburn circa 1952), perhaps it wouldn't have seemed so ridiculous, but here it just makes the common-sense part of me want to scream. I just hate films with bad premises and bad casting--and I am not sure ANY actress could make this premise work. Oddly, this dopey plot was repeated a decade later when Jerry Lewis took on this same role--and he was 29 at the time! While Billy Wilder is a now huge name in directing, at the time he had no reputation in Hollywood so he was stuck with this utterly stupid casting decision. Had he been given this assignment later in his illustrious assume he would have likely refused such a ridiculous premise!The silly plot occurs because Ginger is trying to buy a train ticket but the rate has recently changed. However, the child fare is half-price and so she decides to pose as a kid!! On board, the conductors naturally assume she's an adult but oddly, Ray Milland is an apparent idiot and has no idea she's NOT a child!!!! So, since he's a gullible idiot, Ginger hangs out in his private room during the entire trip. However, when Milland's fiancée sees Ginger in his room later, she naturally assumes that this 31 year-old woman is a 31 year-old woman!! But, to convince his fiancée and future father-in-law that she is only a child and nothing inappropriate occurred, he brings Ginger with him to meet them at the military school. And, oddly, when they meet Ginger, they immediately assume that she is 12!!! This is dumb AND creepy--after all, it's better that she's a 31 year-old than a pre-pubescent female riding with a strange man!!! Now whether or not this is a watchable film just depends on how a able you will be to accept the premise. If you can somehow manage to not only believe the plot but also ignore all the creepy implications, the film is a lot of fun...and even romantic (especially at the end). I guess I just couldn't do this and the movie, despite its pluses, just didn't work for me. I couldn't get past Ginger's casting, her ridiculous impersonation of a child (calling it 'broad' or a 'burlesque' is way too charitable) and that Milland's character might just be a pedophile--a very problematic plot to say the least!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fundamentally Weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Major and the Minor" was the first American film directed by Billy Wilder, although contrary to what is sometimes stated it was not his directorial debut. (That was the French film "Mauvaise Graine" from eight years earlier). A young woman named Susan Applegate, travelling by train from New York City to her home in Iowa, discovers she has only enough money to cover a child's fare, so disguises herself as an eleven-year-old girl- "twelve next week"- and renaming herself Su-Su. On board the train she meets Major Philip Kirby, an instructor at a military academy, and when the train is delayed by flooding on the tracks Major Kirby invites Susan, whom he believes to be a young child, to stay at the school until her parents can fetch her.The film was made in 1942, shortly after America's entry into the war, but the action takes place the previous year, shortly before it, and there is a definite patriotic subtext. Philip believes that war is coming, and is anxious to be posted overseas where he will have a greater opportunity of serving his country in an active role. His scheming fiancée Pamela, however, is determined to keep him at the academy, well away from the front line. Philip, however, has an ally in Pamela's younger sister Lucy, who dislikes her sister and is determined to thwart her machinations, and who recruits Susan as an ally in her cause.Although the film was ignored at the award ceremonies- it was the only one of Wilder's Hollywood films not to be nominated for a single Oscar or Golden Globe until "Kiss Me, Stupid" in 1964- it was well-received by the critics at the time. Variety, for example, called it a "sparkling and effervescing piece of farce-comedy", and, to judge from the reviews on this board, it would still seem to have its admirers today. What struck me about it, however, was how odd it looks from a twenty-first century perspective. Part of the problem is that the idea of Ginger Rogers successfully disguising herself as a child is an implausible one. The only person who sees through Susan's disguise is Lucy, played by Diana Lynn as that stock comic figure, the obnoxiously knowing child with a middle-aged and formidably intellectual head on young shoulders. Everyone else is completely taken in. This was an idea which really needed an actress considerably younger than the 31-year-old Rogers. Veronica Lake, famously petite and only 19 at the time, could perhaps have pulled it off, but the studio doubtless wanted a more established star.Even weirder is the idea of a man falling in love with an eleven-year-old girl, or at least with a girl whom he believes to be eleven years old, but that is precisely what Philip does. As soon as he realises that Susan is an adult he proposes marriage to her, his engagement to Pamela having been broken off by this stage. Philip is not the only one to succumb to Su-Su's charms, as several of the cadets at the academy, boys in their early teens, also take a shine to her. There is a running joke about the boys using an explanation of German tactics during the invasion of France as a pretext for putting their arms around her. One wonders how Wilder managed to get this sort of thing past the Hays Office at a time when thirteen-year-old boys were generally portrayed in the cinema as mischievous children rather than budding Lotharios.The film has some good qualities. The role of Philip Kirby was originally written with Cary Grant, that master of screwball comedy, in mind, and there are some witty lines which one could just imagine Grant enunciating. Possibly the best-known is "Why don't you get out of that wet coat and into a dry martini?" Ray Milland, who would later collaborate with Wilder on "The Long Weekend", is perfectly good in the role, although I thought Grant might have been better. There are also some amusing scenes such as the one where Susan imitates Pamela in a telephone call in order to get Philip transferred to the post he wants. (Ginger Rogers obviously had some talent as a mimic). The fundamental weirdness of the film's central concept, however, means that today it is difficult to take it altogether seriously or to find it altogether likable. Although there is a feeling in some quarters that Wilder could do no wrong, "The Major and the Minor" does not compare with his really great films such as "Double Indemnity", "Sunset Boulevard", "Sabrina" or "Some Like It Hot". 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Major and the Minor isn't horrible, but it's certainly not in the same league with Wilder's comedy masterpieces. To find this kind of stuff funny, one has to suspend one's disbelief quite a lot. I personally thought that the premise of a visibly grown up woman disguising herself as an eleven-year-old girl was a bit too silly.Based on a single joke, the whole thing feels drawn out even at 95 or so minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had such a great time watching the first 90 minutes of this 100 minute movie. The acting was as perfect as its premise, but that ending was so rushed. With Philip not angry with Susan for deceiving him is very unrealistic. It would had made more sense if he found out about her age at the party by his fiancée telling him. Also, they shouldn't had gotten married, he barely knows her and she did deceive him. It would had been best if it was implied that eventually they would get married, but I guess I just watched this film through 21st century eyes. Lastly, It would had made sense making Lucy Philip's sister instead his fiancée's so after he and Susan gets married, they would be sister's in-laws. All in all, I rate this movie a 7 out of 10, because the movie was flawless until the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncomfortable viewing in this day and age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to watch this movie primarily because Billy Wilder directed it and co-wrote the script, since I'm not a fan of either Ginger Rogers or Ray Milland, and the premise of the movie requires a major suspension of disbelief: A woman disguises herself as a kid and fools just about everyone into thinking she's a big 12-year-old - "I come from Swedish stock!" The movie was mostly as charming as I expected it to be, coming from the legendary Mr. Wilder, and Ms. Rogers does a good job in an awkward role, alternating between sassy, cloyingly sweet, and love-besotted. Actually, I think Ray Milland had the more awkward (and thankless) role, considering how he had to convey that he was wondering why he was falling for a 12-year-old.Which brings me to the pedophiliac undertones of the movie. How would that not run across one's mind, when it's not just Ray Milland falling for her but amorous (and grope-y) young boys of about 15 as well? And the ending, geez. Let's just say it doesn't improve Milland's character any.I imagine this movie would've been easier to accept back in 1942, when people were more innocent about sexual perversions, especially since it's an entertaining watch (that just drags a bit in extended scenes with the boys), but in this day and age, the subject of pedophilia - even if it's not overt - makes for an uncomfortable comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor Wilder comedy with major themes (possible spoiler in last two paragraphs)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be nice to be able to say that 'The Major and the Minor' is one of those great debut films of the early 1940s, of the same vintage as 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Maltese Falcon'. The truth is, despite being thoroughly amiable, frequently risque, and always clever, Wilder's first film is simply not funny enough. Perhaps the fault lies in the casting - is Ginger Rogers to wisecrackingly knowing to fully exploit such a perverse role? Is the film's perversity too lightly handled? i think the problem is the recurring Wilder problem, that of too many words. One is left breathless, but a little oppressed, at the continuous barrage of gags, wisecracks, puns, sarcasms that fitfully hit their target. It is significant that the film's funniest sequence, when the cadet Susan has hoodwinked returns to his abandoned post lost in music, in the presence of his superiors, is a purely visual one, depending on resources other than the word: expectation, incongruity, physical humour. It is more eloquent of all Wilder's themes - the limits on humanity under authoritarian systems; the generation and gender gap; the transformative power or otherwise of art - than a hundred perfectly honed jokes.Still, the film is notable in that it serves as a fully formed statement of intent. Or rather; there have always been two impulses in Wilder - the ironic, yet enchanting, adult fairy tale, and the corrosively bitter melodrama, which, in its most hysterical form tended towards a Gothic melodrama not too far from the first. 'Major' is pure fairy tale - Susan is transformed (there is an elaborate scene of metamorphosis, appropriately, at a train station) from a failed woman into a wildly popular young girl; she steals the handsome prince from a grasping shrew; she spends a fairy-tale three days in an enchanted space, where normality, order, hierarchy are all suspended or overturned; she even chooses to reveal herself wearing an 'Arabian Nights'-like costume.Susan's 'time-transference' allows her to become a subversive sprite, although an earlier tussle with Osborne (the immortal Robert Benchley) suggests that she is not the sort of person to simply take things as she finds them. But the idea that a little girl can disrupt a rigidly ordered military base on the eve of war IS subversive, culminating in the glorious switchboard sequence. She does more than this - she changes the status quo - a hick girl who has blown all her prospects is able to infiltrate the military elite and overturn an arranged marriage, a deliberately conceived continuance of tradition. She takes Kirby out of this crippling environment, out of an enchanted land and the witch that would keep him there, even though she herself has magical powers that allow her to change appearance and age at will. She uncovers the sexual neurosis at the heart of the military project, rightly comparing the Fall of France to a sexual violation, but also suggesting that the mechanised disciplining of human beings only leads to the kind of physical repression that is betrayed by physical symptoms like Kirby's dodgy eye. When Susan leans against an erect cannon, trying to ward off pubescent boys for whom military advances are sexual advances, we know what's happening, especially as she met Kirby on a derailed train, that Freudian engine, which, along with Susan's disguise as a female caricature, prefigures Wilder's masterpiece, 'Some Like It Hot', and which, when the relationship is finally sorted out, and about to be consummated, is so at a train station. There is a melancholy twist to this fairy tale - Susan gets her prince at the moment he leaves, perhaps never to return, like the millions of men soon to be mobilised in the war effort. Wilder's portrait of Pamela audaciously suggests that not every woman will selflessly stand by her man, pointing to the misogyny of film noir and its treacherous women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't work at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one misfired entirely. The idea that Ginger Rogers could dress up as a child and pretend to be twelve years old is ridiculous in the ghoulish and horrible sense, not in an amusing way at all. She becomes a kind of Frankenminor, a monstrosity more imposthume than impostor. One wants to throw up. And then she meets the dour Ray Milland, who may make a good lead in a menacing thriller, but when it comes to interacting with kids, forget it. Milland was in real life so fantastically mean with money that he would always stick a travelling companion with the cab fare, pretending he had forgotten his wallet, as I was told by victims of this tactic. A man who cannot bring himself to spare a nickel is equally ungenerous with his affections, so Milland has about as much ability to relate to a 'child' as a mole could relate to an eagle (one living underground, the other in the clouds, and in Milland's case, he was the mole). Milland and Rogers have about as much chemistry between them as two rocks. This film is just a ludicrous attempt to cheer up the American public during the early stages of the War. Men watching must have been driven to enlist, if only to escape such drivel, and women watching would have been glad they were not twelve, if twelve is a woman in a school hat with a silly voice. This was Billy Wilder's first pathetic attempt to make something that was funny. Even Robert Benchley could not manage to raise a laugh, so the lead balloons were everywhere, tied to everyone's ankles by a misconceived project, an inane script based on an obviously very silly play, and inadequate direction. Perhaps this was the kind of target the Japanese were really after: bad movies, but they only got as far as Pearl Harbour, about which many bad movies were later made (excepting always the wonderful 'The Winds of War' TV series of 1983, one the finest series ever made for television).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I mean may. If 2 minutes after the introduction of Diana Lynn's character (Lucy Hill), you do not know how this film is going to end, then you have not been paying attention.If you are one of these people who see the humor in pedophilia, --- and who doesn't, huh? --- then you are going to love this movie. And I am not talking about some phony outrage over a 17-year-old dating his or her 22-year-old teacher (actually quite common in the years following WWII). No siree!!! I am talking about honest-to-goodness, pre-pubescent pedophilia. You're gonna die laughing!Our story starts with our heroine, Susan Applegate (Ginger Rogers) deciding that she has had enough of the decadence of the Big Apple and wants to go home to Iowa. Unfortunately, she had not allowed for a price increase in the train ticket, and so she pretends to be 11 years old in order to get her fare at half price. As in typical leftist Hollywood style. You know, stealing from a big, bad, evil corporation like The Railroad is perfectly acceptable. Note to those of like-minded convoluted thinking: Being a thief is like being pregnant. Either you are, or you are not. There really is no gray area. But I digress.Having boarded the train, our heroine is subjected to the constant harassment of the evil agents of The Railroad (conductors) who are not buying her ruse. And so she ducks into the stateroom of our hero, Major Philip Kirby (Ray Milland) in order to hide out. He buys her story about being 11 years old and agrees to help her out. He even convinces his fiancé, Lucy (Lynn), that he is just helping out some poor little girl who is traveling alone. And when the train is halted by flooded tracks, our heroine is put up by Lucy's family at the Military Academy where our hero teaches.And here is where you aficionados of this type of fare are gonna be rolling on the floor. Throughout the course of the next hour or so, this grown man, a Major in the US Army, lusts after what he thinks is an 11-year-old girl. Sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle. Oh, that Billy Wilder. Doesn't he just know how to massage the funny bone?And let's not forget our heroine. Just to make sure that our hero doesn't get all the laughs, she, a grown woman, plays on the sexual frustrations of a bunch of 14-year-old male military cadets. I mean, you just gotta split a gut, dontcha? Of course, in 21st century America, especially if the genders were reversed, the police would be setting up a sting for such a person. But again, I digress.And finally, how does our little saga end? Well, as I said, if you didn't see this coming you haven't been watching the same films as the rest of us. Let's just say that our hero strolls off into the sunset knowing that he can fantasize about sleeping with an 11-year-old for the rest of his life.Some fun, huh? I mean does anyone with half a brain think that this movie could even be made today? I cannot even imagine this film airing on broadcast TV without Congress putting someone in jail. Absolutely unbelievable.And so you say, "Lighten up, Francis! It's just a movie." Yeah, right. And the Inquisition was just a phase. Consider that when Nabokov's Lolita came to film, Lolita had to be at least a biological adult which is why Sue Lyon was chosen. And even then, all of the characters were shown to be deeply flawed, to be scorned for their unacceptable behavior. (No one would even show the 1997 remake until Showtime finally picked it up.) Imagine the Farrelly brothers making a comedy version of Lolita, and you get a feel for The Major and the Minor. Poor taste, indeed.Even if you dismiss the overtones of sexual perversion in this film, consider doing this to two of the most gifted, Oscar-winning actors of yesteryear. Give the beautiful Ginger Rogers a jaundiced face, ugly clothes, a god-awful hairstyle, an annoying name (Su-Su) and an irritating falsetto voice. And then take the sophisticated Ray Milland and turn him into a bumbling, perverted idiot. Sound like something that you would want to watch for an hour and half? Me neither.As the reviewer of another film put it, I am going to give this movie a rating of 2 because I don't want to admit that I watched a film rated 1. Of course, in my case, that means a rating of 2 out of a 1000. If you ever want to watch a Ginger Rogers film again, without thinking about this garbage, then avoid this piece of trash like the plague. You have been warned.</fullReview>
