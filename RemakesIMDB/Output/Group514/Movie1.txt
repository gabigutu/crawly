		<shortDescription>Pinnacle of their Partnership.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered the best of the Martin and Lewis comedies, this remake of "The Major and The Minor" (with Lewis in the Ginger Rogers role as an adult disguised as a child to qualify for a half-fare train ticket) improves on the original with a never ending romp of slap-stick humor, musical comedy numbers, and color. Diana Lynn, who plays a teacher, played the teenage roommate to Ginger Rogers in the original. Diana Lynn also starred in Martin and Lewis' debut films "My Friend Irma" and "My Friend Irma Goes To New York." Lewis as a boy is never really believable, but that's okay, it's meant as a spoof of anyone who has tried to pass off an older child as younger for half fare tickets. Most important, the humor is very, very fast and funny. Despite some nice musical moments between Dean and Jerry, there is no mistaking this is Jerry's tour-de-farce, and the reason for their split up obvious. Enjoy the pinnacle of their partnership.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll never get tired of watching this movie!Jerry Lewis is everything in this movie, from a goofy barber assistant to a spoiled little brat to a suave and sophisticated young man.All the funny bits will never be old to me, they still put me in stitches even after I've watched the film umpteen times.My favorite part is the choir scene...If you haven't seen it, don't be a ninny and get the movie for yourself! You won't regret it!I'm glad I still have my good old copy of this wonderful classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a re-working of another movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was watching this movie and suddenly thought it seemed very familiar!! I then realized it was a re-making of the 1942 movie "The Major and the Minor" starring Ginger Rogers! There is a sub-plot that is different,but many of the scenes are identical except for the fact that now it is Jerry Lewis playing a 12 year old boy instead of Ginger as a 12 year old girl.Another pairing of Lewis and Martin-lightweight but enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little gender reversal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Paramount library was a good place for source material for the Martin&amp; Lewis team while they were making big bucks for the studio. You're Never Too Young was a gender reversal remake of the Billy Wilder classic, The Major And The Minor. Not that anyone would confuse Ginger Rogers and Jerry Lewis.Just as Ginger Rogers was pretending to be a juvenile in the Wilder film, Jerry is pretending to be a little boy because there's a killer after him. The killer is Raymond Burr and he's killed a man to obtain a very valuable diamond. In trying to escape the hotel where the crime happened Burr palms off the diamond and eventually it winds up with Lewis.On the train to Blitzen, Washington (is there such a place) Jerry meets up with Dean Martin and Diana Lynn going back to a girl's school. Also on that train is Burr forcing Jerry to adopt that disguise. Jerry takes shelter with them and boards at the girl's school. Lucky dog.Arthur Schwartz and Sammy Cahn teamed to write the score for You're Never Too Young of which the number Simpatico done in a nice Latin tempo by Dean is the best. There's Nina Foch in the cast playing a designing woman whose designs are on Dean and her mother runs the school. And we can never forget Veda Ann Borg who always adds something to any movie she's in. Watch her try to vamp the diamond out of Jerry.Even missing some of the Billy Wilder bite, You're Never Too Young is a funny enough film that will please more than Martin&amp;Lewis fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Doesn't Get Any Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From start to finish, and based on the other pictures the boys were in, this is without a doubt the best of the Martin &amp; Lewis series. For some bizarre reason, 'You're Never Too Young' has been buried in obscurity. Maybe it was because there was just a bit too much M &amp; L exposure in '55, so it got lost in the shuffle. By this time, Paramount was giving M &amp; L pictures the 'A' treatment, in full VistaVision and Technicolor, with a great score of specially-commissioned songs and big production numbers. The Sidney Sheldon script they used in this case wasn't too shabby either, and was more ambitious and wide-ranging than their previous films. There's plenty of the customary wackiness, but more sophistication as well, and the boys can handle it. Lewis is in top form. His multiple role playing is inspired, whether doing a Bogart imitation, or a French barber, or, for most of the picture, posing as an early teen in order to escape tough guy Raymond Burr. Thanks to Norman Taurog's competent direction, he is always 'under control' and consistently hilarious. Dean cruises through effortlessly, and does his usual dandy job. Highlights: crooning to Diana Lynn in his sparkling DeSoto station wagon, and helping Jerry get through 'I Like to Hike' at the girls' school concert. Great supporting roles supplied by Veda Ann Borg, Romo Vincent, Hans Conried and Mitzi McCall as Skeets, who's mad about Jerry. All in all, the best produced, the most rewarding, and the best-managed Martin &amp; Lewis vehicle - not to mention the funniest. Now, Paramount, lift this gem up from the vaults and give us a DVD version. Please? Trust me, you'll get your investment back. UPDATE: Paramount came through: the DVD is outstanding, and the film is better than ever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're Never Too Young is another Martin &amp; Lewis movie that's lots of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this movie, Martin &amp; Lewis have a reunion with a couple of co-stars from their first feature-My Friend Irma: Diana Lynn, Jane Stacy in that and its sequel, is not only Dean's girl here but also a crush of Jerry's. And Hans Conried plays Jer's barber mentor, Francois. Then there's a couple of cameos from other of M &amp; L's flicks-Nancy Kulp, from The Caddy, as a lady with a "12"-year-old son and Bobby Barber, from Money from Home, as a newsstand clerk. With that out of the way, I'll just say the plot of a jewel robber (Raymond Burr) trying to get the diamond out of Jerry's coat pocket-which the latter doesn't know about-as Jer tries to pass himself off as a minor in order to get a half-fare train ticket with him ending up at a girls school where Martin and Lynn teach is perhaps the most ridiculous story yet for the boys' movies but darned if I didn't find myself constantly laughing anyway! As usual, plenty of Lewis' mugging and doing impersonations provide plenty of fun entertainment along with Martin's smooth crooning on many romantic ballads. And seeing the latter get constantly hit and bumped into by his partner just adds to the fun. So despite the many nonsense shenanigans, I heartily recommend You're Never Too Young.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As usual opinions vary on a Martin &amp; Lewis picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're Never Too Young is a remake of 1942 film The Major and the Minor (which itself is based on a play). Only with a gender change. It's directed by Norman Taurog and supporting Martin &amp; Lewis are Diana Lynn, Nina Foch &amp; Raymond Burr. Plot sees the duo caught up in a diamond robbery that entails Lewis posing as a 12 year old schoolboy to flee from the pursuing Burr. Tale unfolds at a girls school where confusion and romance reigns.It's the same with other famous comedy double acts on the big screen, be it Laurel &amp; Hardy, Abbott &amp; Costello, Hope &amp; Crosby or this here pair of Martin &amp; Lewis; there's never a definitive movie that's considered the best from the output. You're Never Too Young has many fans, some of whom proclaim it to be the best film they made. Personally speaking I think it's OK as a time filler, but actually one of their weakest colour productions; and certainly inferior to the great Artists &amp; Models released the same year.Casting aside the preposterous notion at the heart of the film, since this is slapstick comedy after all, the support cast is weak (Lynn arguably the worst female support in all their movies and Burr underused) and the gags are few and far between. It's weakly plotted and half heartedly performed by Martin, even the Schwartz/Cahn musical numbers lack sparkle (yes even Dino's lukewarm rendition of Simpatico). The colour photography from Daniel L. Fapp is most appealing, as is Edith Head's costuming. But no! Even as an ardent fan of their work, I just can't agree this is anything but distinctly average. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Martin &amp; Lewis films...and in widescreen color</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should preface this review by saying that I'm a huge fan of Dean Martin. But I think I can be objective, and there are films of his (e.g., "Artists And Models" and the later Matt Helm flicks) that are not so hot. But this 1955 comedy is one of the Martin &amp; Lewis films on the high side. The co-stars are second rate -- Diana Lynn, Nina Foch, and Raymond Burr (two years before he hit it big with "Perry Mason" and became a television staple).In this film, Wilbur Hoolick (Jerry Lewis) is a frustrated barber's apprentice who spends most of his time sweeping the shop. There are some funny bits when Bob Miles (Dean Martin) visits the barbershop for a trim. But before that, Raymond Burr's character steals the Majuba Diamond and hides it is Miles' pocket. Wilbur, who appears to have inadvertently gotten the diamond, is sent by Burr to Burr's wife's apartment to give her a hair-do...merely a plot to secure the diamond, which fails.Wilbur is forced to leave town...again, inadvertently with the diamond. He doesn't have enough fare for the train to Blitzen, Washington so he finagles a boy's sailor suit so he can pose as a child for half fare. Okay, so it's goofy...but this is that kind of comedy. Wilbur as an 11 year old is pretty far-fetched, but he ends up on the train...sitting next to Burr...and ends up in Dean's girlfriend's train cabin....scared of the thunderstorm. And starts the gossip back at the school where Martin and his girlfriend teach.Once at the girl's school, things get out of hand with Wilbur falling in love with Martin's girl, but unable to be the adult he really is.There's a great finale, with some lake-speedboat photography that's surprisingly realistic.Dean has a couple of good romantic songs of the style popular back then -- "Like I Do" and, particularly the romantic "Sympatico". Dean and Jerry are hilarious in "I Like To Hike", with a large chorus. I'm not a Jerry Lewis fan, but there were times he was so good...and this is one of them.This film was re-released in 1964...right after Dean Martin hit big with "Everybody Loves Somebody".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't understand the appeal of this plot--it's a terrible film for Martin &amp; Lewis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched Billy Wilder's "The Major and the Minor" twice--not because I liked it but because my impression was so poor compared to the film's very good reputation. Here in "You're Never Too Young", the same terribly flawed plot is recycled but with no originality and A LOT of Jerry (whether or not this is a good thing depends on your feelings about his style of comedy). I actually think I am generous in giving this disappointing film even a 4. Here are some reasons I disliked the film: 1. The plot has to get the viewer to suspend disbelief to the point where the viewer has to be stupid! Who would believe that the almost 30 year-old Jerry could successfully pose as a 13 year-old?!? Not only did he sport a 5 o'clock shadow, but he was 6 feet tall!! And his version of a kid is loud, shrill and annoying.2. Jerry is loud, shrill and annoying. I frankly wanted to see him shut up and stop overdoing every scene. Subtle he wasn't--which is a shame, as Lewis could be subtle and funny if properly directed.3. There is no originality at all about the film. It's simply a copy of "The Major and the Minor" and does not improve on it in any way. Dean Martin's songs are pleasant but do not make up for this deficiency.So, if you love Jerry Lewis films and think he's a genius AND can believe he can pass for a kid, you'll probably enjoy this film. Otherwise, beware!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long-in-the-tooth shenanigans...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Role-reversal remake of 1942's "The Major and the Minor" has Jerry Lewis stepping into the part originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just Ginger. Lewis attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train; he's successful, but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions. Sidney Sheldon adapted the screenplay, tossing in musical moments for Dean Martin (playing yet another in his stable of second-bananas) and a jewel-robbery subplot (which is dire). Diana Lynn, who played the wily teenager in the original film, plays Lewis' love-interest here. She's cute; Jerry isn't. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>
