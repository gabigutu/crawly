		<shortDescription>Something a little different from the boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment this movie begins we know we're in for something a tad unusual. In the early talkie days the folks at the Hal Roach Studio experimented with a new format for delivering opening credits: instead of simply filming title cards in traditional fashion, they built a spiffy Art Deco stage set, complete with proscenium arch, and hired a pair of young girls called the Crane Twins to march out onto the stage to deliver the film's credits verbally. The girls, who are dressed as bellboys, speak in unison at first, then alternate, then bow in tandem as they conclude. The effect is quite odd and (inadvertently?) funny, and kicks off Another Fine Mess on a curious note. The twins introduced several concurrently produced comedies featuring Charley Chase, Our Gang and the 'Boy Friends,' but this marks their only appearance in a Laurel &amp; Hardy movie. I find the girls rather endearing myself, but in any case Roach's experiment with spoken credits didn't last long.Enter Laurel &amp; Hardy chased by a cop, and we're back on familiar terrain. And yet things aren't quite so familiar after all, for it soon becomes apparent that this film has a different feel from the average L&amp;H comedy. There's an actual plot, comparatively little slapstick, and an unusual amount of verbal humor. It's no surprise to learn that Another Fine Mess was based on a stage sketch, because once the boys seek refuge in the house where most of the action takes place, it does indeed feel like a stage act is underway, as they engage in an extended routine involving disguise and mistaken identity, with some farcical elements included for good measure. Ordinarily Laurel &amp; Hardy didn't place much emphasis on dialog humor as such, but here they do, and happily the material is pretty funny. (Interestingly, the sketch that served as this film's source material was written by Stan Laurel's father, who was a theatrical manager and playwright, though it was said that the old gent did not approve of this adaptation.) In any other L&amp;H short the guys would've spent five or ten minutes trying and failing to enter the house, but this time they've got a rendezvous with The Plot and not so much time for physical shtick.As it happens, the guys have taken refuge in the home of Colonel Buckshot, who has supposedly departed for Africa. His servants, who were entrusted to rent the place out, have also left for a weekend vacation. Complications ensue with the arrival of a honeymooning couple, Lord and Lady Plumtree, who are interested in renting the place. Even bigger complications are set in motion by Ollie's decision to open the door to the couple in order to get rid of them, which forces Stan to impersonate the butler, which in turn forces Ollie to impersonate Colonel Buckshot, which in turn forces Stan to impersonate Agnes the maid. That's what I love about this movie, that decisive moment that starts the ball rolling. All the guys had to do was ignore the doorbell and wait for the couple to leave, but then they wouldn't be Laurel &amp; Hardy, and we wouldn't have this fine mess to enjoy.It's amusing to watch Ollie brazenly attempt to assume the role of the wealthy Colonel Buckshot, behaving the way Ollie believes such people behave, and he's well matched by Stan's quick-change impersonations of Hives the butler and Agnes the maid. I especially enjoy the scene between Agnes and Lady Plumtree. We have to assume that Thelma Todd's barely suppressed laughter throughout the scene is genuine; I mean, playing opposite Stan in drag, listening to him ramble on and giggle nervously, who wouldn't crack up? While it's true that the musical score and sound effects used in Another Fine Mess are somewhat more emphatic than the typical Roach comedy of the period, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, I feel this gives the film an agreeably wacky, "cartoon-y" feel suitable to the situation. I love the moment when the real Colonel (Jimmy Finlayson, underplaying as usual) returns home and tries to grasp what has happened. His furious response prompts the silliest wrap-up ever contrived for a L&amp;H short. It's a laugh-out-loud ending -- it was for me, anyway -- and it ensures this movie's status as a treat for comedy connoisseurs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurdly inspired detail makes this film hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the better films of the talkie era, this short, based around the earlier pre-teaming Laurel &amp; Hardy classic 'Duck Soup' flows well with Stan constantly having to switch his disguise back and forth between butler and maid.It's attention to detail that makes this film so funny. The ridiculous guffawing Lord Plumtree, the timely return of Colonel Buckshot (James Finlayson) who is a step ahead of his imposter (Oliver Hardy), and the totally bizarre pantomime-whatever-it-is ending which, as the audience returns to reality, leaves an impression which makes them say "What in the name of sanity was that?!!". A hilarious film. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Mess is Fine!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laurel and Hardy are simply hilarious! They incorporate slapstick and basic comedy to a pleasant pinnacle of perfect acting performances!! The talent of slapstick, which relies on a lot of physical humor,is misconstrued by the movie audience as just being silly! Hence, it is not given it's just deference. The movie "Another Fine Mess" pokes flagrant holes in the day to day petulant actions of the well to do!! Laurel and Hardy's chicanery and wild antics are once again, totally unintentional in this film, that is what makes them so funny!! The early days of movie making almost seem incomplete without Laurel and Hardy!! I found their movies and skits to have a totally innocuous reliability to them!! Such theatrics of whimsical mannerisms reflect the innocent days of yesteryear!! In evaluating these Laurel and Hardy movies, there is such a dark side to so many people who star in them!! Such disconcerting callousness is put in a flippant perspective, and should be taken with a jaundice eye!! I could watch Laurel and Hardy reruns over and over again, they definitely fall into the category of timeless entertainment!! "Another Fine Mess" is one of Laurel and Hardy's better efforts, and I recommend to anyone who is just in a mood to be amused, that they watch this movie.... THUMBS UP!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stan as Agness the maid is just the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing Stan Laurel as Agnes the maid in this film is absolutely fantastic. I especially love his girlie chat with Mrs Plumtree on the sofa. This particular scene of the film illustrates Stan's adaptability to talkie films, and to situation comedy, where there is less of the usual slapstick.I guess the use of more dialogue over slapstick in Another Fine Mess is due to the fact that it was thought that such comedy genre would be less funny, and therefore irrelevant to talkie films. Seeing Stan and Ollie with more dialogue to perform takes allot of getting used to. However, I think the duo pulled it off in this film Very good viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Here's Another Nice Mess You've Gotten Me Into"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot was going on safari in Africa for a few months, leaving his house for rent. Pretty soon, Laurel and Hardy come running down the street. They're being chased by a cop. Why? Because he had found Stan and Ollie in the park sleeping on benches and when told to move on, Stan tipped his hat and said, "yes, ma'am". Stan and Ollie hid in a basement, accidentally locking themselves in. "Here's another nice mess you've gotten me into," says Ollie. But they find a way out and into Colonel Buckshot's mansion. They see Hives the butler and Agnes the maid leaving for a much needed vacation. But every time Stan and Ollie try to exit the house, the cop is right out there waiting. Suddenly, a couple, Lord and Lady Leopold Plumtree, show up and wish to rent the house. So Stan dresses up as Hives the butler and inadvertently invites them in. Ollie dresses up as Colonel Buckshot and attempts to show them the whole house. Stan also dresses up as Agnes the maid, according to Ollie they're twins. "One was born in Detroit, the other in Miami"; But then, the real Colonel Buckshot showed up because he forgot his bow and arrow. Stan and Ollie are discovered as phonies. They escape and are chased by cops. It's a pretty good Laurel &amp; Hardy short. The title became Ollie's catchphrase. Whenever the duo got into trouble, Ollie would always say, "here's another fine mess you've gotten me into", usually followed by Stan crying. So anyway, if you can find it, then I recommend Another Fine Mess. Also, a happy 72nd birthday to the film!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable remake of the silent feature "Duck Soup", which had played such an important role in establishing Laurel and Hardy as the great comic duo that is now so well- known. This feature follows the same story setup, and expands it slightly while adding in a number of new gags that would not have worked as well on the silent screen.Once again, Stan and Ollie find themselves forced to impersonate an absent homeowner and his servants, while hosting a prospective renter. The main story is also framed by a brief opening sequence and an interesting, nearly surreal finale. In the main part of the movie, they get a lot of mileage out of the basic situation, and Laurel plays his multiple role in an amusing fashion. James Finlayson gets a couple of good moments near the end, although he does not get as much to do as he did in some of their earlier features.It packs a lot of material into a little under thirty minutes of running time, and there are a handful of moments when you can just tell that it was an early sound-era movie. But, as this example shows, Laurel and Hardy had little difficulty in successfully adapting their style to the new era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Circumstances of poverty force Laurel and Hardy to take refuge from the police in James Finlayson's mansion. But it might be a stroke of luck as Finlayson is about to depart for Africa to shoot big game. He gives instructions to the butler and maid to rent the place for six months, but they leave themselves on a short getaway.Which gives Ollie the idea to masquerade as Finlayson and rent the place himself. Stan masquerades as the butler.But when the boys meet with Charles Gerrard and his lovely bride Thelma Todd who knows a maid comes with the package, Stan has to get into drag and quick change drag at that to be both butler and maid. That provides for a series of incredibly funny situations.Of course it's all a big bust for Stan and Ollie, but you have to see one of their funniest short subjects to see how it all goes bad.</fullReview>

They take refuge from the chase in the basement of Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot, who has just left to go on vacation to South Africa.While hiding they pretend to be the owner and maid (Stan in his guise as Agnes) of the house when a new married couple (Lord Plumtree and his gorgeous wife) come around to rent the place. Obviously the usual hijinks and misunderstandings follow but the comic timing and Stan's indulgence in his Agnes disguise make it a half-hour laugh riot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laurel and Hardy did not make many 3-reelers. I'm not an expert on Laurel and Hardy, but as far as I'm aware, the disappointing and rather tiresome "Be Big" (1930) was their first -- and that would certainly have been much more enjoyable at two reels, as most of the extra action consists of Ollie literally getting caught in Stan's shoes -- a caper that soon wears out its welcome.The next L&amp;H three-reeler seems to be "The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case" (1930), which, despite its soppy conclusion (maybe it wasn't such a cliché back in 1930?), is one of their funniest and most uproarious outings.And now we come to "Another Fine Mess". I love this film! I think the timing is superb -- and there's not a minute wasted! It's a fun picture all the way with not only L&amp; H themselves in top form, but Thelma Todd at her prettiest and wittiest. Not only do all three have great roles, but all three make the absolute most of their opportunities. Oliver really shines as the bogus millionaire hunter, Stan is wonderfully adept at his quick-change impersonations, and Thelma, of course, as just said, is perfectly wonderful.The movie gains its humorous intensity not only from its superb scripting, playing and direction, but simply from the fact that, aside from a quick introduction with the boys being chased by a cop and the obligatory chase climax, it all takes place in the one setting, and so what have here is the concentrated humor of a stage play as well as the wider range of the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, but not fine...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't classic Laurel &amp; Hardy by anyone's standards, but it's made watchable by the comedy talents of the duo and a couple of inspired moments. The boys play a pair of bums who stumble into the unoccupied house of a local millionaire when avoiding arrest by the police and then pose as owner and butler/maid when prospective tenants of the property come calling. The comedy here is a little too one-note once Lord Plumtree and his foxy new wife arrive, spending too much time focusing on Stan's switching between the characters of Hives the butler and Agnes the maid (Agnes, incidentally, would resurface in A Chump in Oxford). There is a laugh-out-loud moment when the boys become tangled up with a quartet of rattling window blinds as they try to evade capture by the police though, and a truly surreal finale which sees them inexplicably disguised as a pantomime cow (?) riding a bicycle to freedom. The film is also noticeable for coining the phrase 'Another fine mess,' which would incorrectly be attributed to Hardy by impressionists forever more. As all Laurel &amp; Hardy aficionados know, what Ollie would testily exclaim to the tearful Stan was 'that's another NICE mess you've gotten me into'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this started I had the strongest feeling that I'd seen it before but I knew I hadn't reviewed a Laurel and Hardy flick going by this title. It turns out this is a reworking of their 1927 silent film "Duck Soup" in which they escaped fire-fighting duty by ducking into an old mansion who's owner is away on safari. Many other details of this talkie film are similar as well, down to the name of Stan's butler character, he was 'Hives' in "Duck Soup" as well (although not listed as such in the film's credits), and his alter-ego 'Agnes' showed up in that one too! The pluses for this film as I see it, are the inclusion of James Finlayson as Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot, and Thelma Todd as Lady Plumtree. I'd include Charles Gerrard as Lord Plumtree in that mix but that laugh of his managed to annoy me. Even so, this is a funny sketch, with a great comic interlude between 'Agnes' and Lady Plumtree discussing the number of rooms in the mansion and the nursery that was added 'in case of accidents' - that line was a blast! With the 'real' Colonel Buckshot turning up to close out the story, the picture erupts into general Laurel and Hardy mayhem. It's a fun film coming in at just under a half hour, with the picture gallantly living up to it's name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, Agnes!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitcom rather than slapstick. This isn't one of Stan and Ollie's best films but it's still a pretty good 3-reeler. I believe this came from a sketch developed by Laurel's father. It's certainly different, and if I remember rightly was re-worked in A Chump at Oxford.This has its moments, particularly Stan's having to change from Butler to Maid on short notice, and Ollie's impersonation of Colonel Buckshot. If the invention level is not quite top notch it's still an amiable film, blessed by Jimmy Finlayson, who along with Edgar Kennedy surely qualifies as "The third Laurel and Hardy." There's a very nice sequence with Stan in drag getting all cosy with Thelma Todd, and some nice word-play around the constant misquoting of Lord Leopold's name. "Plumtree, Plumtree, Lord Leopold Plumtree!" He must say this at least a dozen times.Pretty good, then, but not in the lengthy list of Laurel and Hardy true classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. I should mention the word is clearly "nice mess", it's a bit odd. Stan and Ollie are on the run from the cops, and just after Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot (James Finlayson) and his servants have left the large mansion, they show up and take it for themselves. Soon enough though Lord Leopold Ambrose Plumtree (Charles K. Gerrard) and wife Lady Plumtree (Thelma Todd) show up expecting to see the Colonel, so Ollie has to pretend to be him, while Stan acts as a butler, and in drag as the maid, Agnes. Both Ollie and Stan fib all the way, until towards the end, the real Colonel comes back, and after some bickering, they escape in an animal disguise. Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film, it is an enjoyable film. "Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into!" was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but over produced and forced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laurel and Hardy are on the run from a police officer yet again. This time they seek refuge inside a mansion. They are getting ready to leave when they hear that the master of the house is leaving for months and has left the house to the butler and the maid to rent out. When the butler and maid leave for a week's holiday, Laurel and Hardy decide to hide out for a bit. However, when two important people come to rent the house, Hardy must play the owner while Laurel has to become both the butler and the maid!Seeing that the name of the short was the (incorrect) phrase that everyone in the world associates with Laurel and Hardy, I assumed that this short would represent a really good film ? perhaps one of their best. Sadly it is not, although it is far from a wasted 20 minutes. The opening (with twins reading the credits) was off putting and was quickly fast forwarded by myself. After this we enter into the usual territory, the short picks up once Laurel and Hardy have taken possession of the house and must pass themselves off in various roles.It doesn't all work as well as it should. Hardy does well trying to find a games room in what is supposed to be his own house, and Laurel is funny as the butler. A running gag involving the mispronunciation of the guest's name results in the regular production of cards! What is disappointing is Laurel as the maid ? he doesn't do well and the scene with him (Agnes) and the lady of the house chatting is devoid of the blank looks of confusion that Laurel is best at ? instead it is silly. The conclusion is amusing but there is to much that doesn't quite work as well as it should.Hampering the material is a real sense of overkill on the production. Every move, look and fall is accompanied with a sound effect or grand sweeping music. The duo needs neither and it only serves to make the jokes appear to be silly or weak ? like they need the sound effects to make them funnier. Once or twice is cool, or used in the right places, but the overkill here is to the detriment of the film.Overall this is an OK short but it lacks the inspiration and wit of them at their best. Here many falls and jokes are simply not delivered as well as they have done elsewhere. Sadly the over production only serves to reinforce this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a mess, than really fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Another Fine Mess" is a 1930 short film starring Stan and Ollie. It is one of their earlier non-silent works and runs for slightly under half an hour. Director James Parrott and writer H.M. Walker worked with the two on many occasions and very both very prolific people in the film industry despite their early deaths (especially Parrott's). It's a black-and-white movie, but certainly not among Laurel and Hardy's best. The problem may be the story. It relies on humor all based on drag and costumes in general instead of delivering a convincing and genuinely funny story. This is not the best choice for Stan and Ollie or for anybody else. I must say this film about the duo being a pair of homeless vagabonds who pretend to be wealthy house owners is a bit of a disappointment. Thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True, we expect the original fat-thin comedy team to get into crazy situations, but try this on for size: Laurel has to pose as two different people at once! When our heroes have to flee the cops, they hide in a mansion where the owner has gone on vacation. While Hardy poses as the owner to meet some prospective guests, Laurel poses as both the maid and butler. And that's just the start of their misadventures! Watching the Laurel and Hardy movies, I often wonder how they kept straight faces in the midst of everything. Certainly I almost never stopped laughing watching "Another Fine Mess". It seems very likely that Stan's and Ollie's antics may have provided much of the inspiration for the relationship between Gilligan and the Skipper.All in all, another great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed that in general, all Laurel and Hardy films get very high ratings--even some really bad ones (such as their films for FOX in the 1940s). While I do love their films, I am not so gung-ho that I want to pretend EVERYTHING they did was great--some films were bad and some were only okay. This film definitely falls into the okay category with overly familiar situations and humor that just doesn't make you laugh. Seeing Stan dressed in drag wasn't too funny and nothing really stood out in this movie to make it anything other than just a time-passer. Instead of watching this one, try to find one of their better shorts such as BIG BUSINESS, THE MUSIC BOX or THE PERFECT DAY.FYI--This videotape was from Hallmark/Artisan and was Colorized. As always, Colorized films look like crap and detract from the overall experience unless you have a fetish for ugly pastels. Try to find a non-colorized version if at all possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really understand why this movie is rated so highly, especially when compared to other far more superior Laurel &amp; Hardy shorts.Real problem with this movie is that it only relies on one comical premise. The jokes and humor are because of that restrained and too often too much of the same. The movie is lacking in some true laughs and comical/slapstick moments, even though of course the movie still perfectly entertains.The story is simple and a remake of the far superior comedy short "Duck Soup". Of course Laurel &amp; Hardy movies always have a simple story, as they should in my opinion but in this case some more creativity wouldn't had been a bad idea.Not even James Finlayson in a small role can make the story feel lively and creative. Basically the most amusing character of the movie is being played by Charles K. Gerrard. Never a good sign when the most amusing character in a Laurel &amp; Hardy movie is being played by a supporting actor. Sure, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are amusing in their roles and they provide the movie with some good moments but it all was a bit too simple for my taste and really lacked in true comical creativity.Certainly not a bad movie and still worth seeing and entertaining enough but nevertheless the movie isn't as good or funny as the rating here at the moment (7.4) would suggest.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Weak-- Does Not Play to Their Strengths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best Laurel and Hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by Stan, but with Ollie receiving the bulk (!) of the punishment-- see the great 'The Music Box' (1933) or 'Towed in a Hole' (1932) as some some classic examples.Here, however, for some reason (is it because it was based on a sketch by Stan's father?) the boys play it 'straight' in a 'comedy' built around jokes and supposedly funny situations. It doesn't come off. It's merely another third-rate tedious 30s comedy, heightened only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures (Ollie's finger wiggling, Stan's blank stares, etc.) or comic abilities.The film begins with them running from the police. Since we never see or know why, it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and thus hiding in Colonel Buckshot's mansion. The premise for the 'humor', Ollie passing himself off as the Colonel and Stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging. They are not playing 'Stan and Ollie' in this film. Their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor.Stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny, but he doesn't get the chance to do any of that here. He's constrained by uttering too much dialog to 'move' the plot, but none of it rises much above the silly. We are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing Lord Plumtree's name, the "Call me a cab! Okay you're a cab!" joke, cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns, and a non-sequiter ending of Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two, and James Finlayson is still doing his silent-era full body takes and Keystone Kop jumping jacks.Stan and Ollie do much better in a situation comedy in 'Sons of the Desert'(1933) where we get to see them do what we love about them -- be themselves. In fact, 1932-34 seem to be their best years.Since this film does not play to any of their strengths, why bother with it? I have to give it a 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not particularly funny Laurel and Hardy short, though it does have its moments. Seeing a curtain rail getting the better of the pair is amusing, and Stan headbutting a wall proves that the duo's timing was far greater than any of the plots.The plot in question revolves around Stan and Ollie pretending to be a rich houseowner and his butler. This isn't as humorous as it might sound due to the leads not affecting greatly different characteristics (as Stan would in A Chump at Oxford) than their previously established personas. Even Stan's recreation as "Agnes" doesn't allow him to take on a different accent.James Finlayson is wasted in a minor role and weirdly; the title again perpetuates the myth of Ollie's catchphrase, though here again he says "another nice mess" not the "fine" of the film's name. However, seeing the picture open with two twin girls dressed as bellboys, cringingly reading out the credits in stereo should give warning to what is one of the more glib, less inspired L &amp; H vehicles. The final pay-off goes too far out to be "zany" and just ends up as somewhat silly and unreliant on any form of logic to be funny. Disappointing.</fullReview>
