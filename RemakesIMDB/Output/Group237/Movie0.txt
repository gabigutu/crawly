		<shortDescription>subtle, melancholic, magical love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Subtle, melancholic, magical. The movie is almost comparable to another Asian film jewel, Love Letter (1995) in terms of the subtleness and slow build-up of the plot; where the platonic relationship between the protagonists help make the love story almost ethereal, and yet very grounded and real, at the same time. The love story is polite and decent, with different shades of melancholy, that at times it edges into sappiness. However, this "sappiness" is only like a pinch of salt which adds additional flavor to the already deliciously rich mood of the film. In terms of story-telling, cinematography and acting skills, it is almost flawless, and after the closing credits, it will leave you utterly breathless. The mood will stay with you long after you've seen it -- i think that's the magical domain of the film -- not only in terms of plot, but more so, the effect it brings to the viewers. A truly cinematic experience you shouldn't miss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life of isolation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A heart-wrenchingly beautifully filmed movie -- the cinematography is absolutely perfect and it makes me wonder whether Korean seaside residences are all that beautiful. But after a little while I sense this alarming message -- these days we prefer living in isolation and talk to people we do not know, and even regard them as our "true love" without any real contact (see the booming of ICQ), while on the other hand, we refuse to give the ones around us a chance, as Sung-Hyun did to his father and ex-girlfriend. I am not sure if this is what the movie is trying to say but it's such a sad reality...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance aside, there are other things in Il Mare worth talking about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler warning: These comments tell all, and are therefore only for those who (a) have seen the movie or (b) have not seen the movie but don't mind finding out everything about the plot.There is no question that Il Mare is a wonderful romance story, although the subtle Korean style may not appeal to an average North American audience. What it reminds me of, funny enough, is Ladyhawke (remember Michelle Pfeiffer?). Once you make this connection, however, it's not difficult to notice the striking similarity. In both stories, the romantic pair do not meet until the very end, but for different reasons. In Ladyhawke, she is a hawk by day ahd he a wolf by night. The situation in Il Mare is far more complicated and will take some explaining to unravel.Before the unraveling of the Time element in Il Mare, it is interesting to note the difference in the way the two endings are handled. In Ladyhawke, when the curse was broken and both finally appear together in human form, he gave her a fierce embrace, lifted her slightly off the ground and spun around in a final scene that fills the audience with ecstasy and joy of a final fulfillment long denied. In Il Mare, the finale is handled in a much more reserved manner, when they didn't even touch physically. The joy experienced by the audience here is more subtle.Now to Einstein's Theory of Relativity. The mystery of Time has provided the plot for many a movie, among the most notable of which are: Time Machine, Somewhere in Time, Back to the Future. Similar to these three, the key element in Il mare is an attempt to change something in the past, or to create an alternative "life line", so to speak.We mustn't however let the similarity obscure the one big difference. Unlike any of the other three, there's nobody in Il Mare who actually "traveled" through Time i.e. physically move back to a different Time. This is what makes this movie so clever and unique. It avoids altogether the paradox that haunts the idea of time travel: meeting yourself (your "double").Il Mare does not have this problem. The interaction is only through a magical mail box which delivers letters between two Times, 1998 and 2000, to be exact. It all starts in 2000, when the girl puts a letter in the mailbox of the house she is vacating, intending it for the next occupant. The reply, to her great surprise, comes from a guy in 1998. Now, we have a situation in which the girl knows in general what has happened since 1998 although she does not know specifically where this guy is in her "present" of 2000. The guy, on the other hand, knows that the girl can tell him things that has happened between their respective "present"s of 1998 and 2000.They finally agrees to meet at a Time that is "future" to both of them, which is two years away for him, but just the next week for her. But when he does not show up at the rendezvous, she is left wondering whether he has changed he mind. Then comes the final climax when she finds out that he was killed in an accident back in 1998 and desparately tries to send a letter back to warn him. In the happy ending, we are back in the opening scene, when he shows up BEFORE she puts that first letter in the mail box. The interesting final state of affair is that the guy knows what has gone on "before", i.e. the exchange of letters, including the final one that warns him and saves him from the fatal accident. For the girl, however, this "reality" has been wiped out entirely! As far as she is concerned, she has never put the first letter in the mail box and will just live happily ever after with this guy she just met.There are other subtleties that I wouldn't go further into. The plot has been very carefully woven, with great attention to details. The movie is well written and well acted, with lovely music, beautiful cinematography, and altogether well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- Il Mare: 10/10The perfect love story, not too soppy and never boring because of another incredible concept out of Asian cinema. This time, a man and woman are exchanging letters, one in 1997 and one in 1999. Sound good? Oh yes. This is just incredible, a perfect, beautiful, memorable movie with great attention to detail and some exquisite cinematography. One of the best films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of those films that makes you think about the story after a few days. The soundtrack and scenery creates a feeling of depression among the lead characters and they find happiness when they communicate to each other about their problems. This creates a slow moving pace, but yet it captures your attention throughout the film because the pain and emotions of the characters are believable and intriguing. The element communicating in different times, like the movie "Frequency", is part of the appeal as well. It's also interesting the way they incorporated the topic of architecture into the story and scenery. Great cinematography and use of soundtrack. It's strange the movie isn't as big of a hit. It's probably because of low budgeting in the marketing department. Anyways, go see it if you haven't, you will be pleasantly impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IL MARE (2001) Another soapy time-travel romance that, if you watch it in the right frame of mind, could have you in tears. It's about a guy who finds a letter in the mailbox of his new seaside rental house from the previous tenant advising him about little things that haven't happened yet, like the paw prints his dog leaves on the floor days later! In trying to meet the woman who wrote the letter, he comes to realize she lives about a year or two ahead of him in the timeline, and lived in the house after he vacated it. He asks her to find him in the future, but she can't... Like DITTO, the film manages to defy conventions on a couple of occasions, and it's internal logic is solid enough that you don't think about it too hard. Another great date film, again provided you're not too cynical about such things. I give it a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching My Sassy girl which i truly enjoyed, i decided to watch other movies with the actor Jun Ji Hyun. Hearing that it wasn't that good at the box office in Korea i had little expectation of the movie. But wow was I in for a surprise. The cinematography and the music really establishes the mood of the movie with the isolated house as the main scenery beside the ocean giving a sense of loneliness that the characters endure throughout the movie. The mailbox was the only way of bridging that gap and the movie did a good job of portraying that. But also had a magical property which sends and receives mail at two different years in time. However exploiting it to change the past could have dire consequences. Overall a different but memorable romantic movie experience. Good to watch when your alone and relaxed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of two people who exchange letters across time is a very good romance even if you're not in a romantic mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of this movie goes something like this.... A young woman leaving a house called Il Mare because it stands on a pier in the sea leaves a note for the next occupant of the house. The idea is to greet the next occupant and to ask them to send her any mail addressed to her since she expecting some important letters (from her boyfriend who's learning animation in America). The letter is picked up by a young man who is an aspiring architect but who works building bridges to pay the rent. He has just moved into Il Mare...as its first tenant...two years before the girl's letter was sent. What transpires is a conversation in letters as boy and girl exchange letters across time.This is a beautiful to look at (I love Il Mare the house) and to listen to movie (I'm going to have to track down the soundtrack). In a way this plays like a time traveling version of 84 Charring Cross Road with much of the story told simply through the letters. In some ways its a story of two isolated people connecting through time, even though there is no way they should be able to. I think that one review of the film I read was right in away in that this film is a weird sort of take on the IMing culture as well as anyone who spends too much time on the computer and so isolates themselves from human contact.(This also has echoes of Voices of a Distant Star) This is a very nice little romance about two people who at first think their connection is a joke and then find that they are somehow becoming friends. For the most part it manages to keep you from thinking about the problems that "time travel" stories usually engender. Basically if you give yourself over to it you'll have yourself a good time.This isn't to say that there aren't problems, there are. As I said the film deals with people who aren't connecting with each other and a good portion of the film is taken up by the two leads moving around not connecting to people. Yes they talk to people (The girls best friend runs a manga store- and she does voice acting) but mostly they are are off in their own little worlds. It gets rather tiring since it feels more like a play than a movie at times, the movie in the wrong frame of mind (which I was in) will make the movie seem much longer than its 95 minutes.(Worse I thought I would jump a head...bad mistake since I had to go back to make sense of what I saw) Still its a nice romance that moved me (I'm not afraid to say I had a tear in my eye). Definitely worth seeing if you're so inclined.7 out of 10 (Higher if you're in the right frame of mind)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Region 3 DVD info</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree wholeheartedly with everything that has been said, this really is a beautiful and romantic movire. It holds back from spelling everything out like a Hollywood movie would, but the quality of acting means you understand the characters without them even needing to speak. I saw this with an architect who also appreciated this on another level, and would recomend any designers see it to appreciate the building it is mostly set in!The only thing I can really add that might help people is some dvd info: I bought the Region 3 DTS/Dolby Digital release in NTSC. Sound is great, maily the music as it's no action movie. The picture is non-anamorphic, and not amazing, but doesn't detract from the artful cinematography. One thing to note is that although the english subtitles are very well translated, every now and then a word can be missed off the end of a sentence (they haven't taken into account the maximum line length that can be displayed). Again, this didn't detract from my enjoyment though, as the only lines with this error had obvious endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty, and Pretty Close to Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Il Mare' is a beautiful film -- beautifully shot, beautifully written, beautifully acted. It's as romantic a film as I've seen in years.Two attractive young people live in an isolated beach house two years apart. Each is hiding from unhappiness and lack of fulfillment. When the young woman moves out she leaves a note in the house's ornate mailbox asking the house's next occupant to forward her mail. She is hoping for a letter from her lover, who is studying abroad and from whom she has not heard in some time.When she gets a reply, it is from a young man who claims that he is the house's first occupant and he doesn't know how her letter got into the mailbox, but that he'll keep his eyes open for her mail. The young woman moved out of the house in 1999; the young man's letter is dated 1997. They are living two years apart, but the house's ornate mailbox somehow makes it possible for them to correspond.Over the course of their correspondence they open to each other and it becomes obvious that they are soulmates. But . . . they are living in parallel universes, separated by two years. She tells him exactly where she will be on one day two years previously, and he goes and sees her, but of course she has no idea who he is.The story moves forward inevitably but unpredictably, and there are almost guaranteed to be tears at the end. But more than the story, and more than the strength and beauty of the film's stars, what impresses is the way the story is told: through ravishing colors, perfectly composed images, amazing cinematography, even beautiful music. (Music can be the downfall of Korean romantic films.) There is hardly a frame of this film that could not be frozen and framed.See it, before Hollywood gets hold of it and spoils it. (It's all over eBay, with perfectly good English subtitles.) This is one to own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Il Mare (2000)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the earlier Korean hits in Singapore was Il Mare, starring Jun Ji-hyun and Lee Jung-jae, and last year it became the excuse of a remake by Hollywood to reunite Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock on the big screen. If anything good comes out these remakes, it is the acknowledgement that Asian stories are finding some legs to travel. There was no hesitation to obtain my copy of this movie when I saw the DVD, given that almost all the versions of the movie here was the VCD oneJust so you know where I'm coming from, I haven't seen the original, and had seen the Hollywood remake first. But if you were to ask me to decide right now which version is superior, I would say without hesitation, the original Korean one triumphs over the remake, simply because, as a romance, it sure knew how to present it the way it's supposed to be. The way the movies were made, is akin to the lake house featured in both movies - the Hollywood one is very grand, with plenty of bells and whistles, but the Korean one is simpler though by no means less effective, in its minimalist look and feel, puts the focus of the story squarely on our lovebirds separated by time.The first thing that strikes you is how quiet this movie can be. There is less dialogue, and it allows the images do the talking. As the cliché goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Containing plenty of beautiful, idyllic soft focus shots which contribute to the overall romanticized feel, Il Mare is slowly and intricately paced, and less complicated with its relationships, and its supporting cast is few and not given anything substantial to steal thunder and limelight.This, compared to the very Hollywood style of development every minor subplot into a major one, and having to explain everything to the audience - this I thought was sledge-hammered through in the remake very early on into the film, which after watching how it was dealt in the original, you'll agree at which version is more superior. There were many instances of "homage" shots, like the red coat, the paw prints, and the shots of the mailbox, as well as adapting plot elements like the train incident, and liberties were taken to bring to life some of its supporting casts, which were only mentioned in passing in Il Mare. If not for the inflation of run time because of the lack of skill in making a beautiful picture, then I don't know what is.Il Mare allows the audience room to piece together clues and events, without stifling, and this enables a greater appreciation, as well as time to be absorbed totally into the lives of our protagonists, 2 lonely hearts finding each other through a temporal time warp via a mailbox at Il Mare, the name of the Lake House. One's an architect, and the other's a voice artistes, and both connect heart to heart during the winter season, leaving the question of, if we can click, why not meet up and get together?Jun Ji-hyun and Lee Jung-jae play off each other really well, even though they share limited screen-time together. Coupled with the way each had their individual scenes shot, framed, and presented, I'd say again, you can't help but to feel for these 2, and root for them to transcend hell and high waters to come together. Watch this movie to find out if they do!!Certainly one of the better romantic tales out there, done totally right. Forget about The Lake House, make it Il Mare instead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the lake house vs il mare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film. It is the first korean film I ever saw and I was not disappointed at all. Recently the remake of this movie, The Lake House, came out in the US. I had to see it of course to compare. I still prefer the original.The music in the korean version is just spellbinding and beautiful. It gives a wonderful lovey dovey/kinda sad mysterious feeling to the whole movie. It kind of connects the whole movie together which I didn't feel in the remake b/c they kept using random music that didn't mix well to me.I don't know much about Korea but watching the film gives me more of a sense of how it is over there and how things are different from my own country. The Lake House didn't really give any feel as to how the US country is.. maybe b/c it wasn't anything original. There were too many holes in the US version too. And even though I've seen the original a lot, the remake confused me a bit even about the time period. don't even get me started on the other changes they made to the plot, as well as new characters, etc.The korean film left you guessing more and didn't just hand over the whole plot and clenchers like the remake. There was more emotion in the korean and more surprising. It's so dramatic and heart clenching and ugh.. just makes you want to cry.Don't let subtitles scare you away.. go find this movie and watch it.</fullReview>

However it is one of my favourite films.Il Mare is set in an idyllic location and is beautifully shot and beautifully acted creating an unforgettable romantic atmosphere.

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful story about love and it really tries to build the plot around the theme of time and distance and the loneliness that one may feel as a result. There's a saying that goes, "in another time, in another place" and it fits well with this kind of story. Stylistically, this movie has a somber and subtle landscape to it and you can feel this as well with the music choice for the different scenes. This movie is sweet and endearing and its simplicity surely contributes to some of that. Although, the story line did feel weak at certain points, I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful; near flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare films that is so close to being perfect that any criticism of it seems like nitpicking. It begins with a scene showing the female lead, Eunju, moving out of a lonely house by the sea called Il Mare. Eunju has written a letter to whoever rents out the house next, asking him or her to forward any mail addressed to her to her new apartment. She dates the letter late 1999 and puts it in the house's letterbox. We then see Sunghyon, Il Mare's original occupant, moving into the house two years earlier. Somehow, Eunju's letter from 1999 has turned up in his mailbox. The two begin to correspond, and the lonely Sunghyon and heartbroken Eunju find that they were made for each other - but can they ever be together?The film focuses almost entirely on Eunju and Sunghyon's evolving relationship, and therefore there are only a handful of other characters in the film, none of whom have significant roles. The film spends such a long time developing the relationship between Eunju and Sunghyon that it becomes entirely believable and profound, unlike so many films where the two characters simply have to look into each other's eyes to fall in love. The two characters are so likable and so lonely that we hope terribly that their relationship will succeed.Somehow, the fantastical element of the plot doesn't make it any less believable. Rather, it makes one reflect on how quickly time passes and how two years into the future can seem a long time but two years into the past can seem like no more than a few months. Nitpickers will criticise the film because of the inevitable anomalies that the concept of time travel causes, but it is easy to overlook these slight imperfections. Furthermore, the complete absence of sex, violence and language is a blessing.It's a beautifully photographed film with a very beautiful story, which - as one reviewer suggested - should be seen with someone you love sitting beside you. It's one of those films that will stay with you for a while after you see it - I found I was still thinking about the characters days later. I confess, a tear came to my eye at the end. But was it a tear of joy or sorrow? Watch the film and find out for yourself. This is one of only four films I've ever given 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Original Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Il Mare is a film about love story between two people separated by time. It touches the theme about long distance relationship. The plot is original and refreshing. In fact, Hollywood picked it up and remade it into a film that reunited the stars of Speed,Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock,entitled Lake House. The acting was excellent. Both Lee Jung-jae and Jun Ji-Hyun,were great as lovers writing letter to each other and sending it to the mysterious mailbox. The cinematography was commendable as well. The ending can be very sad and the last scene may provide confusion to a lot of viewers. But overall, the film is a must-see not only for Jun Ji- Hyun fans but for people who have appreciate great love stories. How does Il Mare compare to the Hollywood remake,Lake House?Il Mare was a lot better than The Lake House. Here are the reasons why.1. Il Mare keeps the audience guessing as to what is going to happen next while the plot is clichéd in The Lake House.2. You care more about Han Sung-hyun and Kim Eun-ju in the Korean version as compared to Alex and Kate in the Hollywood version. Credit that to Jun Ji-Hyun's performance as she has the ability to make you sympathize with her characters in her films. While in the Hollywood version, Keanu Reeves is not fit for any kind of romantic leads for he is more suited for action films like Speed and the Matrix.3. There was more emotion in the Korean version as compared to that of the Hollywood version. You know that the leads do care a lot for each other. 4. The Korean version focused on both leads and their loneliness while the Hollywood version involved more characters which made the viewer felt less for the emotions of the leads.5. Finally, the use of mailbox and writing letters was probably still common in South Korea during 1997 and 1999 in the Korean version while the use of email,google and the internet was already a way of life in the United States during 2004 and 2006 in the Hollywood version which made the plot of The Lake House less realistic and presented more plot holes. For movie fans, check Il Mare instead of The Lake House.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that got me hooked on to Korean movies..although it might be abit old by now (8 years old)..it's definitely a classic.. better late than never The main setting of this movie is loneliness..from the austere lighting, violin score, jazz background, large empty spaces..you might be left suffocating as the movie was barely punctuated with any light hearted moments (e.g.-the visit to the theme park quickly snuffed out with a reflective walk down an empty lane)..Little wonder why some people accuse the movie for being to draggy even though it is a 90 minute flick..But just before it lulls you into a slumber the story climaxes, reddens your eyes and leaves you breathless and wanting for more..an altogether wonderful experience The portrayal is perfect..in those cramped minutes the movie had made the connection with the audience..make them feel the characters as they fall into their disappointments, reclusiveness and right down to their happy moments as they open their mailboxes..so much so you cried because you felt the death of the male protagonist was almost too cruel an ending..special mention must go to Jeon ji hyun who's presence here was essential..her facial expressions were great..she had the ability to lift the mood with the slightess of smiles..yet carry the viewers through her blank stares and sobbing..and if you were to watch the video several times..you will notice the amount to symbolism used in almost every scene..for example the floating appearance of the house, dead tree with Christmas lights, broken glass, the bright red coat and gloves..everything painstakingly considered Yea..this movie is in Korean and it might be a little tempting to watch the Lake House instead (the Hollywood remake of Il Mare)..but i sincerely think you should do the opposite instead because this IS the movie that has the ability to make you breathless Note: This is definitely not a movie for those who are too afraid to tear in public or admit their emotions..And for those waiting for fast paced scenes..expect none However if you are good at appreciating subtleties and are tired of the usual genres of love stories circulating around..this is the perfect movie for you!..watch it at night before you sleep with the one you cherish</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lake House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen The Lake House with Sandra Bullock and Keanu reeves, but I have seen it. Il Mare is the Korean film that predates it by six years and is the same story. Like many great Asian films, another has been remade in America.Jung-Jae Lee (Typhoon) plays a budding architect estranged from his father and he moves into a house that his father designed and built. He finds a letter in the mailbox presumably from another person who has lived in the house. But, it is new and he is the first person there! Gianna Jun (an incredible beauty!) is the woman who rents the house two years later and is corresponding with the first owner through a magical mailbox.It is a sweet and tender story with absolutely brilliant cinematography and hauntingly beautiful music. And, of course, it has the cutest dog you can imagine named Cola, who binds the two together.A Sci-Fi ending to a sweet romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an emblem of the "pure romance" sub-genre from Eastern Asia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spawning a Hollywood remake 6 years later, THE LAKE HOUSE (2006), a star vehicle for Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, IL MARE is an emblem of the "pure romance" sub-genre from Eastern Asia, typically in Japan and South Korea around millennium, aiming to the incorrigible romantics, whereas love transmits in its most unpolluted form between two beautiful-looking youngsters, a form eclipses puppy love among adolescents, and imbues a more substantial connection of limerence between two people. In this case, what makes IL MARE a critical standout is its inventive concept to present "time" itself as an unlikely obstacle between two lonely souls Sung-hyun (Lee) and Eun-ju (Jun).The fantasy premise is that, through a magical mailbox, Sung-hyun, a young architect in 1997, receives a letter from Eun-jun from 1999, who has just left the beach house, aka, Il Mare, which Sung-hyun stays now, and moved into a new apartment in town. The house is a gift from Sung- hyun's estranged father, and he is its first occupant, so clearly, he receives Eun-jun's letter from a nearer future, 2 years later exactly speaking.This uncanny communication enlivens both Sung-hyun and Eun-ju's lonesome existences, they exchange their stories, both have experienced a recent breakup, with some not-so-serious time- altering happenstances (e.g. collect a lost Walkman in 1998 and send it back to 2000) to bring about their mutual affections. Guaranteed a slow pace with an intrusive deploy of soft-focus aesthetic (if not a bit televisionary) to fabricate a dreamlike co-existence of how perfect they are made for each other, experience their pastimes in two paralleled universes, separately but vicariously accompanied by each other, Lee Hyun-seung's fairy-tale regrettably slumps into a cloying one-trick pony after the midstream, when the novelty runs dry, and some default plot-holes emerge.One might wonder, since Sung-hyun can regularly meet an unwitting Eun-ju in 1998, why he chooses not to get to know her in person, using the Walkman as a silence-breaker for instance. No, he would rather communicate with a future version of her and laments in his time-line, that the present version only reckons him like a stranger, but in fact, he is a total stranger to her, what does he expect? A more nagging resistance is that, it never occurs to Eun-ju that she should look for Sung-hyun in 2000, not until the moment arrives solely for the convenience of a major plot device, which is narrowly plausible but too conniving to consummate a satisfactory crescendo.The two leads are not given too much to act since the narrations of their letters take a big chunk of the story, and most of time, they are acting against themselves under a veneer of affected pretty- people-entrapped-in-the-loneliness narcissism with schmaltzy songs in the background, although Jun Ji-hyuan exhibits a tinge of sophistication at a rather young age of 18, augurs her soon-to-be- acquired mega-star popularity not just in her motherland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love that transcends time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching "Il Mare" (aka "Siworae") back in the day shortly after it was initially released. And I do remember it as being a very beautiful movie. So I sat down yesterday to watch it again for the third time.And while "Il Mare" does have a very nice and original story, then it was a tad slow paced, which could be somewhat of a challenge for some audience to get through. However, I think that it is alright with a slow paced storyline here, because director Hyun-seung Lee uses the time quite well to tell a very beautiful and touching story.The story told in "Il Mare" is about a lovestory between Kim Eun-ju (played by Ji-hyun Jun) and Han Sung-hyun (played by Jung-jae Lee). They are sending each other letters from a mailbox at an ocean-side house named Il Mare. Kim Eun-ju is living in 1999 and Han Sung-hyun is living in 1997. And even with two years apart, their love grows with each letter.It is indeed a very interesting storyline, and one that has originality and sinks right in, because it is really well-told by the director.And while the cast list in "Il Mare" is relatively small, then there is a bigger pressure on the leading stars to perform well enough to hold up the movie. And I will say that both Jung-jae Lee and Ji-hyun Jun did more than perform adequately. They really carried the movie quite well, both individually and together on the screen."Il Mare" is a beautiful movie to grace the South Korean cinema, and it is a movie that is well-worth watching, regardless of you having a preference for Asian cinema or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartwarming, cleverly perplexing, and out of the ordinary concept made into a very well executed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review might be a little unorganized, simply because I didn't type all of it at once. However, I think you will get the general idea. I don't really enjoy going into detail about the entire plot since there's a synopsis for that, but I like addressing finer pieces of information which people may find confusing or miss by accident. Either way, I hope you'll understand my thousand word rambling.Nowadays, we rarely see time travel films that retain logicality and full consistency throughout, but Il Mare does it all by avoiding (or correctly abiding by) the confusing laws of time paradoxes. Those who love movies involving shifting elements of time will love this one too, although it doesn't transport people, but instead, items placed inside a mailbox. The magical mailbox of Il Mare, the house built by the lake, serves as a portal connecting two very special individuals who carry close resemblance to each other ? in the way that they are both living in solitude ? yet are dimensions apart; literally, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun exist in different time periods setting them two years apart.In simple terms (or maybe not? :p), "You can't change your present, but you can change your past's present" is the alternate-time-line concept portrayed by the director. The plot line is thought-provoking and requires a considerable amount of understanding, either by watching Il Mare again, or by utilizing careful attentiveness the first time around. This is a positive feature of the film, as it becomes worthy of repeated watchings and also leaves the viewer to contemplate about future events, but some may find it frustrating. The principle of alternate time lines branching off is shown in the ending where the two correspondents meet up in Sung-hyun's reality, while Sung-hyun is forever inexistent in Eun-joo's time-line. For those who have trouble understanding this, it means that Eun-joo, in the 21st century, could not alter the past to change her current state (by preventing Sung-hyun's accident), as the tragedy had already been witnessed.She COULD, however, alter the past to change HIS present (completely unattached to her time-line). This meant that in Sung-hyun's life, he could and did meet up with Eun-joo. I think this idea of alternate time lines is the director's way of introducing a happy ending. Il Mare is still sad with it, if you think about Eun-joo being eternally heartbroken in her "era", but the story ends up with one-half of its original bitterness. Future events are definitely debatable, as well as the question of whether Eun-joo meeting the alive Sung-hyun would impact Eun-joo's time-line, but that is in itself an entirely different topic and can be saved for another day.The only minor inconsistency, well actually, disturbing detail, would be that if I were Eun-joo, I would at least be a little spooked by a random guy making several appearances in my life. Without knowing him, Eun-joo meets Sung-hyun not once, but multiple times in 1998: the first encounter with the earmuffs, the second while meeting her boyfriend Joon-hi, and the final scene after Sung-hyun receives her letter to prevent his death.Everything was visually astounding, from the spot-on camera work (loved the "Cola-cam") to the beautiful Korean scenery. I must say, I would very much wish to visit the shooting location of Il Mare one day to see if the house is actually there.There is also an underlying theme (my personal thoughts) describing the fact that something which has gone should not be changed. Fate meddles with whoever tries to sabotage the events that were meant to happen, as portrayed when Eun-joo knows about the Sung-hyun's father dieing from the book, but getting hit by a car "by accident". The mittens given to Eun-joo float away into the sea by chance (which also acts as a symbol for the disappointment in Syung-hyun not appearing and him drifting away), while the recovered tape recorder smashed onto the ground. What was or wasn't meant to belong was deliberately corrected. In the same way, Eun-joo brought more destruction to others and herself, alienating the ones she cared about even more when she selfishly tried to change her past. When she finally accepts her present situation as unavoidable, a happy ending follows. This theme is an encouragement to hold onto those who are currently beside instead of those who have gone.Some may ask about the dog, and why Cola appears in both time lines. This is, again, open to imagination. My take on it is that when Sung-hyun died, he left Cola in the house, and the authorities or the local landowner probably gave it to the next tenant ? Eun-joo. (However, this leaves a discrepancy where Cola is seen running out of Il Mare which belonged to Eun-joo at the end of the film, when it really should have been Sung-hyun's if he was alive. Or maybe he simply gave Cola away?) Some notable scenes that were intriguing included the funny spaghetti scene, where the two throw strands of pasta at the wall, and the one where he puts a letter into a wine bottle... "Wine is supposed to get better with age" ? so does a broken heart.I love films where the directors don't simply just feed the story to the audience, but allow it to require some thinking to make the overall movie experience a tad more interesting. In the end, I can't help but hope for the best of both their futures because it really is a fascinating story. While this will disappoint some by not showing too many tear dropping scenes, it will satisfy those who are looking for a refreshing story. I think that this film was executed in a good fashion, and finished quite well, as it could have easily gone awry with the plot. Il Mare is an enjoyable movie and probably will stay as one of my favourites for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A korean movie with an Italian title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this was the first time I ever saw a korean film. I only knew about its existence after hearing of and watching the American remake. Sadly remakes have that effect.Of course that, by being the original, originality triumphs over the remake. The remake cannot be considered original for the simple reason of being a remake.The plot of both versions is virtually identical. However, the korean version takes place some years sooner and in a very different culture and society. Plus, it has many originalities of its own.Although as confusing as the remake, I'm much less critical on the original - it is more complete, richer in details, truer, more touching and sentimental and beautifully photographed. Even the actors are more believable in comparison. The remake, of course, doesn't repeat the original's formula and was obviously made to "match" the American standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Letters and The Twilight Zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine the story from Love Letters adapted to the world of speculative fiction, and you have a fair idea of what Il Mare is like. The concept is novel and refreshing (at least until other filmmakers started copying it) - a young man and woman share the same lake house, except at different times. They're separated by a wrinkle in time, and communicate through an antique mail box. The concept is contrived, of course, but the gimmick offers a novel viewpoint on the issues of time and fate. It makes little sense to view the film through the lens of logic. Rather, it offers a cunning "what if"- where characters travel through an alternate time, almost meet, but isolated from each other by each other's daily lives. This soft-hued focus bypasses the idea of using their situation to pick lottery winners, or bypassing the bumps in life's more difficult roads. But it does try to illustrate how people "unstuck in time" can support and love despite their separation. Love Letters may be more logically consistent, but Il Mare is subtler and sweeter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True love is stronger than time or space could keep apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'I hope you're ready to hear a long and magical tale.' This is what Il Mare or Siworae is about; a slow moving love story that will make your heart ache with pain, joy and inspiration.This little Korean gem of love and lost is underrated and almost unknown to most. It centers on a tale where two people are connected by a mail box although they live two years apart. With their letter exchange between each other they manage to forge a friendship which later develops into a love stronger than time and space could divide.Shot is a drab looking place this movie carries itself with the help of a credible cast, a powerful storyline and a wistful jazzy score that will tug on your heartstrings from all directions.Lovers of tearjerkers, romantic sagas and emotionally charged moments will have no trouble snuggling down with this. It is one of those movies that will make you wonder why your love life is nothing but a mere convenience without so much as a fanfare or a sparkle.An English version of this movie was remade by Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock call The Lake House. It's hard to compare the two since they are of different cultures, but they're both enchanting in their own right while sharing only similar plot.Other movies that share similar nostalgic and wistful sentiments are Serendipity, Cinema Paradiso, The Notebook and many many more. Get a shoulder, a hanky or a pet to sit beside you before you start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like it. Original and Derivative at the same time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a nutshell, A girl falls in love with a guy who is two years in her past. Romance and Time Travel has been around for a long time. Back to the Future is a romance. So is Chris Marker's Le Jetee (and as a consequence, 12 Monkeys) and Somewhere in Time. There are many plot devices to separate lovers and one of the most cruel (hence most romantic) is using implacable Time. So the time travel device is no longer a De Lorean or playing mental tricks on oneself but rather it's now a mailbox. I think more interesting are some directing effects (when the camera swings around the mailbox and the lovers seem like they are in the same space), some good shots of the skies and the deliberate, anti-MTV pacing of the movie. Lake House, the remake, is actually decent. It's fairly restrained and the house in the remake is prettier. It is not, however, that revolutionary, and therefore suffers in comparison with this remake. Lake House works because of the story, which is virtually the same here. Also, putting in two big name stars is distracting from a simple, gossamer story. Therefore, I have fonder memories of this Korean original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi melodrama with lots of pretty pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Korean film is a melodrama. It's a sci-fi melodrama. But the sci-fi elements are on the down-low, in fact--the sci-fi elements of the film are so underplayed, you wouldn't think it's a sci-fi film. The sci-fi element? Time travel. Actually, a limited type of time travel that would also be used the same year in the film Frequency and the next year in the Korean film Ditto.So, like most melodramas, this film focuses on the relationship between two lonely people, each with a relationship (one familial and one romantic) that they are having problems with and how these two people form a bond themselves.The time-travel elements are present and are used sparingly, but effectively to drive forward the melodrama. It's actually pretty good with no hugely bizarre continuity errors. Now, the really good stuff about the film: beautiful cinematography, gorgeous sets and location shoots, tempered and well-paced directing and editing and a general "feel" of the the film that sticks. It holds a personality and a charm that's unique to itself.The acting was decent enough that I didn't bust out laughing, although the same cannot be said for the often overdone score. But for a quiet melodrama film with a healthy chunk of time travel thrown in, it's a very good film. The only beef I have with the film is the ending--if the film removed the ending that it had, then perhaps it would make more sense, but the ending throws off the film a little. Nevertheless, the rest of the film is so pleasant to watch that I can still recommend the film. Just don't think too hard about the ending.It's good. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Siworae' a.k.a. 'Il Mare' is a romantic film. 'Il Mare' literally means 'The Sea' in Italian. I must admit that initially I wasn't intending to watch the movie cos my intention was to renting another show (it came as a alternative, since i got nothing to watch).The movie was overall pretty well done. The plot develop rather well for me (yes, I know some of you out there confusing about the time line and so on. but this aren't a sci-fi why bother to figure out about the time line and so on). The details in each scene make the emotional bonds between the two characters even strong. The song also accompany the movie well creating some sad-ding moments.When Sung Hyun died in Eun Joo's time line, it left me with an emotional impact. Yeah, there is other films when the character died but there aren't any emotional impact. In my POV, I feel that Sung Hyun really gives a lot (trying to make smile wearing the ear muffler, drawing out her ideal house and even try to prevents her breaking up with her boyfriend even when he didn't want to).For those who are emotional, prepare a box of tissue besides u. Some of my lady friends start crying towards the ending.</fullReview>

Their "long distance" relationship deepens and they try to find a way to be together. Overall very good. Good story, acting, &amp; musical score. It has a sadness and visually stunning cinematography that done so well in many Korean films. The composition, lighting etc in many of the scenes are like beautiful works of art. I thought it dragged a bit in the middle but not overly.See this film if you're tired of the summer action blockbusters.I haven't seen the Sandra Bullock/Keanu Reeves remake (The Lake House, 2006) but I would bet it's not as good.

		<fullReview>I have been watching tons of South Korean movies lately. There have been some very good ones, but then others have not been that good. Il Mare was one of those. I didn't think the movie was all that great. I simply did not understand it. Everything was confusing, so I have literally no idea what happened in the movie. I did not understand the sequence of events nor the ending. I spent an hour and a half watching this, but I couldn't really discuss it because I did not understand the story. I wish I did, but that's not the case. :( Artistically speaking it wasn't that great either. I found the house hideous and the location quite dull. The beach was all gray and it wasn't really inspiring. So if you are wondering whether to see the movie or not, I would suggest you to skip it. There are tons of other movies that are much- much better than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike a past message someone wrote about how he didn't like the ending, and it would had been better if Sung-hyun died would had been a mistake. It would had made the prev 100 mins seem pointless. There wouldn't be a point for this celestial matchmaking if the main character just died at the end.I understood the ending with Han Sung-hyun getting the letter in time, with instead of meeting Kim Eun-ju at the beach as planned, he decided to catch her as she was moving out which is the reason why she didn't remember him. Even though it would had been more rational if he just waited, b/c now he will come across as a crazy person. Plus it would look more romantic if they met on the beach where they intended.The part I didn't like (BTW major MAJOR SPOILER) is that if all this Twilight Zone stuff didn't come into play, Sung-hyun would had lived. The movie made fate seem like a deranged meddler by causing the rift in time to kill Sung-hyun only to have Eun-ju prevent it so she could realize that she was in love with him. I believe the screenwriter thought closed-mindly about that when he could had thought more outside the box. It would had caused more intensity and drama if Sung-hyun died in an accident which had nothing to do with Eun-ju and she suddenly remembers the tragedy back in 1998 and warns him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good quiet romance, tho bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Il Mare is a Korean romance about two lonely singles who have a romance through letters. The catch is that they are separated by two years in time (he is in 1998 while she resides in the year 2000) and the only way they can contact each other is through a magical mailbox at Il Mare, the oceanside house both reside in in their respective time periods. I've heard a lot of hype about this movie...especially about the time-travel aspect in the plot. I was expecting it to be flashy instead I found a quiet steady drama yet it wasn't original or particularly moving. Its strength lies in its restraint.Many commenters have noted the ingenuity of the time-travel aspect...but I was less impressed with that having seen it used before in another movie with a couple that had more chemistry (The Love Letter starring Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh). The lack of chemistry and character development is the fatal flaw of the movie. We see that Eun-ju and Sung-hyun are lonely people but besides that we don't really get a sense of who they are. Given the plot they cannot interact really except for a couple of scenes, such as when Sung-hyun meets Eun-ju at a train station in the year 1998 when she has no idea who he is. These scenes should have had a bittersweet tenderness, yet they merely fall flat. In a movie like this, the leads do not need to have crackling chemistry but we need to be able to see that they belong together. Individually the performances are good, if a bit bland. The dialogue is...not as sappy as some movies, but not at all witty or innovative. despite its plot gimmick, il mare is nothing but a traditional romance who's only notable point is its austerity. The film doesn't force the romance on us, it takes its pace unfolding it..first as a friendship only near the end indulging in the sapfests. But in being so restrained about it, the film also doesn't really give the audience something to root for. If you don't really expect much from this kinda genre you might enjoy it but if you want to be swept off your feet and moved to tears this isn't the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but only one in the bathtub in Il Mare.This film gets off to a frightening start with the kind of piano that here in the U.S. is often used in upscale department stores to imply that love is a commodity to be purchased.The use of a mailbox serving as a spacetime portal is a nice invention, and there are a few tests and tricks that the female lead utilizes that get more mileage out of that device than one would expect. At the same time, the notion of love blooming in a series of epistles is unfulfilled here.I don't think that is even the failure of the translating team. The actual letters aren't really what fan the flames of their love, rather it is requests passed through the medium that do. Aside from sharing a sulking sullenness, the two love interests are mainly united by that extraterrestial mailbox.And a dog. A cute dog. I mean its name is Cola.Yes the scenery is beautiful... But I had hoped for prose that would rival it. The notion of an architect building houses, with no sense of home. That was a touching line, but it was exchanged with a co-worker not penned to his amor.The house-on-stilts near the strongly ebbing bay would qualify as a dream home, or even a dream house, for many. Meanwhile the projected house on the craggy coast made me want to quit my job here and go do the clearly more lucrative voice dubbing in Korea.Having the long walk to the magical mailbox was a nice touch, adding to the anticipation of each exchange. And something about that vastly ebbing tide connected with the two-year gap between our heroes. I think the scene scouting on this was top notch, in a way it was more like casting.The cinematography was at times fascinating. Great shots from outside to inside the stilts house, a nice revolving shot overlapping the two during the early whirling romance around the mailbox. But then that shot resolved on a clunky splitscreen image. Additionally a lot of the night footage just looked dismal.The first wrong turn in the series of requests is deftly handled, and subtly unraveled within the next few scenes. The second wrong turn, however, is much more clumsy and makes me worry that the virus known as audience-testing has spread to Korea. Enough said for now...Ultimately I feel like this would be more appreciated by teenagers and lonelyhearts. A little too simple for my tastes, but at least it gives some hope to the tradition of letter writing in romance.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>suffers especially from consistency problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having accepted the premise of two people living in different times and communicating with each other, there are still serious problems regarding the handling of this premise. Besides this, the script is not void of consistency problems. The remade movie with Reeves and Bullock has a far superior script and therefor is a better and more convincing piece of art work. The subject matters Il Mare is dealing with are indeed quite romantic. But this is true for a lot of mediocre TV-work, which is on par with European or American standards. To be a really good movie, there must, in my opinion, be no consistency problems. I can love a movie, and this does not necessarily make it a good movie. I do not like Il Mare, but I kind of love The Lake House due to the subject, the production values AND the very well done script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I watched this movie cause Jeon Ji Hyun stars in it so I figured if she was amazing in My Sassy Girl and Windstruck but I was wrong. She and the entire movie was a big snooze. The magical mailbox concept was confusing, but at least it had a happy ending thank goodness. There was now actual physical intimancy between the two main characters. I thought this was a romantic film not a documentary on houses. I'm still mind boggled about how she is attracted to someone by mail but not in person, what's up with that? However I do understand the deeper meanings of the movie of how we people sometimes shut the ones closest us when we are troubled when really we should keep them near us.I still love Jeon, peace-out.SAM</fullReview>
