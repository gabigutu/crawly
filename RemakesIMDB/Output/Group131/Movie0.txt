		<shortDescription>One of the year's best horror movies, though the subtitles will sadly put many people off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the website of this movie gave me the creeps. And it turned out to be one of the scariest movies I've seen in a while. We follow the touching story of a young Hong Kong girl, blind from her earliest years, who undergoes a cornea transplant. After softening us up with lots of nice sentiment, the horror kicks her new found sight brings its own macabre rewards. Snappy editing and a well-timed score heighten the horrors that pack nanchuka punches to the guts. About a third of the audience was cowering behind their hands for the last half. In an age when American horror flicks are starting to look weary from over-use of CGI special effects or are toned down by self-censorship to reach a wider audience, The Eye comes in as a deftly woven real cardiac-stimulation shocker. Sadly, the fact that it is subtitled limits the potential audience as many people simply refuse to go and see foreign language films until they have been genuinely moved or terrified by one. If you like horror movies and want to experiment, this is a good chance, and one of the best in the genre since the little shown Audition earlier this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the horror movie genres in existence, ghost stories have always been my personal favorites. The Haunting, Ju-On, The Innocents, Ringu, The Shining...all nice, moody, creepy ghost tales. The Eye now finds itself at the top of my list along with the aforementioned as one of the best and creepiest ghost stories of all time.Mun, blind since the age of 2, receives the gift of a cornea transplant at the age of twenty. Her restored vision comes with a price, however. She can no longer play with the all blind symphony that she once found solace within, she cannot read or write, having had no reason to learn, and she has no words for visible objects, having always identified them by touch. She's also seeing things that nobody else can see...terrifying things. A little boy looking for his lost report card plagues her daily. An old woman wanders the hospital corridors, complaining of the cold. Shadowy forms come to escort the recently deceased away to parts unknown, and Mun's own bedroom flickers in the darkness, changing into another room that once belonged to another girl, in another country. Mun knows that the things she sees are not normal, but no one seems to believe her, not even, at first, the cute doctor who is trying to help her. Mun finds herself alone in a frightening world filled with things she never wanted to see. When Mun and the cute doctor finally learn the identity of the donor whose corneas Mun has received, they also learn of her frightening abilities, her sad death and a terrible tragedy which is destined to repeat itself. The Eye is an original and innovative film and yet it is also a perfect mixture of plot points and elements drawn from such previous films as The Sixth Sense, The Mothman Prophecies and Blink, all of which are very good films in their own right. The Eye knows exactly how to scare you, and does so without a drop of blood or a hint of gore. A scene in a calligraphy class provides a truly frightening shock, while a scene in an elevator is an exercise in slow, building dread which grows more excruciating by the second. The performances are all wonderful, and the feelings of loss, alienation, fear and determination are genuine and powerful. Fans of the aforementioned films would do well to seek this one out, as would ghost enthusiasts and Asian Horror aficionados. It's rare these days that a film will actually make me jump, gasp and check the corners of my bedroom for boogeymen, but this one spooked me very well indeed - and I watched it in the middle of a bright, sunny day. The Eye tells a good story and tells it well, with strong characters and genuine scares. It is never dull or cheap or overly dramatic. Highly HIGHLY recommended!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful film with flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, "The Eye" is a competent effort from HK cinema. While most HK films nowadays involve big pop stars in pointless romantic comedies, this film (and also Infernal Affairs) show that there are still talented filmmakers in HK.The story is about a blind girl named Mun getting a cornea transplant. When she gets her vision back, she begins seeing supernatural beings (ghosts, to be precise). For the first half of the story, we see her experiencing all these haunting encounters. One notable scene is in an elevator. The mystery and creepiness in this first half is incredibly effective and well-made.The same cannot be said about the second half though. Like "The Ring" (or "Ringu"), Mun travels to Thailand to figure out the origin of the owner of her cornea. What starts out as a supernatural thriller turns into a mystery.The film seems to be a mix of "The Sixth Sense", "Ringu", and a touch of "Final Destination." The switch of style in the middle and toward the end is somewhat annoying. The ending is an effort of the directors to show that they can do big CGI action sequences too. But, this film would have been good enough to stand on its own without that.The acting is pretty good. Angelica Lee as Mun is very believable. The same cannot be said about the doctor though. I think this is mostly because his character's motivations are not convincing enough. Why does he give up his whole career to travel all the way to Thailand to help her after meeting her for a few times only? For love? Probably...but I don't buy it at all.Overall, this film is pretty good. It is a nice effort from promising directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent little horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good little Asian horror film that I would definitely recommend renting or even buying, if you like foreign films. A young blind woman receives a cornea transplant and soon finds out that she got way more than she bargained for when she starts being visited by some very unhappy dead souls. It's not very original, true, but the acting is good, the lead character (played by Angelica Lee, is that her name?) is adorable, as is the little girl who plays Ying Ying; there is some serious tension and dread here, especially in the first half hour. The scene in the hospital hallway had my skin trying to crawl off my body, as well as the "Why are you sitting in my chair?" scene. We're talking serious chills. Some of the music IS a bit cheesy and over the top, but hey, you can't have everything, right? The scenes where we see through Mun's eyes in the first few minutes are very effective; we know someone is standing there, we just don't know who it is, and we feel her fear and uncertainty. Not the best movie ever made, but it's definitely worth seeing.Before I close, I would like to respond to the attitude expressed here by some people that American films are all stupid, and that American filmgoers are all drooling idiots who have to see a throat slashed every few minutes in order to be engaged by a movie. When you make comments like that, you really show how ignorant you are when it comes to American cinema, as some of the finest movies ever made came right out of Hollywood, and no they aren't all slasher films or mindless teen comedies. But then I'm sure you folks already know that, you just want to feel intellectually superior to others. I enjoy a good foreign film, and so do many Americans, but just because they're foreign doesn't mean they're perfect. They have flaws just like any other human effort, so please get over yourselves and try to watch movies with an open mind, because you'll enjoy them much more that way. That's just my two cents.Watch this movie, it's good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Excellent Alternative to Mainstream Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are already several comments left, but what the hey, I liked this movie and I'm gonna have my 10p worth.Before I mention the movie itself, I'd better comment on modern Asian movies that reach Western shores, and the fact that they have different pacing, priorities and styles to what you would see at the cinema. The fact that a lot of people don't 'get' the parts of this film which seem to have no relevance is probably as much due to the difference in culture more than any wrongdoing on the production team's behalf. The same can be said for a lot of Hong Kong comedies, the 'humour' which would probably illicit a wry laugh back home flies miles over everybody else's head.In that sort of circumstance, I've developed a good trick, I switch-off trying to figure out what all these little hints and gestures mean and concentrate on the character interactions and the scares. I've had a lot of practice, Western cinema in recent years has been guilty of 'rambling', and they've got no such excuse as 'cultural differences' ;)Anyway, the movie! (good grief!), the plot's already been explained and probed, so I won't go into that. What this film has is a constant 'pressure', a claustrophobic atmosphere which persists regardless of the location. Clever camera work afoot! The palpable distance which the heroine feels from her family and the people around her (perhaps a symptom of not being able to communicate non-verbally with them so long? Perhaps not, but it's there) is always there too. You get the impression that she could be surrounded by a crowd and still walk alone from one side of a city to the other.The smaller roles are played out very nicely, great acting considering the film concentrates almost solely on the two main characters.The ending is a little bit of a let-down, predictable and not entirely 'working'. But, BUT, it isn't a catastrophe which ruins the film, which I'm sure you'll know what I mean. The ending of a film is what you're left with when you switch off the TV, and if it's bad, then so is the film.This movie is the only one in recent years which actually gave me a start, and that's something. Real horror isn't about dripping guts and hooks with heads on them, it's about the unexpected, it's about being confronted with something terrifying, something which makes you wish the character was elsewhere. In order to achieve that, you need to give a damn about the character in the first place, which is where 90% of cheap horrors fall down. Not here, the characters are likable and have a little childlike innocence about them, you want to get in there and slap the more unpleasant visitors :PAll in all, I very much enjoyed watching this film, and intend to buy it when I find it for a pittance (almost all DVDs can be found for the right price at one time or another, shop around and ask people where they get their bargains). I would heartily recommend renting before buying, however. As several have mentioned already, there are several elements of this film which seem to have been deliberately copied from recent films such as Sixth Sense. If that prospect leaves a sour taste, I'd look elsewhere, but everyone else who hasn't had enough of all that yet should certainly have a look :DThanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrificly horrifying movie experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. This movie completely caught me off-guard. It had been lying on my shelf for months, some friend gave it to me and since I don't usually watch much films made outside U.S. I hadn't really given much thought for it. When I finally got around watching it, man was I scared...I'm not going into plot, you can probably read more from other comments and from the web but the effect this movie had on me - I didn't sleep last night. The Mood. I can't even remember when was the last time (or how old I was) when I wanted to close my eyes and not watch the screen. The Eye did that. This movie is SCARY and CREEPY. Lee Sin-Je does amazingly talented acting portraying the role of Mun, blind girl who has got her sight back. And now with her new vision, she starts seeing things... Let me warn you, the first scene when she sees something she shouldn't - you might just wet your pants. I was scared s***less every time she was seeing something, and I'm not that easy to scare. The Eye has much of the same with 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Others' but goes way beyond, simply with the mood. In this movie - at least for me - everything fell for place. Directing, shooting, editing, lighting, soundtrack &amp; sound effects (really check these out!) - just simply amazing - Hollywood pay attention !I guess one of the reasons this experience was so eerie was that the spoken language was Chinese, so I understood what was going on because of the subtitles, but the mumblings and other horrible voices were 'not familiar' to me, it made the movie even more scary. I know this review is a bit weird, but it's written by a guy who's still messed up from yesterday by The Eye. I'm checking the closets, looking over my shoulder. I'm still scared as hell.If you ever have a chance - check out The Eye. Turn off the lights, put a little more volume on your speakers than usual - and prepare to be SCARED. 10+ !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Corneal Transplant from the Twilight Zone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the first time that a movie where the main character gets corneal transplants which not only make her see, but give her paranormal capabilities has been done. A good reference is BLINK, where Madeleine Stowe was the receiver of the creepy transplants, suddenly able to see events from the past, and future. Here, the main character, Mun (Angelica Lee), a blind violinist, receives the transplants. Slowly, albeit a little too slowly, she becomes aware that aside from being able to see the world for the first time, she can also see the souls of the recently departed who also seem oddly attracted to her. That she eventually sees the owner of the eyes (a girl about her age) through her own reflection is an interesting, but not especially shocking twist, but her plight to Thailand to track down the mystery behind the girl and what she finds there does generate some needed tension.With this film, the Pang brothers only add to the growing statement that Asian horror is on the rise. While this is probably not the most memorable of the lot, it does have its own style, which is deliberately slow, much like THE SIXTH SENSE. The way these ghosts appear to her echo that film in tone and dread, and there are no sudden shocks here. Angelica Lee, with a totally expressive face, conveys the horror, and then determination, of a girl caught under a remarkable circumstance without betraying her own character development. The only sequence which rings false -- or forced, as to bring some impact -- is where she runs through the streets knowing that disaster is about to strike in the form of a gasoline tank, banging at car windows. I feel that THE EYE didn't need this sequence to be a chiller -- it kept reminding me of the similar climactic sequence in THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES --, and is the one point that detracts from the films honesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Eye"(2002)has to be one of the creepiest horror movies I have seen this year.The "transplant gone awry" concept has been done before-just check out "Body Parts"(1991)or the third story in the horror anthology "Body Bags"(1993),but the Pang Brothers created extremely eerie psychological horror with plenty of genuine scares.Angelica Lee is excellent as a young girl named Mun.Her numerous and extremely creepy encounters with the spirits Mun sees are filled with excellent use of sound.The conclusion is amazing and totally unexpected.The film is very scary and uncanny-it actually reminds me a bit Japanese horror hit "Ringu"(1998).Check it out,if you dare.9 out of 10.The elevator scene blew me away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much a Scare Fest than a decent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About three months ago, I was paging through cable and found a film that looked intriguing. After watching for about five minutes I had the pants scared off of me, so, being the complete wuss I am, I turned it off. Curiosity made me want to go back to it, of course, so about twenty minutes later I got up the guts to turn it back on. After about two minutes, I was full on terrified, and turned it off for good. I told some friends about this film, and all seemed intrigued, mainly because of the scare factor, so this weekend we got around to finally watching it. That movie of course, was the Pang Brothers' "The Eye", a film that ended up being something completely different than what I was expecting.In "The Eye", Wong Kar Mun (Lee) is a young blind woman who gets a corneal transplant. Soon after her operation, as her eyes are adjusting, she begins to see some pretty scary images; shadowy black figures hanging around people who later die, dead people themselves, and her room keeps doing a pesky trick where it changes on her as she's looking at it, furniture and all. Her doctor, Dr. Lo (a really young looking Edmund Chen) doesn't believe her at first, but then realizes that there may be some merit to her claims, so they go in search of the donor in order to find out what history her eyes' previous owner had, and what kind of baggage Wong Kar Mun has to deal with now.Based on my first impressions of the film, I was actually expecting a big scare fest like "The Grudge"; short on story, big on scares. What I actually realized is that the two parts that I briefly watched were actually two out of the three genuinely scary parts of the film. (The elevator scene was enough to make me take the stairs today at work, seriously.) The rest of the film is certifiably creepy, but there is actually a decent story to support those creepy parts. "The Eye" has no doubt been compared to "The Sixth Sense" in terms of theme, but it is also similar in substance as well. Even without the scares, the film would be able to stand on its other merits. Some of the special effects in "The Eye" were kind of cheesy (basically Sci-Fi channel made-for-cable television caliber) and in typical Chinese film fashion, the music was horrible, but all told, it is a decent film.After doing a little reading on the film, I saw that Tom Cruise's production company bought the rights to the film and are planning a remake. I'm not very educated on Asian horror films and their American remakes, (yet) but I think I would see it just out of mere curiosity, because I would imagine that they would take this relatively small film and mess with it to make it "bigger". "The Eye" is definitely worth checking out because while it definitely scared the pants off of me a couple of times, the rest of the film was really was worth sticking around to see how it all would end. 6/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Scary Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Hong Kong, the eighteen years old Wong Kar Mun (Lee Sin-je) has been blind since she was two years old. She submits to a surgery of cornea transplantation, and while recovering from the operation, she realizes that she is seeing dead people. With the support of Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou), Mun tries to find who was the donor of her eyes and resolve the mystery of her visions."Jian gui" is really a very scary movie. Without being gore, the Pang brothers use visual and sound effects to create a frightening atmosphere. The result is magnificent and I really appreciated this film a lot. The first half of the story is amazingly scary, with the ghosts and the shadow man surprising Mun and the viewers. I was watching this movie alone late of the night, in a very dark ambient, and I startled many times. I really believe that fans like me of "Haunted", "The Sixth Sense", "The Others", "Ringu" and "El Espinazo del Diablo" will like this movie, which I include among my favorite ghost stories. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "The Eye ? A Herança" ("The Eye ? The Heritage")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent horror film with a weak ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mun (Angelica Lee) is a young woman who has been blind since she was two years old. A cornea replacement surgery offers hope of being able to see. But once Mun's vision is restored, she gets more than she bargained for. She is bombarded with images of places and people that don't quite seem right. Mun sees ghosts. But that's not the worst of it. When presented with a picture of herself, Mun realizes that the image in the picture is not the same woman she sees when she looks in the mirror.The first half or so of The Eye is an incredibly creepy little film. There are moments like the elevator scene or the first time we see what Mun sees in the mirror that had me sitting on the edge of my seat. It's all very nicely handled. But the film switches its narrative tone about half way through much to its detriment. The Eye goes from being a subtle, effective horror film to being a special effects extravaganza. The Pang Brothers appear to have the same problem ending a movie that a lot of Hollywood filmmakers seem to have ? if you can't come up with an ending, blow something up. Had the movie ended when Mun discovered the secret of her new eyes, it would have been a better movie and worthy of a higher rating.The acting in The Eye is as good as I've seen in a modern Asian horror film. I've only seen Angelica Lee in one other film (Koma), but she's quickly become a real favorite of mine. The two roles I've seen her play are vastly different yet Lee handles each in a believable, very enjoyable way.While The Eye may not be the best Asian horror film I've seen, the first half makes it more than a worthwhile watch. I'm looking forward to getting a chance to see The Eye 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wong Kar Mun went blind at the age of two, 18 years later she undergoes a cornea transplant that appears to be a success. Unfortunately that success comes with a terrifying side-effect; the ability to see unhappy ghosts??.Gin Gwai (The Eye) is directed by the Pang brothers Oxide and Danny and stars Angelica Lee (Mun) and Lawrence Chou (Dr.Wah) as the two main principals.No matter what source of reference you use for film reviews, one thing that can be guaranteed as regards Gin Gwai is how divided people are on it. One of the few things that most tend to agree on tho is that it's visual flourishes are nothing short of fantastic. And they are. Blended with the editing, music, sound, camera-work and the effects, it therefore fuels the fire of those calling it style over substance. It's also fair to drop onside with those folk decrying its over familiarity with its central themes. If you have seen Irvin Kershner' The Eyes Of Laura Mars, Michael Apted's Blink and M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, well you wont be watching anything new thematically here. But the Pang brothers have crafted a thoroughly engrossing, menacing and nerve gnawer of a film, one that delivers chills and scares for the discerning horror sub-genre fan.Here's the crux of the matter with Gin Gwai, it is the opposite side of the Asian horror coin to the likes of the blood letting Audition. This is pure and simply for those not in need of murder death kill to fulfil their horror needs. I was creeped out immensely by this film because the ghost and supernatural side of horror is what really works for me, as long as it is done effectively. To which Gin Gwai most assuredly is. The various scenes shift from ethereal unease to hold your breath terror, from classrooms to lifts, to hospital wards, the brothers Pang, with beautiful technical expertise, held me over a precipice of dread. Even the opening credits are inventive and have the ability to send a cautionary shiver down ones spine. There's a barely formed, and pointless, romantic angle that marks it down a point, but as the blistering (literally) last quarter assaults the senses, so as the time for reflection arrives, Gin Gwai ends up being one of the this decades best horror pictures. To me at least. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World Class Stylishness, But Overall A Disappointing Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Eye ...SpoilersFirst blush reaction to this film, while it was on, is that it would never have been made without the conceptual model provided by The Sixth Sense. Our heroine does indeed "see dead people" and like the tragic little kid in that seminal thriller, her gift of seeing that which 99.99% of the people can't see is a life- and mind-threatening curse. Her sanity is soon enough questioned by herself and those who love her, cranking up the angst factor already established by floating corpses following her, and her glimpses of flickering black specters mutely leading people away at the time of their death.There, the similarity of copy to pattern pretty much ends.Like the American 'The Ring' ('can't speak for the Japanese original) this film rather too quickly and completely breaks down into a mundane investigative procedural, just when the mind-bendingly creepy stuff is beginning to really take hold of the film. (The rationale for the eerie stuff, for this viewer, anyway, could have come off any of a number of made-for-TV films of the supernatural from the 70s and 80s. It's that tame and lame.)Maybe no rationale could be as strong as what is implied in the early going of this film, as the heroine's world reels off its axis into darkness. But I believe it could be as strong, and these filmmakers simply failed to crack the code. Aside from questions about the strength of the rationale here, why feel at all that you have to halt an over-the-top experience for the cut-and-dried sense-making of a standard detective story? --Do all supernatural films cry out for Scooby Doo-style windups? Understand, unlike the old Scoob toons, this film stays true to it's supernatural premise. But the rationale for what is happening feels alternately too vague or too specific in the wrong places, rings false, and eventually sinks beneath detective story rationalizing to big tears-for-the-heroine soap opera bathos. By this point, if you are like me, you will feel real pity, not for the heroine, but for the Pang Brothers for beginning their nifty little film with such atmosphere and style, only to miss several turns and wind up Nowheresville.In the final analysis, this film's trouble is one common to most 'entertainment' films today: a slam-bang setup, one that sells the film to producers and studio and audience, and may be the films sole reason for existing, disintegrating because of a pathetically weak follow-through. Wild hook concepts are neat, but they're not enough. The most promising joke, burdened by a let-down punchline, isn't worth starting to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another overrated Asian horror "classic". Disappointing but still worth watching. (Warning! Spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible spoilers ahead)The hype surrounding the mediocre letdown 'Ringu' has overshadowed the fact that there has been some really impressive horror/SF/suspense movies emanating from Asia in the last few years ('Audition', 'Gemini', 'Wild Zero', 'Freezer', and 'Hypnosis' are a handful of titles that immediately spring to mind). I really hoped the much hyped 'The Eye' would be another first class example, but sadly it was a major disappointment. Not as disappointing as 'Ringu' itself, but still, nowhere near as good as I'd hoped. The Pang brothers ('Bangkok Dangerous') have a lot of visual flair, and Angelica Lee gives a very good performance, but the script was mundane and quickly runs out of steam in the second half. The spectacular climax helps somewhat, but overall it is quite an unsatisfying movie. There are some creepy and atmospheric moments in the first half of the film, but descriptions of it being "the scariest movie since 'The Exorcist'" are absolutely ridiculous, and can only help create a negative reaction. Also, one thing that really niggled at me throughout - a cornea transplant enabling the recipient to see the dead is something I can accept in a horror film, but to HEAR them too is a bit on the silly side! Anyway, despite 'The Eye's flaws I still found it to be more interesting and entertaining than 'Ringu'. I just wish the Pang brothers had spent more time on the script which really dragged this one down. I must say that looking at this movie and 'Bangkok Dangerous' they do show a lot of potential and may end up making something truly extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember a while back someone suggesting to me to go see this film, and although it took me a while, I'm glad I finally saw it. Overall I kinda liked the general look of the film. It didn't really have that creepy, "somethings going to jump out at you any second during the entire film" vibe that The Ring, Ringu and The Grudge had, which was actually a nice change because when those "fright" scenes happened the creepiness was actually increased quite a bit. I love the actors chosen too, especially the lead. She did a terrific job and didn't annoy me at all in the film. I have to admit to a few "cheesy" spots throughout it, but for what was lacking in the script was made up for in the direction. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Have you seen my report card".To have such a simple line bringing with it an utterly terrifying chill is an achievement in itself. Don't believe me? Go see it for yourself.Take my word for it, this truly scary flick will trigger fear you don't know you possessed. Its phantasmic moods and imagery will linger in the dark recesses of your mind long after its final reels ended.Not since "The Ring" has a horror film incited such twisted dread and rampant imagination amongst its viewers. You can't quite place it, but THE EYE will definitely scare you silly with its uniquely Asian sensibilities and haunting sequences. Look out for the "Lift and Stairs" segment. It'll leave you gasping. As an added bonus not present in most horror films, "The Eye" is also not content with scaring you silly. It also had many poignant elements thrown in for good measure. Issues explored included meditation on the role of fate and pre-destination and the strength of kinship. All these made it very harder for me to reconcile with the gnawing fear it instilled in me and the genuinely heartfelt emotions it sneaked in the process. In conclusion, this is one of the most unforgettable film of the year.And you have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on the Fantasy Filmfest in Frankfurt and it is surely a new milestone in the History of Movies. Such a good story combined with an extreme atmosphere, hasn't be seen yet! Sure, The Sixth Sense was a phenomenal movie and The Eye is the same league, but this movie goes three steps forward. If you think, no movie can top Sixth Sense, than you are very wrong. Look at this Film, and you will get more than you ever expected. It only happens once a year, that you get such an experience. Watch this one, if you are a Horror and Thrillerfan. Amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the honor to watch THE EYE at the german first night in Muinch:THE EYE is no simple and bloody scary movie. It's an intelligent First-Class-Suspense-Thriller like THE 6th SENSE and THE OTHERS. Especially the first part of the movie is really scary. There the audience just can see blurred pictures in the same way as the leading actor. So you can understand the permanent feeling of insecurity. Additional the leading actor (Angelica Lee) and the perfect timing of the sound-effects intensify the thrill. Unfortunately the last part of the movie offers no new conclusions or surprising turns. So the melodramatic end is easy to predict. But nevertheless THE EYE is an innovative Thriller which has no reasons to hide (from the big ones).In addition: I nominate THE EYE for the best opening in a motion picture!PS: Sorry for my bad (poor) English! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very interested in the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. While it had some good features, for the most part I found this movie to be heavy handed, predictable, and, worst of all, not in the least bit scary. The first 30 minutes of the movie were promising, the actress did a nice job in her portrayal, and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful. Unfortunately, from there, the movie entered into a downward spiral. I went into this movie with no clue as to what it would be about-- didn't know anything about the actors, directors, genre, etc. At a certain point, my wife made the comment "is this supposed to be a scary movie?". Well I suppose so, as the boiler-plate "horror movie" score full of squeaking violins and extended vibrato could mean nothing else. There didn't seem to be a whole lot of originality in the movie, the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment, and the second half of the movie descended deep into the realm of the ridiculous. A movie like this walks a dangerously narrow path, and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer must decide whether to continue walking along that path, or to jump off and simply laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. For the final 30 minutes, I chose the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow creeping film, mixing great Japanese horror with poor Hollywood type script direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Japanese horror, as well as the foreign film scene as a whole (and by foreign I mean non-Hollywood), I was excited at the prospect of seeing this movie. I wasn't disappointed, well for the most part anyway. It opens strongly, with a narrative style, as the young blind woman receives her eye transplants. As her sight returns we are greeted with the traditional Japanese style of under stated shock and horror. Creeping dread. As we are treated to the sights of blurred, unfocused figures and images, only the music and the subtle camera movements to tell us something is wrong. Soon, however, her seeing returns and we are treated to a more tangible horror, and yet it is still treated with careful hands and controlling care. There are shocks aplenty, and a few quiet scares that are hardly noticeable, but when you do, boy do they freak you out! Unfortunately, as it is with many Hollywood films nowadays, the ending is what lets this film down. During the latter half of the film, the focus turns from the slow horror to a plot that most of us have seen before, and we are dealt a final sequence that seems unconnected and distant from the rest of the movie. With no discernable conclusion or understanding to come from the film, you're left with a feeling of a wasted movie, with such promise from the rest of the story. Still, perhaps this is a sign of a reversal of the movie syndrome to date, a foreign film that doesn't quite make it at the end, has now been bought by Hollywood, perhaps they could turn it around. Still, I would recommend seeing this version now, some of the scenes will have you totally creeped out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gin Gwai, or The Eye as it's more commonly know amongst English speaking audiences, is set in Hong Kong &amp; tells the story of a young woman named Wong Kar Mun (Angelica Lee) who has been blind since she was 2 years old. She has a cornea transplant &amp; for the first time in years she is able to see, however her new eye's become a curse as she sees more than she should. She is able to see the souls of the dead all around her &amp; shadowy figures which lead them away, after waiting all these years to be able to see again Wong Kar Mun is haunted by what she sees. Was the operation really worth it &amp; whose cornea's does she have exactly?This Hong Kong, British &amp; Singapore co-production was edited, co written &amp; directed by Oxide Pang Chun &amp; Danny Pang as the Pang Brothers &amp; in my opinion this is yet another overrated Asain horror ghost story which didn't do much for at all. The script by the Pang Brothers &amp; Jo Jo Yuet-chun Hui feels like The Sixth Sense (1999) &amp; I couldn't get the scene of Haley Joel Osment saying the infamous line 'I see dead people' out of my head as that's basically the whole plot of Gin Gwai in a rather literal sense. Personally I thought it was a touch slow going at times, I thought it was repetitive &amp; just didn't really hook or interest me much at all. I found the character's dull, the dialogue simple, I thought it was very predictable &amp; the so-called twist parallel type ending sucked. I'm sorry but I just couldn't get into the film at all &amp; I was glad when it finished which is never a good sign.Director's the Pang Brothers do OK, they use a variety of annoying techniques like skipping frames, changing from colour to black and white &amp; all the other editing &amp; camera tricks we've all seen loads of times before. I hear how lots of people say how scary Gin Gwai is, it may be to some but I thought it was pretty lame in the scares department as the ghosts don't really do anything, there's no excitement, no tension &amp; no atmosphere either. I certainly didn't have any problems sleeping last night after I saw it. Gin Gwai relies on storytelling to get it's point across so don't expect any gore or special effects as there aren't any.Technically the film is OK, I only saw it a few hours ago &amp; I can barely remember a single scene from it so that says everything really. The acting is hard to judge as everyone speaks in different languages.Gin Gwai didn't do a thing for me to be honest, it's watchable I suppose &amp; tells a story but I'm not a fan. Followed by Gin Gwai 2 (2004), Gin Gwai 10 (2005) &amp; Gin Gwai 3 (2008). Remade by Bollywood as Naina (2005) &amp; Hollywood as the soon to be released The Eye (2007).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ghosts are perfect fodder for horror movies, but they are rarely depicted as chilling or creepy. Most ghost movies are filled with stingers, CGI, and are neutered by a PG-13 rating. The Eye, however, creeps up on you (pun intended) and will make the hairs on your arms stand on end.A young girl, blind from the age of 2, is given a cornea transplant and slowly adjusts to being able to see again. But she sees beyond our world and is haunted by the spirits of the dead in her Hong Kong neighborhood. The movement, behavior, and appearances of the ghosts are just mesmerizing. THIS is how you do ghost movies. I also liked the shadow people, moving as blurs, guiding the recently dead into the afterlife. Twin writer/directors Danny and Oxide Pang have pulled off one of the best horror films in the past decade and have done it with more integrity than M. Night Shyamalan.The Eye is not a slick, high-key film. It is shot in a rough, gritty texture that reminds me of late-80s horror such as Hellraiser and Paperhouse. It's a far more appropriate and engaging aesthetic than anything offered by Platinum Dunes or Dark Castle. There is a Hollywood remake, made in 200 but I couldn't care less about it. The 2002 HK version is the way to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main issue with this is its ending. Its last third makes it into a mystery rather than a thriller, and though the backstory is great and "works", the resolve feels awkward... and it is. Maybe they didn't have any solid ideas for how to close it. Once it does reach its conclusion, it uncomfortably transforms into Final Destination and tries to wow us, becoming bombastic and out of touch with everything that precedes this portion. Still interested? I'm relieved to hear that. You see, that's really the only outright negative thing I can say about this. It's immensely creepy, beginning so right from the start(seriously, that credits sequence... if I'd watched this at the cinema, it would have sent severe chills down my spine). Lee portrays a blind person extremely convincingly, and this puts us inside her head some, through the editing and cinematography(which is all really well-done and fits, with carefully chosen angles, selective distortion, etc.). I have not caught a lot of Asian horror, because I'm not big on ghosts(and they are; their films about them are, thankfully, sophisticated and not crude, the way the mainstream Western ones tend to be), and, well, there are cultural differences, and I find that it distracts me from taking in the picture. Subtitles don't bother me(I vastly prefer them to dubbing). Anyway, they are growing on me, and what I have noted is the strong focus on the senses, and on the ability to "see" the other side, where spirits and demons are believed(in Japan) to live. The approach to terrifying us is subtle(as are most of the FX, and those are excellent, other than the handful that are somewhat crappy), building up gradually, using atmosphere and mood, seldom going for jump-scares. The sound-side is quite important, and it is skillfully done. There are a few clichés(and brief shameless product placement), but on the whole, the writing is good. The characters are credible, and the main one is affable, and her relationship with Ying Ying sweet. This also fits in what too many in the genre neglect... genuine emotion, impact that does not have to do with the monsters. It is actually partially a drama, and it provides food for thought(as well as cheese and corn). This was on sale with its direct sequel and the American remake. I'll be reviewing those two, in that order, the next two days. This one sets the bar fairly high. There is a bit of disturbing content and brief violence in this. I recommend this to any fan of this type of movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~The Eye is one of the original properties that was responsible for getting everyone excited over Asian horror. I remember liking the film the first time I saw it, however, watching it now I find that it's a bit boring. Well, the first half of the film is still engaging, but the latter is tedious and uninteresting to me. In the beginning of the film, we find 20 year old Mun, who has been blind for most of her life, has just had a successful cornea transplant. The operation allows her to see once again. But this new sight is more than she bargained for. She now has the ability, or curse, to see apparitions. There are some genuinely creepy moments where Mun is discovering that she can see ghosts. One involving an elevator is downright unnerving. When Mun decides to find out who the donor of her cornea was, the film turns into a kind of supernatural mystery and doesn't offer up anymore chills. That's where they went wrong. The Pang Brothers have a knack for generating some good scares. Unfortunately thus far they've put those scares into sub-par films (i.e. The Eye 2 and The Messengers). If you like films such as the original Shutter, you will probably find something to like here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gin Gwai is one of the most often cited examples of good recent Asian Horror, and now I know why. Starring the beautiful Angelica Lee as a blind girl - Mun - who undergoes a cornea transplant and begins to have terrifying visions while her doctor tries to help.I didn't find this particularly scary and there are but a few jump out of your seat moments. But this film is more in the atmospheric and supernatural realm, and all the better for it. There aren't many twists here, as this movie really plays by the rules of Asian horror, with the exception of the ending, which I really liked.This movie gets extra creepy points for a certain scene in a train and also because of recent news about people who have undergone transplants and seemingly acquiring some of the donors' personality traits. Now I've been hearing about stuff from cell memory to ectoplasmic attachments, from scientists. So this movie might not be that far-fetched after all. My only real complaint was some very unnecessary (and obviously fake) gore near the ending. Other than that, it's a worth watching (but a bit over-hyped) effort for Horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Eye" is a thriller about a blind girl who gets a successful cornea transplant and regains her eyesight.But she begins to see strange things around her as she opens her eyes.These strange things include supernatural beings, dead people. May sound like a rip off of The Sixth sense, but strictly speaking, this is the only premise that is similar to The Sixth Sense.The rest of the story is different. I don't want to spoil any of it, but would like to state that the first half is more like a horror movie, while the second half seems like a melodramatic ghost story.All in all, it is a pretty decent flick. Not excellent, not very bad either. The cinematography could have been better."The Eye" has been shamelessly copied, scene-to-scene in a Bollywood (India) movie called "Naina". Please avoid "Naina" if at all you were planning on seeing it and try and procure a copy of "The Eye".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The flagman of Asian Horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, the horror lovers like myself, felt the refreshing, beautiful, and terrifying wave of asian horror movies. They are definetly too distant from the western ones, mostly in vision, acting, and budget (ofcorse). But I personally think, that when speaking of vision, atmosphere and horror itself, Asian Horror movies are way better than the rest. Good examples are movies like Ringu, Tale of Two Sisters, Dark Water, Battle Royale, Oodishon and defenetely The Eye.***SPOILERS AHEAD***The movie came like a cold shower for me. I really expected much from the trailer, and the movie managed not only to match my expectation, but also, it exceeded them. I was shocked by the great vision, the powerful acting, the realy wicked and pure horror scenes...There are scenes you'll hold your breath, like the elevator scene, where I felt real and unrefined fear in the expression of Mun. There was no overacting, no crying, just the chilling and breathtaking fear. The sounds in the scene with the old lady in the corridor were terrific. I felt here standing right beside me, moaning with that terrible voice. And I almost fell of my chair when the girl in the caligraphic school flew towards Mun. Truly memorable scenes, I only wish there were more.Definitely, the plot isn't original at all. Everyone has the right to blame the makers for copying the main idea, about the dead struggling to find help, so they can have their peace, from the great Shayamalan's Sixth Sense. But have in mind, this is something like an urban legend, not something Shayamalan just made up. Also, I felt the ending was exactly like the one in The Mothman Prophecies, which bugged me. But then I realized. that both movies came out in about the same time, so accusing the directors and screenwriters in stealing is sort of foolish. And even if the movie is a mixture of already seen stuff, it's still a great example of good and cheap movie making.***END OF SPOILERS***So, good acting, great vision, astonishing atmosphere, perfect sounding, interesting, yet not that original plot. Overall, I would say it's a must see for horror lovers, and worth watching for all others, that value aesthetic and non-blockbuster movies like this one.Doom's evaluation - 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2002 was the Year of "I See Dead People" for the Hong Kong film industry. There was a slew of film, all cashing in on the same premise, but THE EYE is surely the best of the bunch, owing in no small part to a starring turn by lead Angelica Lee, who continues to make waves by picking two great films back to back. (Her other movie was PRINCESS D.)THE EYE was frightening to behold, and it takes a lot to scare me. But the film's first hour is one of the best I've seen. Although the second half is a bit of a let down, travelling down the path already mined by THE SIXTH SENSE, making the comparison inevitable. Too bad, because THE EYE was really a good movie up to this point.As it stands, THE EYE is still an excellent film, with enough scares in the first hour to last 2 movies. And Angelica Lee shines.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Eye is a good film, but it drags on occasion and never really delivers on some of the frights that it suggests. Perhaps the difference is a cultural one, although the film does suggest that Asian cultures are much more adept at dealing with death than those cultures in the West.When protagonist Mun's neighbor continually asks for his report card, or even eats the ceremonial candles that his family has burned in his memory, it comes off less haunting and more like the actions of a goofy middle schooler, as does the strange tongue flicking of a woman who comes back to haunt her husband's food stand.And the ending seems extremely contrived, bearing more than a passing resemblance to the conclusion of "The Mothman Prophecies. Stylish and aesthetically rich, The Eye is but another in the recent trend toward visual horror at the expense of truly frightening content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is only after seeing the trailer for the Jessica Alba remake that I found out there was an original Japanese version, and this is it. Basically, blind since the age of two, eighteen year old Wong Kar Mun (Angelica Lee, or Lee Sin-Je) in Hong Kong submits to a surgery of cornea transplantation, i.e. being given new donated eyes, allowing her to have her sight back. Recovering from the surgery, she gets more than she bargained for when she starts seeing apparitions, i.e. dead people, and some of these ghosts are pretty unfriendly. So she begins a journey, with the help of Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou) to find out who donated her new eyes and get rid of these horrible visions. In the end however, she goes to pretty drastic lengths to get rid of seeing the ghosts, I can't remember much, I just know there is an explosive crash, and her eyes end up draining blood. Also starring Chutcha Rujinanon as Ling, Candy Lo as Yee (Mun's Sister), Pierre Ping as Dr. Eak, Yin Ping Ko as Mun's grandmother and Edmund Chen as Dr. Lo. The effects and story, as far as I remember, were quite effective, and it was a stylish psychological and visceral horror thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

Though the plot is fairly straight forward, the movie is really well done, and the Pang brothers have done a masterful job of directing it. The Eye, or Jian gui, has a way of letting you know a frightening scene is coming, slowly leading you into it - as if to say 'Get ready, here it comes', yet still scaring you senseless. Angelica Lee does a wonderful job in the lead role, causing one to actually feel what she is feeling. She even brought me to tears in one scene.

		<fullReview>The internet is a wonderful invention: not only does it allow me to make you read my nonsense, but it's also a huge shopping mall. You know the story: you're bidding on an auction and want to lower the shipping costs by ordering a second DVD. You stumble onto a movie you never heard of and decide to have a go. Eventually you find yourself even more anxious to watch this extra film than the film you ordered in the first place.What made me decide to buy "The Eye" (or "Jian Gui")? The DVD cover may have looked inviting, but it was the story of a girl who, after years of blindness, finally is able to see but sees more than she bargained for, that made me open my wallet again. This was a few months ago and "Jian Gui" had only just been released on DVD in Asia and I had yet to see a review of the film. I eagerly opened the tray of my DVD player and was extremely surprised: I saw a frightening film, one with atmosphere and staggering images.You know how people tend to say that the internet has spoiled movie fun? Movie websites reveal all the trailers and spoilers you want and don't want to know. Before you get a chance to see a movie, the hype is already three steps ahead of you. Movie fans who are a generation older than me have great memories of how unprepared they were when they were confronted by "Night of the Living Dead". After watching "Jian Gui" I know what they mean: it feels great to be unaware of what you're going to see and to be overpowered by what you're witnessing. A few months later I still haven't dared to watch the film a second time: I'm afraid I'll be a bit disappointed even though I know that the movie is good enough to stand a second viewing. I've lent the film to a couple of friends and the worst reaction I've gotten so far is that the film is "good".I do know that the film has some imperfections and if I really wanted to, I could nitpick on some details, but the truth is that I don't want to. The creepy atmosphere, the sudden scares, the beautiful photography... you just can't say this isn't a good film. Because you have no reason to say so and because I won't allow you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a cornea transplant heals her long standing blindness, a young woman sees visions of the dead that lead her into the tragic future. Or is it the past?Good ghost concept diluted by melodrama. Asian horror is so neat with its plot hinges as layers of deception are unfolded, and often it's grim and spooky. Here we have the usual scenario where a sensitive innocent is burdened with the task of uncovering an old injustice. Plenty of character - but too much dialogue, too much romance, as the story bobs about on a slack current.The pace tightens up at the end, only to deliver a false climax followed by an overblown emergency. Music is big, sometimes interesting before descending into plink-plonk piano. The photography messes with the concept of blindness, but fails to create a visual world and relies too much on ramshackle CGI.The performances are OK, and the heroine's mother and the boy with the tumour had good parts. No memorable lines, although it was interesting to see English briefly used in a HK/Thai crossover.Overall, I guess the problem is with the directors/producers, who seem to have bought a good story then splashed it with marketing gunk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly creepy Asian ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another in the new wave of Asian horror which has been wowing foreign audiences in recent years, this follows in the same tradition as RING and DARK WATER in being a subtle, slow-paced and relatively gore-free suspense offering in which the atmosphere is emphasised over more traditional shock moments. The story of the formerly blind girl who sees dead people is nothing new ? and most probably a spin on THE SIXTH SENSE ? but the film's strength is in the original direction from the Pang brothers, who do more with their camera and characters than most Hollywood directors.This is a film that feels fresh and punchy, despite the slowness of the unfolding plot, and it's partly driven by a driving score that keeps the adrenaline going. The first 2/3 of the film sees Mun recovering her vision and at the same time witnessing some distinctively spooky events ? a cold woman floating down the hospital corridor, a suicide boy looking for his report card. So far so good. The finale becomes a driven mystery as Mun, confused by strange visions, explores the background of her donor and finds history repeating itself as she strives to stop a terrible accident from taking place (a very similar situation to the climax of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES).The element which makes this film stand out is the emotion. All of the characters are very well-rounded and the dialogue is very true to life ? painfully so in some instances. The film deals with the topics of death and suicide in mature ways and the attitudes of the characters are extremely well acted. Angelica Lee is wonderful in the leading role, really fleshing out the character of Mun, and the various supports are also excellent in dealing with the serious tone of the film as a whole. There are some stand-out scares (apple-core face in the elevator) and weird bits (the licking ghosts) and even bits that feel like GHOST (Ying Ying being led away). The only let-down in the movie is some dodgy CGI effects work, but again that flaw is seemingly ubiquitous in today's cinematic world. The film's one grisly moment is used in a survey of burnt bodies, but the gore is used for impact and emotion rather than gross-out. Well worth checking for those bored of the usual fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent early Pang Bros effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent Gothic style horror film. It's less about gore and more about slow building tension and a chilling atmosphere. If you're a gore hound, you may be disappointed. If you're a thinking person's horror fan, you'll like it.Gorgeous and talented Wong Kar Mun plays Lee, a young sight impaired Woman given the opportunity by her doctor to receive a cornea transplant. The operation is a success, but horrible at the same time, since it appears to have opened her awareness to the ghosts that live among us. This is a deep seated reality among the Asian Conscience. If you don't believe in ghosts, you may find you are unwilling to suspend your disbelief, although I have shown this movie to friends and even the most cynical atheist was affected by it.So as she is getting used to seeing for the first time, Lee starts seeing shadowy figures on the edge of her awareness. Since her eyes are still becoming reacquainted with sight, this is of course confusing and scary, She isn't sure what she is seeing is real. These figures start to become more and more scarier, and start closing in upon her. The Pang Bros (directors of this film) are really talented at building this sort of unique tension.Her doctor (Edmund Chen) is skeptical, but attempts to ease her stress by helping Lee search for the identity of the eye donor which compounds the dramatic tension toward an excellent ending.This is a great horror film. It's one of the many fantastic low budget horror films to have come out of this region over the last 20 years. If you enjoyed The Sixth Sense, you'll love this film too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not conventionally scary, but a great drama thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film surprised me, as I've always heard mixed reviews of the Pang brothers, but all of my usual streaming services have been giving me problems lately (stupid college wifi) and I noticed that this and the 2008 remake were free on Hulu right now, so I decided: If this video ever loads, why not watch it? Turns out Hulu loads more effectively on my Wifi network than Netflix or Screambox, so I watched this late last night, and I was actually very impressed! The film does have a couple of frightening moments but it functions more as a thriller and drama, led by a nuanced and passionate performance by Angelica Lee, with a solid supporting cast at her side. This film also contains a lot of beautiful imagery, showing the Pang Brothers' eye (HA! yes, pun intended) for visual language. What I was most impressed by was the ending-- figuring out how to end a film of this kind is so difficult, but the Pangs do so with grace and style.All in all, if you're a fan of Asian cinema and haven't seen this yet, check this one out. Now, watch as I prepare to roast the American remake...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since it's almost Halloween, I thought I would write a review on my favorite horror movie ever. I love scary movies, but it's so hard to find any good ones. This movie isn't bloody or gory. There isn't a masked murderer running around, killing everyone. But The Eye is the most frightening movie I have ever seen. It's a psychological type of horror movie. That's what I love about it. No matter how many times I've seen it, I still get freaked out. Please, if you haven't seen this yet, watch it. You can easily find the dubbed version. (VUDU has it). Do not opt for the newer American version with Jessica Alba. It doesn't even compare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying that this original Hong Kong version of The Eye is MUCH better than the remake that stars the useless Jessica Alba, and is much creepier also.I'd actually seen the remake before seeing this original version, and while I thought it was OK, I couldn't get into it because of Alba. Having now recently watched this original version, there's no doubt which one I thought was better.Ringu was good. Ju-on was good. Dark Water was good. The Eye, however, surpasses those, and is definitely the best Asian horror film that I've seen to date. I loved everything about this film, and even the acting was really good (which is sometimes one of the things that ISN'T good about these films). The music score was excellent adding to what was already a creepy atmosphere; the story was intriguing and well written; and the cinematography was well executed, bringing us some great shots especially during the more creepier scenes.Speaking of creepy scenes, The Eye has some of the best I've seen in a horror movie for quite a while, and I think the only recent movies to match atmosphere and true tension for me was Sinister, Insidious, and As Above, So Below. The scare scenes in this film WILL freak you out. I mean just to name two alone...the hospital corridor with the older woman and elevator scenes. I defy anyone to watch those scenes and not feel at least a little uneasy.CGI is usually very minimal in Asian horrors, and it's no different in The Eye with the majority of the SFX coming in the last few scenes of the movie. There are the odd moments CGI used for the scarier scenes, but they're really used as "touch up" techniques, so it's not as if this is a CGI-fest, which is good as practical effects can actually be scarier if done right, which they are here.I honestly can't speak highly enough for this film, and if you enjoy Asian horror, like the films I mentioned earlier, then you (should) enjoy The Eye.Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm a wimp. This was NOTHING.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's put aside the fact that this film has some creepy moments but zero actual scares. Sorry, I jumped all throughout The Grudge and I knew while I was jumping that it was a terrible film. This didn't scare me. Noroi? Crapped my pants. This? I was laughing two thirds of the way through. Why?Because I just might nominate this film for most contrived ending of all time. Even disregarding the sheer amount of plot devices this film borrowed (Angel Heart and Jacob's Ladder are all over this film), the last third was absolutely dumbfounding. My jaw was on the floor from the sheer melodrama of it all. I saw this film on lists with Ju-on, Ringu, and a few other notable J-scarers, but boy, if this scared you, Ringu will literally kill you. For the record, Ringu didn't scare me either. Not like the American remake did. But that's a whole other can of worms.The Eye suffers from a serious dollop of schmaltz. Romantic subplot? Check. Ridiculously cheery classical piano music? Check. A "things are back to normal and I've gone through a lot but learned even more and everything's fine now" ending? Check.And hey presto, to top the whole thing off, a story with more plot holes than a cemetery after a tornado. And these aren't plot holes that film enthusiasts (not buffs, that denotes some sort of effort) will only catch and not the average viewer. You'd have to be awfully close to blind yourself to not be asking yourself some serious questions at the end of this film. Like, "What'd they use to make those fire effects, MS Paint?" or "Was the test audience for this movie a bunch of old women that said something along the lines of 'You really oughta include a series of flashback shots interleaved with shots of the present so that viewers won't get confused as to the already-obvious story arc similarities'?"Not a good horror movie, not a good thriller. If you want to look at it as a film about a woman struggling post eye surgery that was actually insane the whole time, maybe that's a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why Are You Sitting In My Chair?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess to some slight disappointment with the Pang Brothers' 2002 offering, "The Eye," but only because of the great buildup that one of my film bibles, "DVD Delirium 2," has given it. "A surfeit of perturbing imagery and sound...among the best genre fare to emerge from Hong Kong in the last decade...creepy, moving and truly shocking...unforgettably disturbing," the writers in this usually dependable guide tell us. Well, I did not find the film to be "all that," but a second viewing, with lowered expectations, revealed that the picture still does have lots to offer. In it, we meet a pretty young violinist, Mun (excellently played by Lee Sin-Je), who had been blind since the age of 2. A cornea transplant not only restores her vision, but, as a bonus, allows her to see the spirits of the recently departed, as well as the shadowy conductors of the newly dead, and foresee when those people will die. Along with her therapist, Mun investigates the mystery of her donor and tries to avert a flaming catastrophe. The Pang Bros., Danny and Oxide (love that name!), have directed their film in a very flashy manner, and edited it likewise (they also coscripted), and while the picture is consistently interesting and beautiful to look at, darn it, it just isn't that scary. Only two scenes generated a chill down this viewer's spine: the one in the calligraphy class (a truly startling sequence) and the one in which Mun shares an elevator ride with the spirit of an antigravitic old man (but even in this scene, I kept wondering why Mun couldn't just hit the button for another floor and jump out). So although the film is very well done and should certainly please most viewers, those looking for some genuine scares should probably seek elsewhere...although I'd be willing to bet that this film is still waaaay superior to the Hollywood remake. At least, that's the way I, uh, see it.</fullReview>

The report card thing is never explained but the other scary stuff in the movie out weights it. It wasn't the most scariest movie on earth but it was creepy.

		<fullReview>Before watching this film, I had already had contact with The Ring and other Asian horror films. From the beginning, I enjoyed these productions though I cannot state that any of them was extremely scary, at least for me. However, this movie is all what a horror movie should be. The plot is not excessively original but the atmosphere it creates to explain the story of a Chinese blind girl who recovers sight is almost perfect. The viewer starts discovering the world at the same time as the main character does. What is unknown for her is unknown for us. This film contains absolutely terrifying images that freeze your blood even if you watch them more than once. What is good news for those people who don't like horror films is that there are not violent or bloody deaths and by the last half an hour the rhythm decreases and everything turns out to be a sci-fi film more than a horror one. That is a good comfort to recover from the three or four scenes that the viewer has to encounter. On the whole, brilliant work that must be watched by all horror fans and probably the scariest movie of the modern Asian terror.</fullReview>

It's not to often where something comes around and is just naturally terrifying. North American horror needs to put loud violins in the jump sequences just to get a reaction from the audience.

		<shortDescription>Everything you'd want out of a 'jump' horror film but with a little extra below the surface.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there I am, thinking that the Japanese were the only nation of people from the Far East whom could make great horror films but it seems I have grossly underestimated the likes of Singapore and Hong Kong, respectively. The Eye is actually a creepy and unnerving horror film that bathes in simplicity and routine narrative but gets across its chills and scares in an extremely effective manner; mostly down to the fact we know exactly what's what and what's going on. Whilst American re-make of The Ring a year earlier was more of a detective film, I was only scared due to confusion. I stated: "If you were to make a ten second film of someone opening a creaky old door, going inside to a pitch black room whilst all the time having eerie music playing over the events and really dark lighting over the images, you'll probably find your audience looking away merely because they don't know who any one is, why what's happening IS happening and what's going to pop out at them." The Eye is anything but as we know what's what; what's going on and what the situation is.This particular film is one that borrows but updates, simultaneously. When Danny Boyle made 28 Days Later, he made 'zombies' or 'persons-transformed-through-a-virus-of-some sort' scarier by enabling them to run ? it was a creepy move as before, a 'classical' zombie could be escaped through a good few minutes running. In The Eye, directors the Pang brothers update the classical horror villain of ghosts by making them hostile. I think the image of ghosts certainly before this film is one of very passive, gentile and perhaps as quite calm but here, they seem more menacing; more aggressive as our heroine is forced into her new world. There are two such scenes that demonstrate this; the first takes place in an elevator and basically acts as the scene which informs the heroine something very odd is going on: she sees a man standing facing the corner in an elevator but the CCTV cameras do not show him as actually there; she enters the elevator and it slowly turns around and approaches her in an eerie fashion ? her reaction is terror. The other scene takes place at some sort of drawing class: a ghost appears and states the heroine is sitting in 'her chair' before it unexpectedly lunges at her, causing the girl to get up in freight but her reaction at this point is still confusion.Two things spawn from these scenes: I said 'unexpectedly lunges' because you do not expect ghosts to be as aggressive as this; harking back to two of the more memorable ghost stories put to film 'The Shining' and 'The Sixth Sense' (which this is loosely based on); even they did not have their ghosts as aggressive as this: approaching and seemingly attacking the heroes. The other thing is that once the audience realises these ghosts are of this nature, unpredictability and eeriness creep into the psyche thus adding to the horror experience. Consequently, we feel un-easy because the film is about eyes, a vulnerable and exposed part of ourselves; something that we treasure and sub-consciously, we all fear going blind, I'm sure.But the film is not just the sort that offers cheap thrills and the odd jumpy gimmick; it's a film that has a theme, that has something to say. The Eye is scary because early on, we know what the girl is dealing with but she doesn't, putting us in a position of power as since we know what she's up against. But The Eye offers a glimpse into the unknown, a portal into another world: a world of death and the dead and such, because of the surgery the characters should really be celebrating the fact the heroine is able to see the dead. Likewise with The Sixth Sense, Cole had a gift that he could see and speak to the dead; spirits that remain on the planet or indeed in this 'world' as we continue our own lives. In The Eye, the heroine seems to get on well with some ghosts whereas others are more hostile and this is something that is echoed in The Sixth Sense; the girl in Cole's tent seems there to shock but to ask for help at the same time and we all know who/what the 'other' sort of ghost was.But The Eye arguably goes a little deeper. In this film the heroine can get along with a fellow patient undergoing surgery but when their time comes, it's not as if he will haunt her: she looses a friend and that is the end of it. The idea that an actual reaper will come to take away the dead is also an interesting one and whilst the idea is sparsely used, it's a good one nonetheless. It's also worth mentioning that the reaper seems to take some ghosts and yet allows others to seemingly roam around our world. This begs the question: what are they even doing there? It has to be assumed that the lead character is the only one who can see the ghosts so if she couldn't, whose attention would they be arousing? But these aren't the sorts of questions you ask, I feel. By the end of The Eye, I think we can come to accept death as something that happens; indeed accept that, rather odd as it sounds; death is a part of life. Whilst The Eye is a horror, it may veer too far into thriller territory by the end but it needs to do so in order to get across the mentioned feelings and themes when the massive blaze occurs. The Eye is creepy, mysterious and rather compelling. Did I mention it wasn't Japanese?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Eye is a tour de force. An extraordinary journey of two girls. The first is Mun, played incredibly by the lovely, Angelica Lee, who is given the gift of sight... and much, much more. The second, the donor of her cornea whose life has become tangled up in Mun's life by her gifted vision. Mun's character is more then simply a catalyst for a ghost story, but a heroine of archetypal exploration, around which the people she meets, dead, and alive, dance in a macabre and beautiful ballet, to the symphony of her experience. Dr Lo, played by Lawrence Chou passionately wishes to help Mun, to uncover the truth behind the living recipient whose cornea she inherited. The movie can be enjoyed on so many levels... as a action movie with pounding music and intense dramatic scenes, or a riveting story of love, forgiveness, regret, and acceptance. Either way you look at it, you will learn to look life straight in The Eye."When I was little... granny told me... I was not an ordinary child. God had given me some obstacles... so that I would grow up to be an extraordinary person. Now I understand what it means to be extraordinary. An extraordinary person can see things others can't... and feel pain others won't feel... Maybe, I was never meant to see this world, I don't want to lay terrified in bed every night... then awaken horrors every morning... I just want to be an ordinary person." The movie is amazingly effective, from the scene in the diner we see she is not the only person gifted with this second sight, or "sixth sense", and that gives us the ability to place the story in a subtext within reality. The dialog and story truly take this out of the realm of simple ghost story, to noble heights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A disquieting film more than a frightening story. A young woman, after a nearly total life of blindness, recuperates her eyesight after getting new corneas grafted on her eyes. But along with them she gets the visionary capability of the young woman who donated them, after her own death. The film does not try to frighten us or even terrorize us. It tries to convince her that this story is true with two doctors as main witnesses and extremely realistic shooting and editing. We are immersed into the story as if it were absolutely normal and true, without any special effects and extraordinary events. What's more it insists on the disturbing effect of this power onto the young woman, to the point of her preferring going back to blindness. Then we end up with extremely disquieting questions. Is eyesight responsible for our unhappiness or mishaps? Do we learn how to reject what we don't like along with seeing when we are children in a segregative not to say racist way? Is our seeing tamed and conditioned early in our life? And this creates in us an uneasy feeling that makes us shrink away from something that could very well be a true fact since our education is not to teach us to see everything but to see in the proper way. The film is trying to convince us of this brainwashing we have been through without even knowing it. Isn't it then better to refuse to see and lock ourselves into some kind of artificial blindness that will protect us from the nightmares of real life. What we do not see does not exist. Isn't that blindness nothing but the same thing as the selective seeing of normal people?

		<shortDescription>One of the better Japanese ghost movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asian horror cinema has definitely becoming that of a mainstream cult phenomenon here in the states. The American remake of "Ringu" ("The Ring") started something very intriguing. With "Ringu" being the most popular one to ship over "The Eye" has to be the second most popular, and soon could pass "Ringu" for this title with an American remake on the way.How could "The Eye" surpass "Ringu"? Pure and simple. It's a better film. Much more atmospheric, shot better and more original, more creepy and a much better overall film.The story centers about a girl named Mun (Angelica Lee). Mun has been blind for 18 years (since age 2). A miracle doctor gives Mun a corneal transplant which miraculously restores her sight. Shortly after getting used to her new sight Mun begins seeing much more than she bargained for. She gets the supernatural power once possessed through the eyes of her donor; the ability to see future deaths as well as the already deceased.This movie does indeed borrow slightly from the premise of "The Sixth Sense" but it is done so in a way that works and makes the story all it's own. Some of the visuals along with the score music will definitely give you the creeps and make you jump in your seat. The film includes a massive death scene that rivals that of the pile up at the beginning of "Final Destination 2". The story never really gets to the confusing stage if you follow the film well.The Pang Brothers do an excellent job in the directorial chair. The FX are done professionally and compliment the movie well. The actresses and actors are top notch and know how to deliver what needs delivering.The film was critically acclaimed all over Asia as well as America. Looks like we are chalking up one more good review for the record books. As mentioned above, the American remake is on the way. Who is putting the remake out? None other than the production company headed by a man by the name of Mr. Tom Cruise. If they keep all the highlights, the feel, and story in tact, American audiences will definitely be in for a treat. But never forget where the film came from and give the original a chance first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 'The Eye' a young woman who has been blind for many years since the age of two, goes through surgery and get her eyesight back. But this blessing comes with a curse, and she starts to see some scary things beyond the ordinary world. This type of story gives a filmmaker some good material to work with. You get the chance to make a grownup meet the world just like a child, which can make it easier for the audience to believe &amp; accept some extraordinary things. 'The Eye' make some good use of these opportunities. There are scenes that work with strong emotion and/or suspense, and it delivers some insight to the bitter-sweet fact that if you want the good things in life you also have to deal with some really bad stuff. On the weaker side I think the pace of the film is a little too slow, there could've been more work on the characters, and the story recycle a lot of things from other scary movies. There's big similarities to parts of stronger creations such as 'Ringu' &amp; 'The Sixth Sense', and of course a touch of a bunch more cheesy films like 'The Hand' &amp; 'Body Parts'. This doesn't have to be just a bad thing if you can put a strong personal twist to it, but for me the recycling in 'The Eye' mostly made me think that some of the previous films used those elements in a much better &amp; more original way. All in all I guess that 'The Eye' is an OK effort that could be enjoyable, especially if you're easily scared &amp; very afraid of ghosts. I rate it 5/10. Not very bad, not very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very much a film of 2 halves, but some very effective scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I became a fan of Asian horror films following the release of the much hyped 'Ring'; (Japanese, not the terrible American remake). My collection soon grew to include what must be the accepted best of all modern Asain horror releases to date; Audition, Dark water, Ju-On, Tale of Two Sisters etc etc. It was with much hope then that I purchased The Eye soon after it's UK release after reading some very favourable reviews.Having never been a fan of blood and guts horror - I felt that the genre as a whole was pretty much killed off by 20 or so years of trashy American slasher flicks, it was fantastic to see the emergence of horror films that were not only treated with sensitivity and intelligence, but which were also genuinely frightening. The Eye however, is something of an exercise in frustration, and does not quite the classic status that many reviewers credit it with.The first half of the film is immensely enjoyable and offers some genuine and effective scares, truly creepy atmospheres and some grim visuals that stay with you long after the movie slides, disappointingly, into a pedestrian and totally tame and fright free 'detective' story, where our heroine must discover why she sees the things she does.This The Eye does this about 50% way through the film, and whilst the remainder is still watchable, it seems to sit awkwardly with the first half, mainly because the heroine of the piece seems to overcome her terror at a time where she (apparently) stops seeing ghosts. This is a real shame for the audience, since the visual flair and often innovative horror sequences that populate the first part of the film with startling regularity, suddenly stop. What we are left with are various scare-free exposition scenes and an explosive and unlikely ending that wouldn't be out of place in any Hollowood blockbuster.The Eye is still a cut above most other horror films out there, and is an must have for any self respecting fan of the genre. The fact that the last half of the film is totally devoid of any scares is a disappointment, however, since there are more genuinely creepy moments in the first half than in most horror films throughout, then this is a small price to pay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Joe Cool Review: Gin gwai(The Eye)(2002)Starring: Angelica Lee as Wong Kar Mun Lawrence Chou as Dr. Wah Chutcha Rujinanon as LingPlot: A young blind woman receives a cornea transplant and everything is well. She can see again, but what she sees are strange visions and the spirits that stayed behind. What if the reflection you see is not your own?Openers: So I heard about this little gem through the grapevine, and at first I really didn't want to see it. It sounded like something that would come out here in the states, only rated PG-13 and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar. If you ignore the simplicity of the plot and dive in, you should enjoy this as much as I did.The Good: The fact we get emotionally attached to the main character of Mun is great. That's how movies like this should be. You should become attached, that way when everything starts going crazy, it affects you more. The script was well-written to achieve this feat, although the acting is top-notch as well. It really sets us up later for a punch to the stomach. And what a punch to the stomach it is. Unsettling creepy visuals occur throughout the movie. I won't give away any, but it's just bizarre and worked very well. There are some genuinely frightening moments and I don't think the impact would be as great if there wasn't character and story development. That's the biggest thing that works for this movie. The sense of dread is drenched in this movie. I also liked how they played with the lighting and shadows for greater effect. The Pang Brothers know their horror!The Bad: The movie does tend to drag. I felt at least ten minutes could have been cut out because they kind of take a long time to get to the point. For example, we really don't need an explanation on how the eye works and how the cornea transplant is supposed to work. It's nice they thought of that, and a smart thing to do, but it doesn't really do anything but slow down the story. Also, I didn't like the fact that Mun and Dr. Wah fell in love. Why? Because he's her doctor? Or is it just because they went through some weird stuff together and it's a rule? Just felt thrown in. The Ugly: Lots of crispy bodies, a man with half his face gone, and a woman with an abnormally large tongue licking meat. No blood to speak of, but this is one of those movies that did not need it at all. Final Verdict: I really enjoyed The Eye. It's a smart ghost story, one rich in development and genuine scares. I did hear there was an American remake coming, when really, all this movie needs is either a)subtitles or b)dubbing and they could re-release it theatrically. Remake not required, thank you. You just know an American version would be dumbed down with lots of "boo!" jump scares and no character development. See this version however.Rating: **** of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent modernization of a classic ghost story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to the boom of Asian horror started by the Japanese film "Ringu" and its respective sequels and remakes in the early 00s, Western audiences received a new influx of the modern Asian film industry, specially focused on the horror genre. Among the many refreshing novelties that this new wave of Asian horror has brought, Pang brother's film "Gin gwai" ("The Eye") is not only one of the best but also one of the most accessible to Western culture. It's a movie that brings back a familiar theme in ghost stories and gives it a whole new look that makes it look original and refreshing again. The brothers Oxide and Danny Pang show a lot of promise, as "Gin gwai" seems to be only the top of the iceberg.The story begins with Wong Kar Mun (Angelica Lee) receiving a cornea transplant, finally recovering her sight after losing it when she was only 2 years old. Slowly she begins her recovery and becomes to discover the world after having been living in the darkness for so many time. However, something is not right, as she begins to have strange visions of people previously deceased, who constantly appear before her eyes as ghosts that never leave. As the visions begin to take over her mind, she decides to ask help to her psychiatrist, Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou), who is the nephew of the doctor that made the transplant. Mun must now discover who was the donor in order to stop the haunting visions.Written and directed by the Pang brothers, "Gin gwai" gives us a fresh new face to a familiar story that becomes even more involving due to the addition of the Pang's own Asian background (both were born in Hong Kong (and moved to Thailand). Just like in every good ghost story, the plot moves smoothly, carefully building up the characters and putting a lot of emphasis in the mystery and the suspense. This may feel slow to those expecting a scare-fest, but it's actually quite effective for the kind of story the Pang are telling.This focus on mystery gives "The Eye" a feeling that makes it different from other modern Asian horrors, as the film doesn't relay too much on special effects or jump scares to deliver the chills. The Pang brothers show a great use of the camera to create eerie atmospheres in our modern world, making a normal place like a hallway or a restaurant have a supernatural feeling. Also, despite the slow pace of the film, it has a sleek, attractive visual composition that goes hand to hand with the modern setting and gives it a modern feeling without falling in the now-clichéd music video style.The cast is quite effective, specially Angelica Lee as Mun, who carries the film with great talent delivering a very believable performance as the film's lead character. Singer Lawrence Chou sounds like an odd choice for playing young Dr. Wah, but here he shows that he has real talent for acting and gives a great performance in a role that seems a bit too far removed from his real persona. Not an easy task to accomplish. The rest of the cast is quite good, and almost everyone, from Mun's Grandmother (Yin Ping Ko) to the enigmatic Ling (Chutcha Rujianon) have a time to shine. Worth to point out is little Yut Lai So, who delivers a charming performance in her small role as Yingying.When a film has two directors is common that problems arise, but fortunately, this is not the case. "Gin gwai" is a great addition to the modern wave of Asian horror as it retains many of what has made this new "style" interesting and at the same time adds its fair share of originality. Many have criticized that the film tends to lack scares by the end of the film, but I think that "The Eye" never really attempts to be a scare-fest. While it does definitely packs a few horrifying imagery, it's always focused on being a mystery film rather than a straightforward horror. It's like a modern version of Gothic horror films.Probably by now what started with "Ringu" has become so common that is now clichéd, but "Gin gwai" is a remarkable horror film that still gives the chills. The Pang brothers seem to have a bright future ahead, and hopefully their career will live up to the expectations they have build with this film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mun is a 20-year-old lady who has been blind since she was 2-years-old. But that's going to change, as she receives a successful cornea transplant. Through training she must adapt to her new perceptions of being able to see, but she encounters dark blurry shadows while in hospital, but she takes it as her eyes simply adjusting. Things get even more stranger for Mun when she returns home to discover that she has received more than just her sight back, but the ability to see ghostly figures. So to escape this she tries to go back to her old ways, but with the help of her psychotherapist they try to track down information on the donor.Here's another one of those subtly, spooky supernatural Asian horror flicks that has been terribly over-hyped when it comes to this field. Now, I rather liked it, but I was kinda of expecting a bit more from it. I'll probably blame myself for that, after a similar fate with "Dark Water (2002)". The Pang Brothers' film does share some ground with "The Sixth Sense" and of course "The Ring", but they try to add a unique spin to the familiar idea. The worn-out story won't set the world alight, but it's the unsettling jolts and a collage of chilling images that raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Directors' The Pang Bros. shows promise within some unbearably intense sequences (the evaluator scene and crackerjack climax) that are effectively balanced out. These are quite sudden "Boos!" after slowly weaving the very eerie images along aside the chilling and quite ambient sound effects. The creative and energetic duos' finesse gives out a simmering atmosphere of clinical coldness that floats on by, which is kept alert by a harrowing, kinetic music score. The sprinkle of hissing FX was very well used and the dim colours were captured by openly focused photography.I thought the drama plot is where it's quite a let down. We're given bits of the story to digest in its slow drifting style, which is filled with a few padded moments and it could have been a far tighter experience. I didn't feel that a lot of the sub-plots were completely fleshed out. Some things in the structure do get foreseeable (investigation pattern and love interest) and can get quite overwrought. It does kinda become more intriguing when it folds out, but the main concentration seems to be building upon the supernatural frights than anything else. The story simply evolves around the extra sensitive and versatile performance of Angelica Lee Sin-Ji as the very timid Mun. She's perfectly sincere in the role of someone coming to terms with her new lifestyle and its added feature that she can't escape. The established script was solid and caught the uneasy thoughts and moods of Mun very well. But I still think it was her absorbing performance that lifted the material.Like 'em or not, those creepy Asian ghost stories can cause goosebumps and the sheer effort behind this film is there, despite that it might be too hyped. Definitely worth a peek, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just another ghost story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghosts stories have seemingly be forgotten by Hollywood, but at least in the East, it makes for good horror films, most of the time. Blind since she was a young girl, Mun gets the opportunity of a lifetime, as she is able to undergo a cornea transplant. However, by regaining her sight, she receives a nasty surprise, when she is also able to see ghosts. With the help of Dr. Wah, Mun sets out to find the history behind her unknown donor.The Eye is not a horror movie in the general sense. It has its scare moments, but they aren't frequent throughout the film, and never builds upon one another. However, these rare moments are quite nerve-racking. The first-half buildup does an awesome job of creating a naked sense of tension, as Mun has to adjust to her newly gained eyesight, however, the second half falters somewhat, yet kicks back with some emotional potency.Angelica lee (Mun) does a stunning job in her portrayal of a woman who gets her eyesight back, but after some disturbing encounters retreats back to the darkness. Since Mun's issues revolve around what is happening on screen, Lee is able to strike with a convincing performance, and the audience cant help but feel how real everything is. However, there is a noticeable mishap in the casting department, in the form of Lawrence Chou (Dr. Wah). Chou is a young actor, and obviously, too young to be in the position of Mun's psychotherapist. From the outset, The Eye resembles The Sixth Sense in many facets, yet it creates it own vibe that is enough to set it apart. It's not the horror movie its cracked up to be, and without the strong performance of Angelina Lee, The Eye could easily have fallen apart. The climax, while not spectacular, has enough to be appreciated, and the drama which fills the story, is somewhat sad indeed. The end result is an unfulfilled story which will probably not impress horror enthusiasts. Yet, deep in its core, The Eye renews the ghost story genre, and its dramatic elements make for an interesting story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent supernatural drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you approach this film expecting an Asian horror flick, you might as well be disappointed. Although I watched it because it was labelled as "horror", I found it to be a very thoughtful supernatural drama, if you allow me the expression. And as such, I personally find it excellent.All the attention is drawn onto the main character, Mun (Angelica Lee), blind from age 2 and now back to the world of the seeing after an apparently successful transplant. We'll accompany her as she gets used to this new world. But soon thereafter, she'll start to see ghosts of the recently dead, as well as foresee deaths that are going to occur immediately.The film goes about the personal drama of Mun, but also about how she meets her destiny. I feel the film works especially well on a symbolic level. Through her gift-curse, Mun finds she is an extraordinary person, and she finds out what being an extraordinary person is about. She finds out that life can be very hard for the gifted, such as she is, as her new ability to see dead people (or to plain see) comes with a lot of pain. Of course, there are a few scares along the way, but the film isn't based on them, and they aren't the film's main motivation.It is very hard not to fall for Mun right away, and much of this is to be thanked to Angelica Lee's superb acting job. Her facial expression tells so much about her emotions, her fear, her pain, and her happiness. I found it very easy to "believe" Mun as a real person. This is miles away from the emotionless creeped out girls we often find in scary movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Eyes of Orlac</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine how old a plot like this must be. I ran across something similar in an old Cheyenne nursery story. One of the first filmic examples must be "The Hands of Orlac," in which, as I remember, a pair of hands is transplanted from a murderer onto an ordinary person who then becomes a strangler himself.In this case it's not hands that carry this negotiable property but a pair of corneal transplants that allows the recipient to see some of the things experienced by the now-deceased owner. Spooky images about, pretty well done, and the sound track booms with percussion and electronic effects that also ratchet up the scare quotient.Usually I avoid films from China. They irritate me because they remind me of how my command of Mandarin Chinese has deteriorated over the years into a kind of influence over it, but this one hooked me.It has a few features that are extraordinarily well done for a simple fright fest, which is what this is.One is the photography and the direction. Combined we get a first-rate picture of what life is like in Hong Kong for a middle-class young woman who suddenly becomes sighted after her operation. The actress, Angelica Lee, has an expressive face that's ideal for the part -- fretful, intense, alert, flawless. The doctor who treats her is quite good too. He looks about sixteen. I think we can understand why he "considers her more than a patient." The ideas behind the plot, sadly, got past me. Maybe it depends more on an understanding of Daoism than I brought to the viewing experience. I had no idea that the theories of immortality were so intricate. According to this movie, the Daoist concept of the afterlife is something like the "previous life" therapy of the outer reaches of the New Age in the 1970s. Those who have suffered violent deaths and have not achieved closure in certain respects must relive their deaths until they do. I witnessed some previous death therapy sessions in Palo Alto that were real lulus. One client repeated a death he'd experience during air combat in World War I.Where was I? Oh, yes, the movie.Yeah, the direction and photography are fine. The images have a kind of pale greenish cast, like a garter snake's belly, which is entirely appropriate to the story.I'm afraid I didn't fully understand the ending, not being enough of a Daoist, or perhaps the confusion was built into the film itself. There are after all a few noticeable holes in the logic, regardless of your race, color, or your creed. Instance: Lee is eating in a restaurant, sees a ghostly spirit outside, and is startled. No one else has ever been able to see the ghosts. But in this case the waitress leans over and says, "So you can see them too!" They are the spirits of the manager's dead wife and child. They frighten all the customers away, and the neighboring shops have sold out and moved. Huh? If Lee is the only one who can see them because she is the one with the eyeball transplants, then what's up? I wonder if Chinese Buddhists and Daoists and Confucianists can understand a Christian film like "Rapture." This is well worth watching, though. Some very spooky stuff is happening on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie has been compared to "The Ring" and "The Sixth Sense", it's not a fair comparison. I've read too many reviews that, frankly, just don't get this movie. It's the story of a young violinist, Mun, blind since she was two, who gets her eyesight back thru a cornea transplant from an unknown donor. The operation is, of course, a resounding success?but there's a catch. Mun, her eyesight still blurry, sees shadowy people around her ? people that no one else can see. Slowly, she realizes that what she's seeing are ghosts, and she sees them everywhere: in the hospital corridor, at restaurants, on the street, in her apartment building, etc. With the help of the psychiatrist who is helping her adjust to having her eyesight back, Mun sets out to find just where her new corneas came from. Believe me, there are at least three sequences in this movie that reach heights of out-and-out horror that most people have never seen in a movie. But this is more than a simple horror movie. It's, at heart, a story of a young girl whose world has been changed overnight, who has received a power she doesn't want, and of her struggle to understand and come to terms with her new ability. There's absolutely not a single, solitary drop of blood in this movie, all the horror comes from the atmosphere of chilly dread conjured by the Pang Brothers and the frankly remarkable performance of Lee Sin-Je as Mun. The rights for this have been snapped up by Tom Cruise, so we can all look forward to a crappy American remake in the near future. Just pass on that and see the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The eye (2002) is a great movie, about a young woman called Mun who has an eye operation to cure her blindness........ initially it works but soon after she starts seeing ghosts!!! All these horrible visions are slowly turning her crazy and she gets help from a young doctor and together they set out to find the eye donors parents, when they find out that Mun has received "Lings" eyes, Ling was a young girl who was terribly bullied and picked on because everyone thought she was a curse, she could foresee death and tragedy.Nobody liked Ling and she hung herself........ now Mun has the power to foresee death and tragedy, can she overcome the curse passed down to her or will she survive and overcome it?? The Eye is a brilliant movie, better than the ring in my opinion, it's got loads of suspense and creepy moments...... the lift scene in particular is nail biting stuff!! It also has a lot of action and heart.If you have seen classics like the ring and dark water then be sure to track this one down, you wont be disappointed!! This film deserves a strong 8/10 and thats what i give it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie one evening and watched it by myself. After watching it for a little while, I actually got up and turned on some lights. This picture really gave me the creeps in some scenes. If you like a good horror, where the horror is left to your imagination, this is a good film to see. Don't let the subtitles turn you off. There is not a whole lot of dialog and the subtitles are fairly easy to read and watch the action at the same time. The story revolves around a blind women who receives a transplant enabling her vision to be restored. I notice that some of the other reviewers like to offer a comparison to the "Sixth Sense". I would agree that there are some similar elements to both films, but this film definitely stands on its own. Remember that it is a foreign film, at least to USAers, and it doesn't have the touchy feelyness that the "Sixth Sense" had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good until the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor plot points are discussed, but no spoilers."The Eye," like "Ringu" and "Dark Water," is another horror film from the East. It emphasizes plot and characterization more so than most films.The main character is a blind woman who has lived a normal, productive life (she is even in a symphony for the blind) but is given a chance to see through an experimental surgery involving eye transplants. (She actually gets both eyes transplanted making the title a grammatical error. In Chinese, the direct translation is "See ghosts.") However, something bizarre occurs when she begins to ghosts, as well as a bedroom (more of a shack really) that she's never visited before. Thus, her and her surgeon (don't ask) go on a hunt to discover the truth behind her visions.The first two acts are extremely atmospheric and chilling. Because we care for the very charismatic lead actress, her journey is heartbreaking; for example, when she meets her friend in the hospital and when she is turned away from the symphony because she is no longer blind. The ghosts are used sparingly and one scene in the elevator will stay with you long after the film is over.Now, comes the bad. The film, first of all, sets up a bland love story between patient and doctor which doesn't work because the doctor looks like he's twelve and also because there is no impetus for their relationship. Second, when we uncover the truth, the film should end with them leaving the bedroom (you'll see what I mean), but instead has an extended scene in a traffic jam that is melodramatic and too pat. It deflates the film. If you turn off the film right before they are on the bus, you'll think you'd have seen a horror spectacular!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mun has been blind since the age of two, and wants to see. When she's twenty, she finally gets the chance to get a cornea transplant. But the surgery has a terrifying side effect."The Eye" is a new film from Hong Kong, which really went beyond my expectations. I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't particularly a masterpiece work of psychological horror, as it had a few flaws and many jump scares, but I'm the type of person that can accept that. I really liked the long tense scenes, and the scares that payed them off. And you can't help but feel bad for the main character: Angelica Lee gives a very beautiful sad performance as Mun. Same goes for Chutcha Rujinanon (Ling). And I thought the ending was pretty much a work of art (even though it was highly depressing, it was still very beautiful and touching).So, what else can I say? This film was great. Highly recommended, and make sure you have a tissue box handy, along with clean underwear. This is one film I doubt I will ever forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Spiritual, Highly Effective Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most unique horror films I've seen in a very long time. That's saying a lot since the film is essentially the Sixth Sense. After receiving a cornea transplant a blind woman begins to see terrible images, and has reoccurring dreams of a strange place. Or is she just adjusting to seeing for the first time? The film is incredibly smart, and it is incredibly creepy. There are no crazy noises or jumpy scenes like most horror films. This is pure tension poured on throughout the film. What makes this film special is that while it is effective in being creepy, it is a life-affirming and spiritual film. I don't think I've ever seen a Chinese film that is so blunt about Buddhist beliefs. In fact the Buddhist house cleansing is both interesting and creepy. The Pang Bros. do a terrific job of making sure this is above everything a pretty film, and it is. Even the horrible disaster in the film is shown in a humane and sympathetic way. This film is being remade next year in the States. Though I doubt they'll keep the overt spiritual themes. The ghosts are not harmful, just restless. Also, this is the second coolest death I've seen in a film, behind the Seventh Seal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Eye is a class film, as with any horror it's best watched at night, in the dark, on your own. From the minute it starts it will creep you out, the opening credits set the tone of whats to come. Some have said that it's predictable. It's not! Especially the ending, not wanting to give it away but it's not when you expect it. It's well acted and has jump out your seat moments. The subtitles don't distract you away from the action either. It's much better than the Grudge, and far scarier than the sixth sense, the first time you watch is the best as it relies on the shocks so not sure it's worth buying unless you've got money to spare so renting is a good idea, but this is one film that is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt "The Sixth Sense" was a major influence for "The Eye", but despite the fact you know that from early on in the movie it still keeps you wondering what is next. "The Eye" in fact evolved beyond what "The Sixth Sense" was into the horror genre-bare in mind "The Sixth Sense" was all about the unraveling of the story in the final minutes-making it more a thriller than horror, "The Eye" however went more for a chilling style of horror common to Asian cinema. Unlike many movies from China "The Eye" was a quality production and for a horror fan worth the time. In fact I would say it's a good DVD to have because it's worth the watch a couple times. If you're the type that simply doesn't like Asian movies or subtitles simply don't watch it. Yes, it does have things that remind you of other movies, but this day and age what movie doesn't?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a complete surprise to me! I had heard a lot of good things but i was pleasantly surprised when i realized it was better than i hoped. The old lady in the hospital is one of the scariest scenes i have ever seen. And i still look behind me when i enter an elevator with mirrors. It isn't tiresome and flows nicely from scene to scene.Beautifully filmed with a good story and many scary scenes it is a good watch overall. A 9 out of 10 for me. p.s.The Pang Brothers released the "sequel" this year but it isn't as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Eye is a good but not brilliant Hong Kong/Thai addition to Asian horror genre, obviously being influenced by the American film "The sixth sense" &amp; the golden age of Japanese horror of the past 8 or so years.Personally my personal biggest downer of "The Eye" is the ridiculous love story subplot between Mun &amp; Dr Wah. Out of nowhere the good doctor decides to throw medical ethics out the window &amp; declare he's in love (for no real apparent reason... well apart from the fact she is very attractive)with the blind girl who can see! Be warned you might suffer a bit of eye strain early in the film with Mun's POV shots showing how her vision is as she begins to regain her sight. This out of focus shooting can be a test on your eyes too! Worth checking out if you are a fan of Asian horror. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent thriller - If you liked the Sixth Sense and Ju-On, you should watch this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did something I have rarely done before with this film - I read a vague review on IMDb (I believe it said "If you liked Ju-On, you'll love The Eye") and bought it, sight unseen, along with a couple of "horror" type movies.The "horror" type movies turned out to be pornography (I now have a better understanding of the Asian movie rating system), but this movie exceeded my expectations.The directors did a phenomenal job mixing suspense and just a touch of horror into a story that should be about something wonderful - a blind woman regaining her sight. This movie kept me riveted throughout, I couldn't leave my chair until it was over... And then I had to watch it again.I saw another review of this movie that called it mediocre - which I think is a travesty. This movie only suffers from a lower budget than most western audiences are accustomed to, but trust me, you won't even notice, and they did put the budget they had where it counts, believe me.If you enjoyed Sixth Sense, you'll enjoy this movie. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing, and there's plenty of creepy supernatural stuff going on as well.I guess they're making a western version of this film - do yourself a favor and watch the original first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>subtle creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found The Eye to be creepy in that quiet, don't let me sleep alone, kinda way. The plot, though at first predictable takes a nice step to the left to keep you hooked. The film doesn't use gore to frighten you, but I did find one scene extremely disturbing. I can't ride in an elevator anymore without getting goosebumps down my back. Once you see it you'll know what I mean. The actress eludes plenty of emotion in her voice so that you don't even realize you're reading subtitles. I also liked the use of three languages, cantonese, English, and thai. You don't see that in American movies. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of The Sixth Sense or The Ring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I C dead people revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jian Gui (The Eye) is a good genuinely scary movie that shares some similar ideas with the 6th Sense. It is the story of a young blind woman who receives a corneal transplant and is given the power of sight only to be seeing more than she bargained for.As with many Asian horror films I love the subtly in the early stages that slowly builds to a screaming finish. This is aided by a wonderful soundtrack and a lot of really eerie imagery and sound effects. There is some great suspense thrown in, too. The scene set in the elevator is so tense.The film is very well acted with very good special effects. The camera work is exceptional. This is a good movie to catch alone late at night if you really want to get a scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great thriller from the Asians!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A blind girl gets a cornea transplant so that she would be able to see again. However, she got more than what she bargained for when she realized she could even see ghosts. And some of these ghosts are down right unfriendly. So she embarks on a journey to find the origins of her cornea and to reveal the history of the previous dead owner . "Jian gui" [the eye] is a very spooky horror film with an engaging plot and an uncanny, creepy atmosphere. Sure it isn't as scary as Ringu or Ju-on: The grudge, but there are enough genuinely frightening scenes--the elevator scene, the calligraphy scene, the face on the train, the old woman in the hospital, to name a few--that are both frightening and different. The performances in this film are excellent (Despite the fact that there ARE a few annoying characters...The grandma comes to mind...) and the conclusion (which is sort of reminiscent of "The moth man prophecies") makes an excellent unexpected twist. The pang brothers stylishly direct this slick, spooky horror offering. The Asians sure know how to scare us...Hollywood could learn a lot from these films!!!!! My rating for "Jian Gui"--8/10.ABOUT THE DVD: Lions gate has released this film with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio letter box format which is okay. There is some grain (Especially near the beginning of the film) but generally it's a decent transfer. the sound is surprisingly excellent with tons of surround sound effects and clear dialog. For extras we get a nice 15 minute "Making-of" featurette with cast interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, story background and FX stuff. We are also given (letter box!) trailer collect and originally U.S. TV spot and animated menus. The disk features English close captioning. My rating for the DVD: 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Final Destination's Sixth Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually rent foreign films so when I put this DVD in and saw the subtitles, I was shocked. I guess I just haven't acclimated to reading while watching movies. But with "The Eye", the effort was quite worth it!A Chinese girl that was blind since she was two, gets a second change at sight in a miracle operation. She receives replacement corneas but they are from a donor with a tragic past. The horror of this past is injected into the visions that the main character begins to see. Strange apparitions that no one else is capable of seeing. Ghosts? Soon these spirits begin to arrive in her visions just prior to their corporeal deaths. They signal death's imminence.What an awful curse for girl who has just been given what is supposed to be a gift beyond measure - sight! She is exposed to a world full of agony as she suffers macabre visits from restless members of the afterlife. She and her sight psychotherapist search diligently to discover who her donor was and the reason for her visual torments.Think of this film as "Final Destination" meets "The Sixth Sense". It is a tale that portends death while it lets the main character interact with the deceased. The special effects (visual and audio) and the suspense-injected horror scenes were something I had been missing for a while. I felt like I had watched an avant garde film with a neo-Hitchcock spin on it. A special toasts goes off to Angelica Lee's part in playing the main character, Mun! She does a remarkable job at conveying convincing emotions. This is definitely a future star, if she's not one already. The film did have a few "hokey" parts to it, but these were short-lived and easily masked by all the other positive elements. I give it an 8 out of 10. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite An Eyeful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Eye" (Jian Gui) is a well-made horror movie, it's quite an eyeful (ha ha). A blind woman named Mun gets a cornea transplant so she can see again, but this transplant also gives her the ability to see (and hear) ghosts. Sounds something like "The 6th Sense", but the style of this movie is somewhat different, the ghosts seem creepier and more harmful. I thought the ending was a little pat, but overall it was a good movie. I wish I'd seen it in a darkened movie theatre, the Pang Brothers make the movie suspenseful and compelling, and watching it on DVD with a bunch of friends in someone's living room (where we could stop the movie and get more popcorn, etc.) seemed to take some of the suspense away. But it was very entertaining, I recommend it as a good, scary movie.</fullReview>

We'd heard a lot of good things about this before we loaded it into the VCR, and wow! With excellent scenework and roleplaying, this piece takes the parapsychologic horror to a whole new level. With being constantly tensed, and never taking a break with the inner discussions; What is this, what's happening; this piece really is a big boom. Locked up with nice comments and quotes, terrific story (all though it might sometimes remind you a little bit too much of Ringu-1 (English title - "The Ring"), and overall it's a supreme piece. I just fell in with love with it's motion and smoothness, all though I don't think it's better than the Ringu-trilogy (whom I like to compare with due their identical set up).

		<fullReview>When you hear something like the eye.

That was very smart. Though i do not think The Eye was the Most scary movie of all time it was fun to watch with Cheap Thrills and something not obvious like Hollywood Cheap Thrills are.Some ideas in the movie to scare you were Brilliant or just plain weird.The story twists and turns and to me will always be better then 6th sense because i feel the story is more Solid in this film and doesn't really rely on the impact of the ending to make it an good film.9/10Fun Horror movie to watch with friends, Family, or by yourself.Do not worry about gore if thats what your worried about this movie hardly has any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mun Sees Dead People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose the "I see dead people" catchphrase was already taken when Hong Kong filmmakers, the Pang brothers, wrote &amp; directed 'The Eye'. Too bad because they could've used it. This time it's Angelica Lee who plays the cute star with sight beyond sight, tormented by visions of the dead that no one else can see or hear. This Cantonese thriller features English subtitles, but it almost doesn't need them. You get the gist of what's happening when she sees ghostly figures and has to deal with them talking to her. It's these scenes where the movie is at its creepiest, especially the terrifying encounter in an elevator.Lee plays Mun, a young adult who's been blind since she was two. When she becomes the beneficiary of a successful cornea transplant, it isn't long before she's dealin' with spooks. Is it the eyes? Did they curse her, even as they're blessing her with a gift she hasn't had since childhood? The metaphors stack up (as they do in all good horror flicks) and, fortunately, the star doesn't overplay any one scene. Lawrence Chou plays Dr. Wah, the psychotherapist dedicated to helping her adjust to the world with eyeballs. Oh, and he quickly falls in love with her too. When she discovers that these new eyes may have a memory of their own, Mun &amp; Wah hunt for the truth and eventually find they must try to help a tragic spirit get some closure. Before it's over, Mun will have more in common with that spirit than we realized.'The Eye' seems to be cribbing a lot of its creepy effects from past horror shows, but what movie doesn't do that? I got the chills a few times. The Pangs don't go for the GOTCHA! moment too often, which has become so routine in this genre that such tricks are anything BUT scary. This film is a treat for home theatre enthusiasts because the surround speakers on the DVD envelop you in Mun's world while the production mixes it up visually as well (shadows, eerie lighting, creepy sets). The ending may be a bit telegraphed, but it works almost as well as it intends to. This isn't quite as memorable as 'The Ring' (although it's a better movie) and it's not as intelligent as 'The Sixth Sense' (although it's less obvious). I was pleasantly surprised by my rare foray into a foreign language horror movie, from its melodic opening moments to its explosive final ones.But shouldn't it be called 'The Eyes'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I not being of sound mind, decided to watch this movie at midnight by my self. Trust me I don't recommend this as you will freak yourself out. Half way through the movie, I remember saying "oh man f*** this" outloud, to no one, simply because I was shaking like a fightened six year old (I'm 25). The movie is very well paced. It starts off nice and normal and lets you forget your even supposed to be watching a scary movie, and then BAM here is something to scare the hell out of you. By far this movies use of sound and music to convey a sense of feeling is far above par, one of the best of ANY movie, horror/scary movie or not. The shots are also well framed and executed with great talent. A definite must see.The plot is well done and simple. Girl has never seen before, gets new set of eyes and sees the world in a whole new way. Then figures out how and why she is able to see what she sees.I don't think I'll ever take a caligraphy class after watching this movie. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers)I really liked Ringu. (compared to the disasterous The Ring... which is a bit more offensive to my intelligence than Ringu was) So of course I knew The Eye was out, and had to bump into it at Blockbuster.Now having watched the film. This is not a scary film. sure, walking around the house in the dark... your senses are a bit elevated, but it'll wear off by the next day. Ringu, had an aftertaste that continue's to haunt. Although in the case of Ringu, it was only an okay movie.The Eye here however, seems to be on the other side of the sea /saw. Doesn't scare, yet it's a great movie.The movie is more about revenge and letting folks know that the dead girl portrayed in the film wasn't a bad person. I really loved that.And that darn score. Where can I buy that? Was just damn good. Loved the drum work. Alot of the camera work was pretty darn good took. listening to this movie with headphones (new tv has a headphone jack) really showed up well when Mun asks the person in the mirror towards the end of the film you got me here now what. And we are treated to this excellent score piece with b/w footage. Detailing the life of this girl whom Mun got her eyes from.I loved it. I was slightly disappointed that it didn't have a fright, but it was still kewl. And I'll likely buy it.9/10Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 8/10</fullReview>

But my husband and I are huge horror fans so we gave it a chance.This was by far the best, hiding-behind-the-fingers, biting-the-blanket movie I've seen in 20 years!!!! Japanese horror puts American horror films to shame. Now I'm all for a good hack 'em up bloody American gore film once in a while, but the Eye was simply. Mesmerizing.It's brought us to rent "RINGU"; "THE AUDITION"; "TOMIE" and "TOMIE 2" and many other Japan and Chinese horror films. If you want to be literally scared out of your mind, rent "The Eye." Then go on to Ringu and see how horrible American filmmakers butchered (literally) "THE RING."We simply can't get enough of these horror films and I've got 4 Japan horrors loaded in the DVD player right now. I'll keep ya posted. Happy Horror-ing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is far more complex and simple than other reviewers have given it credit for. IMO it's putting to test the debate of fate over destiny. Do we control our destiny? Can things be changed? Can things be changed if we know what's going to happen? I perceived it as a journey of a tortured soul who was trying to come to terms with these questions and finally coming to rest once the answer is found with the help of another.Aside from the philosophy subject matter, this was a visually beautiful film. The colours, the pace of the filming, the visual symbols and perspective were all extremely interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree that it may not be the most original idea ever but for people to say that it's boring is crazy and un-scary...unbelievable. This is one of the scariest things I have ever ever seen. Maybe it was because I saw it at the cinema but it absolutely terrified me. While watching it, it scared me more than Ringu although Ringu has definately had a lasting effect on me... I won't sleep in a room with a T.V. Visually speaking this film was exceptional. Never letting the audience see any more than the main character and creating such a tense atmosphere through the movement of the camera and some bizarre camera angles as well. I'm fearing (in a different way) the proposed remake by Tom Cruise because I can't see it bettering the original. Overall a truly exceptional film which will have you staying away from lifts for ages afterwards...why? You'll have to watch and find out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not original and far from perfect but this Asian horror film is better than most of the films it borrows from (the sixth sense, jacobs ladder, stir of echoes etc.) and as good as that other Asian horror classic, Ring. I totally disagree with some of the reviewers who seem to be implying the film only got the critical acclaim it got because it was made outside of Hollywood and if it had been made in the u.s people would have been more critical of it. The fact is Asian cinema is at the moment the best in certain genres. I must admit though the first time I watched this film I did'nt really think it was a great film. The second time the film reveals it real worth. You appreciate the films own ideas and unique points more and realize just how skillfully it has been put together. It feels less like a ripoff and more like the classic horror film it actually is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty good film, but not great. It is a bit derivative and the creators state in the "Making Of" featurette on the DVD that it really isn't an original idea. When posting this it was rated around 6-7 and this is exactly where it belongs. Above-average, but not amazing. I suggest a rental as it is certainly enjoyable and interesting, but one viewing ought to be enough.There were some ideas that could have been followed better, especially the girl's slow process of learning to see again and finding out what is real and what isn't. As it is most of the scares are nothing more than shocks and almost always telegraphed by an excessive swell in the music. Likewise there isn't much mystery to be had either. If you liked Ringu/The Ring and possibly the Sixth Sense you might enjoy this film a bit more than most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fare, if lacking good scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As yet another in the emerging line of 'extreme cinema' from the far east, The Eye is another psychological chiller/horror which attempts to find new ways of terrifying the viewer. Unfortunately, all these movies are now compared with the granddaddy of them all, Ring, and none of them match up. This does not break the chain. The story here is of a cornea transplant which leads to the receiver having traumatic visions she cannot explain. In a nutshell that is the story - like Ring and Dark Water it's a supernatural chiller, with emphasis on psychological fear rather than gore. It is still ahead of many Hollywood efforts for class, but isn't quite up the level of Ring. There are certainly a few chills here, but nothing I haven't seen before. Certainly nothing I found fearful. As a story it is certainly half decent, but *is* an unashamed rip-off of the Sixth Sense, and an old 70's movie (Whose name escapes me) which also featured a transplant of a hand which caused visions for the receiver. The final sequence is extremely impressive, and worth the wait. More like Hollywood in scale.Good enough movie, but lacking a lot for me which it won't for others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The path the plot of "the eye" took halfway through the movie just didn't make sense. I thought that the pictures of the suicide boy were actually of the blind chick's insane sister who had been kept from said blind chick all her life. Think about it, they didn't actually show the face on the photo. Plus, who are the best and most likely donors of body parts? Family members of course! Especially, eyes of a twin with the same genes. That would explain her family's secrecy. Plus, in her father's classroom when the girl in the corner says, "Get out of my seat (chair, place, whatever, I'm not big on quotes)" I thought for sure it was her sister. Why would she say, get out of my chair? (I'm sure there is a reason, but it makes more sense if it were here evil fruit loop sister).It seems to me that the writers were going down this path, but decided to throw the viewers a loop and head to Thailand for some stupid reason. This totally ruined the movie for me. However, the scenes in the first half were spot on and scared the poop out of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since movies like EVIL DEAD TRAP and RING, the cult and underground horror fans' eyes moved from Europe to Asia. The Asian Horror (capital letters deserved) hit of 2002 was the Hong Kong production THE EYE. Tom Cruise's production company purchased rights to it as soon as it was released for obvious reasons: THE EYE was one thrilling ride. I was never so scared ever since I watched FRIDAY THE 13th PART 6 as a kid (Not a good start, right?)A nice way to describe this supernatural thriller is RING meets THE SIXTH SENSE meets BODY PARTS meets THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES meets GHOST. Angelica Lee gives an excellent performance as Mun, a young woman who was tragically blinded at the age of two. Mun eventually gets a cornea transplant from an unknown donator from Thailand. While seeing an entire new world, Mun soon starts seeing things she is not supposed to. "I see dead people" strikes again. With the help of her doctor (Lawrence Chou), Mun starts investigating the origin of her new pair of fresh eyeballs.The storyline of THE EYE is old as dust. People getting cursed body transplants has been done to death. It is only a simple back-seat for creepy images and jump-out-of-your-seat moments. The first hour of the eye grabbed me from the imaginative DAREDEVIL-like opening titles to some of the scariest heart attack-inducing scenes I have ever witnessed. Even knowing they all depend on sudden bursts of orchestra in order to get really effective (RING remake comes to mind) they all succeed extremely well. And this is coming from a huge horror fan who was able to sit though many classics without flinching.After the first hour however, THE EYE soon goes back to familiar territory and one can't help to remember RING while watching it. Both movies feature a female character who gets somehow cursed (tape in RING, eye in EYE) and with the help of male side-kick, travels to a creepy isolated town to find out this story about this girl with weird powers that the town despised. It all builds up to a climax that failed to impress me on both horror and drama elements since I had seen it all before. However, one good similarity THE EYE and RING share is the secondary surprise climax. While it borrows from THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, the surprise scene is energetic and chilling at it's best. It still doesn't top the TV scene from RING, but this is not a RING vs EYE topic.I don't really mind that THE EYE borrows from many films. What I do mind is that no attempts are made for us to ignore that. At one moment, Mun realizes her doctor isn't taking her seriously and asks: "How can you help me if you don't believe me?" That would have been an effective line had not already been pronounced by Haley Joel Osement in THE SIXTH SENSE. And a serious car accident scary scene reminded me of GHOST so much that I couldn't take it without laughing.The energetic direction by the Pang Brothers allows some fast-pacing and excellent cinematography. The shaky camera and lack of color tricks have been done to death over the years, but it sure works. The overall gray and depressive mood of the film is sure felt and they sure know how to scare the audience. The Orange Music material is aggressive at best from the heavy main theme to the shock scenes, but during the dramatic moments it becomes cheesy and silly like it belongs to a Lifetime TV movie. What was that techno during the picture-taking scene? Maybe it is my Western ignorance and maybe that music might be considered good in the East.The fx-work that meets the eye (no pun intended) is a mixed bag. The ghost-involved CGI is handled well and with care. What becomes embarrassingly laughable are the effects used in the secondary climax. The tracking shot inside the engine and the slow-motion explosion look like they came from a video-game. But the scene itself is effective enough already, so it doesn't hurt that much.Unlike RING, THE EYE is not really in need for an American remake. The movie looks and sounds slick enough to have been produced by a major Hollywood studio. But it is Hollywood's assumption that English- speaking moviegoers can't read subtitles (maybe they are right) will not stop them from remaking foreign hits in the future. While there are elements in THE EYE that would sure help an improvement, it doesn't really need a remake. It is one scary thrill-ride that you might enjoy.(3.5/5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So what happens when you take "Blink", "The Sixth Sense", "The Ring", and "The Mothman Prophecies" and throw them in an Asian blender? You get the Pang Brother's "The Eye." Thanks to a compelling lead performance from Angelica Lee (who seems to be the Asian answer to Naomi Watts) and some stylish direction, the film rises above its own derivative nature. While there is a nice mood of ominous dread set from the get-go, most of the jolts, however, come from jarring music and camera tricks which makes them seem cheap. The ending falls a bit flat, and there is no sense of a cohesive lesson to be learned, despite some interesting Eastern-flavored philosophies strewn throughout the tale of a blind woman receiving a cornea transplant who then goes on to "see" some very troubling things. There is already a planned American remake, which is ironic since this film was so derivative of American thrillers that were already inherently derivative. Proof again that there isn't an original thought floating around out there in La-La Land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familar Eye leads to a new vision!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I guess the big question is how scary is The Eye? The anwser is This film pretty freaking scary. It's about a young woman who after a lifetime of not being able to see. Regains her sight after a cornea transplant. The only problem is that she's starting to see stuff. Ghosts. All around her! And I don't mean those pansy ghosts your used to seeing. Real ghosts, the p***ed off ones. The scene in the elevator takes suspense to a whole new level. Terrifying and thought provoking. The eye trances through familair terrirtory but it does it in a way so that it seems fresh and new. The performance of the lead actress is quite phenomenal. The Eye doesn't break any new grounds in the creative department but trickles suspense along it's rims like it's truly seeping from the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Eye is a genuinely creepy horror flick, which reminded of 'Ring' in the way it engulfs its audience with a sense of dread, slowly building to a compelling climax.A young woman undergoes an operation which gives her sight, for the first time in years. Everyone is happy, but then she starts seeing shadows and ghosts. When she looks in the mirror, it isn't her reflection looking back.I won't go into any more detail than that, but suffice to say that this is a very well made and sometimes frightening horror film. It makes me wonder just why our Asian cousins are so competent at making excellent horror movies, when Hollywood has little or no idea when it comes to understanding how to shock and scare an audience.Highly recommended - don't be put off by the subtitles, you soon get used to them (very quickly actually) and then the film takes over. Excellent stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Frightening as Advertised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Eye" is a good horror movie. It's good because it will scare you just as horror movies should. It is not overtly gory nor does it contain anyone hurting anyone else. It's just a simple story with lots of frightening scenes lurking around the corner. You'll probably be reminded of "The Sixth Sense," but don't dismiss this as an Asian carbon copy of that film. The two film's may have a similar premise but they are quite different in story and feel.I feel compelled to mention the Japanese movie "Ring" even though there is nothing to link the two films other than the Asian/Horror connection. Hopefully you are a moviegoer who is not a stranger to subtitles. So if you liked "Ring" and you made the effort to import the film, grab "The Eye." It works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT - there may be spoilers below - depends if you've seen the other movies I mention. As a seasoned horror movie watched I think I've seen pretty much everything and there's not a lot that fictional 2D images can do to unsettle me. Whether it was just the mood I was in or there were other factors to take into consideration - The Eye rattled me on more than one occasion. Derivative - specifically for western audiences - of The Sixth Sense, this does have two or three scenes of wonderful dread and suspense ("You're sitting in my chair"). Whilst it flags in its approach to the climax its worth the wait and pulls it off with much more flair and audience concern for the characters than the similar "Mothman Prophecies". Spectacular effects in places too. Off the point - why does everyone think The Exorcist is such a great horror flick when it's dull, empty Catholic propaganda with the occasional scene of outrage which are done much by the Italians anyway - it sucks! Give it up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, but average - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to put a one thing in perspective - horror/ghost is a majorHong Kong genre, and through out the years different variations ofthe "supernatural sight" theme flooded the market. Like otherHong Kong films, they are mostly dogged down by poor scriptsand production. There are plenty of cheap thrills, mostly of "ghosts"with exaggerated (sometimes even funny) makeup jump out ofnowhere to scare the audience. One can't help but be scared (ifthe scenes are done well), but the movies are hardly creepy. Thencame "The Sixth Sense" and "Ringu", which open up the possibilityof injecting creativity and human elements into this otherwise oldand tired genre. Now horror films can be "serious"."The Eye" is but one of those recent films from Hongkong and Asiathat follows this new trend. The more creative element is of theblind girl recovering her sight after a replacement surgery, only torealize that she also retains the supernatural power of the donor tosees "death people" and "dark shadows", the delivery men fromhell that come to take the spirits away from the material world.As any Hongkong Chinese can tell, stories about those "darkshadows" and the central theme - that spirits of people whocommitted suicides will linger on to repeat the horrifying acts untilthey can resolves the conflicts that made them killed themselves -are nothing new. Nor the other "ghosts" that our heroine sees,including the one who licks the foods on display in the openkitchen of a Chinese restaurant, the old man with half a face in thelift, the man standing in the middle of a busy high way, etc. Thosestories have already told numerous times in sleepovers andcamping trips when I was a kid that they are no longer scary.Having said that, it's still a rather good movie, and overseesaudience can probably get more mileages out of those "ghosts"than us from Hong Kong. Ah-Mun is capably played by AngelicaLee, though only she and her granny (played by Yin Ping-Ko) arethe convincing. Her love interest Doctor Wah (played by LawrenceChou), a psychiatrist, looks and acts like a 21-yr-old (he probablyis in real life). A total miscast. It also applies to another (male)doctor they meet in Thailand.Visually it is only so-so - not as good as the Pang Brothers' lastmovie "Bangkok Dangerous". The jerking camera works of scenesin the hospital in Thailand, for example, are more annoying thancreepy. Commercially though, it's a major success not just inAsian markets. It points to the new way for Asian directors/talentsto tip into Hollywood funding and recognition without beingswallowed up creatively. For that Mr. Peter Chan, the producer andpossibility one of the most influential non-American power broker/ director from Asia in Tinsel Town, must deserve the whole credit.For more or less the same theme, I personally enjoy "The InnerSense" more, a similar storyline (only it is told from the angle ofthe psychiatrist) with the late Leslie Cheung as the lead. Muchmore creepy even though the "ghosts" are just the imagination ofhis patient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-Key Effective little Chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>20 or 30 years ago, there would be a half-dozen odd unassumingly effective Horror thrillers like this EVERY year. Now, in the age of SCREAM and its "I'm too hip to be scared" brethren, a small film like THE EYE stands above the genre crowd. Yes, the film uses the old cliche about body parts "remembering" their former body. And, yes, it's a bit slow between "the scary parts". And, yes, there aren't too many surprises.  But, THE EYE is well made. Carefully directed and edited by the Pangs. The acting is decent for the most part. There's a chill or two. A good solid B-Picture. Too bad most recent Horror Films don't even come close to measuring up to this! USA remake here we come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 2nd Act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See this before Tom Cruise's company turns it into Hollywood schlock. The Eye is the latest of the Asian films to be bought up by the power brokers in Tinsel Town and like The Ring will probably be better in its original language. The Eye tells the story of a young, blind woman who receives the eyes of another to regain her sight. In the beginning all she sees is the out-of-focus shadows of people who may or may not actually be there. Once the film moves into its middle third, it reaches its peak. The Pang brothers do a marvelous job of bringing right you into the film and making you feel what it would be like to be about to see the spirits of the dead. There are a lot of parallels to The Sixth Sense, but with more of a Taoist spiritual aspect; however, even the Taoism is keep to a minimum as if the filmmakers are embarrassed by the beliefs in the script. This not only leaves the film a bit unsatisfying, but also leaves a couple of unresolved issues in the film. Beyond that though The Eye is a well-acted ghost story with a couple of scares in it. If only the feeling of the film's second act could have been expanded into the third, then it would have been a great ghost story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best, but very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had much in common with the Sixth Sense, in that cornea transplant patient Mun is able to see the ghosts of the recently and not so recently dead, as well as the spectral death figures who come to pick them up and take them to their reward. As she is recovering from her transplant, she begins to see more and more and wonder who and what they are. She speaks to them, not knowing that they are no longer alive, and in one terrifyingly intense scene, standing in an elevator near one of the restless undead. Very good scene.The movie takes a sharp turn in the second half of the film as we find out more on the origins of her corneas and the curse that comes with them, as it turns out she can see the specter of death show up before people are killed. She turns out to be a Cassandra, warning people about a doom, but unable to stop it. The ending is excellent, and has a very nuclear holocaust feel to it. I only gave this movie an 8, because it was so much like the Sixth Sense, and the first half is very slow, but man, the second half more than makes up for it. The friend that I saw it with said it had a lot to do with the Mothman Prophecies. I disagree, because unlike the Eye, I hated the Mothman Prophecies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to classic ghost story telling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Eye' (or "Jian Gui" - literally translated as "seeing ghosts") is a Hong Kong/Thailand/Singapore co-production directed by the Pang Brothers about a young woman, Mun, who had been blind for eighteen years, coping with sights she never bargained for after a successful corneal transplant. Not having seen anything for most of her life, Mun is at first confused by the strange shadows and people she begins to see - are they real or are they figments of her imagination? I absolutely LOVE the first half of this movie for several reasons. First, this movie is such a quintessentially urban Chinese ghost story, of the sort I used to listen to as a kid. Who amongst us urban Chinese living in Hong Kong or Singapore has never heard of the ghosts of suicides haunting the corridors of apartment blocks, of the ghosts of dead patients haunting hospitals, of hungry ghosts eating candles, of ghosts with long protruding tongues, of making offerings to the dead, of Taoist exorcists, or of strange passengers in the underground Metro? Second, this movie scares the audience by using absolutely minimal special effects or gore, relying simply on a thumping soundtrack and on the "spookiness" of the situations our heroine finds herself in e.g. venturing into a dimly lit hospital corridor and hearing the moans of a sickly woman and feeling her presence but not really seeing her, or venturing into an empty elevator and inexplicably finding a creepy old man in there moments later, or settling down for lunch at the local restaurant only to find the long dead wife and child of the cook turning up for a first taste. The elevator scene alone is worth the admission fee, and has me convinced NEVER EVER to get into an elevator by myself - the old man has minimal makeup to suggest he is missing the right side of his face, his feet is shown floating an inch above the elevator's floor, and he is slowly floating closer to an increasingly terrified Mun, and that is all the Pang Brothers need to have you clutching with fear at whoever is seating beside you in the cinema. Sadly, the second half of `The Eye' is a little formulaic and less interesting - Mun goes to Thailand to find out more about the donor from whom she had inherited her terrible curse - although the climatic Armageddon-like scene near the end is on par with anything Hollywood can come up with. I'll definitely be getting this movie on DVD. Apparently Tom Cruise has bought the rights to remake `The Eye' for Western audiences. Hopefully, the remake will retain many of the truly oriental flavors of this fine horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really creepy film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a really creepy film! Asian horror films (particularly Japanese films) are not necessarily for the typical American horror film fan. They tend to be psychological horrors rather than slasher films, absent of endless streams and splatters of fake blood. Their appeal is in building a tension between shock scenes - an appeal that many of the posters here seem to have missed. This film was not lacking in nervous tension but still didn't have the obligatory slashing to broaden its appeal to western audiences. Contrary to one poster's way-off-the-mark comments - THIS IS NOT A JAPANESE HORROR FILM! It doesn't take a genius to figure that out from the beginning. It does rely on the same formula that is characteristic of Japanese horror films. If that formula works for you, you will certainly enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this because I've literally watched all the other movies showing for the week. This was a toss up with another movie THE RING 2. I eventually watched the latter film but on a VCD. In retrospect, I thought I made the right choice watching THE EYE on the big screen. :)This is a low-budget movie but despite it, this movie was effective in terms of course with its purpose of, well, scaring the hell out of people. Coming from someone who firmly doesn't believe in ghosts, the supernatural and even the existence of a god (whew), I think you should take my review seriously, no kidding. And I'd say, this movie gave me the chills I haven't experienced from a horror movie for the last 5 years or so! I'd say very few movies are able to evoke this feeling for me and this one made from Asia, just did it. Take note, it's NOT from hollywood.Excellent camera angles and shots. Excellent use of shades. Excellent focus on facial expressions and attention to details. Mawkish plot ending (as expected of Asian products). Great concept. But of course, I still don't believe in ghosts that's for sure. A 3.5/4 for excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ghost story with no sex and no cigarettes. Hollywood, take notice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film and I'm a little amused by many of the comments about it. Some commenters seem to think this is a Japanese movie, some wonder why if the action takes place in Thailand is everyone speaking Chinese, one commenter said her doctor seemed too young to be an eye surgeon and suggested the casting was just so that he could be her romantic interest.Some of the commenters don't seem to have been paying attention.This is a Hong Kong/Thailand production, not Japanese. The tip-off is that in the HK scenes they are speaking Chinese and all the signs are in Chinese; in the Thailand scenes, everything is in Thai (except that the psychotherapist speaks English at the hospital until he meets a doctor who speaks Mandarin).The eye surgeon seemed about the right age and is NOT the romantic interest. The psychotherapist whose role is to help her to relearn her visual vocabulary (great scene with the stapler, by the way) becomes the romantic interest.How can I take any comments seriously by people who can't get those basic facts correct?Here are my own comments:It's refreshing to see a movie containing no sex and no cigarettes. Hollywood productions (with the exception of Shyamalan and few others) always contain both. American horror movies since the 50s ALWAYS have some unnecessary risque material and those from the 70s on up have at least one unnecessary nude scene. I have no objection to sex but it is only part of life and most American movies seem to think it is all of life. I do, however, object to cigarettes because they kill tens of thousands of human beings every year, directly and indirectly, in the service of corporate greed. I have suspected for years that the American tobacco companies are secretly helping to bankroll Hollywood movies and I think someone should investigate what amounts to an insidious form of advertising.****POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD*****The Eye requires the viewer to bring some intelligence and some knowledge of Asian culture to it. Of course, it is marketed in the US and elsewhere as a "horror" film, because it shares some elements of the horror genre. I didn't find it very horrifying, but it was creepy and definitely moody. In some ways I was reminded of Ann Fadiman's book The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, about the clash of traditional Asian and modern Western views of illness in the case of an epileptic Hmong child in California. Within the cultural context, the decision for Mun to go to Thailand halfway through makes sense and the importance of such a move is foreshadowed in the meeting of the Taoist and the parents whose child committed suicide over a lost report card. His prescription for closure is to find the report card and burn it so the child can have it in the spirit world. Actually, I found the scene of the spirit boy eating candles left at his shrine to be one of the film's most poignant and horrifying moments.One jarring element for me was the instant and growing romantic attachment of the therapist and his patient. In the US, such a relationship is not only ethical, in many cases it would lead to loss of license. Maybe things are different in HK.Bottom line is that it is a well-made entertaining movie that, like most international movies, is doomed to fail at the American box office for reasons too numerous to mention here. I also shudder to think what Hollywood will turn this film into. Hopefully not starring Ashton Kutscher and Reese Witherspoon and renamed "Dude, Where's My Eyes?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm just a jaded horror fan. I have seen "The Exorcist" innumerable times and countless stalker/serial killer/Asian horror films and I can honestly say that the for me, the ads for "The Eye" are pure hype. Good grief! I had the same reaction when avoiding the hype of "Blair Witch Project." You have to be pretty impressionable and weak to be frightened by "The Eye." That's my take on the fear factor.But this does definitely NOT discount the film as a well-made poignant and touching horror film. The main character has had a corneal transplant and in "Sixth Sense" style simply sees dead people. Girl, don't freak out! It's a gift, honey. To be able to predict accidents and death before they happen and to be able to converse with with the dead is a gift of ESP and sensitivity to the other world.The Pang Brothers have in my mind brought to light a supernatural love story of how one live human is able to see and relate to the residents of the hereafter. In addition to "The Sixth Sense," "The Eye" bears a similar resemblance to "Beetlejuice" and "Ghost" without the humor. Especially when that boy runs right through Mun. I thought of Whoopi Goldberg and how she warned the ghost never to do that to her again.There is very moving relations with Ying Ying and the little boy in the hallway and especially her encounter with the eye donor who also had the gift which others did not understand and for which she was scorned.All in all, I was very touched by all this and yet the underlying love story of Mun and Dr. Lo was somhow superficial. However, I prefer another HK horror flick in the same vein as going much further without the horror and hype. I speak of the late Leslie Chung's last film, "Inner Senses" which was foreboding in predicting this actor's own suicide. I wonder about the line in "The Eye" about a soul of one who commits suicide not being to rest unless the reason is brought out and resolved. The moral: try to understand people's pain and misery before they leave this world as a memory.But by all means go see, "The Eye."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you tell the difference between ghosts and living people if you've never seen any of them before?This film (which is based on a real story) is about a 19 year old blind girl, Mun (played by the beautiful Lee Sin-Je), who after an eye surgery is able to see again.It is quite interesting how the directors try to show us the world through Mun's new eyes and how she tries to tell the differences between objects and people. We soon learn that Mun possesses a power which combined with her ability to see has turned her life into a nightmare. We follow Mun while she tries to find an answer to her problems and the end while a sad one is rewarding because it makes us understand that everyting happens for a reason (especially when Mun says that she will never wonder again why she has to be blind). The Eye is a beautiful story and a rather refreshing view on ghost stories.</fullReview>

Though the ending isn't the movie's strong point, the film up to that point is genuinely creepy and warrants viewing by anyone who enjoys cinematic scares. The plot itself, even with a slightly tenebrous premise, is still strong and carries the movie. Art direction is slightly above-average, but it's the suspense that really gives this movie its deserved '8.' Find this movie and watch it in the dark -- it's worth it!</fullReview>

I'd agree with the other posters that the first part of the movie was the best and scariest, but the last part was nothing to scoff at. and did the last scene remind anyone else of Mothman? anyway, i definetly recommend everyone to see this movie at least once, possibly a second time if youre brave enough. that elevator scene (and the calligraphy scene too) was possibly the best example of asian horror movies being able to scare much better than hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "The Eye" last night. The plot is nothing that hasn't been done before. It's the old tried and true someone gets a transplant of something on their body and immediately begins to have problems or suffer due to the transplant. In this case, a young woman gets a cornea transplant so she can see again. Almost immediately after having the bandages removed, she starts seeing things and starts getting scared.As the movie goes on, she learns that she is seeing things from the 1st person perspective of the deceased donor where her corneas came from. The acting is average at best. Some of the cinematography shows some signs of originality but never seems to consistently go anywhere with it. This film is like a Taiwanese 6th Sense to a point. I must say that the finale explosion was done very well. I was impressed with that. Overall, you could do worse than this, but don't look for any lasting effects after you've watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK. This wasn't a good idea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I said this wasn't a good idea, I meant that it wasn't a good idea to watch it alone and then be left alone. Too many Hollywood flicks overuse that slasher horror stereotype so this movie is a refreshing change. It relies on the simple story of how a cornea transplant meant to give sight to a blind girl isn't all that life saving as it seems to be. It also gives you an insight on how the culture is like in Asia as reflected by the cornea donor who was ostracised for having the 'gift'. Don't be put off by the sentimental tone in the beginning of the movie. Just watch it and you'll find yourself covering your face but glued to your seat. This is probably the best horror movie I've seen in a long time. It really spooked me that as much as I'd like to see it again, I don't think I will in a long time to come. Not alone anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very creepy at times, but conversely, very cheesy at times. Specifically the use of the score was what hindered it at times. I've noticed this in several Chinese movies, sort of the over the top Yanni type music during 'sensitive emotional' scenes. But over all, that was my only issue with the film. It seems quite the trend to compare the movie to The Ring, though they are totally different stories, from different countries. The movie is more like Sixth Sense if any comparisons are to be made. Though I found The Sixth Sense and The Ring far more suspenseful and tense, The Eye was creepier than Ringu. The elevator scene is enough to drive anyone batty!8/10 [5-8-5.net]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying(May contain small spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this movie at a free screening. I have seen a lot of films, be they American, Asian, French, Italian, etc. And I have seen a lot of horror films(see above). Before this movie the scariest movie I had seen was Hideo Nakata's Dark Water. But after seeing this masterpiece, it will take a lot of effort for a film-maker to even come close. The pacing, score, camera angles, pretty much everything about this movie was perfect. There was not one moment during the film that I did not feel an overwhelming sense of dread. And there are at least three scenes which sent absolute chills up my spine. Admittedly the Pang brothers(Hong Kong directors, not Japanese, get your Asian countries right) do wear there inspirations on their sleeves. The elevator scene reeks of the best of Hitchcock. People could draw comparisons between this and the inferior Sixth Sense. But this movie far surpasses any ideas that may be similar. I will not be able to walk down a hospital hallway, or ride in an elevator alone again. Not only is this a great horror film, but a great film in general. See it, if you are a fan of "cinema" you will see what i mean, but I have to end this because "I am so hungry". 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie begins with a very weird atmosphere, and goes on to describe the details of a blind girl getting a cornea transplant thus giving her the ability to see. However she starts to see some very weird things, like a angry girl charging at her from out of nowhere, then dead people start to appear all around her.The movie has a good storyline if you pay really good attention to it. However the ONLY scary thing about it is the atmosphere created by the music.Overall a very entertaining movie.Watch it if you like strange movies, stay away from it if you don't like getting scaried.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed that many imdb users (mostly the western viewers) compare this awesome movie to 'The Ring'/'Ringu'..just because both are ASIAN films!..Don't do that, please!..Firstly, Ringu is a JAPANESE film (get that clear, SUPERUNKNOWN..sheesh!) whereas The Eye (TE) is a HongKong/a bit of Thai production. Secondly, Ringu (including the Hollywood mistake..oops, I mean remake) is NOTHING!..nothing compared to this very clever piece. Ringu is nothing but a sleep fest until the 'grand finale' ending (you know..the TV!!) but TE keeps one interested (and scared silly lol!) through out. My homegirl, Angelica did a fantastic job and everyone back home is soooo proud of her. She should even WIN AN OSCAR (eat your heart out, Nicole!)..To those who have yet seen this movie, trust me..you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>effective chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Eye" is a very well-crafted and elegant chiller, with a number of interesting ideas. The lead character, played by the wonderful Lee Sin-Je, is very sympathetic and carries this film with little or no help from other co-stars. It is a fine example of the new generation of horror films that combine economically used "jump-out-of-your-seat" shocks with atmosphere and mood, begun by "The Sixth Sense" and continued by such modern classics as "The Devil's Backbone" and "The Others." Like those films, it uses horror not as the driving force of the story, but as a backdrop to other, more earthly dramas; "The Sixth Sense" was as much about a troubled kid in a single-parent family as it was about ghosts, "The Devil's Backbone" was as much a domestic tragedy as a horror story. In this case, the story is of a blind girl suddenly given sight, and finding that she is unable to cope with her ability. The fact that she also sees ghosts is almost incidental; you feel just as devistated when she realises she can no longer play with her orchestra, because she is no longer blind. Also, like "The Devil's Backbone", this film shows that computer graphics are levelling the playing field internationally in visual effects, and that Hollywood-standard production values are now within the reach of any international fimmaker. That would mean nothing if the directors (The brilliantly named Danny and Oxide Pang) did not use them well, but they do. They unleash some incredible, and incredibly realistic, visuals in this film, and clearly know how to scare an audience with them. "The Eye"'s principal flaw, I'm afraid, is that it is simply too similar to other films; the "blind girl given sight who sees visions" plot has been done before (in Michael Apted's "Blink"), the "seeing dead people" shtick was used up by "The Sixth Sense", and the end bares a striking (though probably unintentional) similarity to "The Mothman Prophecies". That said, this film is good enough to stand on its own without those narrative riffs, and is well-worth your time. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch way too many horror movies, and I haven't actually been SCARED by one since I first watched The Shining. But MAN, this movie scared the crap out of me. I had to pause the movie after the calligraphy scene because it scared the ever loving crap out of me. The people who compare this to The Sixth Sense need to stop. The only thing similar is "seeing dead people", which there have been plenty of movies BESIDES The Sixth Sense that DIDN'T suck that have used the same idea. The Sixth Sense is NOT a horror movie, it's a sappy family drama with slight suspense that never goes anywhere (the ghosts look so cheesy I don't see how they could scare anyone), and uses a "hip" twist ending that all Hollywood movies use these days. If you hate The Sixth Sense, but want to see a movie along the lines of good REAL horror such as The Devil's Backbone and Session 9, but much much better and scarier, see this.I hope to God that Tom Cruise decides not to re-make it. I hope that he AT LEAST has the decency to change the name, so I can at least watch this movie without feeling like a film snob, unlike with Ringu (although this film is much much better than Ringu).9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever did the sound of this film is a genius. While most horror films attempt to scare the audience, they usually fail. And this film points out why. While you can make the scariest imagery around, if you don't have the sound to back it up, it's worthless. The combination of these two being combined so well lead to a constant uneasy feeling throughout the film, regardless of seeing "scares" coming a thousand miles away. That's difficult. Yeah, there is a relationship theme in this film that's rather unnecessary and comes off as cheesy, but it's really unimportant. This film was made to make you feel uncomfortable, and it does just that. Extremely well crafted and worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sixth Sense meets Final Destination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The skeletal layout of The Eye is somewhat as follows - a girl who has been blind for 18 years undergoes a cornea transplant operation that results in her ability to see dead people.Anyone expecting a Ringesque creep-out might be heavily disappointed, as this film plays more like a supernatural thriller rather than a horror. And perhaps that is intention of the directors. But there are few moments of geniune eerieness that raise the goosebump level a bit. Technical credits are absolutely superb, and you might be forgiven to assume that it is a Hollywood product. The climax is a visual treat boasting impressive SFX, camerawork and editing. This film has been deftly handled with some excellent perfomances from the leads.I would like to add though, that this movie is not a Japanese film, as some of the commentators have mistakenly taken it to be. It is a Honk Kong/Thailand product.For those of you seeking a Ringesque ride, I'd advise you look elsewhere, but if you do wanna be entertained, then the Eye could be your cup of tea.</fullReview>

The Eye tells us the story of a woman that gets an operation of cornea transplant and all of a sudden starts to see things that are actually not there, shadows...Ghosts!!!! I know you have see this before (I see dead people) but now it is really creepy and cool,no more kiddie stuff, no more half assed scares, this movie is the real deal, Do what i did, watch it with friends and be happy its only a movie because it will scare your witts out,This movie takes where "Ringu" Left off and goes further into scaring people, if you liked the Ring...go ahead and pop this baby into your VCR...If you DARE!

		<fullReview>Ok, this movie freaked me out. Especially the mirrorscene when she finds out what she really looks like. The movie Ringu started this whole new asian wave of horrorflicks some very original but many of them very poor (e.g. Tomei). The Eye though is very good. It reminded me of the movie Blink and I think the Brothers Pang saw that movie and saw the wasted potential that movie had. Unfortunately I have to say that The Eye has some wasted potential too. The ending like many people say could have been much much better. It looks like there's gonna be a Hollywood remake and this remake could actually work especially when they come up with a good ending.I'll end with 2 remarks: 1- keep your eyes on the directors. The Brothers Pang are going places. 2- keep your eyes on Thai cinema. Very interesting stuff.

		<fullReview>In this rather slickly made thriller, a blind girl receives a corneal transplant. Once she is able to see, she becomes aware that she can see ghosts. And not just any ghosts: she sees the soon-to-be-but-not-yet-dead. Turns out her eyes were from a suicide victim with Cassandra-like visions of death and destruction. Talk about a botched operation.This is fairly standard HK fare. It's well made and has a very Hollywood look to it (especially the apocalyptic ending). It's enjoyable, if not derivative of several films, up to the point where the girl visits the mother of the cornea donor. The movie comes off the tracks for a while, but gets back on for the ending. All and all, an enjoyable watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't close your eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a blind girl transplanted an eye, what is supposed she going to see? What if all she could manage to saw is an eerie situation that only freaked her up. Is she going to resist her brand new eye or she just stand still? That's the question revolved around `The Eye', the fresh Horror film from The Pang Brothers. The Asian horror film demonstrate it own class lately, with being different what Horror films tend to do (usually influence by those Hollywood characteristic). It proves that the Asian films is a lot scarier and has more dark atmospheres on it. Furthermore, `The Eye' also provides enough drama to occurs, and that make this film step a head than the previous as an elegant flick. The Pang Brothers did a superb job. With plain visualization, simple plot (but deep in the sense) and scary score, `The Eye' manages to make the audiences stiff on the edge of their seat. But, don't close your eyes, even you are frightening a lot, because you will lose your grip to the pace.The rumor that being held that `The Eye' is going remake by Hollywood, like they did to `Ringu' (a.k.a. `The Ring'). I hope they (The Hollywood) still could cling to it original aura and run it as good as this.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pang brothers are getting the wrong rep...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pang brothers' 1999 `Bangkok Dangerous' was an intriguing, offbeat, somewhat post-Wong Kar Wai film about a sensitive deaf mute hit man. I loved the way the young hero relived his meetings with his new girlfriend entirely by gesture, back in his lonely bed. This new Pang brothers story about a woman whose corneal transplant causes her to become as clairvoyant as the corneas' previous owner, with wrenching results, leading up to an extraordinary disaster that she cannot prevent, certainly shows an offbeat imagination on the part of this part Taiwan, part Thai team. They seek to work in a popular vein, but with fresh twists.In London `The Eye' was touted as a stunning horror film, and people seem to see it that way. It is rather horror, if horror at all, in the vein of Edgar Allen Poe, horror as horribly heightened sensitivities, of being trapped in a painful consciousness, of living on the edge of neurasthenia. Most of what's going on is interior (much as the `Bangkok Dangerous' hit man's world was interior because of his inability to hear or speak). Here, the young woman who gets the transplant has been blind since childhood, so she, like the hit man, has been cut off from the rest of the world. When she gets the transplant from the dead woman who foresaw disasters and begins to see new ones herself, it's as if the disability of `Bangkok Dangerous' has been grafted onto M. Night Shyamalan's `Sixth Sense.' There is a lot of film expended to show what's going on inside the young woman's head. Is this a skillful use of special effects, or mere clumsiness? You be the judge. `Bangkok Dangerous' didn't require more than a few flashbacks. We could experience what it was like to be the hit man just by watching him, and by an altered sound track, as in the clever recent French film, `Sur mes l?vres' (`Read My Lips') by Jacques Audiard.In some ways `The Eye' is technically sophisticated, but the premise is hokey, and the young actors are rather too bland. The young woman is generic. Her doctor is a cute young man, chosen not for charisma or believability but as a good romantic partner her when circumstances increasingly throw them together. It is hard to believe that he is old enough to perform eye surgery, but he certainly cares for his patient. If only doctors `followed up' to this extent in real life, the lovelorn among us would all be off to our local ophthalmology clinic.The blending of Chinese and Thai elements in this UK/HongKong/Singapore/Thailand film is also confusing in `The Eye,' at least for all those of us who are not Asian polymaths. Why is the action set in Thailand but with everybody speaking in Chinese? If one is interested in character and setting and not just generic thrills, as in a video game, these things matter.However, the final sequence of the unavoidable disaster is truly surreal and hellish. Too bad the preceding events are so sleep-inducing. It is to be hoped that Oxide Pang Chun and Danny Pang will hit their stride again and not be seduced by the claims of various viewers and critics that they are good at horror. This is neither good, nor a horror film. For something really extraordinary, not to say unforgettable, in this vein, see Kiyoshi Kurasawa's `Kyua,' or `Cure' (1997), which cunningly and unforgettably blends elements of neurosthenia and horror with mysterious powers and serial killing. Bingo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest film that I have ever seen. Moreso than Ring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the Japanese film 'Ring' - I thought that it was superbly made and truely terrifying; then I saw 'The Eye'.I had heard about 'The Eye' from a 'Ring' website and was expecting a similar kind of film, however 'The Eye' surpasses 'Ring' in so many ways.It is terrifying (like 'Ring', not in a blood and gore type way) to the extent that you want to look away from the screen yet are compelled to continue watching. The way that the movie is filmed is superb (with very clever use of camerawork after Mun has had her operation and sees only blurry images) and the soundtrack is phenomenal as it keeps you on the edge of your chair throughout the film.Everything builds and builds to the point where Mun begins to witness a terrible event that is analogous to something that pushed the previous owner of her eyes over the edge - this in itself is perhaps the greatest climax of any film that I have ever seen.As well as being well filmed and planned there is also a clever sub-plot which explores societies attitudes towards suicide and this helps to explain why it isn't happy 'spirits' that Mun can see.All in all, there are not enough good things that I can say about this film, however on the downside I did feel that Muns Grandmother, Sister and The Taoist had more to give to the film, yet this was never explored to it's utmost.You will need to wear rubber pants to watch this film and you will need to change them after you see what happens when Mun is advised that "You're in my chair".

		<fullReview>This film, the Pang Brothers' second feature, is an accomplished piece of work. It benefits chiefly from the directors' stylish visuals and an empathetic central performance by Lee Sin-jie, surely destined for great things. Although the dialogue is at times cheesy and a contrived romance subplot superfluous, these are more than compensated for by effective crystalization of the "horror elements". A couple of these scenes, in particular, are positively hair-raising! Ostensibly part of the horror genre, two-thirds into the film, it changes gear abruptly, becoming essentially action-disaster. This "twist" may well have been used by other films, but it is not wholly inappropriate in The Eye and is, in fact, unexpectedly pleasing. To sustain horror tension right to the end would have been near impossible. The climax, unfolding relatively slowly, is horrifying in its own sort of way and attempts some sort of closure for the central character. All-in-all, a satisfying treat. I'm not looking forward to the Hollywood remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i reckon that its quite a good movie...but only on the first half or so....the horror they tried to build is kinda useless it the final scenes..(love the lift scene tho...^^;)..if u compare it to Ringu, the SFX in Ringu is better(hail Kenji Kawai!), the final scenes is also better in Ringu (those who have watched Ringu should know what i mean)....even i think that the final "horror" in The Eye is actually disappointing....now about the story....i dunno why but it reminds me a lot of The Sixth Sense...the "I can see dead people" stuff...(ok...maybe the 6th sense is also not the first movie with that theme...its just what came out of my mind right now)...just scarier in some parts...(cant forget how the girls screamed in the caligraphy class "incident"...hahaha)ok...conclusion...this is a movie that want to be as scary as Ringu with The sixth sense approachment but even tho they kinda fail to recreate the final touch...but its not really THAT bad.btw...please forgive me and my bad english...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although quite reminiscent of "The Sixth Sense", this amazing thriller stands on its own, rising above and beyond the now unoriginal ideas first presented in that late summer blockbuster."The Eye" has a style all its own, especially when dealing with a story that seems like you have probably seen a million times. ("The Eyes of Laura Mars" cries out for some reason, although it has been many years since I have seen it.) The filmmakers have created an atmosphere that is creepy, unsettling, and often, downright scary. Added to that is a chilling score which provides the icing on the cinematic cake.POSSIBLE SPOILER: While there is no "surprise ending", like those that have seemingly become required for American films, the climax is nevertheless explosive, reinforcing everything that has preceeded it. And the "epilogue" seems perfectly natural, finishing things off in a very satisfying fashion.I am probably not properly expressing how much I enjoyed "The Eye". I just hope that it is not re-made in the United States like every effective foreign film seems to be. But wait... there are already others like it; funny how none of them even compare!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it ever comes to your city, do watch this movie. It is a creepy horror movie that's bound to give you a few shocks.Basically, the storyline goes like this: a blind girl gets a cornea transplant so that she would be able to see again. However, she got more than what she bargained for when she realised she could even see ghosts. And some of these ghosts are down right unfriendly. So she embarks on a journey to find the origins of her cornea and to reveal the history of the previous dead owner ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all bodily organs exploited by filmmakers, it's the eyes that come in for most punishment. It's easy to see why: not only are they wonderfully expressive, they're also vulnerable as hell, as Luis Bunuel ably demonstrated in an infamous sequence from Un Chien Andalou. Here, the Pang brothers, Danny and Oxide (Bangkok Dangerous), take the idea of an organ transplant patient who takes on the donor's characteristics and stoke the fear-factor up through a judicious mix of sight, sound, and horrendously creepy atmospherics.Lee Sin-Jie plays Mun, blind since the age of two, but now the happy owner of a pair of used corneas; until the ghastly visions of mortality come slithering into view. These include strange, black-clad figures leading the recent dead into the afterlife, levitating spirits (during a scene that may prevent you stepping into empty elevators ever again), and the disturbing fact that the face gazing back in the mirror isn't hers, but that of the donor - who, wouldn't you know it, was a tortured young woman with clairvoyant powers that drove her to suicide.Sporting much less a plot than a series of relentless, sensory-battering set pieces, each creepier than the last, The Eye's general effect - courtesy of Simon So's art direction and Oxide Pang's soundtrack - is akin to being strapped into an unstoppable, unsettling ghost train ride.Remade with Jessica Alba: "I see no audiences."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrifying horror film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that The Eye was a great film and very creepy. In Hong Kong an eighteen years old blind girl called Wong Kar Mun gets a cornea transplant so that she will be able to see again. She has been blind since she was two years old. She has to have a surgery of cornea transplantation, and while recovering from the operation, she realises that she is seeing dead people. With the help of Dr. Wah, Mun tries to find who was the donor of her eyes and resolve the mystery of her visions. So she goes on a journey to find the origins of her cornea and to reveal the history of the previous owner. This was a terrifying horror film, with some parts being the most scary i have ever seen in a horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping and expecting this would be a good movie, but I wasn't quite prepared for the experience of watching it...It was like being twelve again, watching Robert Wise's masterpiece The Haunting alone in a new house in a new country... tense, rapt, barely blinking, unsettled, moved and basically in love! Immersive, emotional, beautiful and solidly written, this films suffers from none of the faults commonly ascribed to either Hong Kong cinema or to horror movies. The premise and script are equally strong, and while it's not plot-driven by any means the conclusion is immensely powerful and satisfying in a way few horror films can pull off.Lee Sin-Je is a beautiful and extremely talented actress, whose mannerisms and body language reminded me very strongly of the sight-impaired people I've known, and her performance as Ah Mun could easily have carried the whole thing.But although the character of Ah Mun is the centrepoint and driving force of the film, she didn't have to - the secondary characters, from Lawrence Chou as Dr Wah on down to the wordless presence of Chutcha Rujinanon as Ah Ling, are uniformly well-played and unusually rounded considering how briefly we meet some of them.(I was a disappointed that Ah Mun's granny had so little to do - I love character actors and old people in movies, and she's great!)Even the ghosts have personality.The FX are excellent - sometimes horrifying, often intensely creepy - and the Pang Brothers direct with just the right amount of flash and fire. They know when to hold a shot, when to focus on a facial expression, when to move slowly... and when to go for the throat, too!The film also makes excellent use of its multinational origins, though it may be a little obscure to Westerners who can't tell HK from Thailand or Cantonese from Thai. Even the sound design and music in this film are outstanding.The Eye has instantly joined the likes of The Wicker Man and Chakushin Ari on my list of all-time favourite horror movies, and I would recommend this unhesitatingly to any fan of sober, intelligent horror.It's rather sad that there's an American remake. Like Chakushin Ari, Ring, The Wicker Man and even a slew of my favourite American horror movies (from The Haunting to Dawn of the Dead), the remake misses the point and dilutes the original vision almost to the point of irrelevance.The only purpose served by these remakes is to present the film to the laziest and least interested audience (and, of course, to make money for people who already have plenty), so take my advice with this as with all those others: watch the original, avoid the remake!Update: A while back as a part of our "Friday 13th Horror Weekend" this movie became the first horror film my daughter watched from start to finish, and I thought it'd be nice to add that she liked it almost as much as I did! Truly, an 11-year-old with excellent taste!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is excellent suspense and understated with believable acting. Mun, a girl who was previously blind, has an operation, and begins to see, not just normally, but paranormal visions, and dead spirits.It seems that these type of films are well done by Asian film-makers, and then 5 or so years later we in America get a watered down version with bad acting (i.e. Sarah Michelle Gellar in "The Grudge").The visuals in this film are intense, and recurring. Mun lives with her grandmother and sees her ophthalmologist and psychiatrist regularly. Her new found sight becomes more and more surreal and frightening, as does the world around her.The sets are intriguing and frightening. Lawrence Chou as Dr. Wah is very good, and Mun eventually falls for him. There is a mystery also which is to be solved involving a young girl, Ling, who died mysteriously.Overall this film is worth owning on DVD, and the director and writer deserve credit. I will NOT be watching the U.S. version. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is fairly simple; a young woman, who has been blind since the age of two, has just undergone a cornea transplant and is now able to see again (after a short case of myopia passes, that is). Well, she certainly can see now, even more than she wants to. Creepy visions of human figures haunt her everywhere she goes. Yep, she sees dead people?and strangely enough, hears them too. The similarities between this flick and The Sixth Sense (and others) are rather obvious but that's not to say The Eye is without merit. It does feature a few nice scares, my favorite being the ghost with the chair, and the ending (a mix of Sixth Sense and Mothman Prophecies) had some good, disturbing visuals. In the end though, The Eye is not better than the films it is compared to (though it is better than several other supernatural Asian flicks). The Eye also has some very weak CGI at times, on the level of a ghost on some "Unexplained Mysteries" TV show. Regardless, if you enjoy these kind of movies, The Eye should not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She should have gone to Specsavers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Eye is a well-crafted Asian horror flick which, while perhaps not deserving of the reputation it currently enjoys, provides some terrific moments of suspense. Like most of its Eastern counterparts, The Eye relies on developing the story slowly, gradually upping the tension while keeping the story firmly rooted in a recognisable world. There are no sex-hungry teens charging blindly around a deserted house/summer camp/department store etc, and no real monsters or villains. The film's chief flaw, however, is that it runs out of steam long before its spectacular - and largely superfluous - final act. The resolution of Mun's (Angelica Lee) predicament - seeing the dead after receiving the cornea of a dead psychic girl - comes across as forced and unconvincing and something of a letdown, and you get the impression that it wasn't felt to be a dramatic enough note on which to end the story. The other unnecessary moment is the ghostly face in the window of the subway train that was allegedly unnoticed by the film crew: cheap trick, guys - whoooh, reeeallyy scary.Despite these quibbles, a wonderfully creepy atmosphere pervades the entire film, and the viewer can really sympathise with Mun's plight as the Pang brothers introduce the worldly ghosts in imaginative ways: the spooks Mun sees are rarely threatening but they are terrifying to see, and can appear at any moment: a small schoolboy turns around in astonishment after running through our heroine to see his body lying in the road, victim of a car crash; another young boy-ghost searches vainly for his report card; an old man floats around in a lift, his feet inches off the floor (in a particularly tense and creepy sequence). Poor Mun never knows when - or why - these ghosts will materialise, and their intrusion into the mundane surroundings of her everyday world are what makes this film so atmospheric. Comparisons with the Sixth Sense are obvious - that film and the Pang brother's other influences are pretty plain to see - but, with great use of sound and stylish cinematography, The Eye manages to stand out as a well-made and enjoyable feature in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are you sitting in my chair?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This bizarre little horror film is a treat for Asian horror fans in it's own little way. It has something about it that separates it from Into the mirror or Phone. The plot is about a blind girl who has an eye transplant and swaps eyes with a girl who died and by connecting everything up doctors believe they can make her see again. It works, however what she she's isn't always what is really there. The creepy scenes are real edge-of-the-seat stuff (the man in the lift)and although the end is a bit OTT the shocks delivered in throughout are great. One of the most frightening scenes in any Asian horror film, the "sitting in my chair" scene builds up no suspense but hits you when your not expecting it. Another great Asian horror flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found The Eye highly recommended, and when I saw it at the local Tower store I quickly snatched it up. All I knew was that it was about a blind girl who gets a cornea transplant, and with the cornea comes the supernatural ability to see things that normal people can't see, namely dead people. Right off the bat I'm thinking about Sixth Sense, but I, of course, give the film the benefit of the doubt. 6th Sense was kind of scary... not really, but you know what I mean. Enough to get you to blink here and there. People were telling me this move would make me drop a brick in my pants. Alrighty then...So anyhow, the girl, Mun, sees dead people who are either on their way to whereever dead people go (they are escorted by faceless people clad in black) which could be heaven (but I'd be assuming on that one), or dead people who are not ready to leave the human plane and continue to stay here, repeating their tragic deaths until the main character can help them out of it.None of it is really scary. Even at the scariest parts you have to ask yourself, what is the worst thing that that ghost can do to her? I mean, they just aren't intimidating. You know, in The Ring (yes, we have to compare it to The Ring), we see first hand just what the evil ghost can do. That ghost will mess you up ugly. These ghosts from The Eye, however, are just obnoxious. One of them keeps jumping out the window because he can't find his report card. I say GOOD. Keep jumping. These ghosts aren't evil. They're weird, or stupid, or obnoxious. Compare it to Thirteen Ghosts - people are in a house with ghosts that will kill you. Ghosts that are evil. That's scary. You know what, even The Others was scarier than The Eye. The ghosts in The Eye are either suicidal or victims of some sort. Not a single sadistic killer. (-_-) zzZZZHence I find this movie overrated. It's simply not scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What makes Asian horror films superior is their reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to understanding the creepiness, I think Asian film makers have better grasp of horror than their western counter parts.There are no statistics about the number of Asians vs Westerners about their ghostly encounters during their youth, but many places in Asia seems to be naturally haunted (like the hospital in this movie), and percentage of people who have direct experience with ghosts may be higher there. The creepiness of many good Asian horror films are based on these first hand experience, only amplified about ten times. They really know how to hit your subconscious fear. On the other hand, Western horror films seems to be focused more on physical violence (like seen in "1408"), which really isn't as terrifying.The Eye is good, because the horror is intensely personal. We can really emphasize with the fear of the main character. This is an excellent film that has no violence, but still has high creepiness factor to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked up this release from Asia due to claims, that this can be considered as Psychological Horror. I already had Kansen which I liked (good story) and thus I decided to get my hands on this film.I do have a reasonable dose of fear from supernatural and this movie was just my cup of ectoplasm, because that's what I like in Horror - to fear. I really enjoyed the work of writer and actors, and cinematography in general, as well as music, which were some kind of unusual for a horror title, and that is good, in my opinion (enhances the weirdness of Asian horror). The story is with some kind of used aroma (seen before here and there), but the cinematography really enhanced this story and the creatures/characters gave a pretty BIG dose of horror to me - great!I do not categorize this movie to be a Psychological Horror in general, but there are some pieces in this title, that may lead to such classification, and these scenes were done just beautifully and very nicely scary.A surprisingly nice and BIG slice of horror and chills for all fans of Asian horror (J-Horror), which reminded me some Silent Hill and Fatal Frame concepts. Good movie, really good, I loved it from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally rented the Pang Brother's The Eye. IMO, The Eye has gotten a little more hype than it deserves. Not to say its a bad film, but its not the scariest thing you'll ever see from Asian Horror (like Ringu, Ju-on, Odishon). The elevator and calligraphy scenes provided the scares and the explosive ending helped increase its appeal. But in retrospect, the Eye 2 was a better thriller as Qi Shu portrayed her lead role much better than Angelica Lee. The Eye is okay for 1 viewing. But judge for yourself to see if it lives up to its hype. Note: I'm not exactly sure about a 2007 Cruise's version, and especially the casting choice of Jessica Alba. She's got great screen appeal but not necessarily the range. Maybe Cruise can offer a big budget for scarier couch jumping ghosts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>clearly inspired by THE SIXTH SENSE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS--YOU ARE FOREWARNED! This film clearly was inspired by THE SIXTH SENSE and in many ways the movie is nearly identical. But, given the little differences here and there, it's still a wonderful movie and is well worth seeing.First, though, I strongly caution parents about letting their kids see this film. There's no nudity, but the level of violence and gore is tremendous--particularly towards the end of the movie. While this isn't gratuitous, it is intense and could easily upset kids or even sensitive adults.Mun lives in Hong Kong and has been blind since age 2. However, she's just gotten a cornea transplant and has regained her sense of sight. However, she also is able to see dead people walking about. Some of these dead haven't yet gone on to the spirit world because they have unfinished business while others are seen being escorted by shadows to the afterlife. This and many other aspects of the film are straight from THE SIXTH SENSE and like this other movie, Mun realizes she can help these dead in limbo. And, she is guided through this by a really nice psychologist WHO IS NOT DEAD.However, it differs because the film also becomes a journey of discovery where Mun and the psychologist go to Thailand to learn more about the donor. They find that she was hated by the locals because she, too, had the ability to see the dead and know who was about to die. Finally, she killed herself to stop the torment. Mun realizes she must help the restless spirit of this woman work through the guilt over her suicide. Afterwards, it appears the visions are finished--leading to an amazing and totally unique conclusion.So why did I like it so much? Well, the writing, while derivative, was still brilliant and very engaging. Also, while I am not a huge fan of special effects, they are simply amazing in the film--the ghosts and the final scene involving the gas truck are amazing.To put this movie in some context, I still preferred THE SIXTH SENSE but not by much. Also, compared to Japanese horror like THE RING or THE GRUDGE (both American and Japanese versions), this is a much better film--written for a more discerning and thinking audience who want more substance to their plots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blurred and Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, this was an interesting movie, however it didn't rise above that: a good premise that failed to find its concretization in visual and dramatic terms. I understand that Asian horror follows its own rules and clearly paves its own way regardless of the more or less established stereotypes that tend to undermine the genre's effective impact upon the already jaded viewer. However, more often than not, this original approach does little to improve the situation. I find that that was the case with this movie. The scenes are static with little or nothing to liken each image-sequence with the next, making the film appear flat on the scream, with a little creativity in terms of camera work could clearly solve, enhancing the movie's artistic appeal. The pattern of building up tension only to deny a cathartic climax is only solved at the very ending: until then, this same technique is used and abused to the point of losing all strength and coming out as a watered solution to resolve a potentially disturbing situation.Which is not to say that this is a bad movie: it is not. The ghost story takes an original twist and manages to create an atmosphere of confusion that although not exactly terrifying is still disturbing. After all, the movie deals with the way in which we perceive our world and how that medium, once distorted, can completely unbalance our ideas of who we are and of how we should relate to the unknown. Also, it tries to display a deep array of emotions and while I think it failed it that particular aspect, the attempt is still praise worthy, especially since cinema, these days, seems to favour the superficial analysis in detriment of a solid study on human emotions. A few redeeming scenes do impress, such is the case of the elevator and the great ending everybody commends are indeed worth watching. To sum it up, it's a most for all Asian horror fans who will not only overlook what I take as flaws as probably value them as virtues and still an interesting movie for horror fans in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A promising first half ruined by a sentimental climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing ruins a good ghost story like bad exposition. I can think of a dozen movies where a chilling, mysterious first act is vitiated by a ludicrous sequence explaining the origin and purpose of the supernatural visitor/s. Perhaps it's best to keep the malign spirits motiveless and the audience confused, as in The Exorcist, the Ju-On series or the Naomi Watts version of The Ring.That's the case here: the lead actress is appealing and first 50 minutes are wonderful, with four good scares -- especially effective because we see them from the point-of-view of the disoriented Mun, who sees things out-of-focus and can't trust her new power of sight. The scenes in the hospital hallway, the restaurant, the calligrapher's, and in the elevator absolutely bowled me over. Things begin to go downhill with some lazy tear-jerking, as children's ghosts start to appear in droves -- if one's not enough, the Pang Bros. give us three.Then there's an underdeveloped love story between Mun and her psychotherapist -- who honestly looks 16 years old at most. Doogie Howser territory here. Don't they have laws about statutory rape in Hong Kong? Most disastrous is a trip to Thailand, where the mystery of Mun's corneas is unravelled. I won't describe the back-story here, except by saying it's melodramatic and sentimental in the extreme. The emotions demanded from the audience were way out of proportion with what I was prepared to invest in the characters.My disappointment may stem from cultural differences. Maybe I'm a flinty-hearted Anglo-Saxon who can't appreciate a good Asian weep-fest. At any rate, I was left wishing I had just turned off the film at the 50 minute mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wow a j- horror film that really lives up to its billing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, that's not fair, I hadn't really ever heard of this film before I saw it... maybe that was good. I found this movie to be brilliant in both conception and execution...that rarest of thrillers that stays right through to the end and packs two major twists in it. Most thrillers are good for 45 minutes to an hour until the one trick pony directors run out of ideas...the Eye has a climactic scene that packs a tremendous wallop and this film stayed with me longer than almost any horror film I can remember...elevator ride anyone? I rarely walk away from a film genuinely STOKED anymore... this one got me looking for more films from these guys. P.S. To all the people who think a TOM CRUEL remake doesn't hurt a film...I can't tell you how hard it was to get people to watch "OPEN YOUR EYES" if they'd got anywhere near that stinkbomb remake "VANILLA SKY". 8 out of ten because the boyfriend was awful and the girl should have been killed at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring meets Body Parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a nicely done Hong Kong movie that borrows from Japanese horror movies and mainstream Hollywood to make a watchable movie. It is a pity, though, that such promising ideas and starting points turn into an average movie.While it takes the feel of Japanese movies, it fails to convey the fright that comes with them. And while Hollywood production have created many a film about transplanted body parts that come with a price, this movie does not transmit the drama that is usually associated with transplants.Over all it is a nice movie to watch, even if lengthy at parts. Some movies do begin slow in order to induce a feeling of terror or uneasiness; this one is plain slow, the terror is diminished , probably for commercial reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mun gets a cornea transplant and she starts to see very scary things, which are the best reason why you should watch this movie. Some scenes like the calligraphy teacher and the elevator scene was very spooky indeed. Also some details like the subway reflection quite got me. Mun is well played by Angelica Lee.Whats not so good about this movie is how it changes mood and direction halfway or so in. The spookiness was well made, why not stick with it instead of making it an investigation which falls down on its own flaws. I guess the market screamed for it too early for the brothers to develop the script properly. Good, but could be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch "The Eye" without thinking about "The Sixth Sense" or "The Ring" and you could really enjoy it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The popularity of Asian horror movies came after the huge success of "The Ring" or "Ringu". Hollywood sensed economical potential on this market and you know the rest...After an eye surgery to recover sight, a 20 year old woman acquires the misfortune to watch dead people. "The Eye" isn't by any means the Asian remake of "The Sixth Sense", in fact, it's a creepy horror movie that doesn't relies too much on F/X or cheap scares but tries to focus the viewers attention on the plot. Of course, there's a strong connection between the plot and visuals plus creepy sounds. The movie has some chilling scenes that give visual pleasure to horror fans. If a director's intention is to generate scares, the movie needs "key" scenes to set an atmosphere; and in my opinion, the scene that sets the mood is the now infamous "Why are you sitting on my chair?!" scene. A truly frightening moment that you don't see coming. After a very kitsch scene where Mun takes an instant photograph with Ying Ying; the fore-mentioned scene happens and shocks the audience. The cheesy scene is quickly forgotten but later takes importance on the movie and in fact it's a key moment to the movie's climax. The Asians know how to give importance to every scene in their scary movies and that's always helpful because you pay particular attention to scenes that you think won't make a change. After the main situation is set, the scary scenes keep coming and stimulate the viewers' imagination. ACTING. Great performance by Angelica Lee. She's perfect in her role as the cute fragile girl. Her suffering and fear are believable and you feel sorry for her. Lawrence Chou delivers as the young Dr. Wah. No supporting characters were needed to be honest. DIRECTION. The Pang brothers created a truly scary movie with a touch of elegance. The camera angels are great and always set the mood for a scare or a scene that could surprise the audience. There's a feeling of uncertainty through the entire movie and that helps to set the mood of a scary movie. F/X, SOUNDTRACK. The f/x are pretty good. The CGI is used when it's needed; there's no abuse of it like in other movies of this kind. The music works pretty good. There are some scenes with cheesy music but that's just to prepare the audience for a non-expected scare. Worked for me.The success of the movie is the harmony between a clever plot and great f/x. While it's not a VERY scary movie, "The Eye" will entertain you and make you think; something that isn't very common in actual horror movies. Don't think about "The Eye" as a copy of "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense"; it's a unique movie that doesn't tries to be something it's not. Take it for what it is: an entertaining horror movie that will stay for a while in your mind. 7/10. Horror movies like "The Eye" are very welcomed to the genre. Give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spine-tingling moments but a tad average overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was swept up by the current enthusiasm for all things Asian at the moment - particularly in the 'horror' genre - into hiring this movie. I don't regret that choice I hasten to add but in essence this is largely and over hyped edition to the genre. There are some very spooky moments - e.g. the episode in the lift - but the plot does feel a bit derivative and the characters a bit flat especially all the male leads (is it common for psychotherapists/surgeons in Thailand to be in practice at the age of 15?). As an aside it strikes me that building up tension across two locations is a major flaw in this film. I found I was beginning to become really gripped by the urban, corridors, 'round the corner theme of the first half, then the location shift completely looses this tension and then tries to build it up again in the rural village setting, however by this stage it is too late. I would give it 4.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE EYE (3 outta 5 stars)Suspenseful Asian thriller which tells the story of a young blind girl who receives the gift of sight via a cornea transplant. The only trouble is she begins to see (and hear) things that aren't there. Like dead people. Weird apparitions who suddenly lunge at her for no reason... or who ask her the same questions over and over.. or who hang out in restaurants licking the food! Our heroine and her young doctor friend seek to find out the reasons for this unusual side effect... and lay these tireless spirits to rest once and for all. Pretty standard ghost story... kind of reminiscent of "The Sixth Sense" and "The Ring"... but well worth seeing for some truly creepy scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some good reviews of this one, especially one in Empire, who I believe called it one of the best horror movies ever. I quietly wonder if we have seen the same movie. What starts out as quite effective, some of the early ghost scenes are a bit hair-raising, quickly descends into complete and utter predictable trash. Add bad acting and dialogue, a weird kind of stylization which makes no sense, annoying music cues and you end up with a total mess of a movie. One which tries too hard to appeal to westeners. It must also feature some of the most unconvincing examples ever of actors trying to authentically play their instruments. A big disappointment. I actually had to fast-forward in the end when it became insultingly bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close My Eye-A Complete Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having rented the "Eye" late one night, I sat alone in my basement expecting to be scared, instead I was completely bored by this utter pretentious attempt at "new wave" horror. Riding the coattails of the average and overrated Jap film, "Ring", this attempts to be a follow up in some way but there is no connection whatsoever, except one of the ghosts was said to be in the "Ring". What wasn't outright stolen from American horror films, was badly imitated in a pointless and completely dull movie. I must say that there was not one scary moment in this film, not one! If you think then that it is a "horror film" then you are wrong, what the director does is sludge through one hour of the most inane dialogue while amateurish and incredulous actors walk around like boring idiots. Where did they get these people? Most of these films would do better if there was some grasp of directorial and script effort but suffice it to say, this is a real stinker. Nearing the end, the film resorts to some cheap computer animation that is like watching a video game. Do not pay attention to the young teens who say this is the "best horror film" ever, rent something that has credibility, this is not it. I am angered that the Chinese get credit for an "intelligent horror film" when they only stole and re-hashed American/Hollywood genres. Check out the American version of the "Ring" or "Seconds" (1966) directed by John Frankenheimer, much more worthy efforts.   </fullReview>

But it surpasses 6th S by a mile or 2500 or so, Where the sixth sense is a good thriller (and a ood movie)the Eye is a good Horror movie.I have never been scared while watcing a movie, well maybe when I was 6 and was watching movies like "the fog" of " an american werewolf in london" , but ever since I am a grown up have I ever been really scared-until I saw the Eye, it made me deel 6 years old again.A friend of mine nearly jumped in my lap, at the climax of " the Others" the audience jumpt half a meter up , here every(!) climax made the audience crawl back into the backs of their seats, hoping to get as far away from the screen as possible... trying not to watch- I can't really describe it, how it felt. But I was truly and deeply scaredIt's not really original (see on of the comments above about %-s of other movies) But -this movie is indeed all of the above. and all the best parts. Okay -it starts slow, but when it starts ...brace yourselves...I was ultimately impressed. Normally my friends and I walk out, laughing, fooling around. Now we were silent -still shaken.

		<fullReview>I've been had. Once again, the trailers worked their tricks. I wasintroduced to "The Eye" half a year ago. The trailer introduced meto a film that was one part horror and one part art film. I was led tobelieve that the Pang brothers put together an amazinglysuspenseful picture loaded with quasi-mysticism, shock-surpriseand philosophical inquiries regarding the nature of sight,perception and thought. "The Eye," however, was none of thesethings. I can definitively conclude that after the pre-title sequenceintroduction that reinforced the notion that this might be thehorror/suspense film version of "Persona," there was nothingworth seeing. This was a totally uninteresting film. It shoots nofurther than standard fare horror/suspense film fails at thisendeavor in every way. Neither art picture or suspense thriller, "TheEye" was a complete let down. The trailer was the movie's bestediting sequence. The rest of the film lacked an appropriateediting rhythm. The film lacked a heinous element. Without anyimminent threat, the long takes shot in hopes of extending theaudience's sense of suspense feel unnatural. Don't waste yourmoney watching this drivel. It lacks any redeeming aspect. Thehorror is poorly executed. They mysticism is hackneyed. Theredeeming plot device/metaphor is nothing more than schmaltzysentimentality. I do not understand how any buzz generated fromthis film or why anyone who actually saw the movie would beinterested in purchasing the rights to the picture. Perhaps it's oneof those cases where everything was lost in translation.For foreign film reviews, interviews and news check out www.au-cinema.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This release is definitely a cut above your typical Hong Kong horrorfilm -- even though it falls behind the curve in the plot department.The concept is simple enough. A blind girl gets an operation torestore her sight, but on opening her eyes for the first time, shefinds that she sees things that others don't. At first, she assumesthat everybody sees what she sees. (On the way home, abusinessman stands in the middle of a busy highway; she'sintrigued, but quickly puts it aside. Increasingly, though, sherealizes "she sees dead people," and that the donor may still belooking at things through her eyes.Of course, that doesn't explain why the girl starts hearing thingswhen she gets the new eyes. No matter. If you've accepted thefilm's main concept, you're unlikely to object to its littleinconsistencies. The Eye is a film of little chills, none too grippingfor the fact that the story is so familiar from American horrormovies. But the good acting and nice atmosphere keep the projectafloat for the most part.</fullReview>

Well glad to see he paid attention while watching the film, given that it is NOT a Japanese film at all. There is no Japanese spoken in it, it only features Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai and short bits of english. As far as I am aware this is a Hong Kong/Thailand made film... NOT Japanese.So if I were you I'd ignore his comments completely, cause if he can't even get that simple bit of info right...Anyway, I won't go over the plot at all, as I'm pretty sure that it'll have been covered extensively already. Just want to say that while this may not be the scariest film you'll ever see, far from it really, there are still quite a few scenes that should make you jump. The calligraphy scene was the one that did it for me the most! Anyway, don't go into this expecting a great horror film, you WILL be disappointed it you do.This is a suspense film, but more importantly it is simply a very good film. All other elements aside, this is a film which you can watch and just very much enjoy, with the added bonus of a few spine tingling scenes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mmm ... corneas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like some of the other people who commented upon this film, I was initially drawn to it from seeing the (very poor) Tartan Video cover in a local store. &gt;From reading a few things here and there about it I decided to order it (along with Ring which will be commented upon soon!) and tonight it was viewed with fresh eyes.MEGA SPOILERS ARE FORTHCOMING! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!You all know the story so I won't bore you with that, and if you don't know the story, all the better. Better you know as little as possible about it. Expect something kinda on the same lines of The Sixth Sense, and if you liked that film, as I did, then I'm pretty sure you'll love this.I thought the film was excellent. It wasn't quite the scarefest I was expecting, though some scenes creeped me out quite a bit, but there was a growing sense of dread and unease that appeared after the first 20 minutes or so and didn't let up right until the end, that is, the REAL ending ;) (And I'll state here and now that when the US remake appears I guarantee that last five minute sequence will not be changed, or softened, it simply won't be there at all! Think about it, do you really think Hollywood will show that amount of indiscriminate devastation when the storyline seemed to have been resolved?) The scene with the first ghost at the hospital. Brrr, shivers. The scene with the young boy. Mmm, getting freaked out. The scene with the women in the class. Gaaaaahhhhh!!!! The scene in the lift. Ok, I AM freaked out now, just GET OUT OF THE LIFT!!! And then the final scene with Ling Ling. Full body goose pimples. But it wasn't just fear inducing, it was strangely moving too. And that in part is due to the incredible performance of the lead actress, something I didn't except but she was exceptional!I'm going to recommend this to anyone who wants to find an intelligent horror film which also doubles as a really great story in it's own right. Not something you can say about too many horror films these days. It IS very similar to Sixth Sense, but personally I found it far better, in terms of storyline, the writing, individual ghost scenes, and sound design. The score is perfectly suited to this film and works incredibly well. And as many people have pointed out, the camera was utilised very well, wonderful framing on some shots.And, the ending. I was very sceptical when I heard a previous commentator mention the 'apocalyptic' ending, as I've rarely found an ending in a horror film that was apocalyptic in the true sense of the word. But this film is the closest I've seen that realises it. It was a devastating ending, but one that the film simply wouldn't have been as strong without. Oh, and special mention to the special effects, they were INCREDIBLE! Not in the sense of giving Hollywood effects houses a run for their money, but simply the fact they were used so well and were fairly sparse and subtle in their design.So go check out The Eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarier than the Sixth Sense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two styles of horror in horror movies the gore style with countless and sometimes very useless blood scenes, and the non gore style like The Others and The Sixth Sense. Both movies are fantastic with each having an excellent twist, that had people talking for days. As I was browsing the internet checking out some new horror movies out on DVD, I noticed a particular DVD by the name of The Eye. I started looking for some information about this movie but could not find anything since the original name of this movie is Jian Gui. So I tracked down the directors name on IMDb Oxide Pang Chun and Danny Pang. I had never heard of these two brothers before and i started searching about Jian Gui. When I finally had enough information to convince myself to purchase this DVD I told my video dealer to get me this movie.This is without a doubt the scariest movie i have ever seen on my own. Even the opening credits on the DVD are impressive.Many have compared this movie with the Sixth Sense. True, it does borrow something from it but The Eye literally stands as a movie on its own. You cannot try to compare Chicago with Moulin Rouge which are both musicals but so much different from one another.The Eye is about a blind girl who gets a cornea transplant to see the beauty of this world like other people see, but she gets to see much much more than beauty! I will not go into the plot detail of the movie, i wish to leave that for the viewer to experience on his own. There were moments where I was scared stiff. The Pang Bros have directed a Masterpiece in horror with an amazing technique that has never been seen before. Beautiful angle shots and imagery that must be seen again and again. The visual effects are very good but the most memorable thing about this movie is the environment effect it has through out the whole movie.I must also mention that there are some nice touching moments too that will have you jerking a tear apart from jumping on your sofa.I have recently read that Mr Tom Cruise has bought the rights to remake this movie again. I urge you to see this movie now before Hollywood gets their hands on this Masterpiece. I am sure that the story will be totally changed like they changed Insomnia, The Ring and Open Your Eyes(Vanilla Sky). I Just hope that at least Mr Cruise has the dignity to leave all the tension Jian Gui has!One last thing to end this review. If this movie is really based on a true story than without a doubt this is truly one of the the scariest movies ever. You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this deliberately without finding out anything about it, I hadn't even seen the trailer. I didn't know what to expect, save for an impression. I'm not a real horror fan, and I wouldn't classify this as a horror, but I am pretty hardened to what cinema can throw at you. Even so, it is scary, and very tense. Very tense. I even said to myself, 'It's okay, it's just a film,' several times during the show. Plot-wise, it's a little weak - it barely scratches the surface of what could have tackled. It starts of edgy, amazing camera-work and effects, and manages to be both pensive and aggressive at the same time. Ultimately though, it's falls away from that edginess into a fairly cheesy Hollywood ending... so ultimately disappointing, after a very strong start. It could have been better, had the directors changed the emphasis. It is pretty much out to scare you - it would have worked well if they had tried to move beyond that.</fullReview>

Also a film not many folk may be familiar with which had similarities was the Michael Apted thriller "Blink" from 1994, where Madeline Stowe plays a woman who sees things after getting her sight back after years of being blind. I liked this film alot although the plot did meander a little towards the end. The flash backs to the dead girls life (and subsequent death) reminded me of the flash backs in the original Japanese version of "Ring" which is never a bad thing. This is more scary than anything that Hollywood will produce this year, although I'm yet to see the US version of "Ring". Catch this movie if you like to be hiding behing your hands!!

		<shortDescription>Beats The Sixth Sense into a bloody pulp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed 'The Eye'; considering the quality of most HK films as compared to their Japanese counterparts, it seems that the Pang brothers have kept a pretty close eye on what's been going down over there. Yes, it has elements which are close to 'The Sixth Sense', but it works on so many deeper levels, closer to Ringu and Kairo than that piece of Hollywood tat. The camerawork is stylish and there are several serious creep-out moments. I fear that Tom Cruise has already optioned this one for a Hollywood-glitz remake (apparently it's all the rage to rip off Asian classics right now :oP), so see it while you can.My one concern is that some of the cross-cultural referencing might get some viewers a little confused, if this is the first Asian film they've seen. Other than that, I thought Lee Sin-je turned in a lovely, understated performance (can you imagine *Nicole Kidman* doing it a fraction as well?) and the acting was generally of really great quality. IMHO, 'The Eye' is a keeper rather than a renter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood horrors have never scared me, coming closer to a type of comedy, Japanese and Chinese horrors generally have a more visually haunting style. This movie was no exception.A young Chinese girl living in Hong Kong is given the gift of sight through a cornea-transplant. We follows her rediscovery of the world, being unable to recognise a stapler until she touches it, being cut out of her blind community. However everything isn't quite right. She sees shadowy figures leading away the dead, and her mirror image is not her own. The movie builds steadily to a ferocious climax, and ends on a twist.The cinematography is fantastic, and the music will make you jump. I cried twice during this movie and enjoyed it immensely. You will too.10/10 - A must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best new-millennium horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure (read: brown-trouser experience!) of seeing this film yesterday, and let me tell you - it has some of the creepiest and most scary scenes ever committed to celluloid!If you've seen 'Ringu', 'Audition' or 'St.John's Wort' you'll know that the far east is the place to go for genuinely scary horror, and 'The Eye' is superior to all of the above. Even 'Ringu', which I truly love.What makes this film work? Well - the acting is superb all around, the special effects are beautiful and very subtle (especially the ghostly apparitions), and the use of very unsettling music and soundeffects reminds me of playing the videogame 'Silent Hill'(those of you who have played this game will know what I speak of).So, in conclusion - get this film on dvd NOW. I guarantee you will be scared. You WILL be.Zeb.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only scary part is, I spent one euro to rent this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across this movie while watching "The Boogeyman" and I took the time to watch some of the extra parts on the DVD, in which the actors of that movie said they had recently seen a film that was scary beyond belief, called "The Eye". When at the local video rental, I saw they had The Eye and decided to rent it and give it a try. Ready to get scared my pants off, I pulled my knees against my chest and turned on the DVD player. However, the entire movie turned out to be a huge disappointment.************** From this point on, some specific spoilers are given **************Let me start out by saying I do not necessarily have something against Japanese movies or so, since I enjoyed Ringu (saw the English version) and The Grudge (saw the original Japenese version). The story in itself has been explained numerous times, a woman gets a coronal transplant and sees dead people now.To me, a movie like this should include some scares, so that the spirits of the deceased people should at least frighten you and the main character (compare it to The Sixth Sense, where this was done nicely), this movie contained no scare at all. Another way this movie could turn into a true horror movie, is if the deceased people all have horrible stories to tell from their lives. Why these people died is unclear to us, apart from one boy who leaped out of a window, because he lost his rapport card. I have read on here that the very first ghost the Mun sees scared the hell out of many people. Let me give you a spoiler, the first thing she sees is an old woman in a hospital that says that she's cold, and then disappears. There is a succession of these visions, where the ghosts just walk by her, smile at her, have a friendly chat with her. Heck, the ghosts are much friendlier than most people I know, so I have no idea why she would be scared of them. No wait, I have told you a lie, there is one unfriendly ghost, which believes Mun has taken her place, and all of a sudden she leaps towards Mun and disappears when she's about 10 Cm away from her face. That is about the only scary part about the movie.So the first half hour, you see Mun walk around with some friendly ghosts at her side, and she gets some visions about a room too. In part two, they find the room and it belonged to the girl who had the original gift, and committed suicide because of it, and now plagues our main character, Mun. All Mun has to do is make her mother say "I forgive you", and then she is plagued no more. Mun manages to do this in a mere 5 minutes thank God, and she can go home, where she embraces her gift.I also see the acting is immensely appreciated on here. It's not bad acting, but nothing special. At a given point in the movie, Mun confesses to her doctor she sees dead people and starts to cry, only problem, during her cry scene she does not shed one tear. Heck, even the 10 year old boy in The Sixth Sense cried a river when he had to confess his gift.That's about your whole movie, nothing scary about it. You won't have a feeling that you're afraid to go to sleep in the next half hour or so. Actually, the only reason why you won't be able to go to sleep in the next half hour, is because you took an involuntary nap throughout the movie. This movie should be classified under "romantic films", rather than under horror films. This movie mainly got its hype because Japanese horror is THE genre for the elite movie watcher now. But if you like to get scared, go rent another movie or "One Night in Chyna"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And when that character becomes the client of a good-looking doctor, we know that doctor is not just in it for the medical scenes.The special effects were pretty good I thought, especially when you consider that the protagonist (convincingly) doesn't know what it's like to see, and takes a while to figure out what she is supposed to be seeing and what she isn't.Otherwise though, I thought the horror (especially the burned bodies) was pretty shonky, and the romance really bleugh. (My vocabulary is at its peak tonight.) The third act, starting with the trip to Thailand to the end of the film seems added on to improve the film (as if it helps). Tragically though, I suspect it was always a part of the script.One for the horror fans I suspect, and bearable even if you're not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually, we don't expect Asia to send us horror flicks, but "Jian gui" (called "The Eye" in English) breaks that stereotype. Blind since birth, Wong Kar Mun (Angelica Lee) undergoes an operation to make her eyes work. However, she gets more than she bargained for. Because the unidentified person from whom she got this vision had more than vision. This vision allows her to see a lot more than she would like to see...and it could be leading her to places where she wouldn't otherwise choose to go.Similar to "The Sixth Sense" (but never aping it), "The Eye" is one movie that really makes you jump. And it might make you uncertain about having certain operations in the future. Worth seeing (pun intended).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Eye" is quite an unique Asian horror film... Despite blending two of the most overused and oldest story lines of horror cinema (misbehaving transplanted body parts AND supernatural contact with the dead), it strangely feels like an entirely new and original ghost story! Even though you've seen all this before in other movies, the Pang brothers' directing style feels fresh and very innovating and so their film is one of the best oriental chillers of the last ten years. Like most other Asian so-called 'masterpieces', this definitely is an overrated film but it does contain several genuinely creepy moments and a truly memorable climax. The 20-something Mun undergoes a cornea graft to restore the sight she lost since childhood. Her initial happiness rapidly changes into pure fear and terror, as she begins to spot the restless spirits of other persons everywhere...and they're not necessarily dead YET! Apparently, the cornea previously belonged to a clairvoyant girl who committed suicide. "The Eye" bathes in an ominous atmosphere and the sound effects are effectively scary. Unfortunately, too much valuable horror-time is wasted on sentimental nonsense (the poor sickly child) and a totally pointless love-story between Mun and her doctor. The acting, especially by Lee Sin-Je, is terrific and the film is overall very well made, with subtle camera-work and nifty visual effects. I liked this film better than both "The Sixth Sense" and "Final Destination"; two popular recent American flicks the Pang brothers were obviously inspired by. Everybody always talks about the notorious elevator-sequence, but that one really isn't *that* disturbing. The explosive finale, however, is downright jaw-dropping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, to all the people putting up reviews who are talking about what a good example of Japanese horror this is, the movie is from Hong Kong. This is not to say the film isn't influenced by Japanese horror films - it certainly is, along with U.S. films like, most notably the Sixth Sense, but let's all pay attention to little details like where the movie is from.The eye starts out really well. It starts off very low key and then introduces a very subtle sense of menace and has some scenes of suspenseful, understated horror. Even though it is much too derivative of other movies, it is very stylish and well done.For about the first half.After that this really becomes a mess. Much of the problem has to do with that derivative nature. It's not necessarily bad to steal, but you have to put together your stolen bits in some sort of sensible manner. The film at times feels as patched together as one of the Scary Movie series. By the end it just feels like a bunch of half-baked ideas are being tossed at the audience in hopes some of them will work. It's just a nonsensical hodge podge.I've heard about the difficulties of blind people who regain their sight, and how traumatizing that can be. This movie just briefly touches on that, but wouldn't it be cool to see a movie that really dug into that? One that really made you feel what it was like to not know what something was even though you could see it? Where vision was disorienting and you couldn't trust your own senses? I'm not saying this movie should have done that. It would have been interesting but I would have been content with a trite, stylishly directed piece of horror fluff as long as it was coherent and cohesive. Still, as long as they were aware of the problems with regaining eyesight it's a shame they didn't take advantage of the knowledge to do something original instead of recycling other movies. I give this 4/10, although if you only watch the first half it's at least a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was eager to watch THE EYE, not because I had read the plot summary or had seen the trailer, but because everybody was talking about it. Now that I've seen it, all I can say is what a huge disappointment. I don't understand all the hype surrounding this film.The movie fails from its very beginning since a good premise isn't enough if you don't build an interesting situation to explore it. We have a young blind girl subject of a cornea transplant who starts to see the real world, but she also starts to see what appear to be ghosts. The girl is scared, naturally, but it takes just too long for her to comment the visions and nightmares with someone, which would be the logical thing to do for a person submitted to any kind of surgery, I think. And I can't buy a she-can't-tell-a-ghost-from-the-real-thing possible explanation. But that's not the only problem. The setback here is although we have a potentially good premise, the plot does not explore properly its premise. Nothing happens. Ok, this girl sees ghosts and dead people, in a clear reference to THE SIXTH SENSE. So what? All we can ask ourselves is who are the ghosts and why is she seeing them. Michael Apted's BLINK manages to succeed with a very similar premise because its plot creates a situation to be explored based on the movie's premise. That doesn't happen in THE EYE and I couldn't care less why was the main character seeing ghosts.However, what really annoys me in this movie is the self-indulgent look at death and particularly suicide. Are the filmmakers really trying to make a point here or is it just a cheap plot mechanism? There is one point of the movie where one character makes statements about the after-life in a way that he seems to be talking about universal truths that can be found on any medical compendium.The artsy camera-work has no real purpose many times and the thrills are cheap as in a bad Hollywood horror picture. Cutting two different images with a loud sharp sound is the easiest way to scare the audience, not necessarily the most effective.I found this movie boring, predictable and unsatisfying; it's full of references to some Hollywood hits, and the ending reminded me THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES a lot. Maybe you should try THE SIXTH SENSE instead, or even BLINK, if you're willing to watch THE EYE.</fullReview>

She must unravel the secret behind her paranormal peepers before seeing dead people unhinges her mind.This creepy effort from the East is a lot like the Bruce Willis hit, The Sixth Sense. The ghosts are sufficiently spooky (I particularly liked the one in the lift and the one that licks the meat!), but the movie's slow pace allowed my attention to wander in one or two places. The final ten minutes or so pep up the movie a tad, but all in all I would have liked a few more genuine 'jump-outta-my-seat' scares rather than the gentler horror served up by directors, the Pang Brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My attention span has much to answer for. I try to watch and enjoy a real horror movie, but given my ADD-like attention span for anything that doesn't involve giant monsters or kung-fu, I generally find myself becoming rather bored halfway through. For that reason, I tend to enjoy mindless slasher movies more than actual horror movies. 'The Eye' was no exception. It seemed like a genuinely scary horror movie, unfortunately, I became bored at the halfway mark and stopped paying full attention. Damn my attention span.Blind from a very young age, Mun (Angelica Lee) undergoes a cornea transplant that restores her vision. The twist is, that Mun now has x-ray vision and can shoot lasers from her eyes, and must use her powers in the good fight for truth and justice. Wait - that's what SHOULD have happened, instead Mun just starts seeing dead people and having strange visions...So, I might sound like I hated 'The Eye'. I'm not trying to give that impression, but at best, it was average. There are a couple of creepy moments in the first half, but the second half of the movie loses pace and focus. My attention span isn't all that trivial - if the 'The Eye' had stayed on track, it would have been a much better film. As it stands, it has a promising start, but quickly becomes convoluted before turning a detective story. How very exciting. When the end comes, you'll probably come to the conclusion that you've seen this movie before: it borrows heavily from other notable horror films.I don't know whether I'm a jaded horror fan or just a lout with a really short attention span (perhaps both?), but 'The Eye' promised to be a good horror film, but was just too unbalanced - 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average, overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After looking through so many 8s and 9s I'm really surprised by how overrated this movie is. First of all, everyone is saying how scary this movie is when there were only like 4 attempts in the whole movie to scare you. Maybe I'm just dead on the inside but watching it in the dark, I wasn't scared at any part in this movie. Neither was my friend and he's been scared by a lot of movies recently (exorcist remake, the ring, the grudge, etc. in terms of "pop-out" movies). Scariness doesn't make a horror movie's rating but I don't think it had that much else going for it.It was by no means bad, but I don't see how and why its turned into such a cult classic. Id understand if it came out before the 6th sense, but seeing that movie a few years ago (which i was so scared by i couldn't see the ending) really made this seem unoriginal and uninventive by comparison. Furthermore, just because it's slow doesn't mean that its subtle or deep or complex. She gets an eye transplant, notices dead people, gets scared and starts investigating for answers. The investigation leads to further discoveries but none of this really seemed "thought provoking", at least not to me. I have to say though that I'm glad it didn't resort to any girls with long black hair (good the first time but move on ppl) or music climaxes before something jumped out every other minute.Still I never felt there sense of threat from the ghosts and thought the black shades leading dead ppl to be a bit hokey for some reason. (((SPOILER kinda))) And what was the deal with the woman that saw ghosts in the market? I felt something useful could've come out of that but that was just thrown in for no reason at all really. The best parts were the get out my chair part, (even though I laughed instead of screamed-dunno why) the meat licking ghosts at the market (best visual in movie) and the elevator part was cool. Ask anybody, the ending did suck. It tried to be deep or hit you with a fate type issue but it was sort of just a nice CG display.I much recommend Audition or Ringu over this. One because those Ringu scared me and Audition scarred me. Secondly, I felt much more of a sense of danger and connection to the main characters as they were more developed for the first half of the movie in a way that made the endings all the more shocking. Audition made me scared of shy Asian girls for a little while, which really freaks you out if u go to an almost all Asian school. In contrast, I forgot about seeing The Eye a little while later until noticing all the rave reviews it got. Not so bad but not so good either.</fullReview>

Of course it's derivative - it goes without saying that a lot of stuff here has been done in many other films but it's still carried off in an eerie enough way to make it a valid expenditure of a couple of hours, particularly the ending. Plus I hadn't seen this kind of theme done in a Chinese movie before which made it all the more interesting.

		<fullReview>As pretty much anyone will tell you, The Eye is just another in a assembly line of Asian Horror movies designed with slick production values and little else. The screenplay is dull, the characters are cliched, and the film manages to not provide a single creepy moment, probably because it just borrows everything from other, better horror films. They try to sell generic movies like this in American because the Asian style of directing is much different than Hollywoods. But really, this film is like Rush Hour, when you consider style. Countless movies in the Exact same structure have come before it, but Americans are unexsposed to it so most of us eat it up. I personally find the style slightly annoying. Frantic editing and washed lighting effects don't make a movie scary. And while other visual components of the style are interesting and add to the film, there is more bad than good. The acting was the only real solid part of the movie. And the ending as well, though while it's well done, it's not worth it to dredge through the movie just to see it. If you've seen any other Asian horror movie, you've already seen this one. 4.5/10 * * / * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard from various sources including reviews on Aintitcoolnews.com that this was a great horror film to see. Instead I found it rather average overall. The visuals in the film are stupendous and possibly the best point of the film. The plot is about a blind woman who receives a cornea transplant and begins to see dead people and shadowy figures who escourt the dead away (presumably to the afterlife). After many scenes that seem to drag on a bit a 'twist' comes in when the woman discovers that the woman who the eye once belonged to had similar visions. She then goes with her doctor (of course this has to be the requisite cookie cutter love interest)to discover who this woman was and how to deal or stop the ghostly visions. There are a few 'jump' moments but nothing terribly scary. As with a similar film I was hugely disappointed with, Ringu, The Eye has a plot that sounded really interesting but then went nowhere that hasn't been visited or explored before. The two films really are much alike and I was disappointed in each after all the hype I had heard.</fullReview>

And Rinug was completely inferior to The Ring.All these movies look the same, it looks like they used a camera from the 70's , none of the actors can act. Also I am not a person that needs CGI to be entertained but the special effects in these asian movies look like they were made by 10 year olds.I CANNOT comprehend where people get off saying these movies are scary or even worth watching.I think it is the "snob" effect. By watching asian cinema people feel sooooo much smarter and more "in the know" then people who watch American movies. The same effect happens with Japanese anime, most anime story lines are about as deep as saturday morning cartoons but anime fanboys will tell you they are soooo much better then American cinema.Wanna see a ghost story that is creepy and won't give you permanate eye damage from watching the grainy film stock? Check out "The Others" or "The Ring"(NOT the japanese version).After Ringu and now The Eye.

I was never really scared during the entire movie, and I thought the end was pretty generic. I also saw it coming a mile away, and predicted it to my pals halfway through the film. I will give the director credit though, he really did a good job creating a spooky and chilling atmosphere in some of the shots. Also, the DTS track on the DVD is fantastic, and really adds to the feel of the film. The lead actress did a great job conveying her feelings through facial expressions as well, though I thought some of the supporting actors could have done a better job. Effects were used to enhance the film, which is always a plus in my book. Subtle effects use is always preferred compared to the more in your face american style. This was my first venture in to asian horror....I just hope it gets better from here. Overall: on a scale of 1 to 10...Plot/Script-5Acting-6Effects-8Sound-9DVD(transfer/subtitles/extras)-6(no anamorphic widescreen here, but the transfer is still quite good)Search out the all region DVD, it's so cheap it's still worthy of a purchase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whats the big fuss? This wasn't that good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is ridiculous. It is so not scary. It is very stupid, bad acting (except the main character, she was very good, horrible graphics, dumb sounding music, and tons more. The only thing good about this was the story, it was good. And I think that the American remake will be better, just like the Grudge, was 10 times better than that stupid Ju-On crap(which I laughed very hard at). The Eye, overall was just bad, the end was ridiculous, I almost cried from laughing so hard! Because the story is so good, It is worth checking out, but honestly, this movie was just stupid, and NOT SCARY. My biggest question, was how could anyone possibly tell me that this was a good movie? I don't get it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Eye" was a great idea. Even on the surface, it looked like a great movie. The plot definitely sounded intriguing, and the trailer was both well-done and scary. Sounds like it's worth a watch, right?Wrong. "The Eye" supremely disappointed me. First of all, this movie was really not very scary. Yes, there were a few scenes that made my heart race, but those scenes could have been made much scarier. Second, the characterization was pretty much a joke. Every new relationship formed in the movie seemed to have no basis or depth. Third, the story was hardly a story at all. It had no pacing whatsoever, because it seemed that as soon as the problem arose, it was solved a bit too easily, with some sequences thrown between the conflict and the resolution to try to make the story interesting. Even the acting was disappointing, but I must admit that it's hard to focus on the performances when you're trying to read the subtitles. The score was also contrived and over-dramaticized.Overall, there's very little that saves this from failure. Only a couple visually strong sequences offer any redemption. Don't watch this one.Final Grade: D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarily boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I don't quite get the fixation with Asian horror movies. And "The Eye" embodies every single reason for me not being into such genre.The movie is slow, plodding and totally NOT scary.Not gore-scary, not psychological-scary, not weird-scary. Not even slightly-unsettling or disturbing.It's just another chapter of the "I see dead people who can't rest in peace" book, which by now has become tiresome and trite.The acting is okay, if you can go past the lack of expression of the actors (something I can't do). The plot is predictable and the ending, well, you can totally see it coming. Probably not exactly the way it happens, but still the outcome is awfully predictable.The Eye is polished and well executed. Too bad the plot and the whole feel of the movie are unimaginative and dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not like this movie at all. The story is not especially interesting, but what is worse is the characters, the acting and how Thailand is depicted. Thailand is a country of poor and superstitious people. The "streets" are littered with junk and it looks more or less like a junkyard. The Singaporeans on the other hand are all young professionals (doctors and such) and of course exceptionally good looking. And as characters they are very one dimensional and not at all engaging. So skip this movie. I got bored real quick, and then mostly irritated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent watch, but slightly boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down to watch "The Eye" with much enthusiasm, expecting another "Grudge" or "Grudge 2". Instead, I was rather disappointed. The film certainly has its good points - such as Angelica Lee as Mun who is fantastic, great special effects, a fairly good crux point at the end of the film and an okay score. However, the negative points seem to stand out more for me, such as very few scares. In fact the only scare, for me, was the old lady ghost in the hospital, the rest just wasn't frightening. The lack of support from the supporting characters was unfortunate, but Lee carried the movie, so wasn't entirely needed after all. In addition, there were several boring moments where not much happened at all. Watch the film for Lee's great acting, but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>100 GIRLS with ghosts instead. Lots of ooh! aah! and later, "what did they have to do with the story?" The US edit will hopefully hack the sagging middle portion. Wake up if you fall asleep in the middle, there's a bit more fun towards the end. Relative fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated SPOILERS ALERT!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't me wrong the idea for this film is very good I was automatically grabbed by the idea that a girl who has been blind who gets he sight back and then see's ghosts without knowing whether their people or not is a very clever. On the extra's on the DVD on an interview featurette one off the producers says a case where a woman who had he sight restored killed herself two weeks after the operation.The first half hour is quite scary and makes you jump but after that goes downhill as it starts to plonder on and on about some woman who had the eyes before the protagonist and how she killed herself and it becomes a chore watching this movie, and the ending seems like something the Pang brothers chucked in there for a longer running time and it completely changes the mood off this film.3 out of 10 (this is a great example off how a good film at the start can go horribly wrong)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another crappy Asian horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I start losing faith in Asian movies. One or two years ago I first saw Takeshi Kitano movies and "Battle Royale" and I was really euphoric about them. I thought the modern Asian cinema could be an alternative to the junk Hollywood usually produces. Well, time passed and I've come to the conclusion that most Asian movies, especially Asian horror movies (with the exception of "Dark Water" and "Versus") are just plain boring: "Audition", "Ringu" (the remake is much better), "Uzumaki" and now "The Eye" - they all have very little to offer. The storyline is always confusing and NOTHING EVER HAPPENS. I had to fight hard to keep myself awake throughout the film. Horror? Haha! Watching "Dawson's Creek" is scarier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And other lines like this lead the plot through implausible twists and turns that really amount to nothing more than a silly horror film with really one or two scenes that generate tension. Now, I want to be fair. This minimal accomplishment is still more than most of the Hollywood horror films that come out every year (the titles of which generally abound in sequel numbers, or mirror the titles of films of which they are a remake), which is why I gave this film a three (or four - I can't remember now) out of ten. But don't be fooled - the story isn't very interesting, most of it forced, some of it unresolved. And I think the story gets explained far too easily - there is no room for doubt or ambiguity (where horror usually lies - see Polanski's "The Tenant" or "Rosemary's Baby"). All in all, dull story, hardly scary and mostly derivative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly I can say that it's the most boring horror movie I've ever watched! The movie was so slowly paced that I almost fell asleep. It is well polished in terms of acting and camera work but the storyline leaves a lot to be desired.Scary??? Nope. Sleepy??? Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "I see dead people" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie takes the hell of a time to begin. And even after that it doesn't get any better. It has one or maybe 2 nice moments but most of the time I spend yawning at that movie. Why do people always try to copy? My advice: Leave that movie alone and rewatch Six Sense instead- it is much better through the entire plot, has awesome actors and a kickass ending. The eye is very far from that level My Rating: 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie SUCKED big time !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi.. I've just watched this movie for the first time, i was pretty excited at first to watch it after reading all those positive reviews and how scary this movie is, unfortunately, this movie turned out to be complete crap, and a waste of time, total disappointment. Nothing about the movie is worth watching, very bad acting, actors were more like puppets with no emotions ( especially the mother of the donor girl ), The plot wasn't anything special, with poor editing and very slow pace that i had to fast forward parts of the movie trying to get to the good parts ( not that the movie had any good parts ). Talking about scares, this movie had no scares at all, not one single scene was scary, not the old lady nor the elevator scene, they were all not scary. the visuals of the movie also sucked, very poor visual effects that made the movie looked like it was made in the mid 90s, and poor direction. Honestly, this movie was bad and terrible, and it is not in anyway a successful movie. I was at first mad and angry that Hollywood is making a remake of this, but after watching it, i must say that I'm glad they will, maybe they will make some improvements to make this better than the garbage it is. I think Thai people don't know how to make movies, if you really need to watch an Asian movie, just stick with Korean or Japanese movies which are far more superior, go watch A Tale Of Two sisters, now that is what i call an excellent horror movie. Stay as far away as possible from the junk called the Eye !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie expecting to be scared out of my seat. I had heard so much about Japanese horror, and how it is superior to American horror. After all, Americans are remaking all of the Japanese horror flicks. I saw this movie on the shelf and became excited. Then I watched it and nearly fell asleep.This is the poor-boy version of the sixth sense. It's not scary at all. The first hour is drawn out and boring. I kept wondering when anything was going to happen. Nothing ever did. If you like Japanese horror or American horror skip this movie. If you like ridiculous attempts to be scary that fail, this may be the movie for you. Big thumbs down.</fullReview>
