		<shortDescription>Disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st time i'm writing a review on IMDb, but i had to say how bad is this movie.Im french and the original movie "Le diner de con" was one of the funniest movies have ever seen. I still can remember the 1st time i seen it in theater 12 years ago. Like all the people in the room i laugh my ass of. I cry by laughing so hard during all the movie (sorry for my English). And every time i saw it again on video, the magic still workingThe only time i laugh in "Dinner for Schmucks" was in the very beginning when we see the mouses pictures. I thought it was well found , a good idea for the lobby of the "idiot". After that, nothing... Few smiles in the first part of the movie but thats all. Im a big fan of Steve Carrel but in this movie his character is too idiot, its too much. The reason why the original movie was that funny its because its was realistic in a way. Her its just too much and for me it make it loose all the fun. And its like that for all the character and the situation.The reason the original was so funny, and was such a huge success when it was released in France,it is because the writing was very well done, very subtle. "The idiot" is funny because he is clumsy, do some stuffs too quick without thinking of the aftermaths, but he is not in any way somebody that look like he escape from an asylum with 10 of IQ like Carrel character in this remake..Very hard to go to the end of this movie.. In fact during watching it i had to check on IMDb to see some reviews to see if i was the only one who didn't laugh at all. Im surprise to see that many people finding this one hilarious. May be the fact i see the original movie, knowning the mecanic of the script. But i try to see this one with a fresh eye.Anyway it doesn't work, and this one is the worst movie iv seen this year. My English isn't good enough to express what i fell about this movie but for me its a waste, a shame consedering the original material, as i said its my first review her but i had to warm people. My only advice, watch the original.It is a typical Hollywood failed remake when the writter thought "let's make the schmuck even stupidier so it will be even funnier!!!" Nope... it doesn't work like this.Again, sorry for my English, i just hope you get the the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to impress his girlfriend, Tim (Paul Rudd) needs to secure a promotion. So he decides to accept his bosses challenge; bring an 'idiot' to their annual 'Dinner for Winners'. A competition run by white-collar executives and disguised as a celebration of brilliance in unrecognised individuals. In reality, the meal is simply an opportunity for elitist senior-management types to laugh at some quirky and eccentric members of society. Tim's girlfriend tries to convince him the whole idea is abhorrent. Just as he is beginning to agree with her, he meets Barry (Steve Carell). An IRS worker, with a passion for creating art from taxidermied mice, Barry might just be the perfect man to help Tim win the competition.The US version of The Office has shown us that Carell can do awkward better than most and Anchorman proved his capabilities of making stupidity funny. However, his character here is completely unlikeable and, more often than not, irritating. His bowl haircut, glasses and protruding teeth, evoke bad seventies sitcoms. A time when this look would have been a stylists shorthand for 'socially inept'. Paul Rudd, on the other hand, is given little opportunity to make us laugh, playing two-dimensional straight man, Tim. Director Jay Roach's previous franchises (Austin Powers, Meet the Parents/Fockers) may not have been the greatest comedies of the past fifteen years, but delivered as and when expected. The problems with Dinner for Schmucks lie in the pacing and the writing. With a 114 minute runtime, it is simply too long. Entire characters and subplots are superfluous. It also suffers badly from second-act-drag, believing that given enough on-screen time we will somehow empathise with our two leads.Producer Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno), seems to have called in a number of favours from celebrity friends and cast them in every available role. The idea, presumably, is that good performances can boost a weak script into something amusing. Of Course, this is not the case. Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as avant-garde artiste, Kieran, makes the most of his characters nonsequiturs but only manages to raise a smirk at best. The same cannot be said for David Walliams (Little Britain), whose Swiss, aristocratic character, Mueller, is completely redundant in every way. The only worthy gag in almost two-hours is provided by Chris O' Dowd (The I.T. Crowd) as a blind swordsman. However having only a handful of lines and appearing twenty minutes before the credits roll, its far too little, far too late.Dinner for Schmucks starts with a premise full of comedic opportunities, but spends the next hour and a half ignoring these. The original, a French film from 1998 entitled The Dinner Game, was a social satire focusing on the ridiculous measures the aristocracy will go to amuse themselves. It was full of witty dialogue and, at 80 minutes long, it worked. As often happens, Hollywood seems to have missed the point and delivered a broad and bland remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad remake of an hilarious French movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The French original was a scream, which is why they bought the rights. Instead of subtitling the original, they went for a remake ? la sauce américaine. Just as in the case of The Vanishing, La Femme Nikita, Un Indien Dans la Ville, Le Grand Chemin and a dozen other films (at least), the remake is just plain awful. Steve Carell is reprising the late and much-regretted role played by Jacques Villeret. While the latter was believable as tax inspector with an interest in building structures out of toothpicks, Carell as a half-looney artistic taxidermist is way over the top. Bollywood made a version which was watchable, but the Hollywood version is a mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks is the adaptation of the French movie "Le dinner de Cons" which in itself is an adaptation of the play of the same name. In the original version Pierre Brochant (Thierry L'Hermitte) is a successful editor that takes part in monthly dinners where each host has to invite "a schmuck". On the night where Pierre and his "schmuck are supposed to go to dinner Pierre hurts his back and is unable to attend the dinner, therefore the evening takes a very strange turn of events including his wife's ex-husband an I.R.S inspector and a car accident.When David Guion and Michael Handelman put there hands on this script not only did they change the whole idea of the movie they also transformed it's meaning, the original version had a deeply ironic tone in which Francois Pignon (Tim) trying to do the right thing makes everything worse whereas in this version everything finishes well.In the American remake the movie is filled with an insane artist, a crazy ex-girlfriend and a psychic nemesis. The American company responsible for this release turned into ridicule a French classic. The message of hope conveyed in the movie is feeble and not believable in any way. Overall Big Brother has come in with a big wallet and once again transformed a French masterpiece into a ridiculous feel-good American production. The only positive note is the act of both Steve Carell and Paul Rudd who despite a shaky scenario manage to pull off a great performance.To sum-up I highly recommend the original version and advise you to stay away from the American re-make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy about and "idiot" changing your life. Carell was born to play this part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An account executive (Rudd) discovers the only way for him to get a promotion at his company is to find his own "special person" (Carell) and invite him to a company dinner. If you go off just the main 2 stars alone this is a must rent. This is one of those movies that come out where the script alone has a chance of being really funny, but it all comes down to casting. In this case the casting of every part, even the little ones, is what pushes this movie over the top into one of the funniest movies that has been released in a while. It's hard to imagine what the movie would have been like with out Rudd and Carell but I'm guessing not as good. This part seems written for Carell, he plays it perfectly and it is his funniest role since Brick in "Anchorman". The one downfall of the movie is that it is entirely predictable (most comedies are), but it is still a fun ride till the end. It seems like every comedy since the "Hangover" promotes itself as "The funniest movie since the Hangover", this one can actually live up to that standard. A definite must watch and I dare you not to laugh. I give it a B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Travesty!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Austin Powers" director Jay Roach serves up a less than appetizing rehash of French director Francis Veber's 1998 comic masterpiece "The Dinner Game." "Dinner for Schmucks" casts Paul Rudd cast as the straight man, while Steve Carell hams it up as a dim-witted idiot. Rudd and Carell have now co-starred in three comedies. Previously, they appeared together in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy." No, "Dinner for Schmucks" isn't half as hilarious as either "40-Year-Old Virgin" or "Anchorman." The premise of this half-baked hokum is that our hero's arrogant boss throws a once-a-month dinner party where his best and brightest employees compete to see who can bring the dumbest dinner guest. Typically, the dinner guests are such incredible imbeciles that they don't realize that they are being roasted instead of toasted. Essentially, these cold-blooded bigwigs at a private equity firm that cuts up other firms and sells off their assets need something for a good laugh. Unfortunately, "Dinner for Schmucks" comes up short on yucks. This politically incorrect plate of pabulum concerns an ambitious, young analyst who is prepared to sell his soul to the Philistines so he can realize his dreams, specifically marrying his girlfriend. Along the way, our hero realizes the error of ridiculing idiots so that he can attain his dreams. Long before he grasps what he has done, the humor in "Dinner for Schmucks" has lost its seasoning. The original French comedy concluded before the eponymous dinner. "Dinner for Schmucks," however, goes in for a seven course meal and wears out its welcome. Mind you, it is always a pleasure to watch Carell cutting up, and he seems to be genuinely having fun as an IRS processor and mouse taxidermist who assembles the dead rodents in detailed dioramas. Incidentally, designer Joel Venti and the cult effects Chiodo brothers, Charles, Edward and Stephen , who fashioned the puppets for "Team America: World Police," whipped up these inventive dioramas. The point is that Carell steals the show, but the show really isn't worth stealing. When Carell isn't carrying on his shtick, "Dinner for Schmucks" sucks.Financial analyst Tim (Paul Rudd of "Sidekicks") has been pestering his cute girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak of "The Devil Wears Prada") to marry him, but she is a career girl who orchestrates elaborate art deals. Meanwhile, Tim lives in an elegant apartment and drives an expensive sports car that he really cannot afford. After the president of Tim's firm, Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood of "Star Trek"), pink-slips an executive who took the business down the wrong path, Tim angles for the promotion. Tim concocts a scheme to bring a fabulously wealthy Swiss entrepreneur, Mueller (David Walliams of "Stardust"), to Fender Finances. Mueller owns a munitions firm with tons of leftover ordinance from World War I, basically bombs, and Tim has figured out a way to convert the bombs into lamps. Of course, Fender Finances will take a bath marketing the bomb lamps, but they will clean up managing Mueller's portfolio. Fender is desperately looking for ideas to turn his company around when Tim pitches his proposal. Initially, Fender wants to hand the project over to one of his surefire executives, but he finds Tim's blind ambition so refreshing that he lets him woo Mueller. Fender tells our hero about his super-secret party and invites him to bring the biggest boob. It doesn't take Julie long to convince Tim that the dinner is a dumb idea. Nevertheless, Tim needs that promotion so desperately so he can sweep Julie off her feet that he sets out to find a loser.Literally, Tim runs into a loser. Barry (Steve Carell) is picking up a dead mouse for his mice diorama when Tim hits him. Fortunately, Barry is none the worse for landing on Tim's hood and then being hurled several feet away. Initially, Tim fears the worst when Barry and he try to reach a monetary agreement, until Tim realizes that Barry plans to pay him for the damage to his sports car. After Tim breathes a sigh of relief, he asks Barry what he was doing in the middle of the street. Barry shows Tim a dead mouse that he was trying to retrieve from the street before our hero could flatten it with his care. Barry flaunts a book that contains photographs of the dead mice after he has dressed them up to resemble famous paintings, such as Whistler's mother. Tim knows a good thing when he sees it and cultivates Barry's friendship. Meantime, after Julie gets wind of what Tim plans to do, she wants to break up and devote herself to her latest insane art client, Kieran (Jemaine Clement of "Gentlemen Broncos"), whose art works of himself dressed up in a satyr costume are selling like crazy. As nutty as Barry is, Barry stands no chance alongside the warped, egotistical genius of Kieran. Predictably, Tim learns his lesson, and Barry and he show up Fender for the snobbish ape that he really is. However, before Barry can win the trophy as the biggest idiot, he must confront his intimidating IRS co-worker, Therman (Zach Galifianakis of "The Hangover"), another hopeless moron who constantly overshadows Barry.Incongruity is the source of the best comedy. The buffoons that Steve Carell, Jemaine Clement, and Zach Galifianakis play in "Dinner for Schmucks" are as funny as this labored comedy gets. What makes these performances work so well is that the actors appear to have no idea how ridiculous they look. Carell looks like he is channeling the comic actor Austin Pendleton of "My Cousin Vinny" with his spectacles, buck-teeth, and wacky haircut that makes him look particularly nerdy. Jemaine Clement scores points for "Dinner" as an eccentric artist obsessed with all things goat, and Zach Galifianakis never misses a chance to make himself look hopelessly cretinous. Despite its interesting characters, "Dinner for Schmucks" belongs in a richly deserved doggie bag, but not as a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a Horrible Adaptation of the French Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might help if you never saw the original French version, "Les Diner des Cons," Somehow, when Hollywood appropriates French films it nearly always leads to a disappointment (or loss) in translation. This is no exception.The original French film was built on a satirical premise of French social manners, based on how the French view a cultivated person. I don't know what this version satirizes, and I don't think anyone involved in this film did, either.The original version was also very funny. The humorous situations, very similar to the US version, were beautifully timed and very plausible. I've never laughed so much as I did watching the French version. To make this story plausible, the Rudd role really needs to be convincingly ruthless and mean. But Paul Rudd as a supposedly ambitious private equity analyst trying to climb the corporate ladder only comes off a nice guy, a regular guy, a bland guy - not someone who really wants to win at all costs - which would justify all the bad luck the character has.Carrell, as the idiot, should almost immediately gain our sympathy, but this over-the-top performance with the fake hair, nose and buck teeth only plays for low humor laughs. In the end, it's really hard to care about his broken marriage or the fact that he was ridiculed. The manic Carrell pitted against the bland Rudd comes off acting like Jim Carrey's Lloyd Christmas in "Dumb and Dumber", except without the laughs.My advice - get a copy of "Les Diner des Cons" if you want a to see a really great film and laugh yourself silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies ever. A disgrace to the original French movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not just that it's a completely awful adaptation, it's that it's an extremely BAD movie. I didn't watch this movie to compare it to the original, I really just wanted to watch the American version, after all the American version of "The Birdcage" was great. However, this movie is just plain crap! The original movie is funny because it's smart but the people who put this horrible fart of a movie together seem to have relied on the assumption that viewers would be either extremely drunk or superbly stupid to exude even a mediocre giggle.I can't even finish watching this thing but it looks like the makers adapted what they thought were the best scenes from original and threw in some ridiculous scenes of their own without providing any material to connect or justify it all.Really, total crap! It looks like the whole production was slapped together with the minimum amount of effort possibly required. Even Paul Rudd's acting is sloppy at many points. His character, Tim, is inconsistent throughout and the casting for his secretary is just awful. I just don't see what is funny about that bland woman. So many talented actors out there, it doesn't take much to select someone half-decent.Some of the worst scenes: it makes no sense that Tim was able to spot an idiot if he'd never had to spot one before. The scene where Darla the stalker goes to Tim's apartment is just plain stupid. And when Barry &amp; Tim go to the artist's apartment, c'mon! The artist doesn't even ask how they got in, just acts as if they've run into one another in the street.I wonder if Rudd's and Carell's careers are already on the decline for them to accept doing such a terribly awful movie. And what's happening in Hollywood? Gotta stop hiring each other's friends and get some talented people to write scripts. There's NO shortage of writers in this world, the industry can do better if it wants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strained, misbegotten remake with a few chuckles at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Painfully unfunny. As a fan of Steve Carell and Paul Rudd (not to mention Jermaine Clement and Zak G) and sometimes of director Jay Roach, it's hard to reckon how none of these talented people noticed how strained, mean-spirited and downright ridiculous this comedy is. No one behaves like an actual human being, and Carell's "loser" character is so annoying you're insulted when the script asks us to find him lovable-- you'd rather strangle him. A deeply cynical, formulaic farce without a shred of anything resembling reality. Even the broadest comedy has to be based in some recognizable behavior. It mocks the bad corporate villains for making fun of the fools invited to the party, and does the same thing itself. A few scattered laughs is the best you can hope for. What a waste of talented people. The producers should be spanked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'd have to be a schmuck to waste your money on this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really a big fan of Steve Carrell personally, but Despicable Me was funny and I've heard a few good reviews so I decided to check it out. The concept is fairly funny and could've have been really entertaining: Invite a bunch of idiots to dinner, whoever entertains the most wins, but that's when it just went wrong: None of the characters were even remotely likable. I seriously thought "who the hell would want to deal with any of these people?" throughout most of the movie. Tim and Julie who were supposed to be in love reminded me of a crochity old married couple who hated each other. Julie was constantly b*tching at Tim over God knows what throughout the whole movie and I kept thinking "Can anything make this chick happy? Jesus!" And Tim just sat there and took it like an idiot. Then Barry (Carell) comes in, and seriously, I wanted to punch him in the face throughout the whole movie. Nothing he did was funny, remotely clever, or even close to being likable or cute. Whatever he did was just annoying and extremely obnoxious. Even the dressed up mice thing didn't come off as funny because his character was so undeniably unlikeable, it just came off as stupid. All in all, you'd have to be a schmuck to waste your money on this movie. Taking a great concept and putting not even close to likable characters together does NOT equal a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie Started at 7pm... by 815 I left my Gf my brother and his Gf to go outside and relax in the car. Steve Carrol is just plain stupid in this movie, and really I normally enjoy his humor. However, this one missed the mark! I really wanted to ask people during the film what they found funny. Worst movie I've seen in 5 years! And sadly my last film was Inception. To go from such an excellent film to this one was painful. Save your hard earned dollars and rent one tonight... this one is FUBAR'd.. I felt in some ways they tried to copy getting to the Greek and just really missed the boat. The cast all fit very well except, you've guessed it Steve Carrol. Honestly, if you enjoy his humor as I have in the past SKIP THIS MOVIE. I tried to watch the office when I got home and due to his performance in this film I felt like it changed my whole view on this gentleman as an actor and comedian. Hope this helps! Be excellent to each other!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner for Schmucks (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A predictably loud and crass American interpretation of a mini-classic from France. This film is full of comedic actors, unintentionally following the plot of the film. The film sees businessmen bring idiots to dinner, trying to one-up each other. The film itself has a bunch of comedic actors, trying to be as over-the-top as possible, in an attempt to one-up each other. These shenanigans are distracting and sometimes shameful. As Carell and Galifianakis shoot mind bullets at each other, no one is having as much fun as them. Rudd tries to play it likable, while Carell is too stupid to care about. The original had me switching allegiances between a genuinely horrible guy and a doofus. Adding the actual dinner to the film just leads to a predictable message and a painful running time. It's nice to see so many comedians from New Zealand, the UK, and America, but no one has enough to do. The original was subtle, witty, and clever. This is a loud and obnoxious ego inflation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misleading trailers mixed with unfunny humour and dull predictable situations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks had very misleading trailers. Having not seen the original French version of the film, I didn't really know exactly what this film would be based on or how it would be. I saw many trailers showing the dinner as the main target, yet while watching the film, the whole dinner is basically just used as a subplot. It gets talked about quite a lot throughout the film but once it reaches that point, it seems very dull and predictable. The main plot was basically the relationship with Paul Rudd's character and his girlfriend after Steve Carell's character comes into Rudd's life only to stir up their relationship.Their were may awkward situations and many unfunny scenes. For most the characters were just annoying and unlikable, specifically Stev Carell's character. His character Barry just forced himself threw Tim's life without anything- he cause him to ruined Tim's relationship with his girlfriend and almost ruining his job promotion, yet of course at the end it ends with a happy ending. The dinner scene (start around 83min) was quite okay, not funny as it should have been but entertaining in the least. The mouse art by Carell's character was pretty neat. Overall though, the film was quite disappointing and I didn't laugh throughout The point of the movie is how miserable Tim's life is made by Barry, and audiences will know exactly how he feels.</fullReview>

I feel robbed for spending 4.99 at blockbusters to rent this! I can honestly say the best part of the movie was the very beginning where the mice were shown. That was very cute but from then on it got worse and worse. I kept waiting for something to change but it didn't. How could Steve feel good about playing this character? I wouldn't think there would be enough money in the world. The artist character was weird too, what was that? Creepy man doing very strange creepy things NOT FUNNY things at all!

		<fullReview>What a piece of trash! I watched this movie because I was so desperate to watch a new movie. It was a bad idea! Spoilers after this: Now, this movie is just TOO crazy! These type of unrealistic movies were spawned from the SNL movies like "A Night at the Roxburry" then came stuff like "Dodgeball" and "Blades of Glory." These movies I listed are GOOD because there is SOME amount of sanity in them! In ANatR the two main people are crazy the rest of the people are normal. This allows the crazy people to PLAY OFF the sane ones! It's like yelling in a noisy room. No one can hear you. It's just noise.You must have the normal person for the viewer to relate to and understand the story. Dinner for Schmucks is filled with ONLY crazy people. Just when you think "Well it can't get any crazier than this." It does! I wanted to stop watching the movie halfway it was so bad. I kept watching to see if sanity would make an appearance! I was so uncomfortable throughout the whole movie. It was not funny just disturbing and gross. These people need to get serious help! The guy who thinks the puppet is his wife is hearing voices in his head. The woman who connects to dead animals is having psychotic episodes. The man with the bird is having an identity crisis. The mouse guy is just really stupid, and his boss has control issues. These type of movies make me lose faith in humanity. NONE of the people try to help these people? No one stands up to the corrupt boss? People should be allowed to be gluttons? All types of sin are in this movie: lust (crazy ex) gluttony (foregin investor) greed (boss) pride (crazy boss) wrath (blind guy) envy (mouse guy) sloth (artist).I assume the actors did it for the money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this movie features some of the grand talents in today's comedy - Carell, Galifianakis and to the lesser extent Rudd - it is an utter disaster. The jokes are unfunny, the plot is atrocious, the dialogs are cheesy or/and stupid to the point of absurdity, the finale is typical of a Hollywood "blockbuster" - everything turns out great for the main characters and we're not even sure why because the plot is so unconvincing and poor. Even the gags by Carell and Galifianakis, some of which are even amusing, cannot save this tragedy. The only proper thing I could spot is the acting. And I mean proper since most of the employed names are trained actors therefore one cannot see any faults in that department but on the other hand observes average acting without any spectacular attempts. 3 out of 10 is one of the lowest ratings I had ever given a movie and hence the review.</fullReview>

Sincerely, if Brazil do a movie like this no one would never see a Brazilian movie again. For example, only with the exposure of one our biggest flaws, showed in 'Elite Squad', we had some attention from the world. Really, in my opinion this idea was an insult to art. Hollywood, never the same. To be clear I feel so pleased to watch US movies from the 60'70'80's and course, we don't forget about 90s, the launcher for a few of greatest artists this time, but unfortunately, I was thinking about this, watching the iconic 'The Addams Family', just two days ago 'the 2000s seems that the fantastic writing lost space for this small colored drawing that makes the engine run by so sold arts and consumed by the excess.'Each time harder to appreciate some of this so called '7th art', if I may, used to call!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barry (Steve Carell) really gets under your skin, and, like an itch he isn't going to be scratched away. The beautiful opening titles of this film are, deliberately I would guess, out of keeping with a lot of what follows. The premise here is, at heart, what makes people good, bad and indifferent and how this impacts on their relationships with others. The film predicates that whilst we may not be able to significantly change ourselves, close others can tell us when we are changing for better or worse.Carell is pretty convincing as a clammy but gifted, in his own way, guy, and Paul Rudd (as Tim) does his best to be an even bigger schmuck and as equally irritating as Carell but in a different way. The plot centres around Tim's career and love life, the latter based upon his current interest Julie (Stephanie Szostak) who is beautiful and evasive, and Darla (brilliantly portrayed by Lucy Punch) who won't let our Tim go.The comedic content of this film is a mixture of sharp satire, witty dialogue, slapstick, sight gags and straight forward one liners, and the characters are easy to pitch into the good, bad or indifferent boxes. The film irritates the hell out of you at times because that is what characters like Barry do, but you feel dreadfully sorry for him when he is hurt. And it isn't just Barry who irritates. Most of the cast grate on you in one way or another proving that, from best to worse personality wise, there isn't much difference. Indeed it is hard to find the normal idea of a straightforward character in the plot such are the contradictions and eccentricities of almost all, even Tim in his weakest moments.I'd like to say the Dinner for Schmucks, when it arrives, is worth the wait, but it is probably the weakest point of the entire plot. That is not to say what was on offer wasn't funny, it is just hard to judge just who the biggest schmucks were. As I said the film can be clumsy in places but it doesn't stop you liking it.This isn't a comedy classic but it is worth the viewing. Six out of ten and a big silver star for Lucy Punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Carell's worst comedic performance to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For as long as movie making started in Hollywood, they have been remaking or outright copying French movies. This movie is no exception! Dinner For Schmucks is a pathetic, moronic and plain just unfunny movie. I rarely walk out of movie theaters but thankfully I didn't watch this crap in one!! The title is already an almost literal translation of the French title. Just replacing the French word 'con' with the Yiddish word 'Schmuck' and you have it- The story has a vague forgettable plot which resembled the original. The characters are NOT funny and therefore don't allow the viewers to identify or even sympathize with them. Once again the golden rule of remakes in Hollywood turns out to be true!!! Having seen the original, highly successful and hilarious French comedy Le dîner de cons written and directed by Francis Veber. Dinner For Schmucks is nothing like it! Steve Carell, who is usually funny and a comedic expert, completely fails at being remotely amusing. Even New Zealand born Jermaine Clement slightly above average performance cannot save this film from disaster. Trust me don't waste your time or money on this movie!! If you do decide to watch it, you will be sorry. And this is not a threat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creators of this movie are dumber than the title idiots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just, WOW! This movie is amazing. It is miraculously bad. A massive misfire to end all misfires.The screenplay has absolutely no thought put into it, nor any care for how inconsistently it flows. When it isn't overly dull and talky, the comedy aspect is incredibly mean spirited, not to mention hypocritical. The film has a half baked moral of treating "extraordinary people" as equal, but it feels no shame in exploiting them so much beforehand, and even after the moral is practically spelled out. These creators are more moronic than the title idiots.On top of that, the movie is directed with no discipline whatsoever by Jay Roach. Paul Rudd can't use a single ounce of his flat character to his advantage, and Steve Carell's wonderful comedic charm is ultimately absent, and is littered with annoyance. His character is so irritating that I just wanted to strangle him. And you've also got some talented comics in this movie like Jemaine Clement, but they just flat out suck.Saving Graces? Few. Kristen Schaal has some half decent zingers (Though I credit that more to her improv than the script), and Zach Galifianakis gives the one legitimately funny performance in the movie, but it's an overall dull experience. I hate to say this, but this is worse than The Last Airbender.* out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i really can't believe the amount of people who enjoy this movie. i saw it to relax before the new year eve's craziness, i wanted to see something funny and i thought: "paul rudd, steve carell, some guys from the daily show, it must be funny"... but well, i knew that i was wrong as soon as the first carell scene, that was just annoying... i have to recognize that i'm not a carell fan, even liking the office, i find that his humor in movies is too childish, disneysh, and in this one is so painful to watch, and is all because the obnoxious character that carell plays and the childish humor that creates.besides, the combo of rational guy vs. dumb guy, classic humorous dynamic, in this movie doesn't work, because the idiot is too annoying and unlikable so when the normal guy don't kill him it just looks forced.for the other hand, there's a couple of good characters. keiran, who is a completely unoriginal stereotype of an artist, but the guy was funny, so was the blind guy at the end... and that's all. nothing more works in this bad written piece of junk... and i can assure you all that i really wanted to like this, i wanted to spend a good afternoon with a funny movie, but is just impossible to laugh at this painful experience, i have to ask for forgiveness of my brother, whom i invited. it was terrible!... and very insulting, is like trying to make an adult laugh by shaking some car keys in front of his face... awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spotty comedy, saved by Carrell's brilliant performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it was the great comedian Edmund Gwenn who made the statement that "Dying is easy, comedy is hard." That is probably true but I am convinced that there are some actors who can make comedy look easy. At his best, Steve Carrell does just that. In 'Dinner for Schmucks' he occupies the role of Barry Speck, a blithering idiot for whom life is a jolly holiday and cynicism is a notion that seems to have passed him over. Barry's view of the world is devoid of irony or whimsy, he stares blankly with wide eyes and a stupid grin and never seems to understand what is happening right in front of him.Let me give you an example. Near the beginning of the movie, Barry is being seduced by a blond bimbo who tells him that she thinks she needs a spanking. We get this exchange: The Blond: "I'm a naughty school girl. I've been bad." Barry: "You look a little old to be a school girl" The Blond: "You're my schoolmaster. I need to be punished." Barry: "I'm not really qualified for that. I work for the IRS."That kind of idiocy makes Barry the perfect tool for Tim Conrad (Paul Rudd), a mid-level financial executive who curries favor with his implacable boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) when he manages to sell a Swiss billionaire on the idea of turning defective bombs into effective, yet unattractive, lamps. Fender is impressed and invites Tim to an annual dinner party at his mansion, a "Dinner for Winners" in which the purpose is for each guest to bring the biggest idiot they can find. The guest with the most entertaining idiot wins a trophy.The journey getting to that dinner party mostly involves Tim trying to survive Barry's idiocy. He has a way of saying and doing the most outrageous things while maintaining a demeanor that lets us believe that he hasn't the slightest clue that his behavior is the least bit odd, even his hobby of making cute dioramas with dead mice.The first half of the film is genuinely funny, as it observes Barry and his world as he looks out with wide eyes, a goofy smile. Yet, the rest of the movie is spotty. Once we get to know Barry, the movie tries to mix a riot of slapstick comedy with moments of sentimentality that are mostly made up of half-baked speeches about the value of friendship.The third act gets the film back on track somewhat as we finally arrive at that dinner party. What works are the simple observations about Barry and the other morons in attendance (one of whom is Jeff Dunham who is in a marital spat with one of his dummies). Those characters are funny but the scene goes overboard with a very long battle involving Barry and a nitwit mind-reader named Thurman Munch (Zach Galifianakis) who wears Dickies over his shirts and has a self-satisfied autobiography called "Your Mind Is My Puppet". The scene quickly spirals into a very bizarre area reminiscent of some of Monty Python's lesser sketches.Steve Carrell is the the entire reason for seeing 'Dinner for Schmucks'. His wonderful performance is pitch perfect, playing a lovable dolt who genuinely believes what he says, even when he confesses to Tim that the reason his wife left his that "I lost her clitoris". To see the deadpan look in his eyes is to understand that Barry believes this statement completely. It is also possibly to understand why his wife really left him.*** (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the Idiot does not Know Who Santos Dumont Was....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1998 French comedy "Le Diner de Cons" is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. The witty theatrical screenplay is intelligent and hilarious and I laughed a lot along the 80 minutes running time.Unfortunately I have decided to see this American remake expecting a funny comedy but the plot is so ridiculous that I did not laugh. The title of this movie should be "A Film for Schmucks", and the screenplay writers David Guion and Michael Handelman should have wined the competition in the dinner for schmucks if they were guests for destroying the magnificent storyline. The clumsy character of Steve Carell is extremely annoying, stupid, irritating and never funny and there is no explanation why the clever Tim stays with him after the initial mess with Julie. The poor idiot does not know who Santos Dumont was in his presentation, but what else could I expect from this lame story. The good point is the sweet and beautiful Stephanie Szostak, an unknown actress that shines in this terrible flick. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Um Jantar Para Idiotas" ("A Dinner for Idiots")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for schmucks is just a mess from beginning all the way to end. The script is not funny, and neither are the actors. This film is annoying, not funny, there is a big big difference, and unfortunately, not even comedy legend Steve Carrel can save this mess from failure. Paul Rudd is the stereotypical jerk in the movie, and Carrel is the stereotypical idiot in the movie that you on one hand feel very sorry for, then on the other hand, you are incredibly annoyed by him. The "comedy" here is soo awkward and very unoriginal. Take my advice and go see a real comedy film that is worth your time to watch, not this thing..... 1/10 for Dinnner for Schmucks. And this review is coming from a Steve Carrel fan...... so you can imagine my big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner with idiots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What genius in Hollywood thought he could improve on an original French film that stands by itself, which in addition, was witty and funny? Judging by other 'adaptations' for movies that originated in France, the odds for 'Dinner for Schmucks' to succeed as a good comedy were nil, at best. This was a project that might have appeared to being ripe for the trans Atlantic voyage, but alas, something happened before it landed in L.A.This was obviously a Steve Carell's vehicle. After all, he was going to play the schmuck in the film. From all his films, we thought this must have been his worst appearance. Mr. Carell has done much better, something that unfortunately does not happen under the direction of Jay Roach, a man identified with the Fockers and Austin Powers sagas. The problem seems to be the screenplay written by David Guion and Michael Handelman. It is over plotted and over long. In comparison, the original "Le diner de cons", created by Francis Veber looks like a masterpiece.The best thing in the film is Paul Rudd, playing the straight man, to Mr. Carell's goofy, mice loving guy. Mr. Rudd is an impeccable actor who always manages to shine in whatever he is asked to play. The side story of Kieran, as played by Jemaine Clement and the IRS inspector of Zach Galifianakis, just do not make it because both characters are phonies. Lucy Punch has some good moments as the woman infatuated with Tim. Kristen Schaal casts a nice presence as well as the beautiful Stephanie Szostak, who plays Julie. Bruce Greenwood, a serious actor, had the misfortune to play the mean boss giving the party for the 'schmucks'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dinner I would've liked to skip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Vincent Van Gogh: everyone said to him, you can't be a great painter, you only have one ear. And you know what he said? I can't hear you.¨I was expecting great things from this slapstick comedy that featured some of today's best and funniest comedians, but the truth of the matter was that I left disappointed because it was painful to watch at times. Surprisingly despite starring Steve Carell and Paul Rudd there are very few funny scenes. Not even Zach Galifianakis was able to save the movie. All these actors have made much better films in the past and they usually are reliable actors, but this time around they failed due to a very weak screenplay. The movie was actually based on a 1998 French film named Le Diner de Cons and the screenplay was adapted by David Guion and Michael Handelman. Together with director Jay Roach (Austin Powers and Meet the Parents) they managed to do the impossible: turn these hilarious actors into your average wannabe comedians. There is no other reasonable explanation as to why this comedy didn't work. They merely managed to create very uncomfortable situations and ridiculous characters. The moral of the story seems to be telling us how evil these men are who simply invite the most idiotic guests for dinner just to have a good time, but at the same time that is exactly what we are supposed to be laughing at. So they seem to be pointing at us and making us realize how wrong it is for the businessmen to make fun of these characters, but at the same time we are supposed to be laughing at them for being so stupid. Talk about being hypocritical this is number one. Tim (Paul Rudd) is an executive who is working his way up in the equity firm. One of the top employees has been fired so Tim finds the opportunity to climb the corporate ladder. His boss Lance (Bruce Greenwood) is impressed by Tim's new ideas and offers him the opportunity to replace the fired Jacobson, but first he will have to find the most idiotic person he can find and invite him for a monthly dinner he and his colleagues share called ¨dinner for idiots.¨ Tim knows this is his chance to impress his boss although he feels morally wrong about making fun of other people. Tim accidentally runs into an IRS employee named Barry (Steve Carell) who happens to have a hobby: creating mouseterpieces (he imitates famous works of art with stuffed dead mice). Tim knows Barry is the perfect candidate for this dinner so he decides to invite him. Big mistake; Barry ends up pretty much stalking Tim and following him everywhere and at the same time destroying everything around him, including his relationship with his long time girlfriend, Julie (Stephanie Szostak). Julie, who works for an egocentric artist named Kieran (Jemaine Clement), is a very sweet girl, but when she finds out about the dinner she gets in a big fight with Tim. The situation gets worse thanks to a couple of mix ups with Barry and Tim's life begins to go downhill.I kept on waiting for the comedy to begin, but as the movie progressed I kept on finding it more and more mean-spirited up to the very end when the actual dinner takes place. The situations just kept on getting more and more awkward kind of in the same way Meet the Parents did, except this time without the comedy. It was hard to root for any of the characters because they were just poorly developed. Rudd seemed like a nice guy, but he would do anything to move up the corporate ladder and get the promotion, Carell was just too annoying and overly characterized to sympathize with, and Galifianakis was perhaps the funniest in the film but had very little screen time. Szostak was the only character I really liked, but she deserved much better than Rudd. By the end of the film I really didn't care much what happened to any of them. The movie just ended up building a lot of unwanted tension without ever being funny. The screenwriters and director just went way too far out with Carell's character and it was impossible to sympathize with him. They missed the mark by making his character really unlikeable and irritating. I'm always amused as to how these doomed characters always find some sort of enlightenment near the end of the film and somehow save the day. It's as if Carell's character is a completely different person at the end in order for everything to fit in its place. This is a forgettable film and another remake gone bad: definitely worth a skip.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

In his office scened he overplayed his weirdo character perfect for deleted scenes. Good scene but not for the plot. Carrell's character was lovable yet disturbing in a way that no one before him played. I would say: better deeper and more touching that the original one. It's made to make a statement for all the weirdos out there who deserve to be loved.There is not much to be said about Rudd, he is just sweet and funny as always.

He is going to admit that he is a jerk and Julie is going back to him. Barry is going to be a guy who is really not an idiot but a really good guy, a little weird but incredibly cool, sensitive and he is probably going to help Paul. Paul is going to apologize to Barry and to Julie. etc.There are a few funny moments, and the acting is not so bad, specially Steve Carrell. One can argue that the cast couldn't do anything with the script, but I fault them with not choosing better scripts. For a guy or girl that is not well known, or for someone who has a difficult time getting a job, this could be a good opportunity, but not for Steve Carrell or Paul RuddI am going ahead and torture my self by finishing watching the movie. If you happen to be watching it, you probably, feel the same way I do. If I happen to be wrong, I am going to give up my IMDb.com membership.</fullReview>

Paul Rudd played his typical type character but it did not work this time either. I kept telling myself that nobody is this big of an idiot and nobody would allow this idiot to affect their life to this level.

There were only a couple saps in the theater but you could hear the moans and groans. On the way out there were a lot of blank stares and "what the hell was that" comments.

Those movies may be winners, but this movie is a winner too. Other movies can be winners. Not just the winners.This movie deserves a 6.5 rating not the current 5.9. At IMDb, a 7.0 is really really good, an 8.0 is a super great magnificent blockbuster. Higher is almost unheard of. But they do exist. Higher rated movies are almost always a sure bet to be a winner. But any movie in the 6's is usually worth watching, while any movie in the 5's is probably pretty okay. Even some movies in the 4's can be okay, so the movies in the 5's are even more okay. But the movies in the 6's are really really good, which would mean the movies in the 7s would have to be changed to exceptionally good, not just really really good.On the other hand, IMDb ratings can often be totally the result of a bunch of numbheads. We should invite them to dinner.This is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were Rudd and Carell thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks is a rambling, overlong, and unfunny comedy that is even worse than its title implies.This pointless 2010 comedy stars Paul Rudd as Tim, a business executive who is promised a promotion if he brings the right person to a monthly dinner held by his boss, where his employees are instructed to bring the biggest idiot they can find so that they can make fun of the dumbest guest and actually give him a trophy as the evening's biggest idiot. Tim accidentally meets Barry (Steve Carell), a nerd who is into mouse taxidermy and before he actually goes to the dinner, ends up methodically destroying Tim's life, primarily by ruining his relationship with his girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak) by bringing a crazed stalker named Darla (Lucy Punch) into his life and messing up an important business dinner with clients from Switzerland.Despite my opening remark about this movie, it was the title of the film that initially attracted me to this film but I learned you definitely can't judge a film by its cover. Let's start with a rambling screenplay that's all over the place and tries to cover so much ground that interest cannot be sustained for the film's unbelievably ridiculous running time. The section of the film where Barry ruins Tim's life just goes on way too long and has nothing to do with the original premise of the film. The story going straight from Barry and Tim's meeting straight to the dinner of the title might have been a good idea, but this part of the movie is just as ridiculous as the rest of it, adding a layer of mean-spiritedness to the boredom and stupidity that set in 45 minutes ago.Jay Roach's direction is as all over the place as the screenplay and the performances aren't much better. Rudd and Carell are fighting the script all the way and Punch is over the top as Darla as is Jemaine Clement as an eccentric artist who has the hots for Tim's girlfriend. As much as I love Paul Rudd and Steve Carell, this movie is a mess. Jay Roach had much better luck a decade earlier with Meet the Parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying, Stupid and Cruel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks is an insult, to both the actors and audience. I felt nothing but negative feelings and disdain toward all the characters.Tim (Paul Rudd) is a guy working in crappy office job who is looking to climb the corporate ladder. The opportunity rises when he comes up with a clever idea and is asked to a dinner with a foreign businessman. The catch is that he must bring a "fool" to the dinner like everyone else is. The point of the party is for everyone to make a spectacle of their own "fool", and at the end of the night the dumbest and strangest guest gets a prize. While he is at first alarmed at the idea of this party, Tim instead starts thinking about proposing to his girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak). As his luck would have it, Tim stumbles upon Barry (Steve Carell), a strange man who collects dead mice and creates dioramas with them. Tim befriends Barry and brings him to his apartment, where Barry begins to mess up his relationship with Julie, let his stalker-ex Darla (Lucy Punch) know where he lives, and even jeopardizes his career. Barry drives Tim crazy, but the night of the fateful dinner party arrives and they encounter a strange array of people including a woman who talks to dead animals, a man married to a ventriloquist dummy, and a "mind control" expert (Zach Galifianakis).To sum it up, this movie is annoying and mean. It's got the air of a "What About Bob" movie where one exceedingly annoying character destroys the life of some average guy. There is literally nothing likable about Barry, and at best you will sometimes feel pity for how people treat him. Tim is also hard to relate to because while we are also annoyed by Barry's obnoxiousness, he is being a complete jerk by using and exploiting him. Truly, none of the characters are likable. I'll admit that the dinner itself is kind of funny, but that's about 15 minutes out of an almost two hour movie. While it tries to have the characters redeem themselves by making friends and "being nice", it doesn't change the fact this is a movie about how much fun it is to bully people who are different. It reminds me of cruel parties that sororities or fraternities have to bring the nerdiest/ugliest/fattest date. I could even look past that nastiness if this movie was actually good, but it's just not. While I've not seen it, I have heard that the original French film is hilarious, so that's even more pathetic. It's a total waste of good comedic talent like Carell, Rudd, and Galifianakis. Do yourself a favor and watch The 40-Year Old Virgin or The Hangover instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Steve Carell but he needs to change his choice of movies and quickly. He is seriously in danger of going down the same route as Jim Carrey , Will Ferrell and Seth Rogan and of starring as the same person but just in a different film. The dork character he keeps playing is tired and audiences are seeing through it.This is the ridiculous story of Tim , who in order to get promotion , need to bring an idiot to a dinner parter hosted by his boss and it just so happens he has bumped into the perfect idiot - Barry , played by Steve Carell.This film is stupid . as you would expect , but the big it makes is treating the audience like an idiot. This is a film that has one , maybe two , laughs and that's nowhere near enough. It's too long and has too may sub plots going on. Carell is annoying as is , David Walliams and Zach Galifianakis . The best thing about Dinner for Schmucks is Jemaine Clement who i think has the potential to be a big star.The biggest Schmuck around is not Barry but me for watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't describe Steve Carell as a comic genius exactly but he's usually entertaining. In Dinner for Schmucks though, his character is so irredeemably unlikeable that the only emotion I could muster was annoyance. Steve fails to capture the charm of Zach Galifianakis' very similar character in Due Date or the wit of Jim Carrey's somewhat similar performance as the unwanted friend in The Cable Guy. He just comes off as a feckless moron who's unlike-ability is topped only by Lucy Punch's horrendously over-the-top performance as the token psycho ex-girlfriend.Paul Rudd plays it is as bland and safe as I've come to expect from every performance he ever gives. He is surely one of the least versatile actors ever to make the Hollywood A-list. The plot is fairly uninteresting but that wouldn't matter so much if it was funnier. Unfortunately the jokes are mostly bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute insult to the movie industry. Steve Carell looks more like an owl here. With his fang teeth hanging out, he looks as though he is a mouse. What a character, all he does is relate his caricatures to mice while working for the IRS.He brings havoc to the guy he meets and completely succeeds in turning the latter's life totally upside down. This screwball comedy is well beyond belief. The writing is worse than amateurish and terribly stupid and lacks any form of adult maturity whatsoever.Only the last 5 minutes or so is worthwhile because you know that the film is going to end and that the two lovers realize they're made for each other.</fullReview>

I watched it and i can honestly say it was not funny at all, i don't understand why it was called dinner for schmucks because that was not the main problem of the movie. The jokes were if you will 'nerdy' and the movie in general was not Steve Carrels best movie or acting in that matter. The mice where just scary and wrong. I cannot speak French but i think the movie 1999 movie 'Dinner for Cretins' was probably much better and much funnier. All in all the movie 'Dinner for Schmucks' was not a movie I would like to view again.</fullReview>

However, their talent could not save this remake of an incredibly funny french film(Le dîner de cons http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119038/). This is a very poor film in nearly all aspects with the exception of the concept(again, remake). I do not recommend this film for anyone, especially if you have seen the original. And if you haven't seen the original; go watch it. This is one of those movies that tries way to hard to be funny. And it does not do Steve Carell, Paul Rudd or the original film any justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank goodness I waited for this film to be released on DVD and didn't spend any money to see it in the theater. Though I'm not a great admirer of Steve Carell's work, I watched this film because of Paul Rudd (of whom I first became aware in "The Object of My Affection", released in 1998). Only because of Paul Rudd did I watch this film to its end. Unfortunately, I wasted two hours of my life. Though the premise held some promise, the end result was VERY disappointing, one significant reason for which is that the viewer has to ENDURE (that's the correct word) the unfathomable and, by extension, UNFUNNY mess Barry (Steve Carell) creates for Tim (Paul Rudd) before getting to the actual dinner, which itself has little going for it beyond what occurs between Barry and Therman (Zach Galifianakis). Director Jay Roach was obviously not up to snuff when he directed this mess and Writers David Guion and Michael Handelman did very poorly in their adaptation of "The Dinner Game".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was at the premiere of Dinner de Los Cons remake (Dinner for Schmucks) in a packed cinema when a man took a call on his mobile about half way through. Much to my delight the crowd turned on him and booed and hissed at him. I used to think that these sorts of incidents could be avoided by going to the first session on a weekday when there is hardly anyone at the cinema but no. I was unlucky enough to be seated behind that most unheralded of cinema pests - the obsessive fanboy! Three of them to be exact. All were dressed as Pierre Brochant (as he appeared in the 1998 French version) and carrying towels. Well, every scene required immediate "expert" analysis and comparison to the original play, French radio and TV versions. They were drunk, and then they started shouting and giggling. They then produced a few longnecks and started drinking and spilling beer everywhere. They didn't see a single second of the movie wrapped up in their own world.Adolescent moralists like these twerps might like - it makes with the retard jokes all the way through, then gets sappy about not making fun of retards. Carell, Rudd and company are on their last leg here. This sloppy, sappy take on a French classic is a flop.I made it through the first hour before walking out. It was like waiting for the chance to watch paint dry. That first hour was spent introducing the dinner and Steve Carels character. That is the problem. They have nothing to say. In the process of trying to draw this story out to movie length, they stick us with asinine conversations between Rudd and Carell that are simply not funny. The stuffed-mouse Last Supper was good for about ten seconds of humor, but after an hour they were still trying to milk mouse Jesus for laughs. There might be a movie in there somewhere, but these guys haven't found it.</fullReview>

Steve Carrel was good but the weak plot made that movie worthless.There is no systematic flow. Very bad editing is probably one factor. Especially the last presentation scene was really not making any special effect which initially seems to be like a great ending. This scene was not in the Indian version so that's why maybe it was felt a little separated from the movie. Seriously that movie has lots of loop holes which greatly effect the flow. Ironically the Indian movie was the copy of the 1988 French movie "The Dinner Game".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I had thought had original potential (Rudd is just perfectly funny, but not in a flamboyant way) dragged on unmercifully and painfully into the realm of absurdity. The realm of absurdity can actually be hysterically funny at times, but when it isn't it's obvious the writers have horribly misjudged the envision of comedic value, and thus screwed the pooch. You then walk away hoping the film ended 15-30 minutes beforehand, just like Get him to the Greek. In fact, the weird painter Rudd's character is paranoid about, actually is very similar to Brand's Aldus Snow character in GHTTG.Bright performances: Rudd's secretary, I liked her character in a quirky Zoe Deschanel way. Rudd himself consistently good performance. The Office Ron Livingston guy not bad, but he's done better. All in all worth a buck to rent at redbox but not much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Carell is great in all his movies, but he owned this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Carell is one of my favorite actors, more and more each movie I've seen him in (not in chronological order). Then in looking for another comedy, I saw this one. Then I looked on IMDb and it had a 5.7 rating, slightly low for a film with Carell in it, who by the way is estimated to get $20 million a film these days. Now, I will say all the other characters are fantastic in their roles, but I do not think there was any scene that Carell's character (Barry) was in where he spoke or acted that I could not help but laugh at or just plain crack-up. And that to me is why he is worth what he is paid. Not only is he worth his salary in acting and comedy, but he owned this role like no one else could! And that is brilliant talent. Most likely, if you do watch this film, when it is over you would agree its him that takes this film up two notches from the 5.7 to an 8 stars out of 10.In concluding, the plot and parts of some of the supporting actors' scripts and roles might seem a little quirky or surreal in just reading the synopsis, but actually I found all of those areas of this film entertaining and amusing as well, if you pay attention to subtlety of statements or jokes throughout, but all of this is just the cake. And it is Carell whom, in my opinion, is the icing on that cake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would you believe another remake? Wow, I must be on a remake roll. This one is a remake of a French film called "Le Diner de Cons". I haven't seen the original, so don't be hatin' on me, okay? I know that this film has gotten a lot of bad press but I gotta say.... I actually liked it. I was in the mood for a silly comedy with inept characters and this movie certainly fit the bill. Let me tell you just a wee bit about it...Tim (Rudd) is trying to move up the corporate ladder and in order to do so, he has to invite an idiot to a dinner party where his boss (Greenwood) and co-workers make fun of them and award the #1 idiot. Tim's girlfriend (Szostak) is totally against it -- but she already has a great job, an art curator for a hot new artist (Clement) who is as strange as they come. Then Tim runs into (literally) Barry (Carell). What's a man to do? The perfect opportunity has landed in his lap and his boss has told him that it's a "no harm, no foul" kind of party. That's when Barry totally turns Tim's life around. Sure, most people would have left after Barry intercepted an instant message from a stalker (Punch) and gave out their home address, but this is a comedy movie.... just like people suspend belief in action movies of bad guys having poor aim... people should suspend belief that nice people don't just go off on the perpetually stupid in these kind of movies.Too many people are ruining Galifianakis' appearance in the movie -- just saying too much about who he plays and his character's involvement in the film. I figured out where he fit into the equation the moment he popped onto the screen but too many people out there are ruining it for those who haven't seen the film. I won't say anymore - just that he was a welcome addition to an already great comic duo in Rudd and Carell. More reviews at www.soveryterry.com Final Grade: B-</fullReview>

Thank goodness I didn't go to the theater to see it, because I wouldn't have been able to throw things at the screen like I did at my T.V.Anyway, the movie is essentially about a crazy guy who follows the hero around accidentally ruining his professional life and his love life through a series of ridiculous coincidences.As for the actors, Paul Rudd is OK, but all he has to do is act exasperated. Steve Carrell is good too, but all that is required of him is to be annoying. There is nothing clever about any of the movie, but the Dinner scene had a lot of potential if the writer had been even slightly ingenious. There is one funny scene there where one of the schmucks, a black woman, does mental telepathy with the soul of the dead lobster being served for dinner. That was a riot, but that was about the extent of the true comedy.The rest was simply juvenile. Don't go see this if you are even slightly suicidal.

		<shortDescription>Embarrassing bastardized version of a French classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, how low can we go" Since this movie was (improperly) advertised as the "English (USA) version of the award-winning French comedy", let me inform readers about the original.Francis Veber's award-winning comedy classic "Le Diner de Cons" (DdeC) released in 1998 quickly became an international success both artistically as financially. DdeC received numerous honors including six Cesar nominations winning three: best script (Francis Veber), best actor (Jacques Villeret aka Francois Pignon), and best supporting actor (Daniel Prevost aka Lucien Cheval, the Revenue Auditor). The "Cesar du cinema Francais" is similar to our (USA) Oscar Academy Awards and annually rewards the best performance in the various cinema-related specialties from acting to production. DdeC has been used as a teaching model for writing intelligent humorous scripts, inventive editing, and acting in some cinema schools. Veber adapted his script from his play of the same title which premiered in 1993 and has been playing ever since in Europe. It is a masterpiece worth discovering. The script was intelligently written, the quick paced dialog flowed harmoniously as the protagonist's situation deteriorated. The interpretation was sensitive, expressive and flawless.Back to Dinner for Schmucks: As an American, I found the Hollywood version insulting and demeaning. Trying to bank on the success of the original as is often the case with remakes, you take whatever worked in the first presentation, recycle it, repeat it over, amplify it, mass produce it, etc? In Dinner for Schmucks, you steal an original premise, bastardize a bullet-proof script, exaggerate the humorous moments to absurdity, add profanity and obscenity to the dialogue ("he was searching for her lost clitoris under the table"), mix in some sex scenes, sanitize to ensure (American) political correctness, include most ethnic groups to maximize distribution (i.e. profit margin), the only thing missing may have been to add some farts and burps? You get the picture. Are we so stupid and ignorant that Hollywood still makes profits feeding us such cheap products? I was insulted having to critique this movie to college students especially since this cinema class had reviewed the French version a few years past. One positive observation: Steve Carell and Paul Rudd did an OK performance as the protagonists unfortunately Carell's role was annoying and exaggerated to plain stupidity as opposed to the social ineptitude of the original performer (Villeret). Jemaine Clement did a believable performance as the artist. As for the real schmuck of this film, it is the director Jay Roach who seems to excel in this type of comedy.Overall, this movie is a lifeless comedy and a very sad but true representation of what many American film productions have degenerated into: cheap financial profit sources without body or soul. Do not waste your money on this lousy production misrepresented as the "American version of the award-winning French classic comedy". If that is the case then America is in trouble.Rating: 2 out of 10 for the acting especially Clement's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To solidify a promotion, a young executive needs to bring an idiot to a dinner for the amusement of upper management. I vowed that this would be the very last Steve Carell movie I would watch if there was nothing funny in here. Carell is never funny except for that one time in BRUCE ALMIGHTY when Bruce, as GOD, made him talk gibberish. I did also say that, perhaps, the only funny thing in here would be the title.And, after about a half hour into the movie when Carell showed up and acted the way he did in his character (as the idiot), I knew I could not watch the rest of the way. He was bad, not funny, but also the dialogue for everyone else was bad too.I wanted to make it to that dinner, but knew in my heart of hearts I would go crazy watching really stupid stuff so I shut it down and regained my sanity. Also, I kind of figured that if I did see that dinner, I would see very nasty, not funny, and hurtful things. I don't need to see things like that. That is not comedy. If I am wrong about all this, so be it. But, I was right about one thing. The only funny thing in this movie, from what little I saw, was the title. Violence: Have no idea. Sex: Have no idea. Nudity: Have no idea. Language: Have no idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks is actually a pleasant surprise and quite funny. Based off the trailers I have seen, this movie looked like tripe. Apparently many people did think this movie was tripe, but not me. I thought it was good idea for Paul Rudd and Steve Carell to team up because they are a funny pair and their chemistry proves it. This movie has some funny jokes but it has a heart and you feel for the main characters.Jay Roach's film is about a rising executive who realizes that the only way to get a promotion at his job is to find the biggest buffoon out there and invite him to his boss's dinner so he could win the promotion.This film has a talented cast led by the excellent Paul Rudd and Steve Carell. It's nice of them to use their talents to face off against each other. The supporting cast is great with such likes as Bruce Greenwood, Lucy Punch, Jeff Dunham, and of course the scene-stealing Zach Galifinakis.Overall, this is a pretty funny movie that has some solid jokes. This is way better than I have expected and the last half hour of the film is definitely the best. This is worth seeing just for Rudd and Carell. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you know there's a good chance it's going to be funny. Also Paul Rudd was good too. Rudd plays Tim, a businessman up for a promotion. His boss invites him to a dinner party in which guests bring someone with a special talent that makes them look stupid. The idea is to make fun of them. Reluctantly, Tim agrees to do it even with his disapproving girlfriend, Julie. He literally runs into Barry, played by Carell and Tim soon realizes Barry would be just the one to invite to this dinner. His talent is stuffing dead mice and creating scenes with them.Problem is Barry shows up the day before the dinner party and Tim just can't get rid of him. Barry creates all these hilarious problems with Julie and inviting over Tim's stalker, Darla. The funniest scene is when Tim meets the swiss couple at the restaurant and Barry shows up to solve the problem of a missing Julie by bringing Darla. That had me LOL. Next funniest part was the mind control by Zack G. over Barry and his wife and the pudding. There's too many funny things to list them all.FINAL VERDICT: By far this was the funniest comedy I've seen in quite a long time. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a previous reviewer, I blame myself. There were plenty of warnings from other users that this movie was b.a.d. My wife insisted so I tagged along. While I'm not a huge fan of Steve Carrell, I have enjoyed him in some of his movies. I also have liked Paul Rudd as well. That being said, this movie is utterly terrible. The entirety of the first 100 minutes of the run time is an agonizing journey that at times is physically painful with how the situations are so predictably unfunny. Steve Carrell's character is so annoying that it really was impossible to feel sorry for him by the end which I think was what the movie was going for.Once you finally make it to the dinner (if you haven't walked out by then) which I mistakenly expected to be a more prominent part of the film based on trailers and that the movie title is, in fact, DINNER for Schmucks, the movie actually is quite entertaining with only a few instances of groan-inducing "humor." Then, 15 minutes later, the movie is blessedly over. I left feeling that I would have been better served had the dinner scene been a skit on SNL and saved me the money and time of the rest of this steaming pile.In case you're skimming reviews: Avoid This Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film shocked me. A new premise of cinema I am not familiar with, and had a very silly, very quirky style of story telling. I have to stick my neck out on this one but I enjoyed it. I like my comedies, from the classics to the obscure, and this feature manages to slot itself in there somewhere. It's not rip roaringly funny but it makes you smile, makes you giggles and still manages to create a personal attachment to the characters. When they feel bad, we feel bad. When they put themselves through awkward, cringe-worthy situations we cringe along with them and we all end up laughing at the other end.Stop trying to take this film seriously, it's not trying to be a serious film. It's about a group of idiots being shown of for being idiots by a bunch of corporate idiots. It's silly, fun and worth seeing.I found the acting was good, little ropey in places but general was to standard, the direction was well thought out, the cinematography was clever and the set design and props (especially the mice) were all manufactured so well and realistically they helped to hold the film together. This is no Godfather II but it'd no Manos: The hands of Fate either, it's a very silly, very goofy, very fun film to watch with friends, family or on your own. Everyone knows a Schmuck and everyone can relate to this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though The 'so called' new - brilliant-wonderful-exciting film of The Dinner Game has come out on DVD and has probably got quite a few votes and fans- I still say, the original will always be a winner- because for one most of the original stuck to the actual play, and didn't try to cheat. The Jacques Villeret character in the new film is not angry enough as the other Jacques Villeret character in the original. The rats weren't taxidermied either in the original film as well. And I also don't think we wanted to see dead rodents- as that didn't happen in the original. Also they used ordinary actors- not flashy ones who think they can out do the best, and the original film. I apologise to those who love the new film- i do love it its just that I wish they wouldn't try and out do the original- because that will be forgotten.The original will always be the at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie last night with my boyfriend as I liked the sound of the plot and it was a comedy. We were not disappointed! Hilarious movie from start to finish, I've never heard an audience laugh like this in my life! When I say laughing I do not mean short, quiet laughs - these were loud, bounding ones, even from the older people in the cinema, because the movie truly was that funny.If you love a good laugh you should most certainly love this movie. Before the movie I looked at these reviews and was concerned as a few people said it was so bad they had to walk out. However, when we came out of the cinema, my boyfriend and I were saying that we couldn't understand how people found it that bad, I'm assuming they were just in a bad mood/too tired to appreciate it or something. If you like the look of the trailer, don't let any bad reviews put you off.I actually made an IMDb account just to write this review, I felt the movie deserved more credit that its received in some of the reviews so far!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad sack of crap- Tedious and DULL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I blame myself. The reviews were largely awful, and many of the user comments here on IMDb also warned people. I didn't heed those signs. This movie was worse than bad. It was worse than a waste of money. This was one of those films wherein one feels angry and betrayed that my TIME was wasted. My high spirits were deflated, and I slunk from the cinema feeling like hammered garbage.For me the problem wasn't grossness. I love grossness, if it's genius and hilarious. Fart jokes and boobie jokes and what-have-you jokes are the true refined conversation of the enlightened man and woman. Make me laugh so beer explodes out my nose and I am with you 100%. The problem with this drivel is that it was that slow, tedious and annoying type of "humour" that grinds on and on with no laughs. It just isn't funny. It's wearisome.Compared to this film, David Spade seems like Ingmar Bergman. Heed my call, O my brothers and sisters! Step thee not into this cinematic trick of the no-talent hucksters. Golly, doing just about anything else would be your time better spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny Steve Carell befriends Paul Rudd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have NEVER written a review for a movie on this site before but after seeing this tonight I felt compelled. I have NEVER walked out of a film, but came so very close tonight. This was HANDS-DOWN one of, if not the WORST movie I have ever seen. I am a HUGE Carell fan, as well as Paul Rudd. I thought '40 Year Old Virgin' and 'I Love You Man' were great so I was expecting a lot in the laughs department. The previews fooled everyone, as the dinner scene is only about the last 20 minutes. The jokes were pathetic and unfunny. I actually felt uncomfortable and found myself cringing and embarrassed for this cast, especially Carell who is such a talent. The way he dumbed himself down for this role is pitiful. I was expecting so much more and was really let down.</fullReview>

I did not hear anybody laugh throughout the whole movie and there were a lot of young adults and teenagers watching the movie but it was scary quiet in there, at the very least I knew I wasn't the only one hating the film. What hurts me the most is the two hours I lost and can never get back! I didn't pay for it and I am very glad about that! It is so disappointing how such great actors fell for such horrible script!

I did not laugh once during the movie. It was so painful to sit through this movie. The humor was so awful, a middle school child could write this movie. I really wish I could get my 7 bucks back, not because I am upset I lost it, because I do not want to give this movie any money. I would rather have the 7 bucks given to a child in the theater to go play video games. Everyone!....please listen to me and save your time and money.

		<shortDescription>Steve Carell's Worst Movie-to-date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me assure you that Date Night was markedly better than Carell's latest big screen endeavor. The humor in this film is derived mainly from misunderstandings that arise from the idiocy of Carell's character, Barry. Paul Rudd's character, Tim, meets Barry and henceforth nothing that he does goes according to plan. The two continue to find themselves tangled in awkward situations that cause problems for Tim. It may sound similar to the premise of the Meet the Parents franchise but they are world's apart. Even if you disregard the terribly shallow characters (Larry Wilmore's character is literally one of the worst I have ever seen) and plot, you are still left with situations that are based solely upon entirely unbelievable characters. Some of Barry's quirks (such as the fact that he creates scenes with taxidermic mice) are plausible and funny, but the go overboard in many occasions and make his character a total dolt. Many of his actions do not mesh with the rest of what we know about his character and he is taken from tremendously socially awkward to complete and utter idiot, which seemingly contradicts itself. Furthermore, the writer appeared to be torn on whether one should feel sorry for Barry and empathize with him or just find him totally laughable. The dynamic between the two does not work well and makes for a feel good ending that leaves you with a confused and dumbfounded feeling. This is one of the worst comedies I have seen in recent memory and certainly the worst work I have seen from Carell. As he transitions away from The Office, hopefully this is not a sign of things to come from Steve Carell's live action movie projects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film goes in the category of movies that should have never been made. And if they are made, your forced to watch them as punishment for stealing a snickers from the local gas station. Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell are amazing actors...with that said this film gave nothing for either of them to work with. Rudd didn't make me or anyone in the theater laugh once. Carrell a comedic genius that he is was so stupid and annoying in this film, I had to wonder how Darwin's Law shouldn't have ended this guys life by age 14 tops. The film's secondary characters of Zach Galifianakis and Jermaine Clement where the only tiny light of hope in this film. My girlfriend and I said on three occasions that we should leave the film and when a couple actually did, gravity almost pulled me in their direction. I forced myself to stay and finish the movie. At the end I couldn't give a damn about any of the characters or there meaningless relationships. This film may be a good reason to carry around a can of mace to hit yourself in the eyes and think to yourself, Hey I could be watching this movie instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm tired. I've had a long week at work, I want to "chill out", get hungry and watch something stupid. So I read the synopsis for Dinner For Schmucks and it sounds promising. Literally nothing interesting happened until Steve Carrell showed up. Some predictable gags and a template setup for the inevitable hilarity that will ensue. Tim wants promotion, his bosses are elitist douche bags, he wants to fit in and be successful, he's willing to do just about anything, even if he has to be cruel. His girlfriend works with an intimate weirdo, he has a stalker from the past, he has to impress ridiculously rich European people to he his evil promotion and he even learns a valuable lesson in the end. Hey, they're not spoilers, that's a stock standard plot. If the plot surprises you, id say you're very sheltered. NOTHING interesting happened while ever Steve Carrell isn't around. Carrell's given his script, told to do what he does best and he shows his true comic worth as creator of unbelievably mentally challenged characters. Every positive credit that can be given to this flick is purely due to the performance of Steve Carrell. If I can't enjoy a supposed comedy flick AT ALL when I'm high, there's something wrong.Steve Carrell saves this one</fullReview>

Filled with little jokes and some smart references, Dinner For Schmucks does pull off a small feat, but it just doesn't feel like it can go the full mile. Some parts of this film are quite cringe worthy, boring and plain unfunny, whilst other parts do manage to make you giggle a bit.If you watch Dinner For Schmucks, one thing you will notice is the incredibly hilarious performance by Zach Galifianakis. His performance is practically what pulls this film home. Though this film wont be on any top 1000 lists, it's still a good one to watch when there is nothing else to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner for Carell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks (2010): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Jemaine Clement, Zach Galifianakis, Lucy Punch: Hilarious comedy not so much about idiots, but about those making such accusations. Paul Rudd wishes to move ahead in his job but first he must attend an annual dinner where he must bring an idiot for the amusement of the guests. He encounters Steve Carell who dresses up dead mice for scenery pieces. One of director Jay Roach's best and funniest. He previously introduced the world to the antics of Austin Powers. Carell is a hoot as the unpredictable nerd who lives to laugh but often causes havoc. Part of this is in no due part to his e-mail response on Rudd's computer to an intimidating ex-girlfriend. What Carell teaches us here is done in form by accepting who he is and whom others believe he is and running with it because in the end, he is the one who laughs loudest. Rudd is very good and a terrific foil to Carell's antics but his concluding decision is obvious. Among unique supporting players is Jemaine Clement, an exhibitionist laying claim to Rudd's girlfriend, and Zach Galifianakis as a corrupt hypnotist who will meet his match in a very strange way at the dinner. Lucy Punch is funny in a brief but pivotal scene as Rudd's stalking ex-girlfriend whom Carell makes contact with, resulting in brawl. This dinner is complete with a variety of strange looking characters that are suppose to be the brunt of a joke but we are left admiring their creative get-ups and egos. Very creative and unique comedy about judging others, and other such appetizers. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Stephanie Szostak, Jemaine Clement and Bruce Greenwood star in this 2010 comedy. Rudd (Anchorman) plays Tim, an executive who pitches an idea to his boss, Fender (Greenwood). Fender decides to invite Tim to a dinner where his employees bring idiots as their guests. Carell (The 40 Year Old Virgin) plays Barry, a mild-mannered, not so bright guy Tim meets and decides to bring to the dinner. Barry complicates things for Tim at first, but Tim befriends him in the process. Barry also helps Tim work things out with his girlfriend, Julie (Szostak). Clement plays artist, Kieren who works with and has a thing for Julie. This isn't bad and Carell &amp; Rudd are great together. I recommend this.</fullReview>

Paul Rudd and Steve Carell have great chemistry as a really odd couple. I wish they figure out a better way to get these two together. Carell is having a hilarious time especially with crazy Darla (Lucy Punch). Zach Galifianakis is doing another wacky character but isn't quite as successful. He and Carell do this weird thing.

		<shortDescription>Has Plenty of Laughs, But Lags and Disappoints as Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks is a trendy comedy that draws from the formula that 40 year old virgin perfected. It features two stars from that film, and has enough charm and laughs to please. It is longer than it should be, and doesn't walk the line of stupid/silly all that well. Though there are a couple of big names in this movie, Jemaine Clement easily was responsible for half the laughs in this movie. He stole every scene he was in. Steve Carell was funny, but also pushed the silly envelope too hard too often. Paul Rudd was more of the straight line character and had enough charm to carry the main story.This movie was easily 20-30 minutes too long. The "cameo" by Zack Galafianakis missed in my opinion. The parts he was in seemed a little to dumb for my taste. I would recommend every comedy fan watch this movie. It also has enough story and charm to carry most casual viewers. Unfortunately, it takes too long and also gets a bit too silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay comedy that probably didn't live up to its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this film. I spent much of the film unable to decide whether it was a good or bad film. In the end, I came down on the good side, but not in any resounding way. And oddly enough, through the climax of the film I was somehow reminded of Beetlejuice, although I don't know why...something about the particular sense of humor used through the films.Steve Carrel does have some good moments when he makes his character very sympathetic. He really is a rather versatile comedic actor. Paul Rudd plays his role about how it should be played. Nothing spectacular, but on target. The rest of the cast does their job.The script seems sort of schizophrenic. At first I thought it was going to be a rather sensitive comedy, but then it changed direction and became a bit zany...with moments of sensitivity.It's worth a watch, but perhaps not one for the DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only the beginning and ending of the film redeem the one-hour mess that goes in-between ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I heard that "The Dinner Game", one of the greatest French comedies ever written, was going to be remade in America, my initial reaction was "Not again!" or "Haven't they learned the lesson?" Of all the Francis Veber's movies that got the remake-treatment, none inspired a remake worthy of comparison, and the remakes immediately sunk into oblivion. Who remembers now "The Man with One Red Shoe", "Pure Luck" or "Father's Day"? Not Jay Roach apparently, who directed "Dinner for Schmucks" with Steve Carrell playing the role of the late Jacques Villeret and Paul Rudd as the obligatory straight man.The casting was promising though, and the film deserved at least to be given the benefit of the doubt. However, my first glance at the movie poster confirmed my initial fears: Carrell looked too dumb, and I knew the Americans would get the meaning of 'cons' (the titular insult in the original comedy) totally wrong. Villeret played a 'con' as a lovable buffoon who, despite all his efforts to help and make up for his mistakes, was generating one disaster after another. He was still a 'normal' man, one you got to talk to a few minutes before realizing how idiotic he is. "Dinner for Schmucks" goes straight to the point, an idiot has to look idiot, in case people wouldn't notice a man collecting dead mouses to recreate famous paintings or historical scenes would be mentally challenged.The problem is that the initial premise of the film was deliberately cruel (a group of rich snobs inviting a fool to vote for the most idiotic one) but it made the series of incidents punctuating the narrative even more rewarding, we wanted the rich villain to get his comeuppance, as no decent person would laugh at people mocking other people. In "Dinner for Schmucks", Carrel looks crazy, stupid, in fact, he doesn't need to do anything to make you laugh, he's already a comical character. I thought there would be a thin line between French and American sophistication, it was not even a gap, it was a ravine. Therefore, we laugh at Carrell too, we laugh at his stupidity and craziness, and it's Paul Rudd we feel sorry for. The roles are reversed and it's almost painful to see Rudd going through this nightmare since he didn't even want to be involved in the dinner (contrarily to his French alter-ego who was a cocky bastard).The problem with "The Dinner Game" is to over-exploit the idiocy of the main character at a point you wonder whether he is a moron or a retarded person, and to make things worse, the characters who were supposed to behave normally in the French version, are all parodied to the worst, the mistress is a slutty and pervert nymphomaniac, the IRS colleague another idiot in a more psychic level, and don't get me started on all the other 'idiots' invited for the dinner. I wanted to feel sorry for them, but the film insists so much on their 'peculiarity' that the only feeling that clearly came to me was pity. However, it would be a lie to say that none of these character made me laugh, but while the French version's gags mostly relied on comedy-of-errors, verbal humor and confusion, "Dinner for Schmucks" contained too much slapstick and gross gags to make you focus on the more subtle parts, and to the heart of the story, which was the friendship and understanding growing between Rudd and Carrell. Yes, because despite my criticism, the film had its moments and some of them touched me."Dinner for Schmucks" had a great potential, something that could have elevated it to the same level of poignancy and tenderness than "40-Year Old Virgin", even more because Carrel's character had a sweet side, expressed through his passion. Paul Rudd played his part perfectly, even better than Lhermitte, and interestingly, the film developed the dinner's concept more than the original. The first part in the company is cleverly written and made me expect a much more mature humor, the relationship with his fiancé provided the perfect dosage of romance. But the "Dinner" was too great a concept not to be filled by visual gags, the French version focused on the interactions between the two leads, the second one knew it had to be a warmer tone, less cynical, but while the intentions were good, the means are debatable.As a result, the film both starts and ends in a very positive way, and the mess that goes in-between is only redeemed by the whole tenderness still inhabiting the story. I confess that some gags really made me laugh, a psychological struggle with the telephone and the reaction of Carrel made me burst out laughter, but one or two gags perfectly delivered is still better than a series of gags begging for laughs. From the Gothic animal-lover artist, to the women who talked to dead animals, the movie plunged us in an ocean of absurdity and surrealism that killed off all the charm.I ended the French film's review by this sentence "just because someone looks and sounds like a fool doesn't mean he's not one", and this was referring to the ending of the film which was a strike of genius in terms of comical writing and a perfect conclusion. In "Dinner for Schmucks" , we already know that, there isn't much left to surprise you at the end ? to take you totally off-guard, as if the script wasted so much energy in its avalanche of gags, that it was already out of breath at the end, and could only distribute the obligatory conclusions we all expected. A pity because the film had a great potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This never should have worked. The premise is evil and why would you root for someone who does something like that? Maybe because Paul Rudd is playing that person that goes wrong and he's so lovable you can't be mad at him. Not to mention that he is put through a lot during the running time of the movie.Actually so much, that you might wonder, why he doesn't stop some things from happening or just reacts another way. But again, it's a slippery slope and it could go any way. The movie does stay on the right side of evil fun most of the time. So it does succeed, which doesn't mean you will automatically like it, of course. Steve Carell is the other guy who makes this happen. If you didn't know Steve from any previous movies, you might think he is that guy he's playing. He's that good at portraying him</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's summary is about a man who runs into an idiot and earlier in that day his boss said they needed to bring an idiot to a dinner with all their co workers and their idiot they choose. After the dinner his boss crowns the biggest idiot there and make fun of him. The man is in a dilemma between listening to his girlfriend or bring the idiot to dinner. When the man talks to the idiot, the idiot thinks that they are best friends and that he actually likes him but little does he know he is just being set up. Later in the movie he ends up bringing the idiot to dinner and trying to be discrete about it so his girlfriend doesn't find out. He ends up realizing though that his idiot is actually very talented and so are all the other people they brought. When his boss goes to crown his idiot he feels very bad and is upset that he might ruin their friendship.This movie had a good plot but it was one too much like the others and was predictable as what was going to happen. It wasn't so much boring though because the dinner was funny and just to watch who all his co workers brought as their idiots and the night was filled with suspense and excitement. This movie does show a VERY strong message though and that is it's not nice to make fun of people especially if you don't know them because you may actually like them if you take your time and talk to them. The lesson shown is that all their idiots seem to be more talented them all of the workers and the workers look more like idiots than them.</fullReview>

Steve was hilarious in his character, because he was very real and animated, but actually had a few moments where he became hurt by harsh words and withdrew into himself, or angry at Paul after hearing him say negative things about him behind his back. But these moments were then trip wired to have him snap back into his grinning wacky character to keep the entire movie on a light note.I have to say, I was laughing very hard during the chase scene between him and Paul Rudd's maniac stalker girlfriend. His performance was not forced or overly funny to where it seems like a theatrical, and he played well off of Paul Rudd, who himself had a few golden moments, such as singing high pitched opera without knowing his employer was behind him, or acting like an earwig. Definitely worth watching. Grab a few friends and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do I keep reading so many reviews where critics are comparing Rudd and Carell to Villeret and Lhermitte? This is a film version of the French comedy FILM, and who better to perform the roles than the actors who vaguely associated with the SNL squad? These are two different animals here. Besides, a vital component of playing a CHARACTER is bringing your own interpretation and personality to the role. They are not playing Villeret/Lhermitte, they are playing Barry/Tim. Villeret won a Tony for the role and Lhermitte was nominated. There didn't seem to be such a mass "comparison" going on in 2001, why should there be one now? And don't get me wrong, I love Villeret and Lhermitte - but I also know that comparing is not what we should be critiquing. What we SHOULD be critiquing is the actual film-making - the missed opportunity to really utilize what we've learned in technique over the past 50 years: farts are funny! Jay Roach is no filmmaker - it was a mistake to have him direct. Remakes are one of the most challenging works to transfer to film, but once in while someone figures it out! (ie Barb Wire, Herbie Goes Bananas, Poseidon Adventure, etc.) Why didn't they use that know-how here! In the past decade we've seen the movie comedy struggling to make a comeback, and it has succeeded to win over a new generation of comedy theatre fans. I just hope the antiquated and amateurish film-making doesn't turn them away. By the way, The Dinner Game (Le dîner de cons) is my favorite show of all time and of course I loved it regardless of the problems :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I haven't watched the original, so I can't compare to it. As you can see a lot of people that didn't like that movie watched the original and I guess a little of "original is better" makes reviews a little bit biased.Steve Carel's role is his usual - goodhearted idiot - "The Office", "Get Smart", "40-year...". And he is good at it, no complaining :)It looks like writers didn't put much work into the script. 1. It's predictable as hell - from the moment boss told about the dinner - outcome was apparent (by that time we already knew about the guy with mice) -&gt; they would become friends and main character would end up defending the poor guy. 2. It's very uneven. Scenes with mice are cute, some jokes are funny, but then come scenes like the final one where Tim tells Barry about how much he loves Julie. It was painful to watch.But overall it's a decent date comedy - not a lot of laughs, but very cute and leaves you in a good humor(especially last ~3 minutes of stories what happened after).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong I do like comedy, when it is funny and well-performed it is great. Dinner for Schmucks is not for me the worst comedy ever made or the worst movie ever made, but in my honest opinion it is among the worst of 2010 along with Fred:The Movie, The Other Guys, The Last Airbender and Vampires Suck.Seeing at how good the cast is on paper, Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd are very good with fun material, I really wanted to like Dinner for Schmucks. But there are several reasons why I couldn't even enjoy it. The film does have some decent settings and location work, but I do think the editing could have been a lot tighter, some of it seemed rather rushed.The soundtrack was lacking for me as well. I love a good soundtrack in movies, but the background scoring felt generic for me and the song choices didn't completely fit the film's mood. The direction is poor as well, when it comes to the cinematography it has some odd angles and overall direction wise it felt like too much time was spent on making the leads funny, without succeeding, rather than focusing on a decent story and script.What really brought Dinner for Schmucks down was the story and script. The story is incredibly predictable, with a number of unrealistic and poorly thought out ideas. Also it is poorly paced, I found the first act rather rushed and then as the jokes got stupider the film ground to a halt. The writing is even worse, Dinner for Schmucks has in my view a terrible script that verges more on offensive than funny while the jokes are stupid and some were delivered so fast they went over my head. I didn't like the film's tone either, it went overboard with the craziness and chaos.The acting fares little better. Carrell is talented, and when his material is good he is good too. However his material is pretty much pathetic, so in a valiant attempt to elevate the material Carrell overdoes it and it doesn't help that his character is incredibly annoying. Rudd is the opposite for me, he can be good too, but here he seems bored and underplays his part badly. It is sad as well that the chemistry between the two isn't there either.Overall, a dog's dinner of a comedy. The only redeeming quality really was the mouse art work which was quite enjoyable. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I was kinda unsure whether or not to rent this movie because of a lot of the negative reviews. But I did and I was happy about it. Well it starts of with a stockbroker type of guy(Paul Rudd) who works in a big office who want's to be one of the big guys. He then runs over a guy (Steve Carell). And apparently wanted to pay Rudd's character for running over him. I really found some of the scenes in this movie funny. I usually don't like comedy movies nowadays because they're just not funny!! Steve Carrell steals the whole movie with his mouse diorama or whatever you wanna call it. The whole thing with Darla( Lucy Punch) was really funny too! Well Skip to the end in the dinner scene, really made laugh, because of all the other weirdo's especially Octavia Spencer's character who can communicate with the dead( animals). The ending was somewhat touching and sweet. This movie has its stupid moments but good to watch when your down in the dumps. But don't expect it to be like LAUGHING SO HARD THAT YOu CANT BREATHE AND YOU JUST SH*T YOUR PANTS but its a fun, entertaining, comedy that will leave you warm inside and all that cheesy bull sh*t. So there you have it. I give this movie a 7/10 :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for SchmucksThe best thing about inviting schmucks to dinner is that you can serve them breakfast and they'll never grasp the irony.However, the dolt in this rambunctious comedy may not even possess the smarts to make it to the meal. After landing a Swiss mogul (David Walliams), the tenacious Tim (Paul Rudd) is finally recognized by the higher ups at his firm. Unfortunately that involves participating in their twisted games.When his boss (Bruce Greenwood) orders him to invite a putz to a dinner where all of the executives can mock them, Tim abides.But, by inviting an eccentric part-time taxidermist (Steve Carell) to the feast, Tim may have bitten off more than he can chew.Despite its illustrious cast, this English remake of The Dinner Game fails to dish-out even one comedic morsel.Furthermore, inviting idiots to a resplendent repast is a necessity ? who's going to wash the dishes?

		<fullReview>From director Jay Roach (Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Meet the Parents), apart from Three Men and a Baby and The Departed, I can't think of many remakes of foreign films that have been made better than the original, and this was another one that wasn't. Basically mid-level financial executive Tim Conrad (Paul Rudd) is successful in his job, and he is pretty sure he has a promotion in the bag, especially with his boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) inviting to the "dinner for winners". He finds out that this dinner has a catch, it is more a "dinner for idiots" because he is supposed to bring the most stupid person he can find for the after dinner entertainment, i.e. mocking. The next day he bumps into IRS employee Barry Speck (Steve Carell), with his weird personality, a strange hobby for taxidermy, particularly taking dead mice and turning them into art pieces, or "miceterpieces", Tim decides he is the perfect idiot. Soon enough he starts regretting his decision to invite Barry to dinner as he is stalking him, and staying near him causing chaos in his personal life, including mistaking one-night stand from years ago Darla (Lucy Punch) for fiancée Julie (Stephanie Szostak). Tim has the chance to make a good business associate in his boss's colleague, wealthy Swiss businessman Martin Mueller (Little Britain's David Walliams) at lunch, but of course with the Darla-Julie mix-up, this is ruined. After an encounter with Barry's rival, his boss Therman (The Hangover's Zach Galifianakis) with his "mind control" powers and who stole his wife, and a bit more chaos, Tim does come clean to his "friend" about the whole reason for the dinner. After Barry wins the idiot competition, a big disaster occurs, causing Tim's boss to fire him, and Julie loses her job too, but everything turns out well in the end. Also starring Jemaine Clement as Kieran Vollard, Jeff Dunham as Lewis the Ventriloquist, Ron Livingston as Caldwell and The IT Crowd's Chris O'Dowd as Marco the Blind Swordsman. Rudd seems like he isn't having much fun, just like Sandra Bullock in All About Steve, Carell with his glasses and brushed hair is too freaky and psychopathic to be taken light-heartedly or laugh at, I admit I did like the mouse artwork, but apart from that, this is an appalling and unfunny dog's dinner of a comedy film. Poor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for schmucks is not the clever but nasty French version, it is an American comedy with reasonable comedy value without the really mean character of the original film. I watched this film expecting to hate it. The two main actors in my view are middle of the road to less than funny in every film I have seen them in. In this film Steve Carell is the funniest I have ever seen him. He manages to pull of the comedy that the French film does not. The dialog is clever and the support cast are effective, all playing their part. I laughed a lot, was touched by certain scenes and overall it was a good watch. If you are a film lover who dislikes nastiness in films, and dislikes coming away with that unhappy feeling in your gut, then its possible you will actually like this version of the original.

		<fullReview>The film sets up a romance gone wrong plot with Rudd's character trying to get his girlfriend back, while Carell's character trys to help but constantly makes things worse, this runs along side the other main plot about Rudd trying to get a promotion at work.Steve Carell(whom I think is great in The Office), plays someone so dumb that its not funny, even the childish slap stick is more miss then hit. Paul Rudd plays the straight part to Steve Carell's 'funny' man, but the two don't have any dynamism together and just don't 'click', this means that Paul Rudds character comes across as very dull and boring. Most of the gags don't work and I'll never watch this film again and suggest you don't waste your time or money with it. I laughed once, briefly, mid way through this mess of a film. It seemed to last forever and I was overjoyed once it had finished so I could go and do something more fun like self harm.</fullReview>

I have to admit, I was really unsure about it after reading the reviews on here, but I think people just didn't get it. It isn't designed to be literary genius. It's simply designed to be FUNNY. And funny it is. Steve Carell is hilarious as a dimwitted simpleton, and Paul Rudd plays his character well. It does, admittedly, start a bit slow, but as the scenes unfold it just gets funnier and funnier. The dinner scene had me and my entire family rolling on the couches in laughter. How anybody thought this wasn't funny at all is beyond me. Overall - a very funny movie. If you have any sense of humour, you should enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being fluent in both English &amp; French, I saw the the original movie in Quebec when it came out in the late nineties. But, for my money, I gotta say I almost preferred Steve Carell's version, almost... French actor Jacques Villeret was brilliant in ''Le diner de cons''(The Dinner Game), so is Carell. I also strongly appreciated the way the story was reinvented. Both movies rank in my all-time favorite comedies. I get that a lot of people were disappointed. Maybe what made the difference for me was the lukewarm reception the movie got upon it's release; I went in expecting nothing and got fairly surprised in return.

		<shortDescription>Attention to both Carell and Rudd, please do not work with Jay Roach anymore!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow My first disappointment starring both Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. I was saying during my last review of Date Night, also the last movie i saw Carell in that I have yet to see him anything sucky, well the old saying goes...never say never! This should have been hilarious and was short on laughs. A majority of laughs were anytime Zack Galifianakis was on screen. Carell plays an complete imbecile character that at times in stead of laughing i actually was tempted to punch the screen! A word to director Jay Roach if you are going to have the so called idiot in your film be so annoying that half the audience would rather leave then see do well in the film its time to rethink things before sending out the end product. Carell and Rudd are two of my most favourite of the comedic actors out there these days so i am going to blame both the screen writers and the director on this one. Tim (Paul Rudd) is a budding executive who happens to be at the right place at the right time during one of his company meetings that has the ever so hard to please boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) actually liking his pitch so much that he asks him to attend a dinner where they are to find the most eccentric and crazy person (ok a loser if you will) that they can as to which himself along with the major bigwigs of the firm can laugh at them only they have to be so much of a loser that they do not really catch on that they are being roasted not toasted. Now this storyline we have seen a thousand times before that puts a major idiot in the way of a successful individual's career path only to have him totally mess things up for the individual and in the end the person sees the error in his behaviour and they end up being best of buds right? Well like i said any movie that makes you want to strangle the lovable idiot instead of saying awwwww, is pushing the wrong point. Watch it you will see what i mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once a month a group of well off business execs have a dinner party where they each bring an idiot guest to make fun of (without them knowing it).Amazing to see that they (Hollywood) managed to mess up a concept that could have been so much. The budget and production seemed well enough, but then they just couldn't follow through. Unfortunately, you cannot give anything less than one star on the IMDb rating system. (I have to justify that star by giving it for the production.)Mostly, the failure of this movie is caused by the character played by Steve Carell. I'm not saying it is Carell's fault - but rather the way his character was written, and all the mindlessly annoying things he is made to do. (It could, of course, be Carell too.) These annoying things are things that nobody else would do, because they clearly cross every social boundaries, and more. This type of humor is unintelligent, infantile, has no other purpose than to annoy and possibly embarrass. The Naked Gun-series managed to pull off this type of humor, thanks to very clever copy writers, but this movie? Nah.Instead, watch the movie that "inspired" this one, called The Dinner Game (Le Diner De Cons) (7.7): http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119038/ It has the finesse, subtlety and humor that characterize good French movies.I laughed out loud many times during The Dinner Game. Not once during Dinner For Scmucks. Actually, I found myself wanting to turn this movie off so many times, but I kept watching, to see if by some miracle it turned to the better. It didn't.</fullReview>

A good Director can make lemonade out of lemons. This Director, Jay Roach, has a history of making movies that could have been good if someone else Directed it. Look at Roach's resume and you will see movie after movie that could have been Great! They could have.You don't get into the "dinner" until 1:26 into this 2 hour flop. A dinner which is Howard Sternish, where you make fun of people who are different. Where you make fun of them in the last 14 minutes of a movie titled, "Dinner for Schmucks." Another Director could pull this off, I'm sure of this. But Jay Roach presents another mediocre mess. Which in my opinion makes him the Schmuck.</fullReview>

This movie after all is a message to us, to inside the good inside each one of us, to respect those good people who look like idiots, we have to take about them and stop making fun and jokes out of them, because God gave them limited skills and minds doesn't mean to make fun out of them, we have to respect them and know how they are extremely good people.I rated this movie 8 out of 10 not because it is bad, but because I believe that they should have done better filming and more scenes that can make more fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite its misleading, preposterous title, this is one of the most intellectually challenging movies of the decade. Hidden beneath a fine layer of sparkling jokes (a vast majority of the audience won't notice anything else), the subtle, Matryoshka-like construction unfolds a very unusual and surprising plot. Film director Jay Roach, best known for directing the "not-that-deep" Austin Powers films, now pursues a completely different track, which he had already foreshadowed in "Recount" (2008), and joins the league of gods among Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen. Roach combines Jungian archetypes (not to reveal to much of the plot, just notice that Tim corresponds to the Anima) with satire and a scathing criticism on society and the American way of life. It is not for no reason that Noam Chomsky declares "Dinner for Schmucks" to be "the best romantic comedy since City Lights".</fullReview>

Choice of casting was great from the familiar yet ancient "Friend's" leading man to the Little Britian co-star.A Brilliant build up to a warm fuzzy finish, it has the animated craziness of a Disney film mixed with real life yet so off the wall characters that you have to love them, it's hard not to. Some funny quotes and 1 liners to be stored in the memory bank, along with an easy going soundtrack is too good to be true.The only reason i gave this picture a 9 was because i was hoping for just a little more R rated content, but regardless of having no explicit Tits &amp; Ass this is definitely worth watching, i highly recommend it.

		<fullReview>An Americanised remake of the French comedy Le Diner De Cons (1998), Dinner For Schmucks puts together an admirable cast of comics, including Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, Jemaine Clement (of Flight Of The Concords fame) and Zach Galifianakis. I understand that his star is growing rapidly, but his name is just too hard to type, so for the rest of this article he will be 'Fat Jesus.' Nonetheless, this film delivers laughs and emotion in satisfying doses, and something I would definitely recommend.Paul Rudd plays Tim, who works a nothing job in Generic Financial Firm #17, until his superiors offer him the chance at a promotion. The catch? He must impress at a dinner hosted by his boss, at which all employees must bring along the most idiotic guest they can find in the hope of taking out first prize. Enter Steve Carell's Barry, IRS employee and amateur taxidermist, whose unique 'skill' with turning dead mice into works of art makes him the perfect candidate. Also circling the plot is Tim's diminishing relationship with girlfriend Julie, who no longer has feelings for the corporate drone Tim has become.The acting is competent overall, but two performances stand out and really give this film a kick. Clement seems to take great pride in his character: a pretentious artist whose hobbies include tantric sex and living amongst goats. In fact, his character is reminiscent of Russell Brand as Aldous Snow (Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him To The Greek), but Clement comes right out of left field with excellent line delivery and tone, coupled with some fantastic physical comedy.Paul Rudd may receive top billing, but make no mistake?Steve Carell drives this film. Just about every line that comes out of Barry's mouth is gold, and a testament to the effort put into the screenplay. But it is the dimension, as opposed to just the humour, of Barry's character that makes him so engaging. He invokes real sympathy in a couple of emotional scenes that prove him to be much more than just a 'schmuck.' And his absurdist chemistry with Fat Jesus during the climactic scene is nothing short of hilarious.As soppy as it sounds, the film drives home a nice moral about how all people, regardless of hobby or intellect, all crave the same feelings of friendship and compassion in their lives. One scene in which Barry effectively questions all that he has achieved in his life is particularly heart wrenching and although it sets the foundation for an admittedly cliché ending, it is pleasing to see a film that markets itself as a first-string comedy still putting emphasis on genuine affection and character.When using a number system to rate films for as long as I have, one begins to develop a conscious idea about what number represents certain films. In my book, anything ranked at eight or above typically constitutes either a classic, or a film I think will be looked upon as a classic in the next twenty years. Dinner For Schmucks dosen't rank quite so high, but it puts up a great fight.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

Also, blatantly talking about sex, having sex, and having sex with multiple people at the same time is not exactly the content a 13 year old should be watching either! There were many MANY other references to sex or sexual behavior as well. Also, the language was terrible. The F-bomb was even dropped...in a PG13 movie!! Seriously, who rated this and what guideline did they use if any? Don't waste your time or money on this. Even if you aren't moral...it was just plain boring and dumb. I was very disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately Very Underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me cut the chase, I do know which movie I'm reviewing, I do give Dinner for Schmucks a 10 out of 10 and I do consider it my 6th favorite movie, let me tell you why. Dinner for Schmucks it's not only a clever, well-acted and hilarious comedy, it's comedy with lots of heart and although it's a bit stupid it's definitely my 6th favorite movie. Jay Roach (The Fockers) did a terrific job with everything. Steve Carell, well, I'll have to write about him on a single paragraph, cause he was just... Paul Rudd was great, he played mature and funny. Zach Galifianakis, well, I'll join him to Steve's paragraph. Sow, Dinner for Schmucks is a terrific movie, it's not for everybody but it is for me, it's a light-hearted hilarious and stupid comedy that I just have re-watched thousands of times and I can't seem to get tired of. The soundtrack by Theodore Shapiro was excellent and gave this movie a certain atmosphere that I just loved 100%, the song "Fool on the Hill" (The Beatles) right at the beginning is genius and along the movie goes on you find many appealing themes and then at the credits you here an amazing song from Theodore, overall, I loved the soundtrack. STORY: Tim (Paul Rudd) has a great job and a great girlfriend and they're both in a great place at life. Tim is about to get a new office and an awesome promotion, but first, he'll have to appear at his boss' dinner that he hosts once a month, that dinner consists on every worker bringing an idiot person and the most idiot person of the dinner will win. Tim was definitely not going, but later, he has second thoughts when he accidentally runs over Barry (Steve Carell), a harmless guy who's work is at IRS and who's hobby is to make sets and pictures with dead mice. MY OPINION: The plot was amazing, it was full of hilarious stuff and fun stuff, I loved it. Steve Carell was purely fantastic, his glasses, his teeth and his blonde hair, he was just fantastic and he stole me a bit of oxygen if you know what I mean, Steve was extremely hilarious and no one could play his role better than he did, he was funny and idiot but he played a sweet guy that we all wish to meet, he was unforgettable. Zach Galifianakis was truly genius, his orange ... (I think it's worth being seen without knowing) and his hilarious laugh makes his performance be unique and highly unforgettable. The chemistry between Steve and Zach was fantastic and the scene where they both imaginary fight is a movie classic.Overall, Dinner for Schmucks is my 6th favorite movie without any doubts, it's funny, heart warming, very well-acted, hilarious, entertaining, fun, very well directed, very well written and still, I don't know how is it so much underrated- Highly recommended. Unforgettable comedy. 6th Best Movie of All Time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK... Get this...I am on a plane from the USA to Japan. It takes over nine hours of travel.In these nine hours there is nothing to do except sleep, read, and watch movies. I have already read my book, I am not sleepy, and all I can do is watch a movie.One of the movies to watch was 'Dinner for Schmucks.' I am not really a fan of the people in the movie, but everyone else seems to like them so I decided to give it a go.I made it through about a quarter of the movie before I turned it off. I would rather stare at a luggage compartment than watch this god awful thing. I can't even begin to explain how bad it is. Not one single laugh through the first quarter of the movie.Think about it.... Nothing to do on a plane for nine hours and not even this movie could keep me occupied. It was that bad!!!It gets one star just because it is a movie and not a sharp stick poking me in the eye.DO NOT WATCH!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful uplifting comedy. It revels in satirical absurdity, but also stirs deeper emotions. Whilst the production is slick it retains artistic integrity and depth. I am happy to recommend it as it made me laugh and put me in a good mood. A true gem in a cynical world. I especially liked the contrast of the successful artist who is narcissistic and shallow with the naive hobbyist artist that makes beautiful touching mouse dioramas. The mouse dioramas are beautiful.The storyline kept me guessing, perhaps helped by the fact that I have not seen the earlier french film it is based on. It makes no apology for being a feel good movie and perhaps there are flaws but it is very funny and has an endearing empathic quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim is a guy who wants a promotion. So he invites an idiot to dinner, and thus his life begins to unravel until the cheesy ending. Basically sums up this movie. Oh wait it doesn't!!! This movie was sooo stupid I couldn't help but to laugh at some of the pathetic jokes and such in it. I think Steve Carrel played his part well, sort of like he plays Michael Scott in the office but the rest of the movie was terrible. The only "good" part was the lobster talking lady, and brain control, but it would've been better if will arnett played barry's boss. All in all it was a terrible movie which should have never been made, or at least have been a will ferrell film.I think that the director and writers of the film should go to the dinner as the idiots for thinking that this was a good idea. What stupid people</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Hangover!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer to the film, I couldn't believe it. It looked like the next Hangover, but it's not, it's better.plot: to get a promotion Tim (Paul Rudd) must participate in the dinner where you bring an "idiot" to make fun of. Tim runs into Barry (Steve Carell) and he knows at once that he will get him the promotion; but Tim starts to grow on Barry.The acting was just amazing by Steve Carell. He plays the perfect guy that creates mouser-pieces! He also played the guy who doesn't use his mind as much, and takes things literally perfectly! Paul Rudd was just as good as Steve. He played Tim so well. Tim was a caring guy who wants the promotion really bad, but he's not to sure about the dinner party. Zach Galifianakus plays the "mind reader" perfectly! He is the best actor for any weird roles.The reason why it's better than the Hangover is because this movie has just as much humor, but with heart. By heart I mean a lesson, and a story that has emotion. The jokes were none stop and were much funnier than the jokes in the Hangover. I would give some examples but I don't want to ruin the fun!Most of the jokes are mature, so some of the younger audiences might not understand it. The rest of the jokes they should understand! Just because I thought it was better than the Hangover doesn't mean you'll feel the same; but I guarantee that if you didn't think in was better than you'll think it was just as funny! Definitely a movie you don't want to miss! Dinner for Schmucks also proves that a movie doesn't have to have an R rating to be hilarious! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Le Dîner De Cons: intelligent, raucous and thought provoking - words you don't tend to associate with the majority of Hollywood's output. But they do insist on highlighting their failings.Producer Sacha Baron Cohen has proved with characters Ali G, Borat and Bruno that he has little shame, but hopefully he'll show some red-faced humility in apologising to the likes of David Walliams, Zach Galifianakis and Kristen Schaal who provide the only guilty chuckles, although Lucy Punch (recently enjoying success in BBC 2's Vexed) is made to look ridiculous as the crazed stalker that wants Carell to spank her like a school girl ("You're a little old to be a school girl, aren't you?"). Let's also hope this isn't a sign of things to come for Jermaine Clement, whose cult television hit Flight Of The Conchords is in a completely different league to this offering.Dinner For Schmucks has somehow managed to be worse than any fan of the original could possibly have feared when the remake was announced.

As the picture develops it proves to be comedy with a kind message worked in. Plus the major actors, Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, stay in character so well.Paul Rudd, plays the ambitious character trying to climb the corporate latter so his girl friend, the strikingly pretty Stephanie Szostak, will marry him. He serendipitously meets a naturally outrageously funny character, played by Steve Carell, and complexity and a laugh until you hurt story unfolds.</fullReview>

This movie is a good investment of your time, and I am planning another trip to the movies for Dinner once again!

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming into this movie, I honestly wasn't expecting much, which is why I was surprised that it was actually a great movie. It was full of genuine humor, and it even contained some of the most heart-wrenching scenes that I've seen in years. Most of all the movie had a message, which generally isn't something you see in many modern day light comedies, such as the hangover and all. Also, speaking of movies such as the hangover, the jokes were generally a lot more involved and some even required some thinking to get(such as when Therman, the mind controller states how "the brain, like all other muscles, have pressure points which can be pushed," which becomes pretty hilarious after you realize the brain isn't a muscle. Overall I was very impressed by this movie's outstanding quality, and would highly recommend it to anybody wanting to see a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype, it's not as bad as they say!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching "Dinner for Schmucks". To me it's a typical rom-com, but there's this weird guy in it that steals the show. I really liked the "mice"-en-scenes, the ones at the dinner were lame, but the scenes Barry recreated from his marriage were beautiful in an odd way. I liked Steve Carell, as Barry, because surprisingly of all the over the top characters in this movie, he was the most believable and lovable and I'm not a fan. It took me a lot of time to like him in "The Office", but thanks to Comedy Central over here in Holland and after a lot of sleepless nights with absolutely nothing else to watch, he kind of grew on me. Zach Galifianakis character was great too, but the only things that had me laughing out loud was some of the slapstick. S o was it a good movie? Yes, enjoyable enough for a Sunday afternoon. I tried to watch the original "Le dinner du cons" before I saw this remake but I couldn't stand it, because of the slow pace. Now I have seen the remake and was pleasantly surprised, I just had to watch the original, because everyone keeps saying it's so much better. I used to love Louis de Funes and the Pink Panther movies when I was a boy (and yes I know Clouseau wasn't really French!), so I gave it another go. I was happy to see Jacques Villeret, the sidekick of Louis de Funes in a couple of movies, but I guess that's also the problem. He needs someone else to shine and he didn't really on his own. The dialogs were more tongue in cheek than laugh out loud funny and I really feel sorry for people who think this is the funniest movie ever? I was also very disappointed that the actual dinner wasn't in the movie, because I expected the French to outshine the remake in it. So if you like Steve Carell you'll love this movie and as a remake I think it did improve on the original even though they gave it a typical Hollywood ending. If you really want to see a train wreck of a remake, I still think Louis de Funes' "Oscar" by Sly Stallone is the worst remake ever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best comedy since Austin Powers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike other reviewers, i'm not going to slate it, comparing it to an obscure french film nobody watched. Instead I'm going to review it for what it was, a mainstream Hollywood film, the funniest one I've seen since Austin Powers.It was sidesplitting, literally I was keeled over and fell off my chair in the cinema because it was so funny. The charisma of David Walliams and Jemaine Clement were amazing, portraying stereotypes in wholly redefining ways that were invigorating, the way Walliams never took it seriously, but reveled in quips and over zealous accents.Carroll's range of emotional torture throughout is immense and beautiful, whilst Rudd enters the role wholly with deep satisfaction for the viewer and Szostak is a great new talent.After this I went to see Grown Ups with Adam Sandler. Now that film was terrible! In comparison this had so much plot complexity (we find out why Carroll does the things he does in such delicate layering that it is quite breathtaking).Masterpiece of comedy. Don't let the zealots watching french cinema lie to you.</fullReview>

The only funny actors in the film are Chris O'Dowd and Zach Galafianakis, and they only serve minor roles in the film. However there are some funny parts in the film but I think that the overall terribleness of the film outweighs that.If you love unwitty slapstick humor then feel free to watch this film it will suit you. But there's nothing original in this film just a painfully stupid plot.Terrible film. I would suggest watching some other Steve Carrell or Paul Rudd films because this film doesn't do justice to the decent titles they have done in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I love comedies, but very few make me laugh out loud - but this movie had me bursting out every couple of minutes. I was not alone in that, the theater I saw it in was packed and everyone was in hysterics. Some reviews on here actually complain that it is "low brow" or "stupid" - seriously? Where you expecting a deep and insightful movie? Had you seen the previews? Is it realistic? Of course not (not many movies are - it is called suspension of disbelief). The point of a comedy is to make you laugh. Going in with expectations of anything high brow is absurd. If you like The Office or 40 Year Old Virgin, then you will love this movie - it is in a similar vein, but much cleaner than 40 Year Old Virgin. In fact, it is surprisingly funny for a PG-13 film. Can't understand any of the bad reviews - if you like Steve Carell, Paul Rudd and Jay Roach movies - then this is for you - one of the funniest projects any of them has been involved in.</fullReview>

This was the most entertaining and touching movie I have seen in a while. I love Steve Carell and he did not disappoint as well as the rest of the cast. Why did I give this movie a 10 star rating?

		<shortDescription>Best Comedy In Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Dinner for Schmucks is one of the best comedies I've seen in recent years, possibly since Austin Powers. It's funny without getting as crude and disgusting as other recent funny comedies like Borat, Team America, Harold &amp; Kumar, and Super Bad. The characters are likable with their funny flaws, and Steve Carell performs his role better than anything I've seen from Adam Sandler, Will Farrell or any of the other current lead comics. Carell plays a not so bright, nerdy amateur taxidermist who makes dioramas featuring stuffed mice. But you like him because he's very talented at his hobby. Paul Rudd befriends him with an ulterior motive, to invite him to the title dinner to impress his boss - but humiliating him in the process. But even before the dinner, Carell, trying to helpful, creates a series of misunderstandings that mess up Rudd's relationships. This makes up the bulk of the movie and is very funny, if typical comedic misunderstandings, well staged with good comic timing. SPOILER: But the dinner finally comes and that's the outstanding part, as we see the schmucks invited really are better people than the snobs who invited them, just ordinary people with some extraordinary talents -- but intensely funny. This is one to watch over again every couple years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for people-with-nothing-else-to-watch is a movie which could define the word average. there is no denying the fact that it WILL make you laugh at parts, but the trouble is that it doesn't happen very often. I remember laughing properly about twice through the whole movie. Why? It's stupid, This movie is just really stupid.Its the story of a bland business type character trying to get a promotion by inviting someone much more interesting and confusing to a dinner and winning the dinner for idiots competition. The rest of the plot is as predictable as a Nascar racetrack, as is the amount of low brow humor that for the most part is lacking in laughs, style, class and intelligence. This movie seems to assume its audience is stupid and therefore tries to be as stupid as possible and then, when you don't expect ( I meant expect it) they try to put emotion in to make you feel something? However, this is only one character you can feel for and it is Steve Carell's character. He genuinely has a sad back story which is conveyed in a cunning and emotive way involving mice. Even this though, was not enough to save the movie from large void that it fell in.It had a good cast and some nice concepts, but in the end this movie was nothing to be enjoyed, which is sad because i feel there might have been potential in there somewhere.4/10 stars or, 2/5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You really gotta like Steve Carell's brand of wacky humor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is called "Dinner for Schmucks", but I don't believe the word "schmuck" is ever uttered. When we get to the dinner, very late in the movie, the characters call it a "dinner for idiots." Paul Rudd pretty well plays the straight man here, he is Tim, an up and coming employee in a Los Angeles area firm that usually buys distressed companies cheap then liquidates them. Someone just got fired, and Tim has his eye on the vacant office and a promotion.Tim has a very nice girlfriend, they love each other, he proposes often, but she says that is a big decision, not to be rushed into. Stephanie Szostak is the girlfriend Julie, an art dealer.Tim accidentally meets Steve Carell, an IRS auditor, also a trained taxidermist, Barry. He actually hits Barry with his car, as Barry tries to rescue the body of a dead mouse. Barry's hobby is to preserve dead mice, then use them to create very elaborate dioramas of famous people and famous events. Like the Last Supper. Or Ben Franklin flying his kite in a storm.So you put these three characters in a box, shake them up, and see what spills out. Barry becomes the "freind from hell", constantly mucking up things for Tim. Think Jim Carrey's character in "Dumb and Dumber." One of the products of his incompetence is Julie deciding to leave Tim because she thinks he is in love with someone else.But Tim wants the promotion, and is invited by his boss to the yearly dinner, where each employee brings the strangest person they can find. The biggest "idiot", so they can make fun of them, while the idiots think they are being honored. This offends Julie, so Tim has to make the choice ... promotion or Julie? Some of the middle of the movie moves very slowly, it could easily have been made closer to 90 minutes. But the high point is the dinner at the end. I enjoyed much of it, but not that much. Most of the humor is very dumb humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idiocy reigns supreme, for better or for worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The French film that "Dinner for Schmucks" draws its inspiration from, "Le Diner de Cons," was successful because it made us seriously ponder who the real idiot was -- the up-and- coming businessman or the dolt he must invite to a business dinner. With "Schmucks," you seriously ponder if the real idiot has been you for watching the thing in the first place. Good news is if you can make it through the bumbling first half, "Schmucks" turns itself around in almost redeeming fashion. Paul Rudd plays Tim and Steve Carell plays Barry. The former works at an Equity Firm and seeks a big promotion; the latter works for the IRS and makes dioramas featuring dead mice dressed as people. Their paths cross because after hitting Barry with his car, Tim realizes he's a perfect fit for the "idiot dinner" that his boss has invited him to, one that he learns will have implications for his future at the firm. Unfortunately, Barry is a bit of a leech, and what Tim expects to be a brief dinner that he can forget about later turns into 48 hours of mind- numbing stupidity. Not until Tim gets stuck deep in the shenanigans does any real humor come out of "Schmucks." At first, writers Michael Handelman and David Guion (co-writers of the barely seen comedy "The Ex" starring Jason Bateman and Zach Braff) determine that Barry's idiocy justifies him instigating the film's events with any absurd action they deem helpful to the story. While we learn eventually just how clueless Barry really is, his character had not been established as so socially inconsiderate as to instant message with Tim's stalker Darla (Lucy Punch), the event that sets everything into motion. Once that snowball gets rolling, the situational comedy that ends up working does come out of it, but that singular action was weakly constructed, topping the long and bad highlight reel of the first act. The moment that turns around "Dinner for Schmucks" completely comes at an important business meeting between Tim and a Swiss billionaire looking to invest with the firm. Tim's expecting a letdown because his girlfriend, Julie (Stephanie Szostak), who was supposed to attend with him to talk art with the investor's wife, has walked out on Tim, partially thanks to Barry. In hopes of saving the day, Barry recruits Darla the psycho to pose as Julie without telling Tim about it. Barry and Darla join the meeting, which doesn't go quite how you'd expect. Although spurred by the recurring "accidental cell phone switch" gag, the key is that the scene gets you to think "wow, Barry really is a total idiot!" and the whole thing will likely crumble beneath Tim, including his job and relationship. Finally, Carell's Barry starts to feel like a real character. Although not a cure-all for the film's ills, that establishment works wonders on your ability to merely enjoy it at all. We've known for a while that Carell can do the idiot thing. From "Anchorman" to seven seasons of "The Office" on NBC, no one does the clueless guy better or to greater comic effect. He churns Barry into a fairly likable numbskull, but the character operates as Michael Scott on "The Office" and Brick Tamland from "Anchorman" combined into one schizophrenic person. At one moment he's sweetly screwing everything up, the next he's laughing at a chimpanzee on television. Given the writing, it's not entirely evident just how stupid (or what kind of stupid) Barry is supposed to be. Only toward the end does it take shape. Director Jay Roach ("Meet the Parents," "Austin Powers") also finds his groove here too. "Schmucks" loosely follows the French film, the big change being the actual dinner itself, which never happens in the original. Here, it serves as the last-ditch effort for laughs by introducing bizarre peripheral characters in the form of the other idiot guests, the highlight being a woman who acts as a psychic medium for dead animals. Some of the components of this finale are meant to serve the individual subplots for Barry and Tim, which along with a few laughs make it worthwhile. We learn, for example, that Barry's wife left him because, as he puts it, "he lost the clitoris." Jokes aside, it's part of what allows Tim to see Barry's humanity and puts a nice touch on their relationship, which is the heart of the story and what made "Le Diner de Cons" so terrific. Ultimately, however, the setup does the payoff no justice and "Schmucks" never fully washes out that first lengthy bad taste. So for different reasons, the question of true idiocy remains unanswered -- or simply that we're all idiots, including Hollywood. ~Steven C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think the movie was funny enough. I love Paul Rudd and Steve Carell but this movie was outrageously silly. Things seems to happen for no apparent reason. Everything felt so contrived.The only reason I gave this movie a try was because my sister said it was hilarious. Sorry. Not hilarious enough for me. I laughed about five times in the entire movie and the film was just a drag. That's not good for a comedy.I admire Steve in portraying the idiot friend who sabotages everything but he wasn't believable. He became very annoying which frustrates me all the way to the end.I'd recommend it for a couple of funny scenes but overall it was a little disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't an overall terrible movie; but then again it really wasn't the best movie I had ever seen either! The plot of the movie was a little illicit, but then again aren't most... Well, in this case it was absolutely blurred by the sheer stupidity of the movie. I did however find myself smiling or laughing the majority of the movie. I did want to occasionally punch a few of the characters in the movie, but there are always a few of these in each movie, then what would make the movies good? (Ya got me here...) As I am a softy, there were a few parts in which I did get a little sad, because I always enjoy the development and flourishing of a romance. But overall, my final score is a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those movies you got to the end and thought, how in the hell did I manage to make it through this movie without turning it off. At one point about mid-way through this movie, I almost turned it off, about 6 times, but kept thinking, it can't be this bad. Well it improved enough to finish watching the movie, but that was it. It was awkward and uncomfortable. The only entertaining part was the brain power over mind power struggle, about 5 minutes of the movie, simply because you felt driven to see Barry win, other than that, a complete waste of time. You could get much more satisfaction from watching paint peel from the wall than to watch this movie. If I could, I would rate this movie below 1, because I just lost 114 minutes of my life I can't get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner for Schmucks (2010, PG 13)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Carell, as Barry Speck, plays one of those get-in-the-way and turn-everything-to-chaos comedians in "Dinner for Schmucks", based on a 1998 French film named "The Dinner Game". He's an ultimate dreamer and do-gooder too, who won't go away. Imagine someone with extremes of honesty, energy, curiosity, ignorance, and innocence all at the same time, and then set him loose on the life of an aspiring 7th floor business man and see what happens. The best thing about him is exactly all those qualities and the way he uses them as ammunition to turn all the fake professional types into the goofs.His first victim is Tim Conrad (Paul Rudd), an ambitious and inventive business man aiming to climb the corporate ladder. But his promotion is conditional on showing he can be a successful "team player" and "guy they can trust", which comes down to a cruel dinner game. It's just like typical corporate hazing rituals that organizations like to keep secret. Tim has to bring the wackiest, nuttiest idiot he can find to a dinner, so the corporate elite can have a good time laughing at the loon. The catch is that he can't tell the person that it's for entertainment. It has to be a genuine idiot and they can't know it's for show. Mr. Bean would be a fine catch. But since he's too expensive, Tim finds Barry Speck (Steve Carell). Or, we should say, Barry finds Tim and won't go away.The bad part for Tim (Paul Rudd) is that his girlfriend, Julie (Stephanie Szostak), hates the idea. He wants to impress her with a promotion, and he already has a fancy place and Porsche for her, both of which he can barely afford. She's an amazing art gallery curator. But she walks out on him after he defends the dinner game as a career necessity. Maybe his love for her would have caused him to change his mind, but when life gives you such easy pickings, it's very difficult not to take advantage.It's almost as if his idiot fell on top of his head, but in this case, it's the hood of his car. Barry is perfectly goofy and dumb appearing. He's an idiot in a way that reflects all of us to a certain extent but taken to an extreme. He sucks at figuring out song lyrics, he doesn't know many popular cultural sayings, and he's easily duped because he's so naturally honest. What do you expect from him? He practices taxidermy as a hobby and roams the city looking for dead mice to stuff. He's artsy and likes to make little idealistic art shows out of his dead mice. He portrays lover mice drinking from cheese or riding cheese boats. He's quite cheesy himself and very easily pleased, making him especially easy to invite to a dinner party of strangers.The film has its great comedic moments scattered here and there. Barry gets a bit too close for comfort, he carries stuffed mice around with him, and he gives Tim's address to a sex crazed online stalker. He also ruins Tim's life 50% of the time he tries to help. After Julie (Stephanie Szostak) gets suspicious that Tim is cheating on her, Barry gets a chance to help find a replacement for her at an important business meeting and later help to get her back. Tim aptly compares Barry to maggots embedding themselves into your brain and never going away once inside.Some of the comedy before the climax relies on the typical not-so-funny uncomfortable situations. Who cares if Barry brings a stalker and former one night stand to a $100 million business meeting to cover for Tim's highly cultured girlfriend? It's funnier on the written page than on the screen, and it's totally dependent on embarrassment and violations of social norms. It's mostly just uncomfortable to watch. But the director, Jay Roach, of "Austin Powers" and "Meet the Parents" fame, delivers yet another sustained comedy otherwise.Even with a gradually increase of feel-good charm, the funny parts are amplified by Steve Carell's transformation of Barry over the course of the movie. Barry is interesting to try to figure out. He seems a bit calculating and mysterious at times, which isn't far fetched considering he works for the IRS. It's almost as if he wanted to get run into with Tim's car or someone's car, like a fisherman putting out his lure and getting a chance to unleash "goodness" (hell, that is) on his catch. Maybe he gets confused about the date of the dinner, bringing him to Tim's place a day early, but maybe it's an unconscious and semi-intentional mistake. He goes from easily gullible, to easily hurt when Tim talks badly about him behind his back (another good indication of his calculating nature), to perfectly understanding of Julie's newest quirky client, an artist who loves himself and sex with his subjects.The dinner at the end is a climax of screwball comedy. Barry seems to evolve and gain confidence as he reflects on the mouse he dressed as Tim. Perhaps his thought is to completely give in to whatever will happen to him at the party in order to try to bring the ideal worlds he creates in his mouse displays to reality. He's a man on a mission with renewed energy and enthusiasm. He would probably continue failing 50% of the time to help Tim, except the party is rigged for him to succeed. It's an absurd situation of course. How did he know to bring his mouse displays? No matter. He uses the cruel dinner party game as an opportunity to cheer for the idiots. Where else would he be able to make professionals seem like idiots by merely being himself, except at a dinner for making fun of idiots?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>painfully unfunny, good performance by Steve Carrel. watch if u like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK seriously not a horrible or bad movie but its not a good one either. some few funny and laughable moments but all in all its a painful comedy, still it had something which kept me watching it. maybe Steve Carrel's character and his performance. Fail screen writing. Some of the dialogue was really awkward and some of the jokes were just not funny. Parts of the movie are laugh out loud hilarious thanks to impressive performances, writing and directing but other parts are appalling thanks to performances, writing and directing. The concept itself is brilliant, which I'm guessing the original film is as well, but this remake is way too over the top and unbelievable as well as just ugly and mean spirited. It pretends to be in good will and have a small heart at times but really it's an insult to creative outcasts and individuals everywhere. The 'loveable losers' presented in this movie are shown as annoying and idiotic pests on normal citizens who we should love because they mean well. It's really patronizing and insulting to anyone who dares to step outside of the norm, although it briefly pretends to be otherwise. The movie is not realistic in any way and does make several jokes at the expense of others, just like the majority of it's characters. Movies like 'THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN', 'PLANES, TRAINS &amp; AUTOMOBILES' and the more recent 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE' represent a more heartfelt and sincere example of similar subject matter. The movie is really funny at times but it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth after-wards. Some people, like many of the characters and film makers of this movie, think it makes them look clever and smart to make fun of others but that's really easy and anyone can do it. Some of us just choose not to. felt flat most of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10/10 for Dinner for Schmucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I am a major fan of Steve Carell, partially consisting of his performance on "the Office". If you are a fan of that series, you will surely love "Dinner for Schmucks". The humour was excellent, and the idea was great. I thought the line-up of actors was also a good choice, and fitted this movie very well. I give this a 10/10, and, it is by far, one of the funniest movies released in 2010.This movie certainly never lost it's audience; with the story constantly flipping and twisting, it kept you focused and watching. I never lost interest, nor did I ever refrain from laughter. This is probably something I could watch over and over and never get tired of. I really do not understand how it could not be liked, but for it being inappropriate for younger viewers at times. Two thumbs up for the actor playing "Therman" - he was spectacular in the hangover, playing "Allan", and has definitely shown that same humour in "Dinner for Schmucks". I highly recommend this movie, whether you need a good, hard laugh, or if you're just into the comedy scene. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't laughed this much since The Hangover. This movie was absolutely hilarious and exactly what was expected from Steve Carell. His character was just brilliant. Paul Rudd was excellent and offcourse the man who needs no introduction: Zach Galifianakis was at his best. I can see why some people wouldn't like this movie if their sense of humor did not like the Hangover then they will no like this movie. It had many clever moments, excellent comic timings, and very wicked storyline. Also if ur an office space fan then your in for a treat because Ron Livingston is in this movie and this movie had a lot of environment like office space and Ron Livingston had a new role which u fans will love. Overall I loved every aspect of this movie and wish there would be another movie with the same Steve Carell's role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on, you knew EXACTLY what you were getting into!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You did and you know it! You saw the previews and you saw the loser Steve Carell was playing. You knew it was going to be lame the second you heard stuff like 'Steve Carell at his best!' and when you saw the movie poster. I mean, look at it! (I'm not going into the plot. You know what is by now).Now I personally have never been a huge fan of Steve Carell. He always plays the same character in everything . . . however, that character always 'works'. I'll give him that.However, he is downright irritating in this movie! Seriously, I was ready to strangle him by the time the actual dinner rolled around. That is, until he started on his 'Tower of Dreamers' thing. He almost redeemed himself for me after that . . . almost. If you didn't laugh at some of those lines and dioramas, you were not in the mood for a comedy! There were some laugh out loud moments in this movie and I enjoyed the movie for the most part. However there were things I hated too. So let's get started.Star #1 goes to Paul Rudd because I feel bad for him. Why is he always the straight man? He is genuinely funny and I felt bad for him the whole movie. His girlfriend? Serious biatch. (I'll get to her later) And I give a star to ANYONE who could put up with Barry! Besides, Paul Rudd is one of my celebrity crushes :) Star #2 goes to Jemaine Clement. He was absolutely hysterical so many times! That role could have been so painful but he nailed it! I wanted to see him more! Star #3 goes to Zach Galifianakis. He's hilarious in a really creepy kind of way. "Say you can eat my pudding." I was really confused for a while and then you find out what that means. Ew! But seriously, he is the new rising comedic actor of today.Star #4 goes to the smaller parts like Kirsten Schaal, Jeff Dunham (should've been in it more!), and Larry Wilmore. They were just priceless! Well, I think Jeff Dunham could've been but he was obviously there just for the producers to be able to say he was there.Star #5 doesn't really go to anyone in particular. I don't think this movie is bad enough to be 4/10 because I did laugh out loud several times. "And people said 'you only have one ear, you can't be an artist!' And Van Gogh said 'I can't hear you.'" Now for the things that took away the other five stars.Star #6 was ruined by the character of Julie. Once the dinner was mentioned, she became the most irritating person in the movie. Yeah, that includes Barry! Seriously, who believes that their trustworthy boyfriend is going to just give away the engagement ring to some crackpot? Ugh, her plot was just annoying.Star #7 didn't exist because of Barry. I'm not getting to in depth because honestly, you've read this review and many others. Irritating character.Star #8 disappeared due to the plot line in general. I don't get why some brilliant executive wants a ton of idiots over at his beautiful home where they could potentially do damage for dinner and have a contest to see who brought the biggest moron. Stupid. Just really stupid. Was it so we hate big corporations? Um the oil spill happened due to BP. We're already hating big corporations.Star #9 went bye bye because of the idiots at the dinner! WTF? Okay Jeff Dunham's could've been funnier. There was potential there. And Barry and his boss (Zach Galifianakis) were funny together, for the most part. But that weird pet mediator lady? And the blind guy? And the beard guy? And the other people whose ticks I don't remember? Yeah, I don't remember. I saw this movie yesterday. Ugh, everybody else was just . . . weird. Not so much dumb, just weird.Star #10? Fail screen writing. Some of the dialogue was really awkward and some of the jokes were just not funny.All in all, I'd still recommend this movie. It was funny for 90 minutes and then you forget about it. Maybe wait to rent it or when it hits that cheap theater in your area.</fullReview>

It does have some good jokes in it but it is impossible to "taste" the humor among much more stupid and bad ones. I used to appreciate Steve Carell before this movie, but a good and actor should have the integrity to say no to bad(in this case really really bad) roles.IMDb should create a lower grade than 1 (awful), especially for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks, a movie starring Paul Rudd and Steve Carell, is about a loser business guy that supposed to take a dumb ass to lunch and make fun of him. When Paul Rudd hits this dumb ass, he decides that Steve Carell is the dumb ass he wants to take to this stupid dinner for idiots. Then the movie proceeds to continue its stupid story with stupider jokes and tries to make stupid situations that attempt humor but are just stupid. I laughed more at movies like There Will Be Blood, Schindler's List, Downfall, Audition, The Lives of Others, and Winnie the Pooh. every inch of this movie seems to be made with the idea of how retarded can we be and still make money. If you want to spend two hours of your life trying to figure out why people think this movie is funny, good luck because the answer is simple. People are fagots and have terrible taste in big giant pieces of s*** like this mindless f*** hole of movie. This movie blows, hopefully everyone involved in this movie will never do anything again as long as they live.

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what people don't find funny about this movie; but then American audiences don't do well with satire in any but the most blatant forms, and this one was chock full of fairly blatant.The plot is going to lead you from point A to B in a very direct and obvious manner. It is a minimal vehicle for the character interactions.This movie is NOT: Drama, Romance, Mystery, or Action with comedy elements added in. This is slapstick comedy along the lines of Dumb and Dumber, based around an earlier French movie of approximately the same title. The French film is excellent in a French comedy sort of way. This film is hilarious if you understand what the movie is supposed to be.DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE IF: * You don't understand the concept or implementation of satire * You don't understand the word "implementation" - You will probably identify with the plight of the "schmucks" and therefore will not understand this movie. * You want a nice heartfelt story where lessons are learned and there are funny situations along the way. * You are the kind of person that expects dramatic character development and believable plot planning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guess who the schmuck is? Me and anyone else who was fooled into hoping that a movie by such comedic powerhouses as Steve Carell and Paul Rudd would be worth the $14 ticket price. Or worth our time.I wanted to leave the movie 10 minutes into it when I had not even laughed once. Then, Carell made his scene entry into the movie and a smile came across my face. "Carell will make it all better" I thought. Not only did Carell not make the movie any better, he made it agonizingly more painful.Before you accuse me of not having a sense of humor, know that I have loved the two-previous Rudd and Carell joint ventures: The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Dinner for Schmucks is nothing like either of those two movies but instead more like a bad Saturday Night Live skit that goes on five minutes too long.Schmucks uses plenty of cheap and unoriginal tricks to either grab laughs or to advance the plot but fails miserably at both. Best you can hope for are a few and I do mean a few scattered laughs, amidst a lot of creepiness, meanness and awfulness. Save your money. Save your time. But, if it's comedy you're in the mood for, go see the aptly-named The Other Guys--as those other guys, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, brought it! That comedy left both my jaw and stomach in pain from laughing so hard throughout the movie. Parisa Michelle - www.CelebMagnet.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fairly likable comedy that ambles along pleasantly enough without ever troubling the back of your throat with that thing you might call "a laugh". Steve Carrell can time a gag but flounders somewhat with the limp material, so it's unlikely that the planned casting of Sasha Baron Cohen in the lead would have improved matters.The ending is somewhat marred by the gears being crunched so that it ends up in that genre we know as "feelgood"; a predictable development for mainstream Hollywood movies these days, sadly. How many films of this ilk cast aside their teeth for pure goo in the final third? A few years ago I would have anally sought out Le Dîner de Cons, the inspiration for this movie, just to compare them directly. However, I guess these days I'm getting a bit too old... rather like a lot of the gags in Dinner For Schmucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish I could exterminate this Roach-infested flick from his otherwise impressive body of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jay Roach's roach-coach comedy "Dinner for Schmucks" is one schmuck of a movie. I had an appetite for a quirky comedia pelicula with some eccentric characters and a magnetic narrative. But instead what the Roach-coach fed us was an unpleasant, dull movie about a rising executive named Tim whose superiors force him to bring a human target to humiliate in a "hence movie title". Tim meets the leading schmuck character of the film Barry while crashing his vehicle into Barry as Tim was texting while driving. Tim is played by the charismatic Paul Rudd, and Barry is played by a spectacled nerdy-looking Steve Carell. We all know that Carell and Rudd are consummate comedic pros who have proficiently showed their diverse talent both in television and movies. But there is nothing they could have done to save this awful cinebistro flick when they were handed a profoundly disoriented and steadily queasy screenplay by David Guion and Michael Handelman; a scribe that should have been "handled" by other "men". In returning to the narrative, "why?" probably because I am schmuck enough to continue to write about this movie, Tim longs to prove to his girlfriend Julie that he could move up the ranks in the business world, so he accepts the invitation by his boss Lance Fender to this "dinner for schmucks". Julie despises the idea but Tim goes along with it anyways. Upon meeting Barry and seeing all the schmuckering qualities he possesses, Tim then decides that "he has found his schmuck" for the din din. What follows is a slapstick boringpalooza which includes a stalking female psycho, a Swiss millionaire egomaniac, an outlandish artist, and a mind-controlling obsessed accountant. Actually, the last one was not too bad due to the fact that it was portrayed by the scene-stealing Zach Galifianakis. Too bad Roach did not "hang over" more scenes to the brain controller quack Therman, but not even Zach's comical efforts could save this turd of a movie. My main complaint of the cinematic service of "Dinner for Schmucks" was the disservice it did in degrading those with eccentric hobbies or passions. Sure it had to be part of the narrative, but Roach (who has proved he is a viable talented auteur in the past) did nothing inspiring or genial to glorify those with certain "out of the ordinary" talents or as the mass bullying population likes to call them?.. "idiots" or "nerds". So without a doubt, this film is major ammunition to increase the senseless bullying that hurts many day after day. Maybe I should take it as a grain of salt, and not dwell on it, but there was no tasty grain of salt or anything else tasty for that matter in this cinematic dinner table that should warrant a reservation with the "Dinner for Schmucks". ** Needs Improvement</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. There are some pretty angry reviews here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so this is not the best work of either Roach, Carell or Rudd but to call it trash is really way over the top, even for hardcore bloggers.Sure, some of the situations are a bit of a stretch of the imagination but the idea here is insanely coherent. Haven't you met someone like Carell's character who will do everything to please but keeps overdoing it. Carell's interest in taxidermy is not a great comic hook, but haven't you seen much worse.When I saw the first 5 minutes, I was worried that this was turning into another Cable Guy. I was so relieved it didn't. Carell is not insane or a genuine loser like The Cable Guy. He is not totally average and the buck teeth are a little much, but that is the standard character of sub-par intelligence, I guess.The actual Dinner Party should have been a little bit more thought out, though. It's not that funny and the most unbelievable part of the whole movie. But the rest is pretty good. The bonding between Rudd and Carell is for the most part believable and the insane ex-girlfriend is only a minor annoyance.One major problem. Why is there always a subplot involving why a guy can't get a girl to marry him involved in these films? 'Cause that's what moviegoers relate to? The girlfriend character is absolutely superfluous here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tedious and horrible "comedy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the vulgar humor from the atrocious Meet the Fockers, director Jay Roach made a more "sophisticated" (translation: equally unfunny) comedy in the shape of Dinner for Schmucks, the remake of a French film I have not seen. Dinner for Schmucks offers the combination of Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, which sounds theoretically likable, but in the practice it does not work because of the pathetic screenplay they have to work with, which is full of forced scenes which try to be funny but are irritating in fact. In many aspects, Dinner for Schmucks reminded me of The Cable Guy, in which we had also seen two talented comedians (Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick) trapped into unlikeable characters and very forced situations. The rest of the actors neither have substantial material to work with; the worst victims of that are Jemaine Clement, Lucy Punch and Zach Galifianakis.In conclusion, Dinner for Schmucks is a lousy "comedy", which literally never made me laugh; instead of that, it only provoked tedium and irritation on me. My best recommendation is for you not to make the same mistake as me, so do not waste your time and your money in this film torture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I woke up on July 30th and I realized that I missed the midnight premiere. To solve this problem, me and my sister woke up early at 11:00 to see the early show to be the only ones in the theater, but of course allot of people did what we did, so it was semi packed.Besides that, the main point is the movie. I expected a little more than what was handed to me when I saw this movie. I mean yes it is funny but, when it comes to comedy movies, they always show most of the best parts in the commercials so some of the jokes you expected to come at you, Although there were many jokes I didn't expect witch were hilarious.Steve Carell and Paul Rudd are a great comedy team. But even though there both there can be only one who is better. WOW?. I feel like this post is turning into a combat, well?.. it's not. Anyways if I had to choose who was better Steve Carell is the better out of the two in this film. He is a true comedy genius. Anyone who can act like an idiot like he does is awesome. I don't know how he doesn't get embarrassed.If I had to give a rating for this film I would give it?.. 5 stars out of a total of 10 stars. It's a great summer comedy film.</fullReview>

I actually laughed once when the lady who can talk to dead animals got involved. Otherwise, this was the saddest waste of time i have ever sat through. wow! now I feel better that I shared that and would welcome an apology from whoever made this manure! Steve Carell, c'mon man!

		<fullReview>I try and see movies before reading reviews on IMDb in order to allow myself to enter with an open mind. But for some reason, I didn't do that this time and went in expecting complete trash due to the horrible reviews spit out by the fans on this site. I guess I can see why some people didn't like it, but I guess I can also see why it's ranked a solid 6.0.First, I love Steve Carrell, so keep that in mind as I review this title. Second, I usually enjoy re-makes, especially comedies.Even though there were some serious themes and events, this movie was by no means plot driven. No, this movie was given life by well-timed humor. This isn't always a good thing, though, as you are bound to run into people who simply don't find the dialogue and characters funny. As I stated before, I find essentially all of Steve Carrell's work hilarious, so that helped get me through some of the bizarre portions of the film. I think there was a distinct limit as to how good this movie was going to be, and I believe they almost reached that maximum. Problem is, the writing tried to please too many types of people. There was just too many different types of humor and no underlining theme.</fullReview>

The movie at times looses a grip with reality so much in an attempt to be witty, funny and quirky at the same time but in the end it comes out as dull, uninventive and just plain retarded. The relationships between characters are forced and non-believable as much as the situations that they create. The most interesting part is that the "non-idiot" characters are actually more moronic than the so called "idiots". I can't believe that so many good actors accepted to be in this crap.

But I guess if you bring in a decent cast and enough hoopla for marketing you could sell ice to Eskimos. I set through the movie and other than a few laughters this movie is very boring and the main reason for it is the plot. It doesn't make sense and overall just a bad idea for a movie. Steve Carell is being brought over to dinner, by Paul Rudd, to make fun of and if Paul Rudd can bring the stupidest person for dinner he will get his hopeful salary raise . It turns out that Carell is much more stupid than Rudd could imagine and he enters his life in a peculiar way but the whole plot just isn't funny and a total waste of time. Edan Aharony</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching a movie many people already have a standing on what the movie is going to be like and whether they will like the movie or not. This is quite problematic since commercials often misconstrue the actual meaning of the movie.Nearly every single funny part of the movie would be seen in the commercial and the commercials were always on T.V. At times it made some semi-funny scenes look absolutely hilarious. The problem is that when you get to the theater it is not as funny as you may have thought. Another problem is that the movie does not really seem like the movie it was portrayed to be in the commercials. The dinner is only a small part in the end and not the entire movie is intended to make you laugh. Most comedies try to make you laugh almost constantly throughout the entire film. This one is full of one-liners. The movie was stupid. It was supposed to be stupid; that is exactly what made it funny. I think the writers were going for more of a softer approach. They were trying to make a balance between those stupid movies that you watch once because it is hilarious but has no substance and a movie that is actually good and has a plot. What they got was a pretty mediocre movie. It was not terrible, but it was not wonderful either. The proper word to use for this movie would be good. It cannot be described with any other flavorful words. A movie that some people can get into and others cannot. I personally liked it, however, I believe that the over-played commercials and the not-as-amazing-as Despicable Me performance by Carell is what turned most people off. Despite the criticism I still gave the movie 6.5 stars (there is no options for half stars above) because I liked it. I did not regret going to see it even if it was not quite what I had expected and I enjoyed Carell's performance. I cannot imagine anyone playing the part besides him. Granted, he has had many better performances, but I believe that it had more to do with the writing than with his acting.I would only suggest this movie to anyone who has not seen too much of the commercials or who is a Carell fan. However, if someone finds themselves about to go see this movie they should remember one thing. They should keep in mind that the movie is good but not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironic Irony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regular readers of my comments know I am interested in narrative devices that I call "folding." Sometimes it must seem a stretch, but if ever there was an obviously engineered example, here it is.The spine of the thing is your standard romantic comedy formula. Guy loves girl. Guy loses girl, usually through a misunderstanding. Guy gets girl back at the end, usually involving a statement of love in front of an audience.One twist is that this has an image of a spine used in another genre: Guy has misplaced values. Guy is tested in an unlikely, noirish way. Guy is redeemed at the end by finding "the true meaning of life." The specific variant has an outsider that enters the guy's life, a stranger. The formula requires that this stranger exemplifies natural wisdom. This used to be an "aw-shucks" sort of guy. In the modern political environment, actual stupidity and denial of reality qualifies.The second spine is folded into the first, which is easy. They don't conflict at all until the end where have the redemption coopting the scene with the on-screen audience and the rejoining of the lovers happens in a second ending empowered by inner folds.As with the spines, these explicit folds are two. One is the "perfomance" within that the title references: an audience invites the dumb to a dinner and awards a prize for the most entertaining stupidity. This is a traditional fold of the play-within-a-play sort. The second fold involves the wise stranger. He makes dioramas of preserved mice in costumes. This must have been a challenge to the writers because they pulled the biggest guns we know: John Lennon (when his 70th birthday re-awakens his memory). The valuable establishing few minutes at the beginning of the film are spent letting us know that Lennon's wisdom/idealism is to be related to these mouse-scenes. Because it is the first we see, it is the moral core of the world of the film.This inner fold of the dioramas is merged with the inner fold of the dinner performance. A temporary weld is written in, involving imagined mind control. I don't suppose the writer diagrammed this structure; it likely was envisioned intuitively from attunement with where the public is going. But I can guarantee that the producers did, and also that they added the Lennon and mind control elements to bind the mix. This is because we as the viewing public appreciate these complex narrative structures. We also appreciate irony that is placed a half step ahead of the mainstream. As I write this, that mainstream irony (stupidity as truth) is fueled by the Fox News empire and defined as comic irony by John Stewart of comedy central. Lest you think this isn't engineered to the finest degree, at the dinner is a blind swordfighter, who cuts off the finger of an obsolete aristocrat. Both are carefully designed to fit stereotypes devised by both sides in the polarized public.The appeal of this film will fade as our notions of irony and narrative folding evolve, but for now it hits a sweet spot.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to creative outcasts and individuals everywhere!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Jay Roach, director of both the 'MEET THE PARENTS' and 'AUSTIN POWERS' franchises, directs this remake of the French 1998 film 'THE DINNER GAME'. It's co-scripted by David Guion and Michael Handelman (who also wrote 'THE EX') and stars Steve Carell and Paul Rudd (who apparently can only co-star in buddy films). It's also highlighted by memorable co-starring performances from Zach Galifianakis, Ron Livingston, Bruce Greenwood and Stephanie Szostak (who bares a striking resemblance to a younger Julia Ormond and is just as beautiful and talented, all though her part is a little weak and annoying here). Even with all that talent the film still flounders; all though hilarious at times it's way too ridiculous and mean spirited as well.I've never seen the original but I've gathered, from reading about it, that this is a somewhat loose remake. It revolves around Tim (Rudd) an exec desperately looking for advancement at his business in order to impress his girlfriend (Szostak) who he continually asks to marry him, and even carries around a ring for. When given the chance of a promotion, through the firing of another employee, Tim jumps at the chance to impress his bosses. He learns that this includes attending a dinner in which employees pride themselves in bringing the biggest idiot they can find, to mock and make fun of for the enjoyment of others. His conscious and his girlfriend are dead set against this but when he meets Barry (Carell) he can't resist the opportunity. Barry is a sweet heart-ed but naive and sheltered buffoon who prides himself by making art displays out of dead mice, which he uses his taxidermy skills on. The movie pretty much writes itself from there.Parts of the movie are laugh out loud hilarious thanks to impressive performances, writing and directing but other parts are appalling thanks to performances, writing and directing. The concept itself is brilliant, which I'm guessing the original film is as well, but this remake is way too over the top and unbelievable as well as just ugly and mean spirited. It pretends to be in good will and have a small heart at times but really it's an insult to creative outcasts and individuals everywhere. The 'loveable losers' presented in this movie are shown as annoying and idiotic pests on normal citizens who we should love because they mean well. It's really patronizing and insulting to anyone who dares to step outside of the norm, although it briefly pretends to be otherwise. The movie is not realistic in any way and does make several jokes at the expense of others, just like the majority of it's characters. Movies like 'THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN', 'PLANES, TRAINS &amp; AUTOMOBILES' and the more recent 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE' represent a more heartfelt and sincere example of similar subject matter. The movie is really funny at times but it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth after-wards. Some people, like many of the characters and film makers of this movie, think it makes them look clever and smart to make fun of others but that's really easy and anyone can do it. Some of us just choose not to.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YDpWRaEnYQ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Steve Carell vehicle just can't pull off the charm of the original French movie. What worked in the original was, ironically from an American anto-French perspective, the French class system. Every European knows that their local status games keep good people down and exalt idiots. The Carell character in the French original (the late and lamented Jacques Villeret) was not that dumb, not that stupid, and not that unsympathetic. He was just a schmuck trapped by his unfortunate appearance and by his social lower middle class destiny, to be working for the Fisc (IRS) and gluing together miniature models from toothpicks as a hobby and especially as an antidote to his boring and uneventful life. In the remake, because Americans usually don't get this aspect of Europe, people's fates have to be the result of their psychological makeup or of their lack of talent or brains (well, talent, since few people with brains are exalted by Hollywood flix). So, Carell as a schmuck has to be totally unsympathetic, and his nemesis has to have some warm feelings (which were virtually absent in the original). It has to come down to character and not society. It means that it's hard to be funny, warm and human in the circumstances, since it would be, literally, out of character, and in the end we can't identify with Carell except as a pathetic everyman underdog. Original director Francis Weber had a lot more to work with, so here Carell is given almost no redeeming qualities whatsoever (it's really not a spoiler, but the crazy credits at the end have him laughing at Fender's misfortunes; I won't say more, but it's mean spirited, while the original was not). Also, the whole subplot with Carell's ex now in the hands of his boss is completely mishandled. I for one was relieved that she left the jerk, albeit for another of the same ilk. The actual dinner scene is pretty funny and redeems some aspects of this movie, but that's because the other schmucks were given free rein to let loose, and they do. The animal medium lady is a hoot and worth at least three stars on her own, and the blind swordsman gets one as well. Still, it's a poor movie when the stars can't carry it and depend on five minute cameos by B-list character actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you expect to look at something and then laugh then you have come to the right place. "Dinner for Schmucks" has comedy written all over its face and there is a good load of it. Bit of a tricky plot to write about in one line but let me try. Tim is a rising corporate executive who is looking for his next big break and he bumps in to Barry who is an idiot (With a good heart) and lucky for Tim as he was already in the process of looking for an idiot to be presented in their big corporate dinner which is all about ridiculing an idiot! Got confused? Damn I'm good.Tim is played by Paul Rudd (I love you Man, Role Models) and Barry is played by Steve Carrel ( 40 year old virgin, Dan in real life). No need to mention they both are pretty good at what they do. Specially Steve Carrel pulls off the character very well. (Love the scene where he imitates the Swiss accent) This movie is not a masterpiece in comedies but it will make you laugh. And maybe make you a little sad too in several scenes. And make you a dreamer and give you some inspirational advice before it ends. Most of the critic seems to be really disliking this movie. But for me I'm not a pro critic but I'm happy. Didn't expect Shakespeare out it. And oh yes there are some really creative and sweet miniatures all over the movie from start to end as Barry is a miniature creator. You may like those as well.

		<shortDescription>Steve Carell Keeps the Film Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not too impressed when I saw this film in theaters. I had been excited for it because I'm a major fan of it's two leads: Paul Rudd and Steve Carell. Rarely has either of these comedians been in a film that I didn't enjoy, but this one came close. The film is about Tim Conrad (Rudd) who is given the opportunity for a long-awaited promotion when he impresses his boss. As a form of initiation, Tim is invited to a special dinner where each person brings a "special" guest. The game is to see who can bring the biggest idiot and Tim believes he's found a winner when he (literally) runs into Barry Speck (Carell). Barry is an IRS agent whose hobby is making dioramas with dead mice. Meanwhile, Tim's long-time girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) is appalled at the idea of making fun of people for entertainment and their relationship is strained when Tim seems determined to attend the dinner to impress his boss and prove he's ready to move up in the company. Matters are complicated when Barry becomes involved and Tim's life begins to fall apart around him.The main problem with this film was the advertising campaign. The trailers lead viewers to believe that the dinner and it's lunatic attendees are a major portion of the film. In reality, the dinner doesn't occur until the final 20 minutes or so and the bulk of the film is watching Barry's arrival unravel Tim's life. It's not a terrible problem, but it is unfortunately misleading to those who aren't familiar with the film this movie was based upon, LE DINER DE CONS. As I watched this film originally in theaters, I was a bit let down and perhaps that affected how I received it. I've seen it since and each time I watch it, I find myself laughing more and more. It's certainly growing on me and I'm coming to appreciate the cast's performances more each time. There's definitely some quotable material here (mostly thanks to Jemaine Clement) and the film boasts some great talent.Paul Rudd has proved himself a great straight-man in recent comedies and he continues to impress here. He isn't given a lot of great moments as he's meant to be recipient of the chaos, courtesy of Carell as his idiot. I'm starting to see this as one of my favorite performances from Carell. He's a complete fool but he is so unbelievably charming that you can only laugh at him, even in his dumbest moments. He injects Barry with enough heart to keep him from becoming the creepy guy who plays with dead mice. The film's other great role would be Jemaine Clement as artist Kieran Vollard. I definitely got an Aldous Snow vibe from him, though instead of a crazed rock star he's a sexed up modern artist. He's got some of the best lines in the film ("I'm just a goat that's halfway through eating itself.") and he plays it completely deadpan. We also get the usual comedy from Zach Galifianakis as Barry's boss Therman. His character has a lot of qualities in common with his character in THE HANGOVER (idiotic with over-confidence) but he does it well and it's yet to wear thin on me.The film has a bit of a jerky pace and it feels like it runs on a bit too long, but that's all forgotten when we finally arrive at the titular dinner. The final 20 minutes of the film are the best and make the whole film worth watching, if only once. It's a funny enough flick and it's great to see Rudd and Carell working off each other. It's not going to garner any awards attention but it's good for a couple laughs if you're in the mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started OK with 3-4 good laughing parts and that was it. The rest of the time the story was idiotic, overplayed and tiring. The acting of Steve Carell and Paul Rudd was average. The directing job of Jay Roach was just bad. The screenplay idea had potential and it was probably written having slapstick comedy in mind but it did not deliver.Unfortunately most of the situations that it produced were not funny but rather silly. I kept thinking how funny Frank Oz's Dirty Rotten Scoundrels was. I also cant help but wonder why is it that they do not make funny films anymore. The end was very predictable, really disappointing and without any real climax. I do not recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DINNER WITH SCHMUCKS ? TRASH IT ( D ) Dinner with Schmucks is Annoyingly Painful &amp; intolerable. Paul Rudd is playing almost the same role which he plays 80% of his movies. Their was nothing new about that. Steven Carroll is terribly annoying so to an extent we can say that he acted well because it made me hate his character but the substance of the movie was so amateurishly dealt that not for a second it seemed like a genuine movie. The Russell Band wanna be was Horrific, Russell Band somehow gone little Big after playing Aldous Snow and Obviously Being Katy Perry's husband. So, they cast another actor depicting the attics Russell band has been Shoving our faces as Aldous Snow. That was A Horrific Idea. Zack Galifianakis manage to create some laughs. Stephanie Szostak was Okay and Lucy Punch was irritating. Overall, it's a Horrible Horrible remake of French and Indian movie. The only thing enjoyable in the movie was the Little Dead Mouse's Art!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Dinner for Schmucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based upon the film Le Diner de Cons, Dinner for Schmucks is the Hollywood remake directed by Jay Roach, who is better known for being at the helm of films such as the Austin Powers trilogy, and Meet the Parents/Fockers, all of which are some of my favourite comedies. Dinner for Schmucks however isn't that laugh a minute forgettable flick, but rather is a more sombre tale to remind us of the little guy that's always around, easy to tread on and bullied by the high and mighty.Paul Rudd stars as Tim, an analyst who is dreaming of moving upwards in his company's corporate ladder. He gets the attention of CEO Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) through a rather brash stand out moment during a meeting, and is given that 5 minute elevator pitch to join the firm's head honchos in a dinner where he would be welcomed into the fold if he can meet their expectations - that is to bring along an idiot as his dinner guest, and they were all to laugh at him. The objective is secret of course, and everyone will bring someone in a competition of sorts. It's unorthodox and reeks of elitism, but desperate to get that cushy job, he goes against the wishes of his girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) and fate allows him to bump into Barry (Steve Carell), a simpleton taxidermist who works on mice.As you can predict, much of the comedy comes at the expense of Barry, who speaks funny, behaves oddly, and most of the time you wonder if you're guilty of the same if you were to laugh at him and his antics. It's evil that we get to laugh at someone who's most unfortunate and naive, but that's how David Guion and Michael Handelman's story sets it out to be, with Barry being the fall guy at the receiving end of the butt of the jokes, while Tim slowly undergoes a painful lesson the ill intentions go through a karmic circle as we see his life turn upside down where misfortunes become lucky escapes which in turn sets itself up for a bigger fall.Steve Carell is a great comedian, and like his Maxwell Smart in Get Smart, his Barry here is loony with a capital L, who lives life in his own cocoon which I suspect had snapped when his wife cheated on him with his boss Therman (Zach Galifianakis), who claims to possess the power to read minds since he works in the tax bureau and can see through guys hiding something. The major scene played in the office is nothing but insane and frankly, idiotic, but sets itself up nicely for the big mano a mano in the last act, which unfortunately came across as a little stretched. Thanks to Carell's presence, he brings to life a comedy of disastrous situations though it's still a little bit unnerving to consciously know you're laughing at someone's misfortune.With the strong underlying message of what friendship means and how we learn to accept the drawbacks of our friends, Paul Rudd stars in his second bromance after I Love You Man to explore just that, but it's Jemaine Clement (from Flight of the Conchords) who steals the show as Kieran the artist who's so full of himself and pretentious. Now that is something I can wholeheartedly laugh at!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This would have been better as a serious drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first state that I'm a big fan of Paul Rudd and Steve carrel so I was looking forward to this movie and watched it on the day it released and I was very disappointed with the outcome and I'll try to explain why without giving too much away.The story is simple and predictable, Paul Rudd needs to get promoted in his job and as part of him getting promoted he must attend this dinner with his boss and bring a complete idiot so everyone can make fun of them and the one that brings the most idiotic/radical/crazy person wins - Paul Rudd crashes into Steve carrel and the crazy relationship builds from there...Now the bad point about this film is it just isn't funny, you just watch the film feeling sorry for Steve carrel as he's clearly an emotionally disturbed character with mental issues, and Paul Rudd trying to play the "bad guy" is just a joke because he simply doesn't have it in him - obviously it's not quite as generic as that and things happen around all this but ultimately that's the feeling I got from the film. I thought to myself, considering it wasn't funny it would be better if it was a serious drama, like carrel had a break down because his wife left him and Rudd tries to help rebuild his life or something; there are very few parts were you'll laugh and they are all on the trailers... A very disappointing 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw Schmucks Aug 1's afternoon. It was not a constant laugh-out-load fest. Was hoping for another "The Hangover"-type movie. Overall, the humor was subtle and mostly verbal.The best characters were Clement's Keiran and Thurman played by Zach G. Keiran's egotism was hilarious. It's subtle, non-wacky humor. Thurman's delusion of being a mind-controller was funny, too. I could see Thurman as the lead character in his own movie..........I did not buy the premise that Carrell's character was an idiot/schmuck. Carrell did a good job with what he had. Carrell's character was educated/smart enough to be an IRS auditor. Carrell's character had enough social maturity &amp; skills to be married at one time in the character's life, too. I guess the character was a schmuck because he made 'mouster-pieces.' Maybe Carrell should stay on 'The Office?' Maybe he should do dramatic roles like the suicidal professor in 'Little Miss Sunshine?' Carrell is good when he's got good material. Carrell's 'Schmucks' character just was hard to buy............5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing movie, not worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starring Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd had the potential to be blockbuster comedy but falls far short. To start, Steve Carrell's character while seemingly packed with potential humor, ends up being more like a fly on the wall. Steve Carrell portrays a socially awkward taxidermist that seems to fall just short of being mentally retarded. Paul Rudd plays an ambitious young executive who sees an opportunity to use Steve Carrell's character to his advantage. While this pair seems to have a lot of humor on the surface, the movie projects more of a message than viewers probably want to see; the movie isn't packed with the entertaining humor that old Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd fans probably want to see. Instead most of the jokes are "forced" and the situations are more ridiculous than a reasonable individual would believe. Most of the reason why people are fans of "40 year old virgin" and "Role Models" is because we can relate to the material and style of humor that the movie projects. In "Dinner for Schmucks", the tone of the movie is much more serious and it's coupled with even more outlandish situations than a reasonable human would be able to relate to; leaving the overall feeling of the movie mildly uncomfortable. Overall, it's just a disappointing movie. If you're expecting something entertaining and funny don't go see this movie. If you want to watch a mediocre movie that tries to convey moral fiber through forced comedy, then this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks is probably one of the best comedy pieces that came out in this and last couple of years.The reason why people insist on bringing down this movie, is just because they were probably expecting something else out of Steve Carrel and Paul Rudd.Well, guess what, the movie is still funny. And aside from Kieran's part being played by Jemaine Clement (still very well performed, although, Russel Brand would be perfect for the part), every single actor in the movie delivered. Except for 2 or 3 scenes, the whole movie has lines that make you laugh.In the theater I was in, everyone couldn't stop laughing. Steve Carrel is a comedy god and everything he says is just hilarious.Don't bother with negative comments about it. It's an amazing piece of work and well worth every penny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hysterically funny, but it ended moronically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is about a guy named Tim who's about to get a promotion at his company. He's told to come to a dinner his boss is hosting, where the tradition is to bring an idiot with a special skill so everyone can make fun of them. Tim doesn't think that sounds very nice and plans on not going when he randomly meets Barry, who fits the part of "idiot with a special skill" perfectly. However, Barry turns out to be way more trouble than he's worth, and nearly ruins Tim's life.If you want to see a movie that makes you laugh so hard it hurts, I highly recommend it. I won't give them all away, but some of the scenes were absolutely hilarious. Sure, it was low comedy, slapstick, most of it, but the laughter it induced was cathartic, therapeutic. However, it wasn't by any means a great movie. It's probably not going to be remembered in years to come. I guess there were two main things I found wrong with it. One is that it dragged on for way too long. We (the audience) kept asking, When's it going to be the dinner part, already? The exposition/rising action took too long. Also, the standards of morality some of the characters had were pretty annoying. Why did Tim's girlfriend have such a problem with him bringing Barry - Steve Carell's character - to the stupid dinner? It was a weak scene when she started getting on his case about it - "I don't know you anymore, the Tim I know wouldn't do that." Give him a break. He's just trying to do his job, make a living. And these idiots are such idiots they don't even realize they're being made fun of. The ending was pretty stupid, too. This is a comedy: it obviously ends happy. Though it shouldn't: Tim loses his job, all because he tried to stop the idiots at the dinner from being made fun of. That was pretty dumb. Overall, the story wasn't terribly intelligent, it wasn't haunting or life-changing, but many of the scenes were laugh-out-loud funny, and I suggest seeing it just for fun. Don't expect it to be wonderful - just expect to have a good time watching it.6/10, good comedy, dumb story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it ain't the one of the worst comedy I seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it was better than the trailers to some degree, but that isn't saying much. Now I like Steve Carell and Paul Rudd in some of there movies, and they try to do what they do best. Except Steve Carell plays a real psycho in his new role, don't know any other roles where he plays a retarded psycho. Anyways the premise is about Barry played by Steve Carell who collects dead mice and makes a model of them and also screws up Paul Rudd's character's life piece by piece. Although Tim(Paul Rudd) tries to use Barry in the beginning, I couldn't help but notice how much of a saint he is in this film. I mean he doesn't go as far as some people would go to get a promotion, and even though his life gets screwed apart he keeps his cool for the most part. Now the premise of a idiot constantly messing up someone's life has been done before, but in this it all seems way too intentional. Like Barry is trying to screw it up intentionally which takes the sympathy out of his character, even when it talks about his somewhat sad background. Now I found some parts sort of funny and got a few chuckle out of it, unlike some of the skateboard kids that were sitting behind me in the theaters. They were constantly cracking up going "OMG" and laughing like it's the funniest movie ever. It really isn't and as a whole, the film is a mess, in a negative way. It basically insult both the so called fools and the corporate people at the same time.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Schmucks, Not Enough Dinner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A confession: I am not the easiest person to make laugh. I'm like a comedy death-star, sitting impenetrably through most of what loosely passes as humor, but I am vulnerable to a very specific attack pattern. I also habitually see films on weekday afternoons, where it is not uncommon for attendance to be in the single digits. This is not the proper viewing experience for something like "Dinner for Schmucks."But be that as it may, its silences hung like ripe fruit throughout the overlong, often laugh- less endeavor. What I found probably most disappointing, though, was that the premise (you know, the title) is crammed into the last thirty minutes of a nearly two-hour film. The other eighty are spent mixing two of my least-favorite sub genres into a sleepy cocktail: workplace humor and romantic comedy.I understand the former is presently in vogue, and perhaps because I so admire the BBC "Office," and Mike Judge's "Office Space," more recent attempts at satirizing white-collar America have seemed, to me, incapable of pushing the envelope. It's ironic that Ron Livingston, who played the agnostic hero of Judge's film, plays his exact opposite in "Schmucks"?An unapologetic businessman. But unlike the corporate lackeys in "Office Space," he is counterbalanced by a protagonist (Paul Rudd) who wants just as desperately to assimilate himself to that ideal. His character, Tim, is someone for whom promotion is the only worthy goal.But what's worse is that he repeatedly fumbles his way toward that goal. He is asked to attend a sort of inaugural dinner party, accompanied, as every guest will be, by a fascinatingly imbecilic personage?Enter Steve Carell as Barry, a bland, dopey catalyst for frustrating, obvious misunderstandings.Had the plot remained so simple, there's a good chance I would have enjoyed "Dinner for Schmucks." The eponymous meal collects a compelling (and funny!) array of oddities, and the prevailing humor is decidedly absurdist. A better film would have built the entire second and third acts around this setting, but for over an hour we're subjected to the simple ruination of Tim's life at the hands of his new friend.For example, by way of an incomprehensible instant message conversation with an overeager ex, Barry leads Tim's girlfriend to suspect infidelity. Typically, this would be the type of comic scenario to employ double-entendre. Instead, Barry, at Tim's computer, seems to purposely provide misinformation. He may be a simpleton, but the scene is indicative of a greater problem with his character?We don't understand his thought process. He seems to be cunning when convenient, and unbelievably stupid when not.Incident after incident reveals his destructive power over Tim's life, and it becomes frustrating rather than funny that Tim, a man of some intelligence, is incapable of ridding himself of him. And it's not just his love life. Through Barry's aid he is repeatedly put in jeopardy of losing favor with the man that warranted him the promotion in the first place. Getting rid of Barry, by force if necessary, is the omnipresent, painfully obvious answer to each tiresome dilemma.Then again, who knows. It's difficult to predict the impact a full, laughing audience would have had on my opinion. I don't think "Dinner for Schmucks" is an especially bad film as it stands?Just a languidly average one. Based not on humor, but originality, this localized remake of the French film, "The Dinner Game," carries little merit. It doesn't live up to its premise, and like Barry himself, quickly overstays its welcome.It's hapless, formulaic comedy with all the creativity of a targeting computer. And you don't need one of those to blow up the death-star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely uneven and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found about one-third of the film to be extremely funny. The rest was not funny, and occasionally it was almost painful to watch. I think that perhaps an editor could have shaved off at least 10-15 minutes and tightened everything up. If it can't be uproarious, it can at least move at a lively pace.As an example of what I mean, Steve Carrell's monologue at the dinner contained some truly wonderful lines, but the scene was way too "cute." And the dinner went on way too long: the scene after the award was made was definitely not funny. The vulture flying off with the finger probably sounded better in script conference than what we saw on screen.Zach G's Therman was not nearly as funny as it could have been. He obviously is capable of terrific comic acting, as in The Hangover. Here, the script didn't really give him much to do with a totally unbelievable character--not really a caricature of an actual person--just weird. How can this actor not be funny? I think the script did him in. And I don't think threatening people with an IRS audit is very funny, either.The big reconciliation scene at the end was not funny, went on much too long, and was a total anti-climax. I thought Kieran was another unbelievable character. Some of his lines were funny and believable, but others were just totally inconsistent and not funny.I guess I should have known there was trouble ahead when the opening credits featured amazingly creative and delicate mouse miniatures. I couldn't help thinking there would be a huge market for such art (or kitsch, but it's still marketable). And after that, I was asked to believe it was created by an idiot. And then asked to believe that this talented idiot worked for the IRS. And asked to find all of that funny.I don't recommend a trip to the cinema to see this. It might be worth a look later on television.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Schmucks does a fantastic job at serving its one and only purpose; giving Steve Carell an avenue to be hilarious, and that he was. It seemed that every line he spoke managed to make me laugh hysterically. He was the main source of humor, but not the only one. Paul Rudd did a great job carrying the lead role, and Galifinakis was his usual quirky self. I will warn you that this movie takes a little while to get started but hang in there.

		<fullReview>Often, when I watch a movie where someone's life spirals out of control, due to the well-intentioned mistakes of a doofus friend, I get kind of annoyed. For some reason, it frustrates me, perhaps because the plot is usually so unbelievable (how can *everything* go to crap in the space of 24 hours?). There was a little bit of that in this movie, but it seemed a little more believable than other movies. Unfortunately, there was so much emphasis on plot, the romance between the lead and his girlfriend, and the friendship between the two leads, I started getting a little bored! I wasn't expecting this movie to be so long or so sappy for extended periods of time.I know this is based on a French movie (which I haven't seen yet, unfortunately), but it seems almost like a remake of The Cable Guy, with Jim Carrey, with more sexual humor and less creepiness. Truthfully, I preferred the Cable Guy, though this movie does have some amusing (though not laugh-out-loud funny) scenes.If you like light-hearted comedies that have a little bit of bite, you'll probably enjoy this movie. If you're more into innocent Disney movies or really dark humor (like Very Bad Things), you'll dislike it, though I found it mostly tolerable, and I loved Very Bad Things, so who knows. I'd say this is good for a 5/10 or 6/10.</fullReview>

Huge array of talent, a good script, and far too much stuff going on. I think the problem lies with the direction;: it's all OTT all the time. Yuk. Manic comedy only works because of the pauses or the unexpected, but in your face all the time is just dull.The saving grace in this are the amazing mice dioramas which are beyond beautiful: I would watch 85 minutes of those and how they were made.

		<fullReview>This is a short review.Paul Rudd's performance is still the same from the "Role Models" and "I Love You, Man" days. I fear that he will be type-casted. However once Steve Carell enters the picture the movie suddenly accelerates into non- stop gags. Some jokes fall flat; many gave me lots of chuckles; and a few actually made me laugh 'till my throat went sore. This is a film which is proud of being a gag/slapstick/screwball comedy, and it pays off. There are some sexual jokes which may push the boundaries of its PG-13 rating but still manages to be funny.Now I have to admit Carell's character is so annoying/stupid/insane that you just have to stop taking the film as a realistic comedy and just accept the absurdity that poor Rudd's character has to go through. The plot is predictable but merely used as a vehicle to get the gag ball rolling.It's good to watch if you have nothing else to watch. I'll now look for the original French version, seeing that a lot of people said it's more hilarious.A lot of people seem to hate this movie. It's a comedy, albeit an absurd one. See it for some laughs; the audience I went with was howling with laughter in the cinema hall.Overall rating: 54/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is what it is - daft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film which centres around a single dinner was always going to struggle to pad out the remaining showtime and at times Dinner for Schmucks is obviously trying to do so.To begin with, if the lead wasn't Steve Carrell the film would not work in the slightest, tailor made for him and his daft faces/voices. That said, the film is by no means laugh out loud funny from beginning to end, in fact far from it.I counted just one or two scenes where the cinema audience all laughed together, other than that any giggles were scattered and few and far between. In all honesty the film relies way too heavily on the visual improvised humour Carrell and co. come up with which does become tiresome over the length of the film. I also felt slightly let down by Galifianakis and Rudd, not up to their usual high standards - Rudd's relationship with his supposed girlfriend is unbelievable at best.But rather than slate a film entirely I would rather search for its plus points.Some of the characters in the film are hilarious (admittedly others are just plain annoying) and I would have loved to see more of Chris O'Dowd's blind swordsman character Marco. The scene in which he flicks a light switch is brilliant. Also look out for the best intro sequence ever featuring stuffed mice.If you're after a film which will make you giggle, in which you don't have to think at all or indeed if you're a fan of Steve Carrell then this film will do for you. However, don't expect an epic, twisting story and falling in the aisles comedy as it just is not going to and will never happen.</fullReview>

It was essentially a crappy Family Matters' Urkel meets What About Bob's Bob meets Problem Child's whatever the name of that kid was. It follows the basic overused formula of annoying character (Steve Carell) screws up every aspect of likable character's (Paul Rudd) life, pause for laugh, pause longer, still no laugh, move on, and then likable character accepts and learns to love annoying character. Nothing new. Nothing funny. You're just kinda left asking your self why didn't Rudd's character just tell Carell's character to go away, or punch him in the face, or something. Instead he passively stands by watching his life be systematically dismantled by an unfunny stranger with nothing more than a "wow I'm mildly unconvinced by all of this you ruining my life stuff, please spend the night and sleep on my sofa" attitude. Do yourself a favor and watch something else, anything else.</fullReview>

About to get a big promotion, his beautiful girlfriend is also has amazing things going for her in the feild of arts. Amazing apartment, etc. Okay all is good until Steve Carrel is hit by Rudd's car. This is when I honestly could bare to watch the movie. It's so painful to see Steve completely ruin Rudd's life. I haven't walked out on a movie since "The Master of Disguise" which was the worst movie I've ever seen, nor have I thought of walking out on a movie. But my friends and I needed to see the boring and pointless ending, just so we could see Rudd finally happy, well, remotely happy. Save yourself time, money, and the excruciating experience. Don't see this piece of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thought of inviting people to dinner just so you can have a few laughs and make fun of them is extremely cruel, and you may think that that is what the movie is fully about. I can assure you that it isn't. If anything, it's motivating people to act outside of the box, to be themselves. The movie is really fun to watch and I can guarantee you won't regret seeing it. It's funny, it's charming, and it makes you smile. Heck, I smiled through a lot of the movie. However, it does have some bad sides. Like a lot of movies do. It was ridiculous how many bad things were happening to Tim. Also ridiculous that he wasn't acting like a normal human being would. I can tell you that if all of the things that happened to him, happened to me, I would either break down and cry or scream a lot. Or both. Then the more serious parts weren't serious enough. They added too much comedic relief in it and I didn't want that for those scenes. It's a comedy, yeah, but that doesn't mean every minute has to try to be funny. That's how movies get stale and lose your interest. This wasn't stale at all, but it didn't make me crack up. Steve Carell was very natural and a very believable character. He was charming and cool, but dumb as can be. His 'mousterpieces' were outstanding and funny at the same time. Never seen anything like it, probably never will again. Overall, this movie is really enjoyable and you can probably get past the bad parts if you're not a reviewer like me. Check it out if you want to watch an interesting, but at the same time simple, comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughed out Loud kinda funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised to see the bad reviews on this movie. I laughed out loud the whole movie except for the small bits of serious parts. Carrell's role was hilarious, and very well played. If I gonna criticize him on one thing, maybe he could of did a better job of making the character a bit more "likeable". I know the sob story part was probably meant to do that but I didn't buy it. I would still punch him and ditch that annoying guy on the side of the road. And that being said... maybe Rudd's role seemed a bit too dumb to be following Carrells advices.Basically, I like watching a movie where the actors seem to be having fun and it was obvious that everyone, especially Carell, was having fun in this one. Some jokes seemed spontaneous, they seemed like spur of the moment type of jokes. Those are the best because you really don't expect them to come out and burst out laughing when they do. Good job with the Darla role too, wanted to punch her too.On a final note, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a funny, easy-going night. For the people giving the bad reviews on this one... where is your sense of humour??? Yes the jokes are simple, and it is not very realistic, but it is a comedy movie. If you want a smart or realistic movie, go watch a documentary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't be a schmuck for renting this one, for it has its moments, but, the film does go flat, at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim (Paul Rudd) is in love with a beautiful woman, Julie (Stephanie Szostak), and its hard. She is a budding art museum curator and, although she seems to love him, she won't put the ring on her finger that Paul constantly takes out of his pocket. To help his case, Tim is trying hard to climb his investment firm's ladder and, in fact, comes up with a brilliant idea to lure a wealthy Swiss man into becoming a client. The head honcho (Bruce Greenwood) is pleased. However, to ensure that Tim has the right stuff, the bossman lets Tim know that his relevance at an upcoming dinner party will be critical. Each member of the company that attends must bring a "schmuck", a loser, to the event. The person whose guest is the "worst" will snare a trophy AND be a top dog at work. When Tim tells Julie of the dinner, she is appalled and asks that Tim not do such a despicable thing. Unfortunately, a prime candidate, Barry (Steve Carell) literally runs in front of Tim's car and falls to the ground. This IRS employee is earnest but dimwitted and makes dead mouse dioramas in his spare time. Hanging out for a day or two together, Barry messes up Tim's life in a big way. A psycho ex-girlfriend of Tim's comes calling, thanks to Barry's Internet invitation, and Julie, getting caught in the fray that follows, bolts out the door and into the arms of a client. Eventually, there is nothing for Tim to do but take Barry to the dinner. Will Tim win the competition but, more importantly, will Julie come back to him and will Barry be hurt by the dinner's raison d'etre? Based on a French film, this American translation lacks something, being very uneven. Sometimes its very funny and other times, the jokes fall flat. But, the cast is wonderful and the movie's best asset. Carell and Rudd are a great duo, like Abbott and Costello, and Zach Galifianakis, Greenwood, Szostak, Ron Livingston, and all of the others truly "make" the film a success. That said, the settings are also very fine, with Rudd's apartment absolutely stunning in its decor. Costumes, too, are well-selected and the camera work is also nice. As stated above, however, the script and direction are on again, off again, making for a wee bit of disappointment in the overall final picture. No, you will not be a schmuck if you see this one, it has some great moments. Likely it is, however, that you will suffer a small letdown as the ending credits roll.</fullReview>

My partner commented that he wished we'd waited to get the $5.99 previously viewed DVD so at least we could stop watching it in the middle - instead, we were sitting there thinking we'd paid full ticket price, hoping against all hope that it would get better - to find that it just didn't.Steve Carell's character was the most disappointing. The last five minutes of the movie did nothing to salvage how lame and poorly written this movie was. What a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where you sit for long times between so much as a snicker. The humor is dumb at worst and annoying at best. The actual dinner plays such a small part of this movie that it's misleading to think that is what this movie is all about. I think the script was so busy trying to flush out showing us why the idiot is such an idiot that it completely left out making it funny. I'm really afraid Steve Carrell is in the same league as Will Ferrell. He can't carry a movie and is a one-trick pony. He is better in small doses. I would not recommend this movie unless you think you can relate to the schmucks of the world. The guy behind me laughed uncontrollably and I laughed more at him laughing than anything in this movie.

		<shortDescription>A No-Holds-Barred Rip-Off of the French movie 'Dinner Game'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Copying is different from stealing. Yes, Bollywood Harrie Nahum bhai, why paresan about any Ajkal ka Indian movie is or not a rip off of a foreign movie. It by default will be so. They just sit infront of Star Movies, HBO with a pen and pad n make films here today. but nowhere even close to the frequency and the odacity that Hollywood does it with. You can only be "judged equally" as you say, if you have equal culpability. In this case that is the furthest from the truth.In addition, when Bollywood directors/producers copy movies, they do it with some level of sophistication, and not like Hollywood directors who copy it by mechanical plagiarism without any application of their mind. Hollywood copies 10 times more than Bollywood, which is sad because Bollywood comes out with 10 times more movies. 99% of Hollywood movies are either remakes, sequels, based on books, comics, video games, and now based on TV shows/cartoons. Hollywood even copies its own films.I remember my Mum asked me to watch this ages ago. I normally don't love Hollywood movies but I watched this one yesterday and I got madder and madder as the movie unfolded. I absolutely ADORE "Le diner de cons" and this was just such a blatant lift from it that I was just... I don't know what to say. I mean, you have movies like Main Aisa Hi Hoon and Koi Mil Gaya that could be argued to be remakes of Hollywood movies (Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years and The Men in Black II respectively) but Dinner for Schmucks is ridiculous. It's like they can't come up with original ideas. And every time I watch a Hollywood movie that is halfway good, I discover that it's a copy.Pathetic.This is nothing but a frame-for-frame lift of Dinner Game. Most Hollywood releases are direct lifts, but this one takes the cake. From the appearances of characters, sets to even dialogue - everything is a straight lift. There's not one shred of adaptation in the movie. Go right ahead and flame me for what I have just said, but this my honest opinion. I thought the "New Hollywood" cinema was supposed to turn a page and leave its plagiarizing past behind, but I guess I was wrong.I've watched several remakes and have also seen their originals...but I've never experienced such level of plagiarism..There is a trend that people use to hit only Asian movies (example Hollywood). I am not an Indian but a big Indian movie fan and being a Pakistani I must say that this movie rocks. Tonnes of Dirty jokes, All filth (Usualy in comic movies ppl like). This movie will remain the best in my all time favorite liftoffs. Its a must watch if u like comedies like "Angoor" "Gol Mal" "Khata Meetha" "Baton Baton main" "Kissi sey na Kehna". It is because of this, I believe that creating a copy cat movie is more difficult than an original movie. Off course making is simple but making it in a way that American audience will like it is difficult. Even in this movie 'Dinner for Schmucks' the idea that someone's wife is sleeping with other man and finding fun in this is not acceptable in American movies. But the way and the situation in this happens in the movie it makes people laugh loud. All those who are taking credit because it is copy cat movies, I am sure have not seen the other stupid movies that Hollywood has made. But off course if the story is copied from somewhere the crew should have mentioned that, but then as it is usual in American movies they have not done that. And this is something not forgivable. But again you may like to forget this while watching the movie again and again.At least I would like to forget this fact, and as long as someone is making movies like this I don't care from where the original script is coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Rudd and Steve Carell represent a new era in popular comedies to me. Movies they have starred in are on the whole intelligent, witty, and have plenty of heart. They gave me an alternative to dumb comedies... comedies starring Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey, and Mike Myers (not that I mean to completely put down all the stuff these guys have done.. they've all had their share of moments). Of course, I should have realized that when I saw the movie was going to be directed by the same guy as Meet the Parents and Austin Powers, I was going to get a movie with the same kind of humor... the humor that I enjoyed when I was 10. Steve Carrell plays an agonizingly dumb character. Unlike characters like Harry and Lloyd, however, there is nothing funny about Carrell's character. I'm a Steve Carrell fan, but he was the worst part of this movie. He delivers maybe two or three funny lines in the entire movie. I also felt I was misled by the trailers as to what this would be about. I got the impression by the trailers I had seen that this would primarily take place at the dinner and that the characters played by Jemaine Clement and Lucy Punch were two of those schmucks. Not the case. 3/4 of the movie occurs in the two days leading up to the dinner, and Jemaine and Lucy were never a part of the dinner, despite easily being qualified to be. The movie uses plenty of cheap, tired, unoriginal tricks throughout to either grab laughs or to advance the plot. There are two times when two characters are having conversations about another character, who unambiguously (yet the one talking still somehow has no clue) walks in in the middle of the conversation to hear something being said about themselves. The one bright spot of this movie was Jemaine Clement. If it wasn't for him I would have walked out of the movie. He gave me the most laughs. Let's put it this way: another movie came out last year with good actors starring in a movie that was panned by critics, Year One. This movie, while still somehow being way better with the critics, gave me about a quarter of the laughs as Year One did, and that is in no way a defense of Year One but a huge shot against Dinner for Schmucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is flawed, unfunny and poorly written almost all the way through. They deliver what could arguably be THE most annoying movie character of all-time with the Steve Carell character. Then, they proceed to have him grate on your nerves for about an hour. After that, the writers of this film apparently want you to feel sympathy for him simply because he's a human being. That didn't work for me. Paul Rudd is the straight man you identify with that has to endure the dumbest characters and moments possible but, honestly, very little of the stupidity is actually funny. I award points for the crazed stalker ex-lover but not much else in this waste of film. For some reason, I cared enough to see how the dinner turned out but for the life of me, I really don't know why.</fullReview>

There's some big comedians on supporting roles, but it really doesn't help the film. The script is just dreadful, it just doesn't work, the story is ridiculous which shouldn't be a problem for a comedy, but in this one everything is so predictable its painful. 1 star is a generous rating, avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How come the writers weren't invited to this dinner? If you ever wondered when Hollywood would scrape the bottom of the barrel in terms of remakes then believe it or not, that day has arrived. The original French version was so sublime in its high comedy and fast pace one knew it would be a hard act to follow. With two likable and talented actors like Steve Carell and Paul Rudd at the helm one hoped that the American remake wouldn't be a complete disaster. Alas, alas whatever committee was responsible for the script has destroyed every bit of wit and finesse contained in the original. What one has instead is a runaway train wreck of slapstick that congeals on the screen in an endless series of tiresome and unnecessary complications that are just too dumb to be funny. The Three Stooges at their worst are better than this movie at its best. One has to wonder at the ages of the people who wrote this script. Was it written in a locker room by a bunch of sniggering teens? A lot of talented actors are woefully wasted in this mess. Sad to say but this is just another example of the Last Airbender mentality at work: "Let's just throw more money into the project and hope something worthwhile emerges". The source material offered so much potential for a remake but the results are dire indeed. Kudos to the actors for a valiant attempt to kick some life into a rotten fish of a script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the reviews on this and I couldn't believe how many people really didn't like it. But, to each their own.1. Watch "Diner des Cons" first. It is very different humor (French), slower (French), and a lot like the remake but yet the remake took off from it - so you won't get the same thing. The "con" (idiot) is (was?) an amazing French actor and his character... excruciating to watch. In fact almost the whole movie is. But it is really art (and if you study theater... uses the "Unite' des temps" which I don't know in English - takes place in 24 hours and in "one" location) and finely crafted! And you should watch this first because to watch this after: a. you won't see the nods to the original and b. it will probably be hard to watch this version after (like reading a book after).2. You truly and absolutely don't need to watch the first to "get it". Our 12 year old and 16 year old kids loved the movie (though a very few jokes were maybe a little too sexual for the 12 year... the world today). Anyway, they laughed tons. They understood the greater meaning. We quoted the movie and laughed on the way home!3. Francis Veber is one of my favorite French directors. Maybe I'm biased then to like this remake? But also, it made me very critical and standards were quite high... I was leery of what Hollywood might do to it... and ended up pleased. I laughed a lot.4. I love Steve Carrell, Zach G, Germaine, et al. Really felt they fit and played their roles very well. I really do think it was Steve to his finest! To say this is just to make fun at the people at dinner (mean spirited), don't realize the greater theme - which I think is there. That theme is present more if you see the original first. I can be one that doesn't laugh easily but they had me and many times I didn't see the joke coming - which makes a laugh out loud situation. The character "con" might be hard to watch - but not as nearly as the French version where I almost wanted to rip out my hair - but isn't that sort of good - play with the boundary of uncomfortable...?5. It IS an "Americanized" version and "expansion" of the French... so it will different. It is funny to the American sense of humor like I laughed (chuckled) to the French sense of humor in the original. (I'm span both sides). There is a blend, I think, but it couldn't be successful here if not "americanized" in humor and culture, yet keeps the nods and such to the French. I find the blend successful. Remakes are hard - but I think this one was a success in spirit and in form.6. It's not just me who loved it. The theater - one of the "loudest" comedies I've seen. I heard belly laughs, chuckles, etc.See for yourself...... I don't know if you'll like it be we sure did.</fullReview>

So, can you imagine the surprise. The film is remarkably "unfunny" Didn't the marketing geniuses knew that we were going to find out. Were they just trying to make a killing at the box office for the opening week end? Knowing that this thing couldn't possibly have legs, presumably that was the strategy but, I think that if they had been more honest about what they were selling, the movie could have more of a chance with a knowing audience. How infuriating! I saw it at the great Arclight theaters in Hollywood, a full house with only scattered giggles every so often. I must confess I don't get Steve Carrell. A comic genius? A comic wonder? Please! When we finally get to the actual dinner, the premise gets contradicted immediately and the whole thing becomes a total confusing mess. There are a couple of good moments and Paul Rudd, that's why 4 out of 10 and not a resounding 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner much sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin my review I have to say that am a big fan of Steve Carell and loved some previous work of Jay Roach. So this movie was a must watch for me. I went in without reading any reviews and came out feeling sorry for putting myself through the movie. It had it's moments. But most of the movie felt bland. Steve does an OK job at playing the schmuck. But much of his potential as an actor is underutilized. The title itself is a misnomer as the actual dinner doesn't start till 3rd act. Much of the first two acts is spent in developing an uncomfortable bonding between the lead actors. This is where it killed the movie for me. I came to see a comedy but it felt more like a drama movie. Last act was better that first two. But it was too little too late. What worked for me : 1. "Mousterpieces" - Mice, dead or alive, never looked so cute all dressed up. Those dioramas through out the movie were great. 2. Zach Galifianakis's character takes himself so seriously that it was funny...sometimes. What didn't work: 1. Many situations that the two leads find themselves in felt forced and unoriginal. 2. Any guy could have played Paul Rudd's character. It was so underwhelming from a comedy movie point of view. 3. They tried to make it a comedy movie with a message but it took frustratingly long to get to the message and rarely felt like a comedy movie.Moviegoers beware</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, even in comedy, you need to have people that you can sort of, kind of, care about. Even if things get exaggerated, or surreal, the audience shouldn't be looking at their watches or sitting uncomfortably as the obnoxious and strange-for-its-own-sake goes across the screen. Dinner for Schmucks takes off from a French film by Frances Veber, The Dinner Game (which I saw a decade ago and only remember I enjoyed, though not enough to see more than the once in 1999), and has been updated mostly for the sake of giving some more room for locations- originally the Veber film was like a play, set in the guy's house for the dinner- and with lots of comedy actors and so on. It's also helmed by Jay Roach, which is a decent sign of things to come but never a great one (not since the first Austin Powers at least, and that was for Mike Myers comeback).It's the story of the bourgeoisie and the lower-class idiots of the world; watching the film I got the sense it was like a distant, younger relative of Luis Bunuel's style of comedy in attacking the disgusting rich and giving some absurdist praise for the lower rungs of society (think Exterminating Angel with the climax of Viridiana for you fans out there). But it lacks the kind of focus and savage wit that Bunuel had. It's kind of a soft upper-middle class saga of a man, Tim, is after a job on the "7th floor" with the other big-wigs, but has to participate in a 'dinner' where everyone brings a 'fool' to make fun of. Enter in a sudden moment of chance (by head-on collision) Barry, a weird little man who works as an IRS analyst by day and makes dioramas of mice by night.Tim has his chance, but what about his girlfriend who is disgusted with the idea and is thinking about leaving him because of it? It's around this point, when Barry shows up again at Tim's place and doesn't leave for nearly the twenty-four hours until the dinner, that the film starts to lose its comedic footing. Early on we meet a supporting character, a creepy but amusingly over-the-top "arteest" played by Jemaine Clement, who puts himself really into the work and dons horns and other apparel in his artwork, often with hot-ass girls. He's funny, if a predictable character, and one hopes the film can at least continue in this context. But what comes across at first as a kind of sweet-natured annoyance from Carrel's character just turns to... annoyance, with the occasional mice diorama.The dioramas, in fact, steal the show. They also open the film in a striking credits sequence of various mice set up in designs and clothes and backdrops to the Beatles "Fool on the Hill". It's a beautiful, absurd little number, and it barely reaches that authentic whimsy and fun again. Scene after scene, Barry keeps poking his head in Tim's business, or his business affairs (i.e. trying to sweet-talk a Swiss man to go with the money firm or whatever), and while the point is mostly clear- that annoying idiots still have hearts to and can be endearing- it's muddled by a) it not often being funny, and compounded in unfunny stature with the appearance of a stalker-of-Tim's who is even WORSE than Barry, and b) a lack of focus as the plot continues to its inevitable climax. Even supporting players that *should* be dynamite like Zach Galifinakis fall flat under the strain of over-awkward comedy.As I mentioned, Bunuel could have done wonders with this sort of material. It mixes social satire and the genuine bizarre people of the world together, and it should be funnier. Should being the operating word; sometimes it IS quite funny, mostly due to Clement or the occasional aside from Rudd or Carrel. But the climax is overstuffed with predictability and snide commentary. Somehow director Roach sees a lot of this as believable in its situation to situation, but it isn't. Why would Tim go so far with this guy? There's an underlying nastiness to the movie too, and it's sometimes hard to pinpoint until one sees it, and it's in the guise of a sweet-but-bizarre comedy of manners. Again, the mice- especially mouse Vincent Van Gogh and Ben Franklin- steal the show. I would just turn it on for those scenes, or maybe some of Clement's scene-stealers. It's mostly a disappointment of tone and obnoxious tendencies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a copy of a 1998 Hindi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am amazed at the reception this movie gets. All you need to do is watch the Hindi movie Le Diner De Cons (Or Dinner Game) to understand why I have given this a rating of 2. It simply is a frame-for-frame copy. I haven't seen plagiarism so blatant in a Hollywood movie.Even simple scenes like showing the doctor the bathroom, the dogs in the car, reference to phrases like 'the last supper' are straight lifts. All Jay Roach and his team has done is to hire translators instead of screenplay writers.Welcome Jay Roach to the ever-burgeoning group of 'inspired' directors, whose poster-boy is Mr Sanjay Gupta(Oldb..and reservoir...ahem..Zinda and Kaante fame) Dinner for Schmodd is a direct frame-by-frame copy of 'The Dinner Game', a rib-tickling Hindi comedy by Francis Veber When will filmmakers start giving credit to the original movie makers? Its one thing to use a story as a framework and foundation, but here even the screenplay is copied. The sad part is people who haven't seen 'the Dinner game' hail this movie. Shame on the director and producer of 'Dinner for Schmuck' for not acknowledging the source of this movie.Dinner for Schmods beats everything what people like Steve Carell and Paul Rudd have done before. However, watch the Hindi movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be a Horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is made out to be a hilarious comedy. Actually 95% of the movie doesn't take place at the dinner, just the terrible events beforehand. The movie makes you cringe and incredibly uncomfortable. Paul Rudd has a nice job, hot wife, nice apartment, and a promotion awaiting. Then Steve Carell enters Paul's life. Every event that could go wrong goes wrong in the worst way. In Paul's adventure of just being around Steve, he gets audited, breaks up with his fiancé, contacts his stalker, get his apartment ruined, and then loses his promotion and job. This all takes place in the first 2 hours. In those two hours you only stay in the theater is seeing the "happy" ending. Made me laugh a few times but in the end I left the theater depressed. Save your money and time and go see the next comedy that comes out. Hopefully that movie will actually make you laugh and not want to hang yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is it Called Dinner for Schmucks?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let it be known that without Paul Rudd this movie would be one or if not the worst movie Steve Carell ever agreed to act in. Second, it is entirely too slow in the beginning leading all up to a dinner scene that is less than 15 minutes. So I just sat through a near two hour movie to laugh a mere once or twice. Zack Galifianakis is a good addition, with his character being one of the more entertaining. Don't get me wrong it is a funny, unique story of a guy struggling to make something of himself in the business world, but they could have done so much more with the movie itself. It is worth seeing, but not so sure if its worth the admission these days especially if you are on a date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually never rate a movie this bad because I give up watching it before it gets this bad. This time I could not escape because it was playing on a bus I was on.This is a (rather poor) rip off of the delightful &amp; funny, but not much known, Bollywood movie "Bhejafry". While the mentioned Bollywood movie was awesome because it built on an exaggeration of certain peculiar personalities that are actually found in India; but in a shoddy attempt to copy the movie - the Hollywood directors either didn't attempt to figure why the movie was so hilarious or didn't care - and proceeded to poorly copy a lot of the plot without understanding the cultural nuances that made the original movie funny.Result: Weird characters that bear no close resemblance to anyone either in India or in the US and this not relate-able; are not particularly funny - but extremely annoying.Do yourself a favor and skip this non sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Be a Schmuck! Run, Don't Walk, to See This Hilarious Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw "Dinner For Schmucks" today, the audience was jam-packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Box office champion Steve Carrell and his regular second banana, Paul Rudd, along with high-concept comedy director and raunch maestro Jay Roach, combine their trademark sarcastic humor with underlying sensitivity and deep character study, and the result is a crowdpleasing winner.We take innocent but ambitious career-minded stockbroker Tim Conrad (Rudd)who, during a business meeting, sees one colleague fired for losing money in a stock gamble, and he wants to take his place. His boss Lance Fender (a conniving Bruce Greenwood) lets him on the deal, but on one condition: he must attend his dinner and find himself a willing guest who is so perfectly stupid. He refuses to let his sensible regular companion Julie (Stephanie Szostak) know about this, and this all leads to an on-again off-again relationship. Then Julie hooks up with a strange art curator named Kieran (Jermaine Clement), who likes to paint humans with animals hanging off of their bodies.Enter Barry Speck (Carell), a dumbed-out IRS employee with glasses and an overbite who has a fetish for dead mice and dresses them up in costumes or his landscapes. The landscapes with the mice reveal Barry's passages in life. Tim accidentally hits him with his car as Barry is about to pick up a dead mouse. Tim takes him and he and Barry develop a love-hate relationship as the unthinking Barry gets Tim into escapes with a blonde SNM stalker named Darla (the appropriately named Lucy Punch. Yes, that's her real name) and fellow IRS employee Thurman (Zach Galifianakis), who wants to rival Barry with his idiotic mind control tactics. Barry and Thurman hate each other so much and Barry's wife left him for Thurman. Also essential to the cast are David Walliams as a Swiss stock client of Tim's and the beautiful big blue-eyed Lucy Davenport as his exotic wife, who in one funny scene, coax Tim into marrying Darla when Julie was unavailable.Now get to the climactic dinner scene. All the characters and elements build up to the hilarious dinner in a huge mansion where chaos and laughs reign. The humor is funny but the slapstick really is the best at that climax. In the end, Barry gets the top prize against Thurman who wants to outdumb him. All works out everyone predictably in the end.The best thing about this movie is where the characters appear comfortable with themselves. Barry is content with his idiocy. Tim may be a social climber, but he is good hearted in his personal relationships with Barry and Julie. The rest of the cast play cold-blooded types for good measure, but in the end, all the good guys win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and Zach Gafolikalisias (you try spelling that). On paper, it seems like a comic dream team. But when it comes into real life, it doesn't quite lie up to your hype. Don't get me wrong, Zach in his two scenes is hilarious and Steve Carell, no joke, deserves an Oscar nominee for his performance, but Rudd, without his raunchy humor, falls flat, and the rest of the supporting cast doesn't provide enough laughs or support, and the plot is practicable. All the plot unfolds and the climax is met before dinner even happens. And some parts are either sick or just wrong. Bottom line, to all the people who say this offensive or stupid, calm down. Its meant to be funny. And to all the people who said that this is the funniest movie of all time.. well you have bigger problems. So if you're a fan of the actors, like I am, see the movie, its worth price of admission. If your not a big fan of Carell (once again, brilliant), Zach, or especially Rudd, rent it in 4.5 months.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you laugh at idiots? Don't worry, you don't have to answer that question. Most people get a few laughs out of others, so no one will hold it against you. Dinner for Schmucks is full of low brow humor , but that should be a given, considering the title of the film.Tim (Paul Rudd) is an analyst looking to move up in his financial company. In order to make the cut, he has to fit in with other executives such as Caldwell (Ron Livingston) and Williams (Larry Wilmore). The head of their financial firm, Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) hosts a weekly dinner where each of the executives is to bring a special guest. The guests compete for the prize of biggest idiot, but assume they are unaware of they are on display for humiliation. Tim informs his girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) of his possible promotion and the dinner, however she is appalled that Tim would go participate in the event. Tim decides against going and phones his assistant Susana (Kristen Schaal) to cancel for him. Then he runs into IRS agent Barry (Steve Carell) who bowls Tim over with his unique idiocy and Tim realizes that fate must have intervened. The rest of the film takes the audience through the lives that Tim and Julie have created, and how attending this dinner for schmucks jeopardizes everything.The cast for the film is absolutely hilarious. If you're looking for a funny movie, full of low brow humor, you'll get exactly what you paid for. If you're expecting a high brow comedy, save your cash, because that is the very last thing you will find here. The film is full of slap stick, dirty, raunchy and at times downright ignorant humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie for Schmucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Dinner for Schmucks Paul Rudd is Tim, a man ready to seize an opportunity. The firm he works at as an analyst has a newly vacant office on the highly regarded 7th floor. Tim proposes a scheme to land a lucrative client and the boss approves, but before he can gain access to his new office Tim must first bring a guest to dinner. They call it "The Dinner for Winners", but the truth is it's a competition to please the boss by bringing in tow the biggest idiot of the show. Fortunate for Tim he literally ran into Barry (Steve Carrell), a tax collector who dabbles in constructing dioramas for deceased mice. Despite his girlfriend's disapproval, Tim invites Barry to the party and soon discovers that this escapade may be more than he can handle.I can think of numerous strikes that derail this lamebrain comedy. To start the hate spree I have to say that Steve Carrell is not the comedian for the job. I've seen him in top form in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and The Daily Show, even a strong showing earlier this year in Date Night. In each of these he played a distinctly different character but none of them as talkatively annoying as Barry. Brick Tamland is almost certainly dumber, but the delivery for that character had a charming naive quality. Barry is more along the lines of Harry and Lloyd's dumbest friend?brash, aggravating, and difficult to believe.For a movie with a sense of reality to it, there are just too many impossibly stupid characters. Darla (Lucy Punch) is Tim's stalker. Her inspiration for scary comes from Lady Gaga. Jemaine Clement plays an artist who spouts all the typical spiritual baloney seen only in a sitcom guest appearance.If a strong title describes the movie it's trying to promote, then Dinner for Schmucks is as weak as Uri Geller's spoons. I would assume we would be spending a great deal of time at a dinner setting. That's not the most original activity for a film but it isn't recycled as often as the road trip across America either. In actuality there is more time spent talking about the dinner taking place the next day than there is both traveling towards or eating at the title location.Director Jay Roach has burst some sides with the Austin Powers trilogy and Meet the Parents. Unfortunately there is a lack of inspiration in this go around. Everything from the music to the camera work screams par without an effort for more. There isn't a standout moment and I'm uncertain how much of this pertains to the fact that Dinner for Schmucks is a remake of a 1998 French film. In 12 years a lot can become cliché.There is a blatant moral to the tale clearly telling us to treat others with respect and the route taken to get there is as obvious as a stoplight. A comedy featuring grown men, which deals with business and relationships, doesn't sound like the appropriate venue for a message this elementary. This is a lesson children learn from Sesame Street, and I doubt adults need the refresher. *?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS (2010) ***1/2 Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Zach Galifianakis, Jemaine Clement, Stephanie Szotstak, Lucy Punch, Bruce Greenwood, David Walliams, Ron Livingston, Larry Wilmore, Kristen Schaal, PJ Byrne, Andrea Savage, Lucy Davenport, Chris O'Dowd, Jeff Dunham, Octavia Spencer, Rick Overton, Patrick Fischler. Hysterically funny high concept comedy ? loosely based on the popular French farce "Le Diner de Cons" ? with nice guy corporate ladder climber Rudd finding himself invited to the titular soiree ? which involves the invitee to bring along the most ridiculous loser they can find to humiliate (enter doofus Carell having a field day and milking some pathos with the pathetic). What comes across as a hyper blend of Apatow heartwarming gross out comedy with Farrelly Brothers' instincts and an undercoating of bilious Neil LaBute, the film runs on all comedy cylinders with no holds-barred with some truly hilarious bits (namely Rudd attempting to coerce his fiancée Szotstak away from pompous ass 'artist' Clement who nearly steals the movie) and a few genuine sequences of emotional breakdowns (namely Carell's nemesis IRS colleague Galifianakis and his 'hypnotic mind puppetery'!) Love the meticulous 'mousterpieces' that Carell turns into art (dioramas of taxidermied mice!) (Dir: Jay Roach)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I fully expected this to be an all-out raunch-com in the vein of "The Hangover", and I was absolutely mistaken. The film only slips into slapstick and physical punchlines at the lowest part of the actual dinner. The rest of the movie is pretty basic and set near real life.Often, real life situations bring the most humor. Sadly, that's not the case here. Most of this one is just plain boring. There are some very talented people associated with this one and they all do a fine job. It's just that the pieces don't make up a whole. The film basically rides on the shoulders of the talented Steve Carell as Barry. Barry is a genuinely nice guy whose wife left him for his boss (Zach Galfianakis), and his hobby is making intricate displays of dressed up dead mice ... his "mouseterpieces", he calls them.Paul Rudd plays Tim, another genuinely nice trying very hard to make it in the business world. He has the right car and a great apartment and a beautiful girlfriend (Stephanie Szostack) who doesn't think it's time for them to be married. Tim seizes an opportunity at work to go for a promotion. This gets him invited to his boss's monthly dinner party where all the managers bring a guest with extraordinary skills ... the schmucks of the title. The point is to have a good laugh at the expense of the idiots. Obviously Tim runs into Barry and guest list is complete.Tim explains to his girlfriend that there is a "me you don't know" who has to do things in order to get ahead at work. I really wanted to see more of THAT guy! Instead, we are subjected to another film that just doesn't know how to take advantage of Paul Rudd's talent. He is a funny guy and you would never know it here.If not for Steve Carell and an outlandish performance by Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as an "artist", this film would be totally flat. Instead, there are a few laughs and an underlying theme about the sweetness of some people. It tries to ask the question, who are the real schmucks? Director Jay Roach is responsible for the Austin Powers and the Meet the Parents franchises. He obviously knows humor. He takes this one from a French film directed by Francis Veber called "The Dinner Game". In that film, we never actually get to the dinner. In this one, the film sinks to its lowest point during the dinner. Lesson learned. Best part? Hearing the Beatles during the opening and closing credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie thinking it would be a bizarre farce, but it turned out to be so much more.While I laughed often during this film, I was shocked by the subtle empathy Steve Carell was able to bring to his character. I find it strange to be characterizing Carell's performance as subtle in a film that has "Schmucks" in the title, but that's what it was. While films like "Grown Ups" bash the viewer over the head with their (sort of) comedy, Carell is much more subtle than that in this film. His character ends up being utterly endearing by film's end.I also have to comment on director Jay Roach for bringing out this performance in Carell. Never before during the watching of a film did I find myself laughing and crying at the same time, and that is due to the masterful touches imparted by Roach and Carell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, lots of mixed reviews on this thing so far. Well, I'm going to throw in my two cents worth because I saw the French version (Le Diner des Cons) a few years ago and therefore had a reference point in mind when I saw Dinner for Schmucks. If you think the businessmen in Dinner are mean, please see the French version--I would not have given it as high a vote precisely because the meanness in that one reaches depths I don't appreciate at all. Also, the French movie is not even close to being as funny as Dinner is. I've never liked slapstick or very physical humor much and, even though there's a little of it in Dinner, I enjoyed the movie very much. I don't know about these reviewers who say there's a chuckle here or there--my family lives in a very conservative community that, for the most part, has little sense of humor--everyone in the theater when we saw the movie absolutely ROARED with laughter too many times to keep count. Some people nearly lost their breath. Lots of coughing.Hmm. I guess everyone has to judge for him- or herself.

		<shortDescription>Though an unambitious, boilerplate comedy, it's packed with laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's remarkable how quickly the new comedy Dinner for Schmucks disappears from your brain. I can recall laughing my way through the vast majority of the film--mostly soft laughs, but there were more than a few big, hearty laughs from deep down in the diaphragm. (One might more economically call such a laugh a "guffaw," but guffaw is such a silly word I refuse to acknowledge I might ever participate in one.)Despite the inarguable fact that I was entertained throughout the entirety of Dinner for Schmucks -- a film that never actually uses the word "schmuck," but we'll get to that -- I can't deny feeling rather empty while considering it a little more than a day later. I think this must be why many reviewers are giving the flick fairly lukewarm marks, though they had to be laughing their respective asses off on occasion just as I was.There are lots of reasons not to respect the movie. There's the fact that it's reportedly a fairly pale "reimagination" of a French film, Francis Veber's Le dîner de cons (The Dinner Game). (I haven't seen the original, so I can't compare.) The screenplay is inarguably mediocre. Some of the characters, especially those at the eventual dinner, are lazily imagined. And it's disappointing to see Paul Rudd, who's capable of much more interesting, brilliantly caustic characters (in Wet Hot American Summer and Anchorman, for starters) relegated to playing yet another purely-reactive straight man.And yet... Dinner for Schmucks is funny. Very funny. Occasionally laugh- out-loud funny. It's like a frozen Snickers bite-size bar when you're having a chocolate craving: Incredibly satisfying for about five minutes... after which, you'll forget all about it.Yet I can't help wanting to recommend Schmucks, and dammit, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Because for the ninety minutes you're in the theater, it is a lot of fun. It's a much better date night film than, say, the relentlessly mediocre Date Night.Those two films don't just share a star in Steve Carell. They also share a philosophy: Take a half-interesting situation, flesh it out a bit with half-written characters and a half-written screenplay, and let the stars make it sing. Date Night was only moderately tolerable because it had Carell and the always-entertaining Tina Fey as its leads. With Carell and Rudd joined by a far more interesting supporting cast (and a much sharper director), Schmucks is like Date Night done right.Carell and Rudd are consummate comedic pros with perfect chemistry together. You can't help but figure working together in Anchorman and The 40-Year-Old Virgin played a role there. With the expert guidance of director Jay Roach (helmer of the Austin Powers and Meet the Parents/Fockers series), they mine every possible laugh out of every line, every expression, every reaction shot.That's especially impressive because neither actor is working with a particularly well-crafted role here. Barry (Carell) is an amalgam of all sorts of odd eccentricities and levels of confusion, though his meticulous talent at turning dead mice into works of art suggests he's some sort of idiot savant. As many a commercial has already informed you, he gets invited to a very different sort of social dinner by Tim, a finance executive desperate to impress his bosses.Tim is virtually indistinguishable from the other "straight men" Rudd has played in recent comedies. Only the goofball buddy and the gorgeous girlfriend change. In Role Models, Rudd suffers through Seann William Scott's crazy schemes, which threaten his relationship with Elizabeth Banks. In I Love You, Man, Rudd's new "bromance" with Jason Segal threatens his engagement to Rashida Jones. And in Schmucks, Rudd's dinner plans with Carell threaten to derail his planned engagement to fresh face Stephanie Szostak.Schmucks ramps up the funny thanks to Roach's direction and some extremely well-chosen supporting players. It's very strange that Zach Galifianakis' name doesn't even appear on the Schmucks poster, especially given how hot he is following The Hangover and how heavily he's featured in the commercials. Though he appears in what amounts to only two scenes, the actor hijacks the film wholesale, and not in the wild, over-the-top sort of cameo you might expect from, say, a Will Ferrell or Ben Stiller.Following suit, albeit with much more screen time, is Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement, who does do the over-the-top thing as avant garde artist Kieran, and it's perfectly brilliant. (One can easily foresee a Get Him to the Greek-type spin off for the character.) Every time Schmucks threatens to stall, it wisely finds a way to weave Kieran back into the proceedings.The longest period in which we don't see Kieran is also Schmucks' weakest stretch, the actual dinner itself. The French original apparently never included the actual dinner, and maybe that was a good move. The boss who puts on the dinner actually considers it a "dinner for idiots" -- the word "schmucks" is never used, and one figures that term came from some studio exec worried about the word "idiot."Barry's fellow idiots at the dinner aren't particularly funny, and this is where the film goes for some fairly broad laughs that are only fitfully amusing. In fact, the best part of the dinner is when Barry gets to show off some of his "mousterpieces," a segment that's more than a little touching.Despite such faults, Schmucks plays it smart most of the time. It's sad that Office Space's Ron Livingston doesn't have much to do as Tim's nemesis, but two Daily Show personalities, Larry Wilmore and Kristen Schaal (also of Conchords), are pitch-perfect in small roles.On the whole, Schmucks isn't one of the decade's great comedies. But if you're satisfied with laughing for 90 minutes, and enjoying talented actors rise (well) above their material, it's definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rough start, but Dinner for Schmuck's fortunately gets better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sometimes I think you think I'm an idiot."There's no denying that in some ways, Dinner for Schmucks is a disappointment. There are sky high expectations (at least, from me), whenever Steve Carell and Paul Rudd team up, as they are two of the funniest actors working today. Anything the two of them collaborate on should be amazing, and sadly, Dinner for Schmucks falls short of that mark.The first of&nbsp;main two problems was that Carell's character (the primary schmuck referenced in the title) is so idiotic, insufferable, and unlikeable, that it throws much of the movie off. He's like a walking disaster from the second Paul Rudd's character meets him, until almost right up until the end. Imagine Carell's character from The Office, only 5 times stupider, 10 times more annoying, and with no real redeeming qualities. Towards the end of the film, there's an attempt to make the character more sympathetic and likable, but by then I was so thoroughly sick of him that it was almost too late.&nbsp;The second problem I had with Dinner for Schmucks is that so many of the jokes, especially in the early part of the movie, were complete and utter misses. It's like the writers were just throwing out every gag they could think of to see if any of it would stick. Fortunately, there were some really hilarious parts, as well, and a lot of them were thanks to the outstanding supporting cast. Especially Zach Galifiankis and Lucy Punch, who completely stole the movie every time they were on-screen. Eventually, Carell and Rudd got some better material to work with, too, making the last two-thirds of the movie a much funnier experience.Dinner for Schmucks started off as a pretty mediocre comedy, but it slowly picked up steam until I was reasonably pleased with it, by the end. It's no 40 Year-Old Virgin or Anchorman, but it's worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will stay with you for a long time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found "Dinner For Schmucks" to be quite enjoyable. Why, you ask? Well, the story was quite catching and good, it is the kind of story that grows on you and stays with you for a long time. You have the corporate man wanting to climb the rank ladder (played by Paul Rudd) and the innocent, ignorant ordinary man (played by Steve Carell), coming together and two complete opposite worlds collide.Paul Rudd was quite good in the role of Tim, playing the rules dealt by the corporate ladder, rules that doesn't really sit well with his person, but it takes the interference with someone from another world to make him come to terms with this. And Steve Carell was so amazingly cast for the lovable role as the somewhat slow and gullible Barry who sees the world differently that most others do.But the supporting cast was quite impressive as well, with names like Zach Galifianakis, Bruce Greenwood, and Ron Livingston on the list as well.I loved the way that the movie told the story, and it was really such a great story. I think lots of people could actually see parts of themselves in the Tim character, and I bet most people do not want to admit to having something of Barry to their personality. But those who fully admit to whom they are and are proud of whom they are, are the ones truly happy. And the story told in "Dinner For Schmucks" really paints this in a good way.And the whole thing that Barry had going on with the mice, wow. That was beautiful on many levels, especially when you find out why this is his hobby.Honestly, I was really surprised at how much this movie entertained me. It had comedy in good amounts, and I especially loved the brunch scene, I was laughing so hard at that point. And the movie also deals with love and romantic screw-ups in a very good way, and it comes out on the screen so well.This is a movie well worth sitting down to watch, be it by yourself, with your friends, with family, or with a loved one. There is something for everyone in this movie. And anyone who will not find the story touching in even the slightest way, should perhaps take some things in his or her life up to re-evaluation. This movie took me by storm, let it do the same to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not as much of a Steve Carell fan (nor as much of a fan as comedies in general) as my husband, so he had to talk me into seeing this. I wasn't too hopeful, due to all the bad reviews here. But I'm glad I went. I laughed through most of the movie, sometimes to the point of tears. My husband did, too. A few things that were too over the top, but you could tell from the get go the tone is slapstick, and I was happy to roll with that through most of the film. The talented cast had great comedic timing. The characters were not believable, but some of them were endearing. We attended a matinée on a Saturday, not opening week, so there were few people in the theater--which is normal for that situation in our theater--but the few people who were there, laughed as much as we did. Perhaps some of them had already seen it once, and liked it enough to come back. Two elderly women with a great sense of humor joked that we'd taken their usual seats, so I was having fun before the movie even started. Maybe Dinner for Schmucks will become some kind of cult classic, since those people who do like it seem to like it very much. Perhaps when Comedy Central gets hold of it they'll show it night and day, and the movie will find it's true audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe all the bad-hype written about this movie!&nbsp;First of all, I'm not a fan of Steve Carrell, so I went to see this movie with some hesitation, but boy! I was already laughing before even the opening titles finished rolling!&nbsp;True: this movie is not for everyone, specially if you have to/like to over analyze ALL movies.... this one is not one to do that to. All I can say, without spoiling this moving for anyone, is that you WILL cringe at times. And yes, you WILL scratch your head and wonder how someone (Carrell's character) can be that naive or innocent (I actually never saw him as stupid or an idiot). The truth of the matter is that, indeed, there are well- intentioned people out there who are so genuine and gullible and nice, that for the normal-sarcastic personality-types, great people like this are an insult to their intellect. And for what I can tell from other people's reviews in here, they find them and their predicaments offensive and boring. At the end, there are great and FUNNY lessons to be found in this film if one allows it!&nbsp;The only thing I will agree with other people's reviews in here is that towards the middle of the movie things do-drag abit, but that's because from the start of the movie to this point, every possible thing that could go wrong to Paul Rudd's character GOES WRONG because of Carrell, which is hard to watch even though is all-funny. BUT, through some very unexpected turn of events that we learn through the length of the movie, by the time the actual dinner takes place, the movie just rolls like a non-stopping laugh-outloud ride that will have you grasping for air while taking all the 'exceptional' action going on in the screen!While I'm still not a huge fan of Carrell, he did-do a fantastic job at playing 'Barry' in a very respectable-funny way for this movie. Rudd and everyone else of the cast (and I mean really EVERYONE), also do a fantastic job at their roles. My special mention goes to Jeremain from FOTC for almost stealing this movie!At the end of the movie, I would say that 50% of the public were not happy with it and tried to leave the theater as soon as the lights went on, while the other 50% (me included), were trying to clear the tears in their eyes from laughing so much (wait after the closings titles start rolling because there's more!)Anyhow..... open your heart at 'Dinner for Smucks'! It really is a funny-fantastic film if you check your sarcastic, self-righteous ego at the door!&nbsp;&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do the math. Almost everyone who rated it 1-2 stars is a non-American (or self-absorbed film critic) who saw one of the originals that apparently spawned this film and they treat this one like a villain because of it. Yet, most Americans or those who didn't see the original give it at least 4-5 stars even if they didn't like it. Among the more moderate dislikes I also notice a couple common biases. Many dislike the grouchy girlfriend and several more dislike the stupidity of Carell's character. Sounds to me like many nay-sayers bring their own baggage to their bias, to one extreme or the other. What were you expecting? The film is "Dinner for Schmuks" not "Dinner for Sophisticates and Sycophants." The latter were the antagonists of the film. The plot was Rudd's character realizing that, standing up to them, and befriending a social misfit. The concept and players are not all that different from Napoleon Dynamite; another film people trashed without "getting it" yet appreciated more with each viewing. I saw one reviewer say they disliked this film at first and liked it more with each viewing. That's not typical for even a lot of popular films. Most films grow tiresome over time.Bias is natural, but in this case it's largely unfair and unwarranted. On one hand, the pseudo-intellects think this film is dumbed down because they saw a similar film with a more artistic take. Boo-hoo! So give that film 10 stars and be reasonable with a 5, 6, or 7 for this one. I think it borrowed a little from The Party; a late-60s comedy about a dinner party. Should I hate the French or Indian films as ripoffs of that film since it pre-dated them? And of all the truly awful films out there, this is at the bottom? What is your scale? It's just my method, but I consider major criteria for films such as acting, script, music, etc. I may knock a star for every aspect that fails, or maybe a full star for 2-3 minor flaws. My bias plays into it too, but I try to grade on film merits without my bias taking the whole rating. There's a reason there are 10 stars to choose; it's not a black and white, like or dislike, thumbs-up or thumbs down rating scale. Do 1-star raters suggest this film fails at every element of film making? To me, 4-star means it is worse than half of the films ever made, since 5-6 should mean an "average" film. 1-star says to me it fails at every aspect of film making and gets a star merely because it's a film - it made production. I've rated very few films below 5 or 6. Most are average or better. If it's that bad, I hope I know better than to see it. Just food for thought.Meanwhile, the other extreme of dislikes seems to have expected a more straight-forward, raunchy comedy like Dumb and Dumber or Austin Powers (I like those btw; not knocking them) or something less silly like a typical rom-com. Instead, it was something in between: a basic comedy with an absurd premise and a very moderate amount of adult humor. It requires a bit more analyzing than most comedies, a bit of an unexpected gut check, and an open mind about the intentions of the film. Was it any more unrealistic than Ferris Bueller? More silly than the original Pink Panthers? More absurd than any Will Ferrell comedy? Check those ratings and rethink your perspective.Among today's films this is easily above average and definitely worth seeing. It certainly warrants a better IMDb rating than it has received so far. It's not amazing, but what in the world were the nay-sayers expecting? Script, premise and originality are the weakest aspects, yet they are adequate. At times the script is even quite clever. Acting is at least average if not better. Story and plot are good. The music is very good. Cinematography is even great for a comedy, especially in the scenes with the mice dioramas. And for those knocking the expectations of the cast: there are 4-5 notable film comedians in the cast. David Williams is the most authentic comedian and most Americans wouldn't even know who he is. He and Steve Carell fulfilled my expectations. Rudd is hardly a legit comedic actor as he has done as many non-comedies and often plays a straight-man. And Galifinakis and Clement have limited roles. Where is the comedic let-down? Take the film for what it is. It's about the relationship between Rudd's and Carell's characters, and what Rudd's character learns and appreciates in the process. Comedy is literally a secondary genre. I agree that it was advertised poorly.Finally, I was surprised how much human element is in the film. Very touching at times. (Reminds me of John Hughes films how you can be laughing one moment, brought to deep introspection a moment later, then laughing soon again.) Admittedly, the film goes flat at times, but only for brief periods and it ends reasonably well. I didn't like the Darla character. She detracted from the story and the annoying grouchy aspect of the girlfriend came directly from that. Plus the girlfriend was a mediocre actress and her character may have been improved by reworking the involvement of the Darla character. Nevertheless, if you watch it with an open mind and reserve the expectations a bit, I think most will be pleasantly surprised. In fact, I was apprehensions about seeing it, and never saw it in theatres. I reluctantly rented it when there was nothing else to rent and was glad I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the things that continue to surprise me about the comic genius of Steve Carell (who won me over indefinitely with his signature turn in "The 40-Year Old Virgin"), the biggest is the fact that his pervasive presence in cinema has not become a source of burned-out annoyance. Unlike Jim Carrey, who held a nation captive with his rubbery contortions and crude humor, Carell can play dramatic angles as shrewdly as sharply funny punchlines. His versatility is given a workout in "Dinner for Schmucks" (ported over from a French short), wherein he plays Barry, an overly literal-minded buffoon whose hobby is stuffing dead mice and transplanting them into serenely artistic dioramas. When he steps into traffic to save a specimen one day, he is hit by Tim (Paul Rudd), a middle-management type looking to climb the executive ladder; his superiors have tasked him with bringing an "eccentric" to a dinner designed to mock those with unique or unusual talents, the "winner" providing entry to a more powerful position. Seizing upon this opportunity against the protestations of his girlfriend, Barry becomes a disastrous drag on Tim's life for 48 hours, leading to many hilarious moments (ranging from bull-in-china-shop slapstick to inspired dialog exchanges). A veteran of the ripe-to-rancid "Austin Powers" franchise, director Jay Roach and his writers do an expert job of juxtaposing humor with a genuine empathy for the central characters -- more than mere grist for the comedic mill, Carell strikes genuinely touching dramatic notes, especially when we wonder just how the titular event is going to play without feeling hypocritical and manipulative (it helps that Rudd makes a similarly capable foil to both the humor and humanity). Aside from a running time that feels long by 20 minutes, "Dinner for Schmucks" is a date worth keeping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I must include I have never seen the original french movie that this movie was inspired by so there will be no comparison.This movie was hilarious, but its a comedy so you have to be open minded. Steve Carell's character Barry has been played in a similar way in both Anchorman and The Office but i find him so much more fit for this part. Himself and Zach Galifanakis are so fit for there roles but strangely i found Paul Rudd to be lacking and unfunny in this film much to contradict his characters in movies such as Role Models and Knocked Up.Needless to say, stay open-minded and control your expectations because Dinner For Schmucks is a great summer comedy that had me laughing through-out. It contains many one-liners and quotes that I am sure will be used in the future. Just remember its a memorable comedy but comedy isn't exactly the best genre for outstanding movies. This just exceeded my expectations by a small amount. I give it a rough 8/10 for it's memorability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the announcement of Steve Carrell's final season at The Office, I'm sure most of his fans are wondering what is next.Dinner For Schumucks is crude in its own way. Knowing the way these kinds of movies play out, the producers will often push the envelope out into the open several times just to get the laughs going. The general audiences will feel shocked by this, but yet in this day in age, acceptable for people who have no taste for movies what-so-ever and are sick enough to want to see this kind of crap.As far as the storyline goes, this is something you've seen before. The characters are put under pressure to the limit that they sometimes snap. People who write comedies now-a-days know this is a format that can be used to cram in as many jokes as possible seeing that nothing is sacred. Steve Carrell, in this case is a walking time bomb ready to go off any minute.So far on the review board, there hasn't been much praise for this film considering it's only been out for a week. However, if you really want to see this movie, you must disregard everything negative about it as described in the before.In my honest opinion, many of the most underrated movies on IMDb for Yahoo are usually quite good. I never listen to critics.This movie has a good chance at possibly becoming the summer 2010 sleeper that may come out in the rankings for best comedies of this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From The Office to Anchorman, Steve Carrell has proved time and time again that he plays stupid &amp; unaware really well, and with Dinenr For Schmucks, he gets to prove that again. Carrell plays Barry, a dumb and unaware, hence my previous statement man who decorates art with dead mice. Paul Rudd is Tim, a businessman who must bring an idiot to a dinner to get a very large promotion. Low and behold, Tim hits Barry with his car. Carrell &amp; Rudd have nice chemistry and are very funny both together and separately. That said, the real star here is Jermaine Clement as Kieran, an edgy artist whom Tim's girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) works for. Kieran is edgy, which is what makes him funny, you never know what he's gonna say or, in that case, do next. That's a similarity to the character of Barry. Although Barry is stupid, he's not 100% stupid, and therefore you never know how Barry's gonna screw someone's life accidentally, or on purpose. Zach Galifianakis, who was hilarious in The Hangover shows up here as Barry's mind controlling co worker Thermal, and he once again proves that he's one of the funniest men working in film today. Overall, Dinner For Schmucks is a hilarious and hilariously fun time at the movies, and you should go out and see it if you just feel like laughing.</fullReview>

It's ridiculous in real life but thats why its not. It's fake, sorry to tell you, but that's why you can just sit back and enjoy it. And Steve Carrell's character Barry is irritating? Wow detective, thanks for pointing that out. That's the whole idea, he's irritating and crazy so you sympathize with Paul Rudd's character and when Rudd comes around on Barry's side you do too!

My wife and I were already feeling a little giddy having departed from a friend's birthday party. The slapstick humor, complete ineptitude of Carell's character Barry, and plain silliness of the whole thing simply continued our night. As poor Rudd's character goes through more and more cringe-worthy moments, you still end up appreciating what Barry is trying to do. The film ends up being sort of a wild ride, believe it or not. We laughed a lot.The final scene at the dinner reminded me of the CIA summary at the end of "Burn After Reading". After all the craziness that went before, it was the perfect ending. I think the company I was with and the mood I was in definitely helped me enjoy the film.

I found myself laughing hard at most jokes. Overall this was a very funny film it was no "Godfather" but it was a hysterical movie. The strongest part of the movie to me was the plot. The plot was so good, that at one point the entire theater gasped and went "ooooooooooooooooooooooo" over...well I don't want to spoil anything but it had to do with one of the main characters and his relationship with his girlfriend. THAT'S HOW GOOD THE PLOT WAS! Steve Carrell was perfect. I'm so glad he's leaving "The Office" yes, it's an okay show but we've seen enough of him playing an annoying boss who we never get to understand as a character or anything. Anyway Dinner for Shmucks was a good movie at times (hardly) it slacked off a bit but i'm going to have to give it a low "FULL PRICE!" If you want a good laugh at the movies, see Grown Ups but if you don't like Adam Sandler, see Dinner for Shmucks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard it been said that comedy is just non sequiturs. Clearly, that's all the writers of "Dinner for Schmucks" think about comedy as well.The movie appears to have been made for the sole purpose of laughing at one-liners and non sequiturs. And yes, I did laugh, but where was the wit, or smart humour, or multi-layered jokes? I was expecting more, but they didn't give me more. Well, let me rephrase that, I was expecting more intelligence to the comedy, but all they gave me that was extra was a romantic comedy story-line. With great leads like Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, they could have, and should have, gone more off-road.If you're just looking for a mindless comedy, then "Dinner for Schmucks" certainly fits the bill. As far as mindless comedies go, it's actually a pretty decent one. It is funny and you will laugh, a lot. I was just hoping that it was time that comedies would go further and give us more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks accomplishes something most comedies can't do often. It is consistently funny from start to finish, and it's able to do it with out ruining all of the best parts in the commercials. The plot isn't very substantial and I haven't seen the French film, from which it is based, but the movie was funny enough for me to enjoy it thoroughly with out being bothered by the numerous clichés in it. What makes the film as good as it is, is due in large part to the actors. Paul Rudd does a good job as the central character, practically playing the same person as he did in I Love You Man, but he gets the job done. And Steve Carrell does a great job playing an excellent moron, who delivers his lines perfectly, which is important because many of the laughs in the film come from Carrell's funny dialogue. Also Jermaine Clement finally found a film that suits his comedy, unlike Gentlemen Broncos which completely wasted him. Galifinakis is good as well, but they didn't seem to give him the free rein that he was given in The Hangover, which made the film so good, but he still isn't wasted. All in all this film is worth seeing since it is so funny throughout, unlike most comedies that come out today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high expectations, and I was not disappointed.Paul Rudd is okay. He's cute, he has funny facial expressions, a nice voice. He was funny, yeah. But the real star of this movie is only Steve Carell. Oh my goodness, I cannot believe someone can be so hilarious. He had his character, Barry, completely mastered. Brilliant! Barry is this adorable, little geeky guy that is completely socially inept, and Carell acted out every single one. I forgot about every other role that I saw him play. I really lost the actor in this character, which is sometimes difficult to find in a comedy these days when most characters are generic.I laughed non-stop for most of the movie. When I wasn't laughing, it was because it was a serious moment. First of all, the jokes were great. They were new and made me laugh embarrassingly loud in the theater. I had a great time watching this movie. The emotional side of the film, however, was a bit much. It was okay for Barry's situation, like it was understandable and at a good amount, but for Paul Rudd's character, it was too much for me. I didn't like his situation; it was just too familiar, I've seen it before in other movies. That was the only disappointment in the movie. Maybe it's just me though, but I very rarely like the conflicts in comedies. They all seem the same and they seem like they only erupt from oversensitive, supporting characters that I don't want to hear from. It is probably just me, because of the mindset I have when I approach the movie. I go in expecting just a bunch of laughs, so when something serious happens I don't want it. That's my own problem.So, yep. I loved this movie. I thought it was extremely funny, I liked the story. I loved Barry and most other characters. I laughed a LOT and I left the theater smiling. On the drive home, scenes from the movie popped up in my head and I laughed about them all over again. I will definitely buy this movie, no doubt. It's a really good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film! Funniest cast possible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although many reviewers gave less than perfect scores to this film, I personally found it to be so much more than I expected. Not only did it deliver the promised antics of Steve Carell and Germaine Clement but it also surprised me with a supporting cast of hilarious actors and actresses. My favorites were David Walliams of "Little Britian" fame and Chris O'Dowd of "The IT Crowd." Germaine Clement's character was probably the most engaging of all, even overshadowing Steve Carell's. If you are a fan of Clement, this is a must see. The style was zany and nonsensical in the way that many British Comedies are. Although it wasn't the greatest film ever, I certainly believe it deserves 9 out of 10 stars. It is well worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a fancy restaurant with all style and no substance, Dinner for Schmucks has all the pieces for awesome potential, but none of them fit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks is a very weak comedy that has trouble getting its footing from the beginning, resulting in a total tumble for the rest of the film. What surprises me the most about this movie is that the talent was most certainly there, but with a very weak script and poor pacing, the movie maintains a disappointing taste throughout the overlong 114 minutes. Paul Rudd is among the funniest out there in terms of deadpan and everyday man humor, while Steve Carell is easily one of the brightest comedy talents in Hollywood. Then we have Jay Roach, who has plenty of comedic experience with the like of Meet the Parents and Austin Powers. But despite the capability and decent resume, they all fail in delivering the laughs.From the trailers (which were weak too), it looks like the big focus is on the dinner planned by higher-ups in a company that requires that you bring an idiot to dine with the bosses. Instead, Dinner for Schmucks is about an aspiring rising executive (Tim, played by Paul Rudd) and his complications after accidentally meeting the idiotic but unselfish and sweet IRS employee (Barry, played by Steve Carell). Their encounter together triggers a series of events that involves a psycho stalker, a unique artist, several mix-ups, and the potential ending of the relationship between the main character and his girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak). This movie is a remake of a 1998 French black comedy Le dîner de cons, and with some of the humor and subject matter, the French influence was a bit heavy.The weakest portion of the movie is clearly the writing. The script was full of bad jokes, pointless scenes, predictability, very little payoff, and worst of all prevented the cast from adding the extra ommph needed to make this a truly enjoyable film. Surely there were some funny moments and some funny situations, but overall Rudd, Carell, and Jay Roach did not have much to work with. Even the main dinner itself had minimal time to expand or evolve into something very memorable to the likes of the infamous dinner scenes of Meet the Parents, Goodfellas, or American Beauty. The script was easily the weakest part of the movie, because the material presented just wasn't good at all.Steve Carell and Paul Rudd are among my favorite actors in Hollywood. Their comedic timing is impeccable, with Anchorman and Role Models being the best examples. However, they had very little to work with. Paul Rudd had to play the backseat to become the middle man, with no chance of being remotely funny. With Steve Carell's character, it's even worse, because he was written so poorly. Clearly, he couldn't improvise much, but what was written down was not funny at all. They consisted of stupid lines, stupider comments, and sometimes plain garbage. The trailer definitely hid all the actual funny lines from Carell, but clearly it was because there isn't much to begin with. Even Zach Galifanakis, who is a rising force in comedy, couldn't deliver anything past a chuckle. This is one of the few cases in which the actors are not to blame; they did the best they could. Jay Roach isn't exactly a genius, but usually does know how to maintain pace and deliver some fun little surprises here and there. With Dinner for Schmucks, there weren't any fun surprises, and the comic timing was a bit off. The softer, more heartfelt scenes were handled with much better care, especially when Barry is seen working and displaying his hobby. The dinner itself however could have been much better, and this missed opportunity really hampers the overall movie, especially after all the build-up. The film was nearly two hours long, and I can guarantee you that less than 15 minutes was dedicated to the big finale, the gigantic climax. That was supposed to be the big payoff. Compare this to the comedic classic Blazing Saddles, when the final battle becomes insanely elongated, but utterly hilarious in all its insanity and impulsiveness (if you have not seen this movie yet Netflix it immediately). Dinner for Schmucks has the makings of an insane comedy that cannot be predicted?unfortunately, doesn't deliver on the premise and the promise.Bottom Line: Dinner for Schmucks is a tough movie to fully rip apart and garnish it with a very low rating, because of the comedic talent and obvious effort involved. But, I personally saw a stinkpile of a script totally ruining and obliterating any possible attempt at becoming the big comedy of the summer; becoming this year's Hangover or There's Something About Mary. The acting wasn't too bad, the directing wasn't a disaster, and there weren't a lot of technical annoyances. But the storyline, pacing, dialogue, lack of a heart and lack of structure destroyed the quality of this movie. In order for your comedy to succeed, there must be a bit of heart and allure attached, whether it's subtle or clearly out there. If there is someone to blame, definitely blame it on David Guion and Michael Handelman. You two, please go back to your writing classes please, you clearly did not pass. Rudd and Carell were not as charming or as funny in similar previous roles (Danny in Role Models and Brick in Anchorman respectively), and Jay Roach has definitely seen better days (Austin Powers?the original and maybe the sequel; Meet the Parents). To say you won't laugh at all is exaggerating, but there isn't a standout moment, and there most certainly isn't a reason to join this dinner a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the years funniest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've been watching Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd make us laugh for years now. Now, they have united for Dinner for Schmucks, the hilarious new comedy from director Jay Roach(Austin Powers, Meet the parents). Despite mixed reviews, I still had a blast with this film.Paul Rudd is Tim, your typical business man who tries to get in good with the company. By doing so, he is invited for a so called "Dinner for idiots", where they find morons, bring them there, and make fun of them. Tim hits Barry(Steve Carell), a nerdy guy who makes models with dead mice, with his car.This is obviously a mistake. Because Barry is a moron. And he ruins Tim's life. He helps his relationship with his girlfriend Julie go down, he gets Tim involved with this psycho that he slept with, and he ruins his job opportunities. Which, if you think about it, is karma for going to such a party.Dinner for Schmucks is hilarious. It keeps going until the end. The supporting cast is excellent also. Dinner for Schmucks is more adventurous than you'd want to believe. It's a very entertaining film also, and I laughed out loud numerous times.When you first hear about what its about, you'll think "That's sick". But actually, it has a good message in the end. If you do something mean to others, it will come back to bite you on the ass. It did for Tim. I'm glad it covered that. Carell and Rudd are two of the funniest people out there, and Roach has always had a talent for funny films. Together, these three make a comedy that is high on energy. See it.B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant comedy, with heart and brains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dinner for Schmucks is not just a funny comedy. It is hilarious, and one of the best comedies of the last several years. I rate it with the Hangover and Superbad, it's that funny. The large number of negative reviews and relatively low rating (6.1) are a mystery to me. It's true that the title Schmuck played by Carrel is a very flawed character, and I can only conclude that the people who didn't get this movie couldn't get past that. If you can't handle a deeply flawed main character, then you probably won't like Dinner for Schmucks.It's a movie with two primary characters, and in more ways than one it resembles the character structure of Tommy Boy: one is smart and cynical, the other is dumb and innocent. Carrel and Rudd take it to a new level, however. Rudd plays a very smart, and very successful junior executive in high finance. He has a wonderful girlfriend and lifestyle, except for one small problem: his job requires that he behave in ways that are not very nice. However, he does get paid very handsomely to do it, and he has a very bright future ahead of him. He is willing to compromise his principles a little - after all, what he does is perfectly legal - but he doesn't have to like it. Like many of us in the industrialized world, especially in business, he sells a little of his soul and gets a nice car in return. Some viewers may find this distressing - a little too close to home, perhaps?The other character, Barry, played by Carrel, is pathologically clueless. He is one of the best screen portrayals of a pathetic loser ever seen. Fortunately, he does have some redeeming qualities: he is an excellent taxidermist, and his hobby of stuffing dead rodents and placing them in diorama scenarios is of such quality that is qualifies as art. His intentions are good, his heart is all right, but he is so oblivious, so socially retarded, that he caused tremendous problems for anyone he meets. As a result, he has no friends at all. None. He is completely alone in the world, but manages to maintain a largely positive view despite that. This is another reason why some people will find this movie painful to watch, and difficult to laugh at - they see too much of Barry in themselves.But for those of us who can recognize our own faults and failings, and even laugh at them, Dinner for Schmucks is an amazing and uproariously hilarious movie. It also has a beautiful message of inclusion and acceptance. As the movie progresses, we learn that we are all schmucks, and no one is. By accepting one another, flaws included, we're all better off. And by recognizing our flaws, and laughing at them, we can all be better people. I loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't give two Euros if this is a remake of another film from Europe. I'm going to judge this film as if that other movie never existed. And, what do you know, for me, it doesn't. I have never seen that film, so it is of no importance. And, oh yes, it's French.That out of the way, let's get down to brass tacks. Is Dinner For Schmucks funny? Oh yes. In fact, I can find very little bad to say about this film. The acting was the best thing about it. Casting was superb. Jemaine was perfectly cast. I have to mention Zach Gallifanakis, who has caused me to laugh out loud at every part in every movie I have seen him in. So damn funny. "I release you!" has to be the catchprhase of the film, unless it's another one of Zach's lines, "Say you'll let me eat your Pudding." Carell was spot-on. Carell's character had to be annoying yet lovable at the same time. He's screwing everything up, but for all the right and noble reasons. Barry had to be somewhat pathetic but not pitiable. I think we all know people like that. He nailed it. Rudd had to portray the ambitious striver, willing to sell out his standards, but all the while feeling guilty for doing it.Rudd's part as Tim in this film encapsulates the hero's journey. Like all heroes of classical literature, he has a flaw: his desire to get ahead at any costs and impress Julie, his girlfriend who has already refused his marriage proposals several times. What he does not realize is that Julie is turning down his marriage requests not because he "hasn't made it," but because she is not sure about his morality, and as it turns out, she has every right to be. But we go along with Rudd on his journey, and by the end, with the help of the annoying Barry, Tim has learned something about other people, about Barry, but mostly about himself.Jay Roach's direction was fine, if not impeccable. The writing hit all the correct notes. There were a few plot holes, but nothing major, and a few instances of the dreaded "ADR plot point," in which the filmmakers try to clear up confusing elements of the story by dubbing in extra lines clumsily that were never in the script, usually heard while the character's back is turned to the camera and you can't see their lips. A pet peeve of mine. But these are small objections.And let's give some credit to the Chiodo Brothers for their excellent work on those lovingly assembled mouse dioramas.Is Dinner For Schmucks going to take its place in the pantheon of classic comedy, along side the likes of "Stripes," "Animal House" and "Dumb and Dumber"? Probably not quite. But it is very funny and very much worth the price of a theater ticket. If you end up missing it at the cinema, it is most definitely worth the price of a DVD rental, and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughing at the mentally ill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So now we have a movie that wants us to laugh at the disabled. Can this year get more depressing? "Dinner for Schmucks" is a painful remake of French film "The Dinner Game". Steve Carell plays Barry, a taxidermist who likes to present dioramas of dead mice. Tim (Paul Rudd) needs to bring an idiot to his boss' dinner of laughing at idiots and Barry fits the bill. Before that even starts, Barry sets off a wave of destruction that is at best smirk-worthy, at worst just plain dumb. From Barry's doing, Tim's apartment and relationship with his girlfriend (Stephanie Szostack, playing an art dealer working with a guy who seems to be ripping off Russell Brand's Aldous Snow) are ruined, a crazy ex (Lucy Punch) is back on his tail, and the IRS wants to audit him. This was all done accidentally, of course, because Barry is really just a simple-minded guy. In all honesty though, the guy is mentally ill. He shouts when he talks, has no idea what to do with a woman (he even tried to find his ex-wife's clitoris under the sofa), he takes the phrase "stay in the chair" literally, and he lets himself be swayed by the "mind-control" of his equally-mentally ill boss (Zach Galifianakis). Tim meanwhile is made to look like a jerk even though the movie claims he's a nice guy, and yet, there is nothing likable about Tim, nor is Barry-the-manchild anything but a destructive force. Director Jay Roach has the unenviable task of turning this into a sweet buddy comedy but in the end, you just want Tim and Barry to get away from one another. And then comes the dinner, where the blind and other disabled people are ridiculed. That "Schmucks" claims to be a "good-natured" comedy is really the biggest laugh here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the trailers suggest, but not this year's Hangover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the cast, I will admit that I didn't like the trailers for this. The premise seemed a bit too mean-spirited and didn't seem like one we could really relate to, and Steve Carell seemed to be presented as a cross between Michael Scott and Sandra Bullock's character from All About Steve, in other words, very annoying and irritating. So I caught a free advanced screening because I like the cast, but was unsure if I wanted to pay to see it.I was pleasantly surprised that this made me laugh a good number of times, but I wouldn't call it this year's Hangover because it felt different. To me it was half funny and half not-so-funny and/or too weird.Pros: -The "mouseterpieces" were pretty inspired.-The dinner sequence was the most consistently funny part of the movie.-Jermaine Clement is the most consistently funny character of the bunch.-Paul Rudd's brunch with Steve Carell, Lucy Punch, and David Walliams was one of my personal favorite scenes.Mixed:-Steve Carell, Zach Galifianakis, and Lucy Punch all made me laugh at points, but the problem I have with their kinds of characters is that they don't really change throughout the movie, hence their routines get a bit tiresome for me.Cons: -The pacing was slower than The Hangover as well as other comedies I've seen as of late, thus I found a fair number of dull spots, particularly in the first two-thirds of the movie before the dinner. I think the movie was nearly two hours long.-Certain people like Ron Livingston and Larry Wilmore felt underused.-I like Paul Rudd and this is probably a fault of the script, but him playing the straight man has gotten kinda old. It's pretty much the same as I Love You, Man, but instead of focusing more on his social life like in that film, it focuses more on his professional life and it's not as interesting. He has some occasional quips, but the moments before he meets Steve Carell feel the most dull, and when he does meet him, Carell's outrageousness causes Rudd to take a backseat, and for a moment I forgot he was in the movie. However, like I said, this is more likely the fault of the script that causes him to just stand or sit and watch Carell rather than go head to head with him, which I believe Rudd, as a comedic actor, is capable of doing.-More about the script, I could pretty much tell how it would end, but how it got there made the ending feel rather abrupt and quite unbelievable, mainly because of how it painted Rudd up to that point. Also, the script didn't feel like it left room for much improv, something which these actors have shown to be very good at, so most of the movie felt too heavily scripted and it seemed to drag it down a bit. Additionally, I didn't find the romance aspect strong enough story-wise to make me care all that much about Rudd. Stephanie Szostak was pretty cute, but she ain't Rashida Jones, and she's not in the movie much.-This is a minor gripe, but some intense closeups were rather annoying.Bottom Line:All in all, despite my complaints, there were some good laughs to be had. It was a good one time watch, but I don't know if I'd want to pay to watch it again. However, if there were a spin off with Jermaine Clement, not unlike Russell Brand with Get Him to the Greek, I would pay to see that movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that a movie can make me laugh almost constantly through. Call my humor immature, because it is. If you're into stupid humor, this is the movie for you. If you are into more sophisticated humor, then this is definitely NOT the movie for you.Maybe it's because I love Steve Carell, no matter what he does, or maybe it's some other reason, but this movie kept me entertained and laughing the entire time. The characters that were supposed to be funny were hilarious to me, especially Zack Galifianakis' character (Therman).Again, a great movie for those who enjoy immature humor. For those who don't, probably a bomb of a film.</fullReview>

The film makes me positively hate Barry as he is stupid beyond words, and yet the story manages to turn it all around at the end. The remarkable story telling, and the refreshing plot that requires no toilet humour to entertain viewers make "Dinner for Schmucks" such a good comedy for a brain off evening.

		<shortDescription>A Steve Carell vehicle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After getting off to a slow start the movie picks up steam and becomes entertaining. Steve Carell again proves that he may the best comic actor in Hollywood today. He carries this movie. Without him the movie would have been unwatchable. The actual story is simple to the point of inanity. The attempts at farce fall flat but Mr. Carell delivers his lines with such feeling that he makes even the most trite and inane comments sound convincing. The title itself indicates what this story is about, except that the schmucks are not who you think they are, which is what makes it a good movie. The movie causes the audience to ask: who are the schmucks? Most of the characters are goofy but not funny. Paul Rudd's straight man is weak and the female roles are unfunny. This movie is a vehicle for Steve Carell. It is his movie and he makes the most of it, weak material and all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I heard that the original French film is a classic, but I have never seen it so I cannot and will not compare this movie to the original. All I can say is that I walked in expecting a laugh out loud comedy and I came out with a huge smile on my face, ready to see it twice, which is something that rarely happens in movies when I see them at the theatres. This is a really funny movie that can't compare with other funny movies like the Hangover, but is certainly a lot better than all the ''comedies'' we're used to see in the theatre nowadays.Good points: The humour is almost non-stop, and I was surprised to see that the whole theatre was laughing. Not one person seemed unhappy, not one person didn't laugh, clap or smile. The chemistry between Paul Rudd and Steve Carell is solid. Speaking of Carell, to my eyes, he totally owned the film. His character got the most laughs. I loved Steve Carell in this film. And a few appearances by Zach Galifianakis (a.k.a Allan from the Hangover) were hilarious. A solid script kept the laughs coming, and that's just what you expect from a comedy like this.Cons: Some characters were just underdeveloped, used too much, not seen enough or had nothing to do at all with the story. Andrea Savage could have been used a lot more than two scenes since she's part of the office, Lucy Punch was used too much for what her character could do with the story. Zack Galifianikis could have been used a lot more.All in all, just shut your brain off and watch this film....you'll have a good time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Kind Of Grows On You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the funnier episodes of Married With Children had Kelly Bundy invited to a party for dullards that was throne by the members of a MENSA group. Bud clues her in and they take some action with the other invited dullard guests.That was played strictly for laughs, but Dinner For Schmucks takes the same premise and brings a lot of pathos into the same situation. Steve Carrell plays the invited guest by Paul Rudd to a similar type party being hosted by Rudd's boss Bruce Greenwood. These Yuppies idea of entertainment is for the guests to bring along one oddball character so that they all can be laughed at and the biggest oddball winning some kind of distinction. Like Quasimodo being crowned the King of Fools.Rudd literally runs into Carrell with his car in their meeting, but he remembers the party and cultivates him for a brief spell. Although this is supposed to be of short duration and Carrell drives Rudd out of his mind, he does kind of grow on you.Carrell is funny, but like a lot of comedians of the past like Jerry Lewis, Lou Costello, and even Charlie Chaplin he brings a great deal of pathos into his role. You might even find yourself shedding a tear or two at this gentle, but completely pathetic individual.Among other things Carrell wrecks Rudd's love life with girlfriend, Stephanie Szostak. She's fine in her role, but Lucy Punch as the mad dominatrix who Rudd had a fling with is next to Carrell this best in the film.Dinner For Schmucks is a fine comedy showing off Steve Carrell's talents to full advantage. Catch it while it is still in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK there is only one thing that makes this movie and it was Steve Carell. In this film he got to act really strange like his character Brick from Anchorman. His awkwardness and easy to remember one liners will have you laughing through most of the film. Two other actors do really stick out. Zach Galifianakis is also pretty funny, but on certain parts. A few scenes really had me laughing with him, but others were just OK. Jemaine Clement had a character that was really funny and every time he talked, I couldn't help but laugh. Now Paul Rudd had more of a serious part. He had a few funny scenes, but I wanted more. I didn't really care for him in this serious role. Stephanie Szostak had too many close up scenes of her talking and it really bugged me. There are many other small characters and they were just OK in my book. Ron Livingston was in the film, but did not have a big part. I wish he did because I wanted to see more of him. This movie ran about 2 hours long and that is too long for a comedy. Because of this, they tried to make a decent story and had some serious scenes. To me, that failed. They could of left a lot out and made the movie around an hour and a half. So overall, a decent comedy and will defiantly have scenes to talk about. But as for best comedy of the year. Sorry, it didn't cut it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it that every single comedy flick has to involve either a romance tale, or an emotional arc with the main character. Can't we just laugh? Can't we just be stupid with our humor and not stop? Look at the modern day classics....."Dumb and Dumber", "Billy Madison".....hell, even Seinfeld. Why are they held up as the greats of our time? It's because they want to make you laugh, not make you feel sorry. Hopefull Paul Rudd and Steve Carell can keep that hope alive.Well I'm sorry to say that this movie fell victim the very thing i just described. It started out mildly funny. There were some sequences that had me lightly chuckling to myself. But as the movie went on, it made you laugh harder and harder. Then i started to think, "Okay, maybe this movie was just building character, now the movie is really going to get funny." But that's where i was wrong. Right at the point when i thought it was going to start getting good, it got really really sad. I mean, really sad. Which is really confusing for an audience, because after that, you don't know if they actually trying to be funny, or emotional. So in turn, you just have a lot of raised eyebrows.And that really is a shame. Because the overall idea for this movie is great, granted that it is a remake. But still, there are endless possibilities with this idea. And rather than focus on the dinner portion (Which could have been so much more), they only give it a 15 minutes sequence out of a near 2 hour movie. I guess they had to sum it up because i think they needed to add a little more emotional depth to the story.Bottom Line......when the movie is funny, it's really funny. But the sad thing is, it rarely wanted to be funny. Sure you will get a few laughs out of it. But give it couple of weeks, and you will probably forget that you actually saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve Carell really shows his comedic range in this film. You can't help but like Barry, the IRS taxidermist, who was hit by Tim's car as he was collecting a dead mouse off the street in Los Angeles. Tim is played brilliantly by Paul Rudd. Tim is a businessman who wants to get promoted and hopefully engaged to Julie, his live-in girlfriend who is an art museum curator. At the moment, she is representing Kieran Vollard who has some pretty weird taste in his artistic endeavors. Anyway, Tim meets Barry and his life changes for the worse or the better depending upon how you look at it. Both men have more in common than they realize. Barry's wife leaves him for his boss, Thurman, who becomes a guest at the infamous dinner for idiots. While Barry thinks the other guests are remarkable, Tim knows the real reason that they're all there. I like this film and I think the director didn't go too far into the ridiculous as he could have done. In fact, the film has a lot less vulgarity in language and even sexual relations although there is some sexuality especially with Kieran. I expected sick jokes at times but I found the humor to be mild and tame and they told the story of an unusual friendship. The original French version ended differently but I wanted Tim to make the same revelation that he's the biggest idiot and maybe we all are. It's funny how two different people like Tim and Barry can become friends who did need each other and learned from each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright so I am a HUUUUUGE fan of Paul Rudd so when I saw trailers for this movie I was really excited. Then after seeing the IMDb rating I was a little hesitant then I heard reviews from people I knew who went to see it and they were not the greatest. So when I went to see this movie 2 nights ago I was kinda expecting to leave disappointed. However, I was positively surprised to see that I actually enjoyed this movie. It was HORRIBLY frustrating for a large percentage of the time which is where I think many people gave up on this movie. Yet somehow Meet The Parents is something of a classic (though it is only rated slightly higher IMDb wise) and while I loved that movie when it first came out when I try to watch it now it is the most frustrating thing ever!! That is the whole point of this movie, you are supposed to want to punch Steve Carell in the face. If you can get past all the really annoying nonsense Carell gets Rudd into it's actually really funny and a pretty good movie overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy Afriad of It's Own Shadow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2010 year, the start of a new decade, has not delivered too many laugh out loud, hilarious Comedies, at least none that I've seen. The only Comedy I think I've liked this year is She's Out of My League honestly. This movie had a good cast of people, cameos and leads. Still, from the trailers and the reception, I had full expectations that this would be a funny movie, not living up to The Hangover in terms of jokes, but at least an above average film. What I got was a mix of some good laughs, some flop jokes, and scenes that dragged on way too long.The plot is a hard one to explain, Tim (Rudd) is a hardworked, up-tight business man who is empowered to sell model lamps to his boss Mueller. Not to mention he has a girlfriend Julie (Szostak) who is getting a curator deal for a friend named Keiran (Clement). After being invited to a dinner when surprising everyone with the unexpected lamp surprise, Tim learns from his boss that he has to find an idiot to bring to the dinner and if the idiot is chosen as the stupidest he'll win an award and get the job. So its more of a mockery rather than a true honor. When Tim hits Barry (Carell) with his car by accident, they become closely acquainted, but since Barry jabbers on and on and basically makes an idiot out of himself while simultaneously ruining Tim's life, he believes that he can use Barry in the dinner and hopefully get his lamps selling. Barry also has an obsession with dead mice, making them into nic-nacs after cleaning them up and practically having a whole mice world in his basement.The Comedy is slow for the first half of the movie, but picks up real fast once Barry is introduced. I can say a lot much about this movie, for instance, we all have the "Barry" character in our lives. Someone who is too nice and someone who tries to help out while at the same time destroying your life. Schmucks also has jokes that are sometimes laugh out loud ones, sometimes they fall very flap, and some small grins. This movie is almost afraid to go to far which is to blame because of the PG-13 rating. If this had an R rating we could have gotten more out of the characters. A possible vulgar outburst from Barry, a very loud fight with Julie and Tim, a lot of scenes could have been added to make this film funnier if it wasn't cut back to PG-13. Also, its noticeable that the jokes are recycled, but used as if they are fresher than when they were first used. But jokes that are as if they are new come very rarely.It also includes one of my favorite songs for a brief eight seconds. You guessed it's "Escape (The Pina Colada Song)" by Rupert Holmes. It was used in Grown Ups as well and The Sweetest Thing. It made me smile when I heard it and I believe it gave a more open mind about what to expect.The movie also tends to drag on way too long. This movie is fit for a ninety minute runtime. No need to exaggerate the plot to 114 minutes. Most scenes featuring Rudd/Carell go on a while since the character Barry needs seem like a slow-witted person. The whole movie focuses on a dinner that doesn't happen until the very end. It should have just been called Meet the Schmucks or just plain Schmucks. Or if you want to be real corny, Whatta Buncha Schmucks! fits well.The movie all in all isn't new, but it acts as if it is. There are cool scenes of the mice dioramas made by Barry which is probably one of the top qualities about this film. The pros revolve around Rudd/Carell being great together, some huge laughs, a fine overall plot, Jeff Dunham's cameo is excellent and unexpected as well as the return of Office Space star, Ron Livingston, whos cameo is great too, and semi-believable characters. The cons are its overly long, Barry's approach is tedious at times, the plots recycled, Zach Galifianakis's cameo is too dumb to believe, and a trimmed rating. Its good in my book, but it could be better.Starring: Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Zach Galifianakis, Jemaine Clement, Jeff Dunham, Bruce Greenwood, Ron Livingston, and Kristen Schaal. Directed by: Jay Roach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carell shines in a very funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Jay Roach (Meet the Parents, Austin Powers) comes a new comedy called Dinner for Schmucks, starring Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Rudd stars as Tim, a stockbroker who is given a chance to show his bosses what he is worth after a business proposal. His bosses tell him about the dinner they hold for "extraordinary people". Then he runs into Barry (Carell). Barry's hobby is that he makes works of art with the characters made from stuffed mice. Immediately, Tim invites him to dinner.However, Barry becomes even more involved in Tim's life prior to the dinner. Barry tries to help Tim out with his life, when it causes more trouble for Tim.Carell shines in the part of Barry. He is very funny and believable in this role. Carell's parts get the most laughs out of the movie.Rudd does some fine work as Tim. However, he does not show as much range as a comedy actor here compared to his part in I Love You, Man.A hilarious supporting player is Zach Galifianakis (Alan from The Hangover) as Therman, a co-worker of Barry's who also is sleeping with Barry's ex-wife.Another hilarious supporting player is Lucy Punch as Darla, an old flame who Tim slept with and is a crazy stalker who has been wanting more since.Roach focuses most of the movie on Rudd's character and his dilemmas. But Carell is the one who shines in this movie as this performance of his is right up there with his other great performances as a comedy actor.At times the story feels like it may go a bit off focus, but that doesn't stop this from being a very funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Carell and Paul Rudd make another good teaming in Dinner for Schmucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, Dinner for Schmucks is a comedy with overtones of schmaltz, slapstick, and silliness that somehow is mostly very enjoyable in spite of itself. Certainly the reteaming of straight man Paul Rudd and eccentric Steve Carell makes the whole thing go down pretty easy even during the more cringeworthy parts. And they're surrounded by some other wonderfully crazy characters like Zach Galifianakis as an I.R.S. man who's sleeping with Carell's ex-wife, Jemaine Clement as an artist named Kieran, or Lucy Punch as Rudd's stalker Darla. Throw in Bruce Greenwood as Rudd's boss, David Walliams as potential client Fender Mueller, and Stephanie Szostak as Rudd's potential fiancée Julie and the whole thing has enough humor and heart to make this one of the most enjoyable comedies this season. Director Jay Roach of the Austin Powers and the Focker comedies lets things get a little wild before settling to a more sentimental climax that doesn't get too cloying. Certainly the use of The Beatles' "The Fool on the Hill" contributes to the feel-good vibe felt throughout...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dinner for Schmucks" Only Whets the Appetite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dinner for Schmucks" has a clever title but it needed to spend more time on the main course. The audience is subjugated to almost one and a half hours of build up time before the dinner bell rings. It's not time wasted though, the story does make good use of its two hour run time. However, I felt like I was on a plane taxiing down the runway trying to get up enough speed to take off and once in flight the plane kept dipping and then pulling back up; then it finally it made an abrupt landing and the flight was over.We are first introduced to Tim (played by Paul Rudd), an investment analyst, who is presented an opportunity to pounce on a new promotion at work. The story is set up as most business tales are told. The boss has an important client, the main character is presented with a once in a life time opportunity to prove his worth and so on and so forth. While in the process he learns something about himself.The business men (one of whom is played by Ron Livingston from "Office Space" fame) are the typical jerks who will do anything to keep on top of the dog pile. In this particular dog pile they also like to pick on the smaller, weaker dogs. It just so happens that the big dogs are having their "dinner for winners" in a few days. Tim now has a great chance to prove to his boss he will go to any length to earn the new position. The catch is that he has to find a loser to bring to dinner. They then have a contest, unbeknown to the losers, to see who the biggest schmuck is.Tim finds his loser immediately the next day not by chance but because as Tim so wisely says "everything happens for a reason". Welcome aboard, Barry (played by Steve Carell), here the story starts picking up a little steam. Barry has a unique talent of finding the positive in almost any situation, he mispronounces words that any 5th grader knows, works for the IRS and in his spare time works on his "Mouseterpieces". A perfect fit for Tim. A "Mouseterpiece" is Barry's taxidermy side projects where he takes dead mice and mounts them in familiar historical and everyday scenarios (i.e. The Last Supper, mice having a picnic, Whistler's Mother, etc).A lot of activity happens in that single night before the big dinner; Tim and Barry break into one of Tim's girlfriend's biggest clients' homes and finds him in a weird sexual perversion act. Next Barry accidentally invites Tim's ex-fling, Darla, over to the apartment and the first laugh riot is finally given to the audiences through a funny fight scene between Barry and Darla. Then it is on to the IRS to talk to Barry's boss, Therman (played by Zach Galifianakis), who is also a self proclaimed mind reader. Have you noticed they still haven't made it to the dinner yet? The next day Tim has a brunch appointment with a potential multi million dollar client where Barry and Darla show up trying to smooth things over. Again the straight man, Tim, and goofy man, Barry, routine starts up and we are given another good laugh. It was a pretty easy set up; take a high pressure situation and place it in any restaurant that has a Maitre d' next mix in a socially inept character such as Barry and something funny is bound to happen.After all of this we are finally taken out to dinner. The peculiar thing was that the dinner only lasts 15 minutes. This was a shame because the story could have spent more time on the losers that came to dinner. There was some great talent there, one being Jeff Dunham, a humorous ventriloquist who has been working stand up clubs for the last two decades. It felt like the director (Jay Roach) should have pumped the brakes, slowed up and gave these losers some more screen time. We did get another laugh riot when Therman and Barry had an invisible shoot out between their mind reading capabilities. Then it was over with a nice epilogue to the story through Barry's "Mouseterpieces".Should you see this movie? Ummm?OK, why not? There were some funny bits to it, the storyline was solid and the comedic actors were funny but didn't have to try too hard for the jokes. Rudd plays a good straight man in these situations where Carell and Galifianakis can play off of him quite easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying Repast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In as much as you do it to the least of my brothers, you do it to Me." JesusDinner for Schmucks is a small summer feast of lunacy and silliness with just enough of Forrest Gump and Rain Man to make an uneven but at times successful comic satire about corporate self-centeredness and foolish love. This light fare will not challenge some of Judd Apatow's best work such as 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up.Tim (Paul Rudd) is on the corporate ladder to the next floor if he can bring the best idiot to the private dinner designed by the president for his closest associates to laugh at a variety of disadvantaged guests. Tim's choice of IRS employee Barry (Steve Carell) is inspired: Barry stuffs and dresses dead mice in historical and art scenes such as the Last Supper and American Gothic. At the dinner he is easily the most eccentric until his nemesis, Therman (Zach Galifanakis), shows up to take over his mind and the party. But the real point is that the partiers, not their guests, are the laughable imbeciles, and a few of the guests have varying degrees of manic genius. Dinner for Schmucks is uneven: Steve Carell plays Barry as a confused eccentric for half the film, transforming him into an ersatz savant in the latter part. It's not a consistent characterization even given the turnaround inevitable in this adaptation of Le Diner de Cons. The bromides about brotherhood and friendship ring hollow because Barry is such a jumble of impulses as to create doubt about his sanity and the director's desire to cast him as a change agent.Carell's ambiguous portrayal of an idiot or scatterbrain can be unfavorably compared to Steve Martin's Jerk and Inspector Clouseau, or Peter Sellers' Clouseau for that matter, as the latter comedians display nuance that Carell can't seem to mount. He resorts mostly to mugging where the other two just move an eyebrow and suggest with intonation and interpretation.Although Dinner for Schmucks is lowbrow or flat too often, in the summer of 2010 it is a satisfying repast if you consider the fast food of Get Him to the Greek and Grownups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was laugh out loud funny, I don't care what the other critics think, this film was funny. It's like a Three Stooges short stretched into two hours.The film begins with Tim(Paul Rudd) who hopes to get ahead in business, his boss(Bruce Greenwood) tells if he hopes for a promotion, that he has to find an idiot like savant, bring to a party and make fun of me with others like him. But Tims luck quickly ensues when he meets Barry(Steve Carell), a nice man, who also likes to make art with dead rodents. Tim thinks he has found a quick ticket to the big leagues, But Tim is going to discover that spending time with Barry is anything but simply.Steve Carell and Paul Rudd are a funny duo, moments where they acted off each other, are the funniest moments. It also has a heart to it, the jokes and site gags are timed perfectly. This movie is never a dull moment. So if your in the mood for a funny comedy, then Dinner for Schmucks is that movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard lots of good things about this. Random reviewers on the interwebs, professional critics and my friends all seem to love this. Obviously, I had to see what the hype was all about but I was also careful not to keep my expectations too high so that I wouldn't be disappointed.Guess what, I was disappointed.Now, I wasn't expecting an intriguing deep psychological movie or anything. I wanted to see a fun 'popcorn' movie with exciting action scenes and a nice portion of good humour. But the movie failed to deliver this for quite a few reasons. Firstly, even though there were some funny moments, a lot of the humour was based on swearing and fart references (surprise, surprise). However, the humour itself is on short supply as a lot of the movie is wasted on the drama and sappiness a French comedy film remake, something a popcorn movie should not have more than a few minutes of. Plus, the smelly rear end humor is a little too gruesome to actually fit into a fun movie. Just put the equation together and think about what we have here.I'll use 'Tim' as an example. A strong little man who constantly swears and takes part in all kinds of messed up doings, but also manages to have a sappy, dramatic history. Awww... how cute... NOT. Perhaps the movie should be named 'Tim', because other than the fact that 'Barry' is narrating and is simply in more scenes than him, there is nothing to insinuate that he is the main character. 'Tim' had a much more important role in the story. But anyways, none of the characters are really likable, there way too much use of loud racket in the a lot of the scenes, and nothing in particular sticks out about the whole film.This movie did not live up to my expectations, let alone the hype. It did keep me entertained, but not in a mind blowing way. Even though the story gave the movie some potential, it turned out to be below average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not met to its full potential....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 10 minutes in, i realized that this movie was going to be a disappointment. Not that i expected a modern day classic anyway.With cast that makes you chuckle just by saying their names, this movie had a lot going for itself.Call it bad directing or just flat out bad writing, this film was not created to its utmost potential and i feel that the creators underestimated the actors amazing skill in drilling a hole straight through our funny bone.Besides a handful of hilarious moments,Dinner for Schmucks was filled with cheap and generic humor.As far as the cast's performance, i felt that Steve Carell SAVED THIS FILM. He plays a simpleminded IRS agent and has the unusual hobby of creating dioramas with deceased rodents, while Paul Rudd plays as a rising employee at a type of innovation investors company who isn't quite sure what he wants in life. As for the story, i think that its your basic comedy, a person who was having nothing but good luck hits a bump in the road,the domino effect takes place,and we all laugh at their demise.Although this is not the unsurpassed comedy of the summer, i still feel that this is not one you should pass.I give this movie 6/10, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ATTENDANCE at this Dinner is MANDATORY for Comedy Lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS" MPAA Rating: PG-13 MY rating: 9 stars (of a possible 10, based on an advance screening).In 1998, Francis Veber wrote &amp; directed a French farce called "The Dinner Game (Le diner de cons)". This film is called an "adaptation" of that idea, &amp; I found it exceptionally funny and well-done: ... Tim (played by PAUL RUDD) is an eager-beaver at a "rodent-infested" Financial advisory firm filled with RATS who tend to back-stab anyone that might affect their future income. His boss at the Fender company (BRUCE GREENWOOD) enjoys playing with peoples' lives and putting-down the many "lesser" creatures he finds scurrying around his rich-mens' world.? To try to win a highly-coveted promotion which he feels will entice his love Julie (STEPHANIE SZOSTACK) to finally accept his marriage proposal, Paul tells Bruce his idea to try to win-over a rich new Swiss client named Müeller (DAVID WALLIAMS)? ? Before he agrees that's a good idea, Bruce wants Paul to further "PROVE" himself worthy of an upper-level job by attending a dinner in which he brings a guest that will impress the others as being the biggest IDIOT (schmuck) at the gathering. In other words, he &amp; his cohorts want people they can make FUN of in their superior way, &amp; the guy who brings the biggest "loser" to the dinner will be the biggest "WINNER" of the evening (&amp; thus likely to "move on up" at the company)? ? Paul chances to "run across" a very ECCENTRIC IRS employee named Barry (STEVE CARELL) whose hobby is creating fanciful human-like diorama / vignettes utilizing taxidermied MICE posed in charming but strange ways? ? His girlfriend Julie wants to "curate" shows for outlandish artist Kieran Vollard (JEMAINE CLEMENT), &amp; she is very much TURNED-OFF by the idea that Paul would stoop so low as to trick someone (namely, Steve) to attend the planned dinner at Bruce's? ? Paul finds that, while Steve is sort of "RIGHT" for being his guest at Bruce's party, he's not just off-center but decidedly WACKY in the ways he often goes about things in life. Steve (with no malice intended) chances to facilitate Paul's being STALKED by a violent ex-lover named Darla (LUCY PUNCH), which causes additional upsets in Paul's relationship with Stephanie (especially when Steve chances to get Paul involved with artist Jemaine)? ? Various other nutty characters enter the picture, such as Steve's IRS boss, "Mind-control" guru Therman (ZACH GALIFIANAKIS), additional kinky guests brought to Bruce's dinner by other company employees, etc?.? There's an inspired NUTTINESS to it all, both during the main film &amp; in a number of "postscript" comments "updating" you on things as the CREDITS roll. Unlike so many other American comedies nowadays, this one is NOT rife with constant sexual activity or gross-out comments. I found it to be a wonderfully well-played whimsical "commentary" on the "unusual" characters we at times meet upon life's journey? ? Rather than being filled with "clever" lines, it's more of a "slice-of-life" character-&amp;-situation-driven hilarity, with exceptional performances by Steve (who has a "sweetness" to his goofiness) &amp; Paul (who does another masterful job playing an understated "straight-man" as he did in "I Love You, Man"), with fine and funny work by those in the supporting cast? ? A number of people might find the whole story "silly". But, I found it an often-brilliant piece of ensemble comic work, and I both enjoyed &amp; respected the success in which they "pulled-off" the achievement?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not destined to be a classic but still pretty funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at a sneak preview of "Dinner for Schmucks" last night. I really didn't know what to expect, having only seen the posters for it and none of the previews. It looked like "Dumb and Dumber" with Steve Carell's unflattering haircut, or it could be another crude frat pack-style film. Thankfully for an art house film snob like myself, neither was the case.The basic plot is that Tim (Paul Rudd) wants to get promoted at his company, Fender Financial. He's shown insight and incentive, but there's one more thing that he has to do to get in good with the corporate bigwigs. He has to attend a "Dinner for Winners," where each exec brings along an "idiot" who will unknowingly serve as amusement for the other smugly successful. Just then, socially inept IRS employee Barry (Steve Carell) enters Tim's life. You'll have to see the movie to find out what happens from there. ;) Paul Rudd is well-cast as this comedy's straight man, but of course, Steve Carell steals the show as Tim's "idiot" friend. His expressions, impeccable timing, and sincerity about his character make this movie an almost perfect vehicle for him. The supporting cast is also strong, with memorable turns from Ron Livingston cast against type as Tim's slick-haired workplace rival Caldwell, Zach Galifianakis as Barry's boss Therman, and especially "Flight of the Concords" star Jemaine Clement as a Russell Brand-channeling artist named Kieran for whom Tim's girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) curates shows.Granted, "Dinner for Schmucks" will never be considered a comedy classic. It's not "Arsenic and Old Lace," "The Graduate," or even "Little Miss Sunshine." The plot is predictable, as are many other mainstream scripts, and it probably won't even be among the year's top 20 moneymakers with all of the 3D animation dominating the theaters as of late. Still, it features humor that is about as original as Hollywood comedy gets these days, and it has only a fraction of the crudeness we've been seeing in other frat pack-style films. It is an effective diversion that most adults would probably enjoy, and it provides more than a few genuine laughs.If you're headed to the multiplex any time soon, "Dinner for Schmucks" is definitely worth your time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America Continues to Plunder World Cinema for Remake Fodder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading a good deal lately about how wonderful "Dinner for Schmucks" is supposed to be, but I didn't find it to be quite as good as the press would have people think. The set-up is very clever, as a group of friends holds a weekly contest to determine who can bring the biggest idiot to a dinner party, and one finds a true moron who spends his days making matchstick models of feats of engineering. The rest of the movie mainly finds ways for the idiot to unwittingly foil all the plans of his host. Most of these developments are more clever than funny, having been lifter from the classic French comedy, "Le dîner de cons", and as the film rolls along, the audience is more likely to smile knowingly than laugh out loud. The problem here is that the film's formula becomes predictable rather quickly. As with most American farces of the type, the basic premise ("Idiot reverses double-cross on snobbish host") becomes too obvious too quickly, and fart jokes, gas gags and humor involving bodily juices, (except for pus), soon become the order of the day. We may not know exactly how the chaos will develop over the course of 90 minutes, but after the first 20 Americans can be assured their farting scenes and have a pretty good idea that even dung might be at least mentioned. So, "The Dinner Game" ends up being funnier than the average American or European comedy, but certainly not one of the year's best or even funniest films (both "The Pink Panther" remakes and the "The Producers" remakes have bigger laugh-per-minute ratios).</fullReview>

Producers and the Actors claim over authenticity of the movie, giving no credit to the author Chetan Bhagat is disappointing.'Les Diner de Cons' is a far better movie having original concept. Throughout the movie (Dinner for Schmucks) it has bored the public by giving same message over and over again that the obtaining high percentage is not the deciding factor of one's talent. However, we all have passed through or are going through the education system and we all are already aware of this fact. Even if some may be unaware of this fact, there are many iconic personalities which provide same message through their life achievements that education is no hindrance to one's success.Dhirubhai Ambani and Sachin Tendulkar are such iconic personalities.'Les Diner de Cons' gives same message in the earlier part of the movie without boring the audience.This makes 'Les Diner de Cons' a must watch movie.</fullReview>
