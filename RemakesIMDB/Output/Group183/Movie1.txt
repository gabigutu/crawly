		<fullReview>Falk is fantastic as a charming thief in this Americanized remake of Claude Lelouch's 1973 film "La bonne annee." With the help of partner Durning, both men set out to pull a heist on a Florida jewelery shoppe, but things don't always go as planned. Falk carries the picture with his savvy characterization, aided in many scenes by some masterful make-up, which received an Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is so watchable than its original Claude Lelouch's (La Bonne Année - 1973). It has its simplicity yet it's more attractive and suave.(Peter Falk) added a certain flavor to the role. After so many years in Lt. Columbo's coat in the TV, he dedicated to keep the same wittiness yet as a thief, hustler, gangster in the movies (The Brink's Job, Big Trouble, Vibes, Cookie..). He brought so much charisma and talent into it, which reminded me of the kind of roles that (Humphrey Bogart) would have played if he lived longer. His best scenes were the ones with the female lead, where his glamour was all over the screen to the extent that he needed no talking at all to express. (Wendy Hughes) wasn't up to all of this, not to mention a slight of silliness in her present apart, lacking any possible chemistry between her and (Falk). (Tom Courtenay) is a great actor, giving a great appeal to it, but actually the movie gave him nothing great to do.There had to be (Harry and the Hendersons) to win the Oscar for the best make up at this year ! Although I'm a big fan of (Harry..) but it's sort of irritating because (Robert Laden) made a fine job indeed. I dare you if you showed Peter Falk's picture as an old woman, for anybody who didn't see this movie, that they would identify or even guess who the heck is that ? Maybe it got something to do with making a wholly fable character as in (Harry..) more than putting diligence into another woman disguise? (Bill Conti) is one composer who never made anything bad or so-so. (John G. Avildsen) dealt with it fine, whereas it's not a caper movie only, it's a romantic tale also. The 1980s' feel is overwhelming, the serene colors are here, and the comic atmosphere is in the smartness of the heist's details so the witty performance's moments.The best about it, else giving the lead role to 60 year old actor, is that it has a deep meaning under the amusing surface as well. The story says it plainly, she forgave him as a thief, and he forgave her affair while he was in jail, it's easy and adorable. And I loved what seemed as implied very wicked meaning also, where being uneducated yet clever thief is better than being a sophisticated artiest (or a smart ass !), as the first kind is at least not bragging, too intelligent, a human that stumbles sometimes and learns about it, and so honest when it comes to love. It's a tribute to the simple man who can be sophisticated in his own area, and a case of a woman who wants to find herself away any deceiving aspects with someone who understands love and deserves it even if he was originally a deceiver himself ! Actually the 2 of them were thieves and crooks in a way, but love can work things out. And I think it's only in the movies when you feel happy because the criminal gets away with it at the end !Compared to the few heist movies at the 1980s (small list with titles like : Green Ice, A Fish Called Wanda,..) it's sure memorable with special personality, being an interesting job with a love lesson too. It's all in the double narration by (Falk) and (Durning) which was so nice, smart and thrilling. Scorsese' (Casino) would use something like it 8 years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie probably passed by the box office like a cocaine bag in the bronx. But it wasn´t that bad. What´s more: it was amusing to watch how Peter Falk and his partner steal a jewerly dressed as an old man. The acting was nothing out of this world, and the plot was just about fine. But the music theme was really sticky, I can still hear that anoying but entertaining tone. If you see this on T.V. it´s ok, but I wouldn´t rent it at a price higher than 2 dollars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a great fan of the movies of Claude Lelouch, a film maker who believes that a life of random incidents adds up to fate, He is a disciple of Julien Duvivier and his work might be described as part of the magical realism movement. His films are full of odd details -- seemingly odd until you realize they are glimpses into some one else's oddly patterned fate, as if each of us is a single tile in a vast mosaic. The effect is often lushly romantic.What to make, then, of this American version of his LA BONNE ANNEE? Well, compared to the original, it's cut-down slop, as all the charming details are removed to concentrate on the caper -- everything after is treated as a throwaway. As a remake, it's a bomb.As a movie on its own, it comes off as an oddly paced caper film with a badly edited love story added on. The caper is very good. The love story is butchered. Peter Falk plays his role with a great deal of charm. The result is something you might stare at for a couple of hours without much pain, but don't waste time looking for it. Watch the Lelouch original.</fullReview>
