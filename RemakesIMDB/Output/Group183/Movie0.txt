		<shortDescription>we wish Lino Ventura a happy new year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Claude Lelouch is known for having left a copious filmography behind him and in which very few films reach the scale of the masterwork, except maybe "un Homme et Une Femme" (1966) and "la Vie, l'Amour, la Mort" (1969). A good proportion is to be pigeonholed in the category of entertaining, homespun films and "la Bonne Année" has its place among them.Straddling between two genres: the gangster movie and the sentimental movie, the Lelouch 1973 vintage features Lino Ventura who is released from prison for the new year in 1968 and with a little help from his accomplish plans to commit a break-in to a jeweler's. But in parallel, he falls in love with a lovely female antique dealer.These two types of cinematographic genres are difficult to handle together but as we are in Lelouch's universe you've got to accept the rules of the game. And the cohesive transition between them works thanks to Lelouch's fluid making and with a lot of humor going for it. I especially love the sequences when he dresses up as an old, rich man who visits the jeweler's and talks about his sister who is at hospital in a serious state. The steps of the operation are shot with clarity and precision. One also appreciates Lino Ventura's mischievous performance and the fact that Lelouch managed to subdue some superfluous features pertaining to him which aren't too overwhelming and are even funny to the pleasure of the projection. So, you can forgive the filmmaker for having incorporated pseudo-philosophical dialogs between Ventura and his female partner about love, wedding and the stability of the couple as well as being amused by a little juggling of the color and black and white concerning the cinematography. The outset and the end are shot in black and white, probably to give an arty feeling to the film even if one can deem this action as gratuitous.But never mind, if you've got to list the ten most watchable films in Lelouch's work, this one should be part of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish robbery caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former boxer Lino Ventura stars in this popular crime piece. But Claude Lelouche, the director of the hugely internationally successful romance Un Homme et Une Femme ensured that this too is a story of a man and a woman in which both Ventura and Francoise Fabian play their parts to perfection. Vive la Difference is the subtext of this film, and one marvels at the raw chemistry generated by the two stars. Lelouche can't help having a dig at smug left-bank intellectuals, but who can blame him for that? Nothing in this film is predictable, right to the very end. Why it seems to be unavailable in video is a mystery to me! See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance and Heist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the end of 1972, the con artist and thief Simon (Lino Ventura) receives a remission to celebrate the New Year outside the Prison La Santé. While heading to his apartment in Paris to meet his mistress Françoise (Françoise Fabian), Simon notices that a car is chasing his cab. In the apartment, Simon leans that Françoise has a lover and he leaves the place without being noticed.Simon recalls the Christmas of 1966, when he travels out-season to Cannes with his partner and friend Charlot (Charles Gérard) to heist the jewelry Van Cleef &amp; Arpels. While plotting a scheme to rob the jewelry, Simon meets the intellectual antique dealer Françoise whose shop is the next-door neighbor of the jewelry and he falls in love with her. But his scheme does not work as planned and Simon is arrested."La Bonne Année" is a pleasant and stylish romance combined with heist by Claude Lelouch. The film begins with footages of the classic "Un Homme et Une Femme" and has a non-linear screenplay with witty dialogs. The story is very well developed in an adequate pace different from most of films of heist.The characters are elegant and charismatic, and the beauty and the magnetism of Françoise Fabian are wonderful. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "A Dama e o Gangster" ("The Lady and the Gangster")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stylish jewel theft film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was pretty good and it was nice to see older men in lead roles who are not particularly sexy. Our hero(?) is a sophisticated thief who has intricately planned, along with his friend, the theft of a famous jewel store. It reminded me of the movies Rafifi and Grand Slam, though this caper was performed by 2 instead of it being a larger group effort. Also, it differs in that it diverges into a romance that builds with a woman whose store is next to the jewelers. Although I liked this relationship part of the movie, the speed at which the woman fell for him and the depth of this love seemed rather unreal, but this is a small quibble for an otherwise excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A history of flashbacks and a robbery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Claude Lelouch takes the ideas of present and past and turns them ingeniously on their heads. We see the history of the three main characters' involvement with each other in a humorous account involving the past and present. Some of this time-switching reminds me of the film to come, Tarrantino's Pulp Fiction, in its clever time-narrative.The film works its way around crime, friendship and love in an artistic way, leaving you quite satisfied with the outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lelouch goes all the way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up in the bi-cultural city of Montreal, I spent my youthful years in Francophone coffee houses &amp; bistros. I suppose it's just something in the sound of the language, but somehow French poetry always seems just that much more poetic, chanson just that much more lyrical. One of the things that fascinated me most about French culture was the easy camaraderie between artists &amp; criminals that stretches back thru the novels of Francis Carco in the '20s, the poetry of Rimbaud &amp; Verlaine in the 1800s, all the way back to François Villon, the 15th-century brigand poet.As a college student in the blandly monolingual city of Toronto in the '70s, I spent a lot of time in the many cheap repertory cinemas there &amp; got a good introduction to French film. Several trips to France since then have dispelled whatever lingering romantic notions I cherished of that country, yet the France of Louis Malle, Claude Lelouch, François Truffaut, Bertrand Blier, even Eric Rohmer ? but above all Lelouch ? still sustain the romantic illusion. The high degree of urbane sophistication &amp; civility they portray is beguiling, whether it exists or not.A Man and a Woman, the film that made Lelouch's reputation, was a flat-out romance. No action at all &amp; little plot to speak of, it was all about mood &amp; how love lifts us out of the ordinary.Le Voyou was all plot &amp; the protagonist, Simon le Suisse, leaves behind the woman he loved, tho he acquires her successor with elegant ease. There's little enough romance here tho; Simon lives by his wits, staying just one jump ahead of the law. What romance there is revolves around the loyalty of comrades, male &amp; female, &amp; the betrayal of trust is the ultimate sin.Lino Ventura, on the other hand, as an unrelated Simon in La Bonne Année, is incurably romantic. While casing a supposedly "incassable" (unbreakable) jewelry store in Nice, he meets &amp; falls in love with Françoise, who runs a neighboring antique shop. She &amp; her current lover run with a snooty intellectual set there &amp; Simon doesn't fit in. When asked how he chooses a movie without reading reviews, he answers ? looking straight at Françoise ? that he chooses a movie as he would a woman, "en prennant des risques" (by taking chances).The heist ? a beautifully crafted caper "psychologique", as Simon insists on calling it ? goes awry thru one little detail, something not even overlooked but simply unforeseeable. His partner Charlot (Charles Gérard) gets away with the loot, but Simon is caught &amp; does 6 years hard time. We learn all this in a long colorful flashback after we see him released from prison, supposedly as part of a special Christmas pardon, but actually in hopes the police can track him to his accomplice &amp; recover the loot.Simon cleverly eludes the cops &amp; makes his way back to his old apartment in Paris, where Françoise has moved in to wait for his release. What he doesn't realize, &amp; finds out the hard way, is that she has taken a live-in lover to while away the time.The plot unrolls with great finesse thru Lelouch's signature use of flashback ? &amp; the striking contrast between the bleak monochrome of Simon's present &amp; the vivid color of 6 years ago in Nice is an especially brilliant touch ? but the real focus is his bewildered state of mind after 6 lost years in prison as he contemplates the changes those pitiless years have wrought in his absence. Ventura wears his sad shopworn face largely immobile, yet manages to convey an extensive range of feeling thru just his eyes or the occasional twitch of a corner of his mouth. His nuanced performance combines with Lelouch's storytelling genius to create what is perhaps my favorite French film ever.Simon looks up the loyal Charlot, who's safeguarded Simon's share of the loot all these years, &amp; makes his plans to get out of the country while the getting's good. Yet he can't bring himself to leave without making one last stab at reconnecting with Françoise because, as he'd told her prior to his arrest, a man is someone "qui va jusque au bout" (someone who goes all the way).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lelouche Scores Big with "Happy New Year"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film a nine, for two reasons: 1. Sharp movie script, well delivered by the protagonists; and 2. Lino in his grave won't like this, but Francoise Fabian steals this movie from him with a truly compelling performance - as a socially and professionally sophisticated and sumptuously attractive woman who is a foil for all men, save Lino Ventura, who conveys at least as much personal chemistry in this film as a block of cement. I mean, when they are reunited following his six-year stint behind bars - he has nothing to say to her, when she is all choked-up with emotion! Ventura gives the expression "man of few words" a renaissance interpretation.Ventura, frankly, was much better cast as the detective out to corral the jewel thieves, in "The Sicilian Clan," than he is here, as the reticent-personality jewel thief, and developing "love interest" of Francoise Fabian. She is so beguiling in this film, looking an ageless 30 instead of her 40 years of age at the time, one wonders if Lelouche might have considered her opposite Trintignant in "A Man And A Woman," some six years earlier? She deserved as least as much international recognition as many of her contemporaries of this time who outshined her, beginning with Claudia Cardinale, Elke Sommer, and Elsa Martinelli, none of whom could have carried this film to stellar heights, as did FF.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tonite I wondered what is my favourite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I say, just tonight I wondered to myself, if someone asked me what is my favourite film, it would be sooooo difficult, but whenever I think hard about films I've seen or even when I don't, for some reason, I always think of La Bonne Annee.So I keyed it into IMDb right now.I have absolutely no idea where I saw it or when, but it probably was in France in the 70s. And I've probably only seen it once, but I've never forgotten it.I just thought it had everything about it that was good about French cinema or at least any cinema that wasn't Hollywood (and that's not a criticism of Hollywood, just a comment that French is different).I haven't looked at the comments yet but I look forward to reading them, and in these days of being able to access, I really hope somehow to be able to see it again.I sort of remember it was an older man involved. I was a young man when I saw it, and I'm an older man now, but I'm even more 'French' than I was then, having spent so much more time there, can speak the language pretty well, know all the best hotels in the south of France etc etc.a la bonne annee! I'll come back with a comment if/when I get a copy.</fullReview>
