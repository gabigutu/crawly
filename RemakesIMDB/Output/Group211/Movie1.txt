		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest and most underrated movies ever made. Just when you think it's about to slow down and become a normal movie, it veers in a whole other, even crazier (and arguably funnier) direction than you could have ever hoped for. With brilliant performances by Peter Falk, Alan Arkin, and Richard Libertini (who has one of the film's best lines: "These are the best security men in the world. They used to work for J.C. Penney"), this is a must see for any fan of true film comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big Peter Falk fan, so I watched this movie because he was in it. I was in for quite a surprise. It has quickly become one of my favorite comedies of all. Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are a perfect pair. The great thing about this movie is that it seems to invent itself as it goes along. The movie isn't following any type of formula, it's making itself up as it goes along, or so it seems. Very funny. My rating: 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be one the most underrated comedies ever made. This movie has made me laugh out loud each of the many times I have seen it. One of the things that makes it really special, however, is that this would be a good movie even if it never had a funny line. The reason is that it is simply a great story. The plot is full of twists and turns, and leaves you surprised at the end. This alone would make this movie a "7." Add the numerous laughs, and this movie becomes an undenible "10."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwball comedy is loaded with options</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are an absolutely killer combination in this over-the-top comedy. The writer who helped pen "Blazing Saddles," Andrew Bergman, is back in a solo effort this time that downplays the profanity and adult situations of that earlier classic for a family-friendly outing that loses none of its bite or wit.For me, this film carries the same buttoned-down lunacy of a great Bob and Ray routine, only sustained for 90 minutes, with hardly a sagging line or note. Get through the first five minutes, a fairly routine armored car robbery and a protracted stairwell run, and you will not be sorry, because the rest of "The In-Laws" is so funny, it will take you three or four eager viewings before you appreciate just how brilliant beyond belief it is. At least that's what happened with me.It's a strangely genial film, its approach personified in Peter Falk's "friend of the world" interpretation of Vince Ricardo. There's nothing that phases him, or is too minute to warrant some breezily cheery comment, like "Is this coffee freeze-dried? It's very good." Or "The benefits [for belonging to the CIA] are terrific. The trick is not to get killed. That's the whole key to the benefits package."Ricardo's approach is exemplified in an apron he is seen wearing at a barbeque: "I'm loaded with options." That he is, and screenwriter Bergman, too. In a somewhat desultory but still necessary DVD commentary for "In-Laws" fanatics like me, it is revealed by Bergman and director Arthur Hiller reveal the key moment for the screenplay is a fairly straight and jokeless scene between Alan Arkin's Dr. Kornpett and his daughter, where she urges him not to reject Ricardo because of his subliminated sexual jealousy about losing his daughter to Ricardo's son in marriage. Okay, maybe that does read funny, but it doesn't come across as funny.The way the scene works, once the hapless dentist hears this, he is screwed. He has to help out Ricardo, in an inane flight from the government into the arms of the only Latin American dictator who's national flag features a topless woman, and whose apparent deputy is a Senor Wences hand puppet. You just follow along the same way Dr. Kornpett does, never knowing what to expect next, and, unlike him, enjoying it all the way through.This film isn't laughs for everyone. Senator Jesus Braunsweiger's next-of-kin and BMW enthusiasts will find plenty to mourn. But for everyone else seeing it for the first time, it will be a joy forever, and a bit of a puzzlement: Why isn't this comedy better-known? Why don't people quote it as readily as "Caddyshack," "The Blues Brothers" or other lesser, contemporary fare?One last thing: Alan Arkin's performance is maybe the best thing in the movie. I only realized this after repeat viewings. He's not the funniest comic actor around, frankly I never found his stuff that good in the other films of his I've seen, but here he makes the thing work. I wanted to say something about this containing the best straight-man work since Bud Abbott, but the more I see it, the less I'm sure who's the straight man. So many of the great lines are his: "There are flames on my car." "Flies with beaks?" "A Zee? A Zee?" "What flow? There isn't any flow." And to think his first line in the movie is a complaint about the viscosity of his dental bibs.Just shut me up and go see it already. Or see it again. There's worse things you could do with your time, and not much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely hysterical. And I do not mean very funny. I mean it is hysterical.The plot is that a CIA operative and a dentist, played superbly and respectively by Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, are about to become in-laws because their two children are to be married. But Falk, about to retire from his clandestine duties, needs Arkin's help to pull off one final mission. From beginning to end the antics of these two will leave you in side-splitting humor. And the performance by Richard Libertini as a South American dictator is equal to Falk and Arkin's contribution to this classic comedy.If you want to see an intelligent and realistic film that is extremely funny from start to finish then this is it. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of American comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly one of the most under-appreciated comedies of all time. Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are magnificent. It was shamed by the abhorrent re-make/re-visit of 2003. Don't judge this original by that pathetic after birth. Two scenes stand out as 'need to see.' The first meeting between Falk and Arkin and the subsequent dinner has many a classic line, 'Beaks? The flies had beaks?' and 'There's tremendous red-tape in the bush.' The landing in Tihara and the car chase that follows including the famous 'Serpentine!' sequence makes me laugh out loud with every viewing. 'They make a chicken sandwich. They heat it up, serve it on a hard roll, with orange juice or pineapple juice, y'know grande, a big one. And coffee. Espresso with that wonderful foam. Oh Jesus Pigs!' If you have no idea what I'm talking about, treat yourself to this classic. If you like Monty Python, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen and the like, you will absolutely enjoy The In Laws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched it again this weekend and laughed as hard - no, harder - than the previous 20 viewings! What is it about this movie? It gets FUNNIER every time. Oh sure, everyone comments here about the biggest laugh: Serpentine! Arguably one of the funniest in film history. But there are SO MANY great lines and moments: "There's no reason to shoot at me, I'm a dentist!" "Left turn at The General Garcia Toll Bridge...it's a fitting tribute general...yes, much better than a statue." "We have no blindfolds senor, we are a poor country." Vince: "from here on in it's very cut and dry." Shelley: "it's not cut. it's not dry." How about Shelley's expression as the general pours cold water into his own hand to calm down his agitated friend? And the airline safety instructions delivered by Billy (or is it Bing?) in Chinese. IT JUST GOES ON AND ON! Tell everyone you know, don't go see the remake - rent the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This truly hilarious comedy is one of the funniest movies of the period. No one does the sort of deadpan face that says "I can't believe what I'm hearing and seeing" like Alan Arkin. Peter Falk's comic abilities match his skill in heavier roles. The interplay between them is marvelous, matching that of Lemmon &amp; Matthau (one wishes they had made more films together). Many side-splitting moments, and some superbly comic dialogue. Not to be missed.Serpentine, Shel, serpentine!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Arthur Hiller presses all the right buttons with this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen this film for the third time - the first was in 1979 when it was in the cinemas, the second was in 1989, and last night - 1999. And each time I've loved it. Somehow it catches just the right note early on, and manages to maintain it right thru the film.I think the character of Vince (Peter Falk) is the key. At the start of the film we are convinced that he is a loud-mouthed schmuck with criminal tendencies, embarrassing and unpleasant to be around. This image slowly begins to crack, and although his behavior doesn't change one iota from start to finish, our perception of him does. So much so that by the close of the film we come to see him as a man of heroic qualities, gracious, and modest to boot. It's a very clever transformation and it's achieved via a plot that spirals hilariously out of control at dazzling speeds.And of course the other joy of the film is the unlikely relationship which develops under fire between the zany CIA operative Falk and Alan Arkin as the dull but respectable dentist. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Cheers For the Guacamole Act of 1917!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this film is really simple: if two families are about to enjoy the union of their children in a marriage, is it not likely that the in-laws involved can come to depend and help each other out in times of need? Most of us would probably say no, or want to know the extent of the help. However, when Vincent J. Ricardo (Peter Falk) asks Dr. Sheldon Kornpett (Alan Arkin) to assist him in retrieving something from a safe in Ricardo's office, Kornpett is willing (if somewhat suspiciously) to do it. The reason that Kornpett is suspicious is he is not quite certain what to make of Ricardo. They only met at Kornpett's house the night before, for a dinner party introducing the families of the bride (Kornpett's) and groom (Ricardo's) to each other. Ricardo acted...well oddly. He told tales of his business travels in Central America, including how in one country babies are being carried off by huge bats that are protected by the Guacamole Act of 1917. Kornpett hears this with a blank face, although his eyes do bug out a little in disbelief. Later, when Ricardo gets testy with his son over a comment about the former not being home enough, Kornpett can't believe the near rage that Ricardo demonstrates at the table. So his suspicions about his future in-law seem well based.Shortly, after being chased and nearly killed by two men who are after the items that Kornpett picked up, the suspicions seem confirmed. Ricardo explains to him, over pea soup in a restaurant, that he actually is not a successful salesman but a C.I.A. operative (a photo in Ricardo's office confirms this: it is of President Kennedy, and the autograph refers to the Bay of Pigs Invasion). He is in the middle of a critically important mission in Latin America dealing with international finance and a conspiracy against the richest nations. Kornpett hears him out, and is upset to hear that there is more material that Ricardo hid in Kornpett's home the night before. He wants no part of it, and leaves to go home - only to find the police there. He flees, and does evade capture - at the cost of having his car repainted in a way he never would have wanted it to look.Soon Kornpett is forced to join forces with Ricardo, and enters the deadly serious but (here) quite farcical world of international espionage and intrigue. At the end of the road is the ringleader of the conspiracy, General Garcia (Richard Libertini) who has a special little friend that makes Al Pacino's little friend in SCARFACE lethal but sensible in comparison. THE IN-LAWS is funny. Arkin with his tight-ass repressive personality works well against the free-wheeling, anything goes Falk. Libertini appears only in the films last twenty minutes, but he does equally nicely as the ultimate in screw-ball dictators. Well supported by a cast including Nancy Dussault, Arlene Golonka, Penny Peyser, Michael Lembeck, and Ed Begley Jr. the film is just a laugh fest until the happy ending. As mentioned elsewhere in these comments Arkin and Falk should have made several films together. They have only done one other movie together since THE IN-LAWS. Pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie and I think it's great! The previews have been stuck in my head for ages. Since the age of 5, I would try to picture the streets of New York in the back of my mind. And I picture the streets very well. This movie is a lot of fun, I liked the banana scene, I also loved the all the other scenes as well. The escape scene where the hapless dentist got the engraving plates from the office. And I liked the part where Peter Falk's character shoots Paul L. Smith in the arm. At least he lives. Though Falk's character hasn't been home for a while, he got a chance to see "The Price is Right" , it's one of my favorite game show of all times. Thae cute scene in the movie was the hand puppet of the leader of the country the duo were in. There is more I could say about the movie is when the two feuding in-laws got to the wedding on time in a seated parachute, and what more could you want from a movie like that. Be part of the family in which the in-law feeds on danger. The In-Laws is a true classic to the collector. 10+!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps 34 years ago was funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not want to be too harsh because perhaps when this movie was filmed some scenes that are too familiar in today's American movies were somehow original, but even so I believe that by 1979 it was quite common to see American movies with cars chasing each other and so on. But leaving that aside, it is quite difficult to swallow that an educated dentist would accept leaving his office in the middle of an intervention to make a favour to a guy that he hardly knew. And this is how all begins. So, the script has an original sin... Nevertheless, there are some good gags and a very good performance by Alan Arkin. And of course, the usual display of utter ignorance of Americans about the culture of the other American countries. For instance to make the Hondureans speak Spanish as if they were Mexicans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the remake, and refuse to. I don't think that the remake could quite capture the magic that Peter Falk and Alan Arkin provide. This movie is a political satire. It spoofs the whole spy business and Latin American dictators. Falk carries the film as a seemingly weird CIA agent. Arkin is a neurotic dentist unwittingly placed in the spy game by his seemingly crazy in-law. The movie has plenty of laughs, and can be seen repeated with the laughs still being funny. The plot is a bit winding and confusing, but it is a comedy after all. Basically, the movie is carried by two great personalities -Falk and Arkin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film began the series, continued when Danny DiVito says "Ooops. Cows." The homage of "Oops. Some creature", always makes me laugh. The interjection into a chase scene of two frames of a pig, or a cow or whatever, which began in The "In-Laws", even makes "No Soap. Radio" amusing, but only in relation. Yes, yes, yes, the funnest American film of the last fifty years, bar none. Some are as funny as, but none are funnier. And the Godless creatures who did the re-make should be ashamed for the rest of their lives. After the original nothing else will ever be quite as good. But the remake was just AWFUL!

		<shortDescription>Still funny throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an outstanding comedy when released nearly 30 years ago. Seen again now, it is just as enjoyable, and with the added feature of being a period piece of its times. Although exaggerated for humor, the small dictatorship where much of the film occurs was much more like the banana republics, which were more a part of Central America and the Caribbean during this era, than one might assume today.Falk and Arkin were absolutely outstanding as a comedy duo, and one wishes that perhaps they had been coupled in other work as well. Unlike most other films - even among the best - this picture had no slow or dull parts. The entire period on-screen was a continually interesting and humorous presentation.I liked the "re-make" of this film better than most seemed to, perhaps because of liking Michael Douglas' and Albert Brooks' work so much. But it was re-made in name only, and like most fell short of its predecessor (Martin and Hawn in "The Out-of-Towners" is an even better example).Catch this film when possible, not only for its humor, per se, but as a fine piece of nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falk and Arkin make splendid comedy team</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alan Arkin and Peter Falk made a great comic duo in this classic comedy. Each one bounces off the other in excellently timed humor.The story is wild and off the wall. Peter Falk's secret agent guy is too, and he has you and co-star Alan Arkin guessing whether he is a legitimate government agent, or some kind of schizophrenic maniac. The two are the respective dads of two soon to be wed kids, and their shenanigans take precedence over their offspring and the upcoming nuptials. Arkin's straight-laced everyman who rapidly waxes panicky, then neurotic due to being suddenly cast in the bizarre world of Falk makes for brilliantly hilarious contrast between the two.Needless to say, Falk is on a case and gets Arkin inexorably caught up in the situation, which soon degenerates into a wild romp with loud explosions, shootings, and other confusion. The "Serpentine!" routine is a classic of riotous buffoonery. Falk and Arkin understand comedy, and manipulate it well. Their comic chemistry is worthy of comparison to some of the classic duos over the years, as they ping-pong the lunacy back and forth with expert timing and delivery. This original is far better than its recent remake, and is recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been many comedies focusing on weddings, but "The In-Laws" may have brought the genre to its panacea. Featuring Alan Arkin (as the bride's father) and Peter Falk (as the groom's father) going on a series of crazy adventures right before the wedding, the whole thing's a laugh a minute. It just makes one happy that cinematic humor in the '70s shifted to the completely loony, and Arkin and Falk make a great comic team. I would imagine that everyone had a lot of fun on the set. Featuring Ed Begley Jr. and David Paymer in his debut. There was a remake, but I heard that it was pathetic. So stick with this one and you'll have a really good time.</fullReview>

The film is really cast perfectly. Alan Arkin seems born to play Sheldon Cornpett (Shelly, I call him.) And Peter Falk seems to be having the time of his life as Vince. Who better to play General Garcia than Richard Libertini? Of course you have to overlook huge bits of logic to really ejoy this film (How can the family have voted for Vince to retire from the CIA when only an hour or so before they didn't know he was in the CIA?)

		<shortDescription>A funny movie in the old Woody Allen genre of Bananas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The In Laws could use some improvement. The secondary dialog could have been clever and interesting, but instead seems like filler. And the secondary acting is merely adequate.What makes The In Laws worth watching is the interaction between Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, two great actors. It is the yin and the yang, the hot and the cool. And when you listen to them, particularly early on, it seems like improv. They really are reacting to each other.The plot is a bit contrived, and makes little pretense of realism after awhile. But it works. You really don't know what, exactly, Falk is doing, and which side he is on, or even whether he is just crazy. That is fundamental to the movie.Once they arrive in South America the roots of the movie become clear. This is a revamping of ideas from Woody Allen's Bananas - 1971, particularly the crazy dictator, and the American accidentally caught up in Banana Republic politics. Then the style of The Inlaws makes sense: the lightweight acting, the silliness and absurdity. It is a genre where the bar is set fairly low, but not as low as some of the so-called comedies that followed.My favorite part, aside from the banter between Falk and Arkin, is the bit where James Hong gives a one-on-one "flight attendant" spiel to Arkin in Chinese.Of course, Richard Libertini is great as the cracked general.</fullReview>

Great all around comedy, writing, timing, slap stick, parodies (Cavalry to the rescue, hundreds of cops in Mafia type suits attacking the bull ring, also akin to the final shootout in Butch Cassidy and Sundance, the chase car slipping and sliding on banana peels)."Flames. I have flames on my BMW!" "I thought you came down to buy a magazine." "I did but all they had was Hustler, in Spanish, Hustlero!" And Sheldon -- Alan Arkin -- running down the street in Manhattan with the briefcase in hand being fired at by the unknown spy --"Oh, God, don't let me die on West 34th Street!" or something to that effect. Then dodging around the taxi cab as the spy shoots at him, while Peter Falk casually sips his cup of instant coffee in the coffee shop watching the cat and mouse game around the taxi cab.

		<fullReview>Unlike contemporary comedies which focus on sexual innuendo and subtle sarcastic wit, this movie uses core personality and character decisions to put two unlikely partners into hilarious situations and choices. This movie is actually funny! The insanity continues throughout, until the unlikely climax. Falk is characteristically a combination of accidental competence and possible insanity. Arkin is great as the unwitting accomplice. The plot gets crazier as it goes along, shifting locations and perspectives. You never know who's really working with whom (at least I didn't).

		<fullReview>I saw the In Laws in the theaters and was with others who were older and I think I was the only one who really really enjoyed it, I thought it was just the funniest movie I could have seen! It's just so screw ball and the dialog is delivered extremely dead-pan and if you can follow that kind of humor you will love it! I played it for my family recently and I was the only one laughing, oh well (though when Arkin is running through the streets of NY they were rolling for that one). I guess it's not for everyone, I think it was because they don't think old movies can be funny, or maybe because there was so much to laugh at it just got numbing. Falk is priceless here with his outrageous stories and Arkin acting as the sane one who ends up involved in the madness that is true that he finally buy's into it then it's getting really funny (no those are real bullets, Shelly!). Is that pea soup good?...(Faulk asking Arkin after he's been shot at multiple times), just totally dead-pan funny stuff! I loved this movie so much that I actually loved Big Trouble, hell I'd probably be entertained watching Faulk take a dump! I give it a definite 10/10, I can't watch the remake because it's like a sacrilege, I loved this movie so much. Shelly looking at VELVET gallery of the evil General:"My General, those are beautiful paintings, who is she?" General:"Oh, she's some hooker in the village." Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would give this film 100 out of 10 if I could. This has got to be THE funniest movie ever made. It has become a cult classic with a large cadre of people having seen it 20-30 times. I've seen it probably 25 times and I still laugh hard every time. The characters are so brilliantly written and magnificently played that they make the wacky story believable. Just when you think the movie will slow down, it takes off on another wild, crazy, hilarious tangent, completely in keeping with the characters. Alan Arkin, Peter Falk, and Richard Libertini are fantastic. This film has lines you will take with you: The 'Guacamole act of 1917', Jose Greco del Muertos, Flies? Flies with beaks?, Serpentine, My car has flames, and much much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undeniably an extremely entertaining film. It has timing worthy of the earlier comedy classics, a building complexity of plot, and a brilliant interaction between Arkin and Falk.From the improbable opening of the film through the first contact the two principals, the film gives few hints to a first-time viewer where it's going.Possible spoilers follow.To me, one highpoint in the film is the dinner, where Vince relates his experiences in the jungle. His explanation, "There's a lot of red tape in the bush," is the capper to an unusual tale.Subsequent viewings of the film show just how well crafted it is. Little items that seem random take on meaning when a viewer knows what's coming next.As soon as I saw it was available on VHS, I picked up a copy. The same when I found it on DVD. Doubtless the best comedy of its decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was 10 years old, my family and I went to see "The In-Laws" in Florida, and we all had so much fun laughing and howling. Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are such a perfect pair in this classic comedy and they are just so inimitable. Falk is the crazed CIA agent, Arkin is the meek dentist, together, when their children plan to marry, Arkin gets involved in Falk's espionage adventures south of the border. Character actor Richard Libertini, a familiar face to many comedies with his bald pate, thick beard, and zany accents, adds to the fun as the Latin dictator who makes hand gestures with eyemakeup and lipstick drawn to his hand to the two guys in one hilarious scene. The best line of the movie is "Serpentine!" Recently, I found on the internet that Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks are going to mimic these greats in an upcoming remake with the same title as the original. Many people posted messages that they were outraged that the regularly dramatic Douglas and the dryly funny Brooks are not only reprising their roles, but also poorly copying them. Audiences at previews were equally angry and predict that the remake will fall flat on its face and there just will never, ever be another Falk and Arkin. Every actor has his/her own persona, and it is highly forced and unnatural when one actor tries to duplicate another actor's persona.</fullReview>

The comedic pairing of Peter Falk and Alan Arkin was inspired, and it's a shame they've not done more such gems.The plot pairs mysterious, over-the-top Vince (Falk) with sober, practical Shelly (Arkin) and sits back to watch Shelly react to increasingly improbable events... all because, as Vince says, "This man's wonderful daughter is marrying my son on Saturday."And PLEASE, for Pete's sake, see this movie before its differently-titled remake comes out next spring. Nothing against Michael Douglas or Albert Brooks, both are fine actors, but I cannot imagine anyone but Falk and Arkin doing justice to the zaniness that is The In-Laws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This brilliant and hilarious film just makes me ask one question: why didn't Arkin and Falk become the next Newman and Redford? Why was their chemistry, so obvious in this movie, never exploited? 1985's Big Trouble teamed them with writer Bergman once again, but, as most agree, it was the wrong vehicle. Arkin's constant look of stupefied amazement at what Falk was getting him into made this movie. That same look was present when Senor Pepe was kissing him, remember? And Falk, apparently oblivious but in reality well on top of things, had his defining movie moment. The movie was a hit, and should have spawned many more Falk-Arkin projects. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. We're the losers because of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 10 comedy/action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other reviews are all highly accurate. This is one of the funniest films ever made, as well as being a great action film.I rate this much higher than the general of 7, however, because the film is a perfect work of art. Every line, every scene fowards the action and the comedy. This not a collection of skits and throw-away gags, like most Marx Brother's films- the humor derives from the situation, and the plot evolves completely from the premise. This qualifies it as a great work of art.It is also a triumphant celebration of the joy of life that lifts the spirit, while acknowledging with open eyes the tragedy and suffering of life. Like the Marx Brother's films, this raises it above mere funny entertainment to the level of classic comedy.This is a jewel of a film, and stands up well to repeated viewing.If you like it, Simon is a more intellectual, farcicial comedy starring Alan Arkin that hilariously and pitilessly lampoons human egotism and the military/industrial establishment. This may be Arkin's funniest, most incredible performance.Big Trouble is a a reteaming of some of the same talent that made this film. It is much more surrealistic and avant-garde, being directed by that greatest of American directors John Cassavetes.</fullReview>

You never really know what the real deal is until the end,and it's no use trying to guess what's coming next. just buckle up and enjoy the ride (over the ocean...?).one note...do not watch this for the 1st time on TV.

		<shortDescription>A low-key but very funny, engaging, and timeless movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people don't remember this film, but those who do typically can recite many of their favorite lines. Most of these are classic exchanges between Falk and Arkin, who do such an incredible job of building characters who are credible, funny, and engaging that they make it look easy. After the classic scene early in the film in which the families sit down to dinner together for the first time, the movie takes off at a frenetic pace and you get lost in the action and exchanges. If you're fortunate enough to not have read some of the reviews here and elsewhere that give away important plot details, you will be struggling throughout the movie to figure out who is who and what is what, which is part of the fun. (Although even after 20+ viewings I find the movie very entertaining. It's like watching old friends yuck it up.) Unfortunately, not everyone understands that it isn't just the ending of a movie that must be kept secret; people's real identities, alliances, and *occupations* can sometimes give away too much! Anyway, you might just buy this movie instead of renting it, because odds are you'll like it, and if so (like me) you'll be watching it at least once or twice a year, and begging friends who've never seen it to come over and watch it with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Most Underrated Comedic Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The In-Laws is one of the better movies in existence that most people haven't heard of or have forgotten. It is a start-to-finish funny, entertaining movie that is at once ridiculous as well as intelligent. Scenes such as the gunfight around cab in New York City or the antics of the strange Latin American dictator are goofy but the movie plays them of as normal. In fact, just about everything Vince (Peter Falk) does is silly, but he carries it off with such a straight face and confident demeanor that you accept it. And this, of course, is what makes it such a funny movie. The constant give and take between the ludicrous actions and comments of Peter Falk and the deteriorating sense of normalcy (and sanity) felt by Alan Arkin is what drives the film. And then the ending where it all comes together is wonderfully surprising because there are times in the movie when it doesn't seem like anything will ever come together and their is no real point to any of the actions.A very swiftly moving plot, unforgettable characters and memorable lines and sight gags are what make "The Inlaws" one of the better comedies of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the ALAN ARKIN perspective....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Insanity, improbability, and a great team (Alan Arkin, Peter Falk) make this a one of a kind comedy. Arkin as an extremely meek, mild-mannered dentist with a quiet suburban life, is perfect foil for Peter Falk (who you never really believe), as a man who presents himself as businessman, gangster, or rogue CIA agent, depending on his company. Their respective families (and incompatible lifestyles) are brought together as the nuptials of their children approach, therefore the title of the film.Peter Falk complicates the life of an unsuspecting Arkin by involving him in felony robbery, gangster chases, and a world wide counterfeiting scheme. There is literally no place to hide, all official (and unofficial) agencies are after him/them. Falk's unshake-able calm, in the face of any danger (bored, been there/done that), is in stark contrast to the controlled, ever-building insanity that is overtaking Alan Arkin. Arkin, by the way, steals the show. It makes for a great vehicle for Arkin, who eventually becomes visibly "numb" to his situation. So "numb", in fact, unexpected heroics seem to be the logical thing for him to do.The resolution of the movie deserves a round of applause for a very inventive script. You won't tire of this movie, it gets better with each viewing. And, one more thing, after you see the film, expect the word "serpentine" to bring a smile to your face, whenever you hear it...</fullReview>

It is an insanely funny film that compares favorably with the classic screwball comedies of yesteryear. Only instead of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, we get Alan Arkin and Peter Falk. Although they don't quite function as a romantic duo, the pairing of the characters of Dr. Shelly Kornpett, as the deadpan, increasingly desperate dentist, with Vince Ricardo, as a renegade CIA agent extraordinaire, works wonderfully. Along with everyman Shelly, you will be sucked into the zany, alternate world of agent Ricardo.

While the plot is appropriately whacked out, what is truly delightful--and perfect--is watching a normal, everyday type like Alan Arkin become gradually more and more unhinged as Peter Falk's character involves him in plot after crazy plot. It all culminates in a happy ending, but getting there is the whole story and provides continuous laughs.Excellent acting by the entire cast--even the bit players--and sprightly direction.

		<fullReview>The writing and casting are excellent. Falk and Arkin play their characters perfectly. The key here is they didn't follow what has become somewhat clich in comedies.Arkin's character, today, would be an over the top neurotic. While I haven't seen the remake, Albert Brooks' casting indicated to me that they went that way. He's successful upper middle class dentist with a loving wife and daughter. He had no problems with the upcoming wedding until he meets Falk. Also, none of the things that go wrong in his life are attributable to him. He's truly a normal guy wrapped up in a crazy situation that's far from his "safe zone". He even manages to adapt somewhat well until the firing squad scene.With Falk's Vince Ricardo, they didn't go with a guy cracking jokes, an over the top tough/professional guy, or the crazy guy. He was a normal guy who has an extraordinary job. He's been at it so long, none of it phases him, because it's normal for him. His funny lines come from treating these situations as everyday occurrences. He can babble about pea soup after being shot at because it's like a train being late to him. He's not funny because he's trying to be funny. He's funny because he's completely calm in an outrageous situation. The only time he breaks this is during the dinner scene where he yells at his son. It's there that you realize he's paid a price for his secret life.</fullReview>

Falk and Arkin were born to play these roles (OK, maybe that Columbo guy too.)I guess what separates those who enjoy this movie and those who hate it (there is no middle ground) is the extent to which the viewers "get it".

		<fullReview>This is one of those lesser known comedy classics that I never would have seen if it hadn't been for my parents dragging it out of their old HBO-taped video library. It's become sort of a cult classic in my family. Every so often, we'll be walking out of our car and someone will shout "Serpentine, serpentine!" Just one of the classic moments in this film that you'll chuckle about every time you look back on this film.The plot has great turns, which is something most recent comedies seem to neglect. Only "Something About Mary" has accomplished the mingling of plot twists with great comedic bits that was standard in a good 70's comedy. And this is one of the best.If you enjoy this one, you should also look for "Hopscotch" with Walter Mathau.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The In-Laws is one of the great underappreciated comedies. The scene where Peter Falk launches into the diatribe about the Tse-tse flies ("Jose Grecos de Muertos"--flamenco dancers of death)--it really must be seen by anyone with an interest in comedy. One of my ten favorite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A buddy movie you can be friends with.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most buddy movies feature a wild character and the sedate counterpart. And they uniformly wind up together at the end, in a predictable follow-the-numbers fashion. In this movie Peter Falk seems to be a do-it-himself CIA operative who elicits the help of his soon to be in-law Alan Arkin. Both are completely believable in their respective roles, and as they work their way through New York thugs and Central American dictators, Arkin warms up to the ludicrous lifestyle of Falk.To me, neither has had a more appropriate role or has been more effective. Funny all the way through and even with a touch of suspense, as you can't be sure of Falk's identity, or if Arkin will stick to his safer instincts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant imagine a BETTER CASTING MATCH in the last 30 years...mm maybe "Butch Cassidy and the Sunshine kid." Arkin and Faulk what a casting. Whats makes this film a priceless Gem is that they didn't try to milk this with sequel. WE ALL KNOW that in todays Film $$$ machine with casting this good they would have milked these two guys to death with 3 more films that would pale in comparison and take away from the magic of the original. As we saw...Hollywood tried to make money off the name and do some half fast remake. Even though I thought that Albert Brooks was a good choice mainly because he is uptight in ALL his films..I didn't understand the casting of Michael Douglas. The chemistry just didn't work.The key of the original film was that the audience assumed that Faulk was just some bumbling wacko but as the film progressed the audience started to think that Faulk was smarter then all of us. Now that i think about it...this casting dynamic is emulated all the time and i can not think of a film that gets it as right as this one!! ....Rich Tancredi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is one of the greatest comedies ever filmed. It has so much humor of many types, i.e. not just sophomoric or slapstick or neurotic. It is dry at times and juvenile at times with absurdities cropping up. It is truly hard to express how much I enjoy it. The writing is just top notch. The acting is as the craft was intended to be. I don't think 2 minutes go by without a line being spoken that is side-splitting funny. Others have given you synopses (plural?) so I wont waste the time but I urge you strongly to get this and watch it. If you are down you will be lifted and if you are already in a great mood you will enjoy it all the more. ENJOY!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puts the Comedy Meter Through the Roof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to making a comedy that `works' (read: Generates some real LAUGHS), if you start with a polished script, plug in the right actors and find a director with some insights into human nature, a good sense of timing and enough experience to know just when to push which buttons, you can win the gold. Well, in 1979, a trio of producers-- which along with William Sackheim included the director, Arthur Hiller, and one of the lead actors, Alan Arkin-- started with a polished screenplay (by veteran screenwriter Andrew Bergman), plugged in the right actors (Alan Arkin and Peter Falk) and found a director (Hiller) with plenty of insights into the human condition, an impeccable sense of timing and a resume that included experience working with the likes of Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Bette Midler, Steve Martin, Dudley Moore, Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, and-- you guessed it-- they struck gold, big time, with `The In-Laws,' an hilarious comedy that examines what happens when an ordinary guy is placed in an extraordinary situation. And it all begins simply enough with the impending marriage of his daughter, and the day he meets the people who, for better or worse, are about to become her in-laws, as well as a part of his own extended family. With the emphasis definitely NOT on the `better.'Sheldon Kornpett (Arkin) is a dentist with a successful practice in New York, a loving wife, Carol (Nancy Dussault) and a daughter, Barbara (Penny Peyser), who is engaged to Tommy Ricardo (Michael Lembeck). The wedding is less than a week away, and the Kornpett's have yet to meet the Ricardos, due to the fact that Tommy's father, Vince (Falk), purportedly the owner of something called Trans Global Enterprises, is rarely around or home long enough for the soon-to-be-related families to have that all-important get-together. Finally, however, it's all arranged, and the Kornpett's anxiously await the arrival of Vince and his wife, Jean (Arlene Golonka) to their home for dinner. And though Sheldon doesn't know it yet, it's a night that is going to change his life forever; and by the day of the wedding, he will have done things and been to places he wouldn't have imagined in his wildest dreams, all courtesy of his newest and best friend, Vince Ricardo.The film opens with a glimpse into what appears to be the covert existence of Vince Ricardo, for whom Trans Global is obviously a front of some kind. So the viewer already has a leg up on Sheldon, who at this point has no reason to take Vince at anything other than face value. Until they meet and spend an evening together, during which time Vince relates a most bizarre story and has his penchant for taking concealed phone calls in such places as the basement revealed, which raises more than a few questions in Sheldon's mind. It's a scene worth it's weight in gold, which Hiller uses to establish the nature of Sheldon and Vince's personalities, as well as the relationship between the two strangers who in a few days will be family. And in that one hilarious scene, you realize instantly that you're dealing with a cinematic incarnation of an odd couple that's going to rival Neil Simon's Felix and Oscar. Bergman's dialogue is incisively witty, and Hiller emphasizes the contrast between the two men to great effect, parlaying it all into some of the most memorable scenes you'll ever see in a comedy. The one, for example, that takes place on a remote airstrip (suffice to say that Sheldon has been roped into something he'd rather not be a part of and would just as soon forget about as soon as possible); bullets are flying, Vince and Shelly (as Vince calls him) are pinned down and they have to make it across an open space to a car, but running straight away isn't an option. `Serpentine, Shell, serpentine!' yells Vince, in what turns out to be an uproarious classic from amongst all of the classic scenes from any of the best comedies ever made, one that puts the laugh meter through the roof.There may be a touch of `Columbo' in Vince, but overall this is one unique character and Falk plays him for all he's worth. On the surface, Vince is a screwball who is seemingly forever off in some Never-Never Land of his own devising, a guy who is hard to pin down, harder to read and seems to lack the focus necessary to get from point A to point B without the help of some kind of divine intervention. But underneath he's a sly one who never gets rattled and knows exactly what he's doing at every step of the way. So what initially appears to be a broadly sketched character is in reality concisely drawn and steeped in nuance. As portrayed by Peter Falk, Vince is a guy you're not likely to forget any time soon.It's Alan Arkin, then, who chimes in with a character who is the perfect counterpoint to Vince. In Sheldon Kornpett, what you see is what you get. Arkin delivers a wry portrayal of a man to whom routine and normalcy is the barometer of life, a guy who fixes teeth for a living, provides for his family, has a nice home, a nice car and believes in a future for all that holds promise, with no reason to think otherwise. Until he meets Vince, that is. And he suddenly finds himself cast into a world he would deny to his last breath even existed. Arkin's performance is brilliantly understated, and the humor of the film evolves naturally and directly from the way he plays it SO straight, as well as the way he and Falk play off of one another. With precision timing and especially the performances of Arkin and Falk, `The In-Laws' is a memorable comedy that's going to have you literally on the floor, laughing until it hurts.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fred and Ginger without the boring plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This hilarious movie reminds me of one of those 1930s black-and-white Astaire/Rogers musicals: silly and boring plots involving mixed identities or whatever, illuminated periodically by stunning songs and dances. Now take away the boring parts. That's more or less what Larry Gelbart has written. Each time I see this movie it seems funnier than the last. The outrageous verbal and visual gags are strung so tightly together that they scarcely leave breathing room between the guffaws. A joke occurs, and you think, "Well, that's it for a while," but no -- another comes on top of it. Libertini as the dictator does his Senor Wences number before dinner. (A general sense of chuckling here.) When you think it's over, Libertini makes his fist say, "Quiero agua fria!" and pours a glass of cold water into the funnel of his hand. The performers perfectly match their parts. Falk's CIA man is lunatic and confidently reassuring by turns.He buries his face in a napkin and bursts into a torrent of sobs at the prenuptial dinner table before Arkin's simple toast to the couple can even get started. During the dinner he describes the time he spent with natives in the Central American jungle. The gigantic tsetse flies carried off the little children in their beaks. "The natives called them 'Jose Grecos de muertos', the flamenco dancers of death." Has there ever been a better straight man than Arkin is in this movie? He seems to stumble through the story with his face frozen in disbelief at what is happening to him -- about to be shot by a firing squad he moans, "I've only had four women in my life, and two of them were my wife." And Libertini boasting about how many thousands of dollars he paid for each piece in his art collection, a few paintings of tigers and nudes in day-glo colors on black velvet. (I keep thinking he must have one of Elvis in a safe somewhere.) On an airplane that is kidnapping Arkin and taking him to a Caribbean Island, flown by a Chinese crew, James Hong sits in front of Arkin and for several minutes cheerfully explains emergency procedures to him, how to blow up the life vest and use the oxygen mask, demonstrating his instructions, the lecture seems to go on and on -- all in Cantonese! This is one of those comedies that makes me smile just thinking about it, the way that the puking fat man does in "Monty Python's Meaning of Life." See it if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straight and narrow New York Dentist Sheldon Kornpett (Alan Arkin)is reaching an exciting time in his life. It the upcoming wedding of his pride and joy daughter Barbara to Tommy Ricardo.Tommy has parents and it's not so much about Tommy but it's the IN-LAWS. Mainly Tommy's eccentric off the wall seat of his pants C.I.A. government agent Father Vince (Peter Falk). Vince after meeting the Kornpett's for the first time at their home goes off to their basement. Plants some evidence in the Kornpett"s basement. The next day Mrs Kornpett discovers the piece of evidence and calls in the government agents. That same day Vince interrupts our Dentist during his busy time,(office filled with patience's) and asks him for a small favor if he could leave his office for a few minutes, break into his office and retrieve something. One thing leads to another and the two are off and running. They drive around a Manhattan as thugs or counterspies chase them. When the two Vince and Shel find out that his home is swarming with agents wanting some answers it's off to Titerboro airport. Just a thought, Vince reminds me of a pushy classmate who makes you do stuff you wouldn't normally attempt. Vince is so matter-of-fact and is never phased by any anything that is thrown his way. Next it's off on a private jet with friendly Asian crew and plenty of magazines. Shel and piloted by Vince fly to some off the map Latin country where their national flag is that of a Naked woman. Our Dentist is overwhelmed and inconsolable and wondering how he ever got mixed up with this so call agent who has a knack for criminal tendencies. Upon their arrival,things go from bad to worse as the two are being shot at by Nationals on the tarmac as Vince suggests that Sheldon serpentine to avoid the onslaught of bullets.They get a room at a downtown fleabag hotel. Vince claims, "You've done enough Sheldon and I really appreciate that so wait here and I'll go off to meet the Dictator by myself." Sheldon has a bad feeling and comes along anyway. Next our two meet the dictator/Presidente of the country and have a nice lunch as Sheldon asked, "The food is exquisite, "Can I get the recipe?" Unfortunately Sheldon and Vince can't share the gourmet fare because after dessert it's off to the firing squad for execution. This all reads bad on paper but it's all laughs from start to finish. Will the father of the bride make the wedding in time. Will the father of the groom think of a way out. No matter what decision is made it's all comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mild-mannered dentist Sheldon Kompett (wonderfully played to the neurotic hilt by Alan Arkin) is getting ready for his daughter's forthcoming wedding. Complications ensue when the groom's father Vince Ricardo (a deliciously dry'n'deadpan portrayal by Peter Falk) turns out to be a loose cannon government agent who gets Sheldon involved in his latest dangerous secret mission.Director Arthur Hiller expertly crafts an engaging breezy'n'easy tone, grounds the wacky premise in a credible everyday reality, and keeps the enjoyably zany story zipping along at a snappy pace. Andrew Bergman's witty and inspired script boasts a wealth of priceless gut-busting lines, with the "Serpentine!" dialogue in particular rating as a truly uproarious bit of crazy business. The natural and appealing chemistry between Falk and Arkin gives this picture an extra big boost; these two play off each other beautifully and make for a terrifically delightful comic duo. Moreover, there are sound supporting contributions from Nancy Dussault as Sheldon's sensible wife Carol, Penny Peyser as Sheldon's headstrong daughter Barbara, Richard Libertini as batty dictator General Garcia, Arlene Golonka as Vince's cheery wife Jean, James Hong as chatty airline attendant Bing Wong, Ed Begley Jr. as nerdy CIA head Barry Lutz, and David Paymer as an eager cab driver. Both David M. Walsh's sharp cinematography and the sprightly score by John Morris are up to par. An absolute riot.</fullReview>

Vince Ricardo (Peter Falk) needs $1.5 million by tomorrow for the plates but his son is getting married. The bride's father is mild-mannered dentist Sheldon Kornpett (Alan Arkin) and the family has never met Vince. After having the family dinner, Sheldon doesn't like Vince and tries to stop the wedding. Vince barges into Shelly's office and drags him out for 5 minutes. Vince convinces him to break into his office to get a bag while two armed goons are waiting outside. After a shootout, Vince tells him that he's actually CIA gone off the reservation to run his own operation. He had stolen the plates to lure out South American cartel who had stolen plates of other currencies and intends to create hyper inflation making the South American debts worthless. The Feds find a plate in Shelly's basement left there by Vince and the two go off on an even wilder adventure in South America.The plot is convoluted. The characters are irrational. It makes no sense that Shelly would do anything for Vince after trying to stop the wedding. The whole operation makes no sense. It makes even less sense that Shelly would follow Vince's lead in anything. It would be a completely pointless movie if not for Alan Arkin. He's great as scared and flustering. Peter Falk is also good and their odd couple chemistry saves the movie.</fullReview>

It does, however, have a fairly predictable ending for this movie. You kind of figured out the ending once you found out about what got stolen. Although Peter Falk played a somewhat comical figure as Columbo, the inept-yet result getting detective; this movie show Peter Falk in a true comedic role.

		<fullReview>Long before "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" exposed the embarrassing clash of family styles, "The In-Laws" took that premiss and created a story that you just couldn't make up, unless you are the un-phased Vince Ricardo (Peter Falk). Vince is ridiculously inane while dentist Sheldon Kornpett (Alan Arkin) tries to politely question his future in-law, quickly getting caught up in the caper of a lifetime. The dead pan serious claims out of Falk's' mouth and the various reactions from Arkin are comic genius. We enjoy Sheldon's plight and to see him warm up to Vince and his antics is priceless! The plot keeps you guessing, the script is so hysterically quotable, and the two actors are a lot of fun in this adventure together! After 30 viewings I'm still ready to declare that Arkin and Falk are the greatest comic duo ever to appear on the big screen. Arkins' classic, "Oh God please don't let me die on 31st street!" is only topped by Falks' deadpan calmness in the face of adversity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>25 years before Robert DeNiro terrorized Ben Stiller in "Meet the Parents" and its two sequels, it was the bride's father terrorized here, ironically by the groom's papa, and he loves it! At first bride papa Alan Arkin thinks groom papa Peter Falk is a lunatic, but the adventure Arkin ends up on wakes him up and brings out his adventurous side, having lacked it in his life as a Manhattan dentist. Falk is involved in a bizarre plot involving the American treasury and a few South American countries, one of them who has a truly wacky dictator (Richard Libertini). From a shoot-out in mid-day midtown Manhattan to a sudden trip to Libertini's country, Arkin and Falk not only risk missing the wedding but their lives as well, desperate to get back in time to give the bride and groom a wedding day that they will never forget.Fast-moving, funny, adventurous, and a definite crowd pleaser, this variation of the "Silver Streak" theme (two opposites paired together in some bizarre caper) is perfectly cast with the dead-pan Arkin not quite so staid but in need of some zest in his life, and Falk a fun-loving lunatic with bizarre qualities of his own who brings Arkin out of his shell. Libertini, the dictator with a "Senor Wences" like hand puppet, has his Spanish speaking army singing American ditties while having a business lunch. TV and Broadway favorite Nancy Dussault ("Too Close For Comfort") has some nice moments as Arkin's suburban wife.A chase through Manhattan is worth seeing just for visions of how the city has (and has not) changed over the past 30 years. Having seen this in the theatre back in 1979, I had remembered the chemistry between Falk and Arkin, which hasn't depleted, and its bouncy musical theme, one which out of nowhere would pop into my head over the years even though I hadn't seen it since then.</fullReview>

The high-strung Arkin goes from neurotic to completely insane as Falk gets him into one pre-marital predicament after another. They end up on the run from a lot of face-less goons all the way to Central America. This isn't as much a buddy film as it is an antagonist film. Arkin &amp; Falk have great chemistry and they're both hysterical (interestingly, there is no straight man). Directed with a lot of finesse by Arthur Hiller from a very clever script by Andrew Bergman. The supporting cast is excellent and features Richard Libertini, Ed Begley Jr., Nancy Dussault, and Arlene Golonka. The fun music score by Mel Brooks' regular John Morris adds a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Think A Pest is Annoying or funny, Falk is both Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting to note, Andrew Bergman wrote the script for this one and the recent remake starring Michael Douglas. This is by far the better version. There are several reasons for that.Arthur Hiller's Direction is definitely better in this one over the newer version. Then there is the more talented cast as Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are definitely more talented than the cast in the remake. It is not that Douglas is not talented, but that he does not fit his character as well as the original actor. Douglas is saddled with an inferior director in the new one too. It is a wonder they didn't get Tim Burton since he is the King of bad remakes, but you can't always get the best of the worst.The main thing is that this was an original and fresh material version of this film. When the remake was made, it did not get a fresh approach, it stuck with the original. In doing so, it fell flat because imitation is not always the sincerest form of flattery. Peter Falk is most known as Columbo, but this is one of several comedy films he made. Falk does Comedy well and this film is no exception. His teaming with Arkin here is inspired &amp; produces very good results.When watching this film the recent loss of Peter Faulk is felt even more as he is incredible in this as the opposite of Columbo, just winging it without regards to details. The results are so funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering all the rave reviews, one would think this movie was something special. I found the film typical Hollywood garbage, incredibly bad on all levels, from a preposterous script to bad casting and unbearable acting (especially by Peter Falk). There is little sense of comic timing and most of the humor attempted is typical Jewish stick, which Arkin overdoes. So why is a dentist in N&gt;Y&gt; living in a mansion that looks like San Simeon, why would he run off on various errands for his imbecilic future in law when he knows hes nuts, and the list goes on. Its not enough to say that this is the point of the film, or some other idiotic rationalization. A good comedy must have some sense of reality to play off, must have an intelligent script, and must have some pathos underlying the comedy. This film, in the inglorious American movie tradition of the last 40 years (with a few exceptions: My Cousin Vinny, Tootsie)is predictably stupid and unfunny unless you believe the zenith of comedy is Neil Simon or Woody Allen. I gave the film one star for some of Arkin's deadpan and another for the possibility the film got better after I turned it off.</fullReview>

Arkin's daughter is to be married just a day or two later to the mastermind's son, though much will transpire between now and then. Falk is somewhat vague about his work. But he talks about Guatemala, tells some stories about giant tse-tse flies. The next day, he's more frank: he mentions he's with the CIA. That probably accounts for the autographed picture of JFK in his office, a picture that involves something he did in Cuba.Very soon, Falk has Arkin mixed up in a Federal crime and aboard a small plane with a two-man Chinese crew. Soon they're in a Carribbean hotel, with a lobby beset with live chickens. Then they're visiting a friend of Falk's, a crazy General, whose art collection Arkin is softly warned to appreciate. Further script elements incorporate stolen US treasury mint, gangland thugs, and a South American dictatorship and its unhinged leader who channels Mr. Garrison qualities and is played by the too hilarious Richard Libertini.Andrew Bergman has written a comedy script that accelerates gradually and crisply, and endows its leads with great clear-cut farce, so that even if the material falters, the manic on-screen presence of able comic actors will be all we could ask of it. For instance, Arkin is one of the funniest men in the movies, and most of his most side-splitting moments come from the pure spontaneity of his reactions to what happens to him, which is not something a script could provide. Only an actor. Under Hiller's simplistic and satisfactory direction, everything keeps going swiftly enough to stump audience misgivings about plotting, aggravatingly inconsistent character development and a briskly condensed time frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Has Some Good Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that definitely has its moments. I have to give credit to Peter Falk, who put on a very strong performance as Vince Ricardo, a CIA agent whose son is getting married to the daughter of a pretty straight-laced dentist (Dr. Kornpett - Alan Arkin) who has trouble dealing with his future in-law's apparent eccentricities but ends up on a mission with him in Central America. The car chase scene is one of the better car chases I can remember in a movie, and the scene when Ricardo and Kornpett end up in front of the firing squad is worth a few laughs. I did think that Arkin came across as a bit too low-key in this movie (although he also had his moments) and to me the movie really weakened once they arrived in Central America and began to deal with a truly bizarre (to the point of being unbelievable) general (Richard Libertini) who has come up with a plan to print all the US currency he could possibly ever want.It's largely fun to watch this, although to be honest I thought this was one of the few occasions when I would say that the remake (the really over the top 2003 version with Michael Douglas in Falk's role) was actually both stronger and funnier than the original. Still, there's nothing particularly wrong with this. It's a fun movie that will keep you entertained. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These Inlaws Need Total Separation and Divorce *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inane farce with Peter Falk involving future in-law Alan Arkin is a CIA romp.The chase scenes and shootings become actually annoying in this film which lacks real humor. When our two heroes meet a dictator of Honduras, he tells them that his army people once worked as security guards for J.C. Penney? This is supposed to be funny. Methinks not.For the straight dentist Arkin portrays, after a while, he seems to be enjoying himself and does pretty well in dodging bullets along the way.The only funny scene here is that woman left with the cement in her mouth as the two fools make their escapade. Maybe, she succeeds because she is quiet. This is what the rest of the film should have been like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was really well done and quite funny BUT why in the world do they have to have so much casual profanity? The name of Jesus is thrown around like a teen age girl uses exclamation marks in a note to her girl-friend. It is somewhat in character but it isn't really necessary. Who wrote this anyway? They certainly are "enlightened" and free of the "inhibitions" that plague those of us who live normal lives. I like Alan Arkin (he was great in The Russians are Coming) and I like Peter Falk as well. I think they could have been just as funny without taking the name of the Lord in vain. It would be nice if God and Jesus got the same respect as some of the earth bound gods.</fullReview>
