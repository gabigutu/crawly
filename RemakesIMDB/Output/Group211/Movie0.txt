		<shortDescription>Extremely Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Tobias (Michael Douglas) is an undercover and efficient CIA agent, supported by the lower-ranked CIA agent Angela Harris (Robin Tunney), and assigned in a dangerous and secret international mission. He is trying to retrieve a nuclear submarine and arrest some international drug dealers and smugglers. Steve is also a reckless and absent father. His son Mark (Ryan Reynolds) is a lawyer, who is going to get married with Melissa Peyser (Lindsay Sloane), the daughter of the housewife Katherine Peyser (Maria Ricossa) and Jerry Peyser (Albert Brooks), a conservative podiatrist of Chicago. Jerry is the opposite of Steve, being afraid of airplanes and living a routinely life. When the two families meet for a dinner in a Vietnamese restaurant to celebrate the forthcoming wedding, Jerry is mistakenly identified as a secret agent, turning his life upside-down. I found this movie extremely funny. The combination of Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks was amazingly (and even surprisingly) good. The performance of David Suchet, as the gay French drug dealer and criminal Jean-Pierre Thibodoux, is also excellent and very funny. KC and the Sunshine Band playing an old hit is also great and completes a highly recommended comedy. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Até Que os Parentes Nos Separem' ('Until the Relatives Get Us Apart')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new "odd couple" is born with a new spy-film twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new "odd couple" is born with a new spy-film twist.Michael Douglas is Stephen Tobias, a rugged deep-cover CIA agent, who focuses more on his work that his life with his son, Mark (Ryan Reynolds) or his now ex-wife, Judy (Candice Bergen).It turns out that Mark is about to get married to beautiful Melissa (Lindsay Sloane) but has yet to meet Mark's parents. Mark assures her that is a good thing. But Melissa's parents, Jerry (Albert Brooks) and Katherine (Maria Ricossa) insist on meeting at least Mark's father.During the first meeting between Mark's father and Melissa's parents, mild-mannered foot-doctor Jerry stumbles in on one of Stephen's spy plans and finds himself swept up in Stephen's mess on the eve of his daughter's nuptials. How will this revelation effect the up-coming marriage and will the two fathers live long enough to get back to the wedding?"The In-Laws" is one of the biggest surprises I have seen this year. I never thought in a million years that this film would be as funny as it is. The odd pairing of Brooks and Douglas pays off tenfold. Their odd pairing and hilarious antics made me think some of the classic film, "The Odd Couple". The film also reminded me a little of the 80s comedy, "Real Men" because of its off-beat way of bringing the audience into the story.Brooks hasn't been this funny in years. His neurotic schtick, which is probably more famous when played by Woody Allen, gives his character such innocence. There were so many priceless moments involving Brooks and how he relates to the spy-world.Douglas seems to have journeyed back to his Jack Colton character, which he played in "Romancing the Stone". There is definitely some of Colton in Tobias. You can really see it when Douglas allows Tobias to put his guard down. That was always the funniest part of Colton and it is the same for Tobias.Another great thing about this film is the caliber of people who are in the cast. You have some great upcoming comedy actors like Reynolds and Sloane and on the other side veterans like Bergen and Brooks. I wanted to see more of Reynolds since he is such a great comedic find. I have high expectations for that guy. I also really enjoyed Sloane when she was in the short-lived WB series, "Grosse Pointe". I so miss that series. She to has a great potential to be more if given the chance in comedy.This film knows where its strengths are and it continues the laughs over and over. I just wish we could have had more time with the supporting cast.The film also has some interesting uses of music in its soundtrack. For instance the opening scenes involving Michael Douglas escaping from one of his spy missions involves a great car chase and a gun battle but the whole scene's overture is accented by Paul McCartney's infamous James Bond theme, "Live &amp; Let Die". It is a great addition as it seems to help build the spy feeling of the scene. Throughout the film there are interesting musical additions, which help put interesting slants and accents on the various scenes."The In-Laws" was such a surprise and is by far the funniest movie I have seen this year, thus far. (4 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, Wacky Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premiering the same weekend as Bruce Almighty, this more cerebral and intelligent comedy maintains its own wacky pacing and outlandish plot with over the top antics that rely more on true comedic humor, especially from Albert Brooks along with the physical/dry humor of Michael Douglas. This feel-good, spy/irony comedy makes for the perfect summer getaway outing without any lavish romantic plot dominating the screen. Candice Bergman gets to play her latest incarnation of weird but loveable matron. The laughs are as belly roaring and satisfying as Bruce Almighty but in a more deeply moving way making more use of unused brain cells. Though a bit extreme in some of its hard-edged scenes and out of this world plot moments, this pre-summer still is a lot of fun. Eight out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome To My World Said The Agent To The Podiatrist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging by reviews in the press and the user comments here, this version of The In-Laws is a pale imitation of the 1979 classic with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. I didn't find it so, this film has a lot of good laughs in it and some fine comic performances.In his TCM tribute to his father Michael Douglas says that when he was starting out in the picture business he avoided taking roles as action heroes because he did not want comparison with his father. At this point though he's definitely not worried about that. The part that Michael Douglas plays, the CIA agent whose life prevents him from having any kind of home life that was done by Peter Falk in the original, I could easily see being done by Kirk Douglas in the Forties or Fifties.Douglas's son Ryan Reynolds is going to marry Lindsay Thorne the daughter of a mild mannered podiatrist who has more phobias going on than Adrian Monk. But Albert Brooks as the podiatrist is just a little concerned about this mysterious father of the groom that keeps avoiding meeting. When Brooks and family eventually do meet Douglas, he bungles his way into a mission that Douglas is on. After that it's one wild ride from Chicago to Paris and back with both bad guys and the FBI trailing both. The In-Laws has some very nice moments and the stars work well together. But the best performances are from David Suchet as the international arms trafficker who's gay and who Douglas convinces that Brooks is a regular Dirk Diggler. And the other great performance is from Candice Bergen who is Douglas's estranged wife and Reynolds mother. As she says she's the only one who really has her husband's number, but she's still crazy about him in certain ways.This version of The In-Laws is an amusing comedy, a worthy next century successor to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Tobias (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Michael Douglas) is a CIA Operative, who's pretends to be an international armed dealers to the European Bad Guys. But he has a tough week, when his only son (Ryan Reynolds) is getting married in a couple of days to his sweet girlfriend (Lindsay Sloane). But he hasn't meet his son's girlfriend or her father Jerry Peyser (Albert Brooks) and his wife Katherine (Maria Ricossa). Now Steven has to make up for lost time for his son and his new family in-laws. But the problem is that Steven is still working undercover, when he takes them to a Chinese Restaurant. When Jerry goes to the bathroom, he overhears Steven talking to a informer (Tamara Gorski) and seeing Steven fighting with a guy, who has a gun. Now Jerry finds himself in hot water, when Steven is forced to protect Jerry from the bad guys and especially the FBI. Which the FBI Agents (Lead by A. Russelll Andrews) thinks Tobias is a rogue agent. Now Jerry has to play along with Steven. Steven wants Jerry to pretend to be an assassin as "The Fat Cobra" to impress a french terrorist (David Suchet). But this french bad-guy has a secret about his sexuality and he tries to put the moves on Jerry! Now Steven and Jerry are forced to get along as the wedding is coming soon. Which they have to accept each other differences for their kids and being future in-laws as well.Directed by Andrew Fleming (The Craft, Dick, Nancy Drew) made an amusing comedy that has plenty of laughs and an heart as well. This is a remake of the well-remember 1979 film, a movie that i haven't seen yet. Douglas and Brooks are excellent in this movie, which sadly it was an Box Office disappointment. When it was release in the spring of 2003. Which it's too bad, because this movie is certainly more enjoyable than the average Hollywood comedy. The cast seems to be having a great time including Robin Tunney and Candice Bergen, who have their own funny moments as well. But it's Suchet is the biggest scene stealer in the movie, along with Douglas and Brooks. Suchet is the funniest character in the picture in his memorable supporting role. The soundtrack is good as well. If you are a fan of Fleming's work or especially that cast, don't miss it. Watch for some amusing cameos as well. Screenplay by Nat Mauldin (Downtown, Dr. Dolittle, Open Season) and Ed Solomon (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Men in Black, Super Mario Bros). Based on a screenplay by Andrew Bergman (Blazing Saddles, Fletch, Striptease). (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modest script but Suchet, Brooks and Douglas are funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The In-Laws' has a mediocre script but the actors successfully elevate the material. Albert Brooks in particular is very good as a neurotic podiatrist. Michael Douglas gives an energetic performance and the two work work well off each other. There are some consistent laughs throughout the film. David Suchet is fine as (MINOR SPOILERS) the gay international arms smuggler who falls in love with Brooks. The script is a gentle spoof of spy films and works well as long as you ignore the various plot holes. Douglas's family is shortchanged by the script, his relation with his estranged wife specially feels incomplete. Still watchable.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really fun and funny movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched The In-Laws one night on TCM, and I loved it!!! It was really funny. It's about a CIA agent, Steve Tobias, who's kind of unstable (Michael Douglas), and his whole life he's paid more attention to that than his son Mark (the gorgeous and hilarious Ryan Reynolds) and his ex-wife Judy. Now his son's getting married, and his fiancé Melissa's father Jerry (Albert Brooks) is the complete opposite of Steve -- the first thing on his mind is his daughter's upcoming wedding. Through a mishap, Steve ends taking Jerry on one of his adventures, which has Jerry totally panicked, especially because now, the FBI think Jerry's behind this huge counterfeit plot!!! Anyway, on the day of the wedding, Steve's assistant double-crosses him and... well, Steve and Jerry save the day. In short, it's a really funny movie, and I'd definitely see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Entertainer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the original 1979 cult classic, 'The In-Laws' is A Decent Entertainer, that doesn't bore. Sure, it's not all-out funny &amp; gripping, but it arrests your attention &amp; provides fair entertainment nevertheless. 'The In-Laws' Synopsis: Right before his daughter's wedding, a mild-mannered foot doctor discovers that his new in-laws are international smugglers.'The In-Laws' has its moments for sure. In the first-hour, especially, there are some really nice sequences. The second-hour, does lose pace, but it doesn't drag, thankfully. The Screenplay is fast-paced, but it could've been tighter in the second-hour. Andrew Fleming's Direction is fair. Cinematography &amp; Editing are functional.Performance-Wise: Michael Douglas &amp; Albert Brooks deliver superbly. Both of the veteran actors, also share a striking on-screen chemistry from start to end. Ryan Reynolds is passable. Lindsay Sloane is good. Robin Tunney does fairly well. Maria Ricossa &amp; Candice Bergen support well. On the whole, 'The In-Laws' is a decent watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The In-Laws: Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks Give Up the Goods, but Where are the Good Supporting Roles for the Others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The In-Laws is a sharp, genuine comedy from director Andrew Fleming. The plot is good, but sometimes, it can feel predictable and completely out of whack, but sometimes it's good to have that in a film. Albert Brooks and Michael Douglas are given the most screen time with what I thought were genuinely funny and deeper characters than they appear, at times though, the Michael Douglas character is predictable with his inner self, but saves it with another great performance. Albert Brooks is funny in this role, in a way, he carries the light spots of this movie on his back due to sharp one liners, which I believe he may have improvised. But the really snores in this film come from the sub plot, a wedding for Douglas' son played by Ryan Reynolds and Brooks' daughter played by Lindsay Sloane. The problem with the sub plot, is it is just not funny or sharp enough, Ryan Reynolds was a complete miss-cast in this role, he just isn't funny. During this subplot, we see Candice Bergen slip into the picture in one of those one liner funny roles that she does so well. Overall, if not with casting of Ryan Reynolds, maybe neglecting the sub plot, with more heavy detail on the comedic action, The In-Laws would be a fantastic comedy, but what is done is done, and you are left wondering what could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remakes shouldn't be allowed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to laugh while watching this movie, and I actually did laugh ... when it was over ... from relief. All of the ingredients were there: great cast, the same writer as the original -- Andrew Bergman. But every line fell flatter than a ruined soufflé. Plus, the plot wasn't as plausible as the original with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin (1979).Granted, the original begins with a long scene that is somewhat difficult to follow, but eventually every viewer is on board and enjoys the show. And there's one of the greatest spy lines of the 20th Century: "You knew Jack Kennedy?" "Bay of Pigs. My idea." I laughed so long and loud during the summer of 1979, I was almost kicked out of the theater.Hollywood really needs to think about their inability to make quality movies overall, much less remakes. Prior to VHS and DVD sales, top grossing movies were re-released from time to time. This should have happened with the In-laws. The story is just as connected with our world today as it was in the late 70s, and the chemistry between Falk and Arkin is superior to Douglas and Brooks.And, there are thousands of novels, non-fiction books and screen plays out there waiting to be adapted to movies. The original In-laws was an inspired piece of writing and acting. Hollywood needs to go after more "original" stories instead of sloppy retreads! No wonder theaters are so empty these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SERPENTINE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are absolutely no words to adequately describe just how truly awful this movie is. Being a huge fan of the 1979 original, starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, curiousity got the better of me...I guess curiosity really did kill the cat!As hilarious and genuinely funny as the original is - I still consider it to be among the funniest films I have EVER seen - this remake is the complete opposite. Whereas Peter Falk and Alan Arkin made a terrific onscreen team, Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks simply don't have it. There just isn't the same chemistry. One of the things that made me laugh so much at the original was Alan Arkin's straight-man performance vs. Peter Falk's "is-he-or-isn't-he insane?" In this one, you'll find nothing of the sort. Albert Brooks (in the Alan Arkin role), whose character is now a podiatrist (as opposed to being a dentist in the original), just doesn't bring in the same laughs...you won't see him running down the street screaming "There's no need to shoot, I'm a podiatrist!" or anything like that. And worse, Michael Douglas (in the Peter Falk role), the secret agent father in law to be who hasn't yet met the in-laws, has a pointless sidekick, played by Robin Tunney, something that I felt weakened Douglas' character...as if the already inept script didn't already do a fine job of that!Worst of all was David Suchet's French arms dealer who suddenly develops a crush on Brooks' character, was nowhere nearly as entertaining as Richard Libertini's performance in the original...hell, even Senor Pepe had more comedic charisma than Suchet in this one, and Senor Pepe was a friggin' HAND PUPPET, for crying out loud!!!All in all, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever paid good money to see (thank God I only paid $5!). If you haven't seen the original, rent it and save yourself the anguish of sitting through this mindless claptrap of a movie. If you HAVE seen the original, and were contemplating a trip to the cinema to check this one out, I have one word for you: SERPENTINE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Actors do a good job with an average plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast does a pretty good job in this movie while working with a fairly thin plot. Douglas (playing Tobias, and undercover agent posing as a Xerox employee) is affable and timely with his lines and humor and I think overall his role is done quite well. His son is marrying the daughter of Dr. Peyser. He carries the movie.Supporting cast members also do a very nice job. I think Brooks (playing Peyser , a foot Dr.) is a bit over the top, but I suppose that can be his style and maybe it was intended. He does a good job bringing a bit of humanity to his character. Candice Bergman was funny and timely with her role as the crazy ex-wife of Tobias. I even liked Ryan Reynolds in the movie (he plays the son of Tobias) who I normally don't care for.David Suchet plays Jean-Pierre Thibodoux, an international arms smuggler. His homo-erotic exchanges with Peyser are pretty damn funny and offer several awkward yet comedic scenes.Naturally, one of the several plot twists in the movie offers a conflict between the soon-to-be wed couple, caused mostly by Tobia's acts of undercover shenanigans. The cause of the conflict is, well- there is no cause for the conflict. The argument is petty but this is just one of the examples of the thin plot. However, its not a reason to throttle the movie or dislike it.Overall, I'm not sure why the movie has done so poorly with its user reviews. It certainly doesn't deserve less than 7 stars. The acting is there, its not shallow or poorly done. There are no serious gaps of non-laughter in the movie. I suppose I find the humor in the movie that other people don't. If you watch the movie, you'll definitely get some laughs and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really. When i finished watching the film I touched my face and it felt much tighter. So, you see what you're missing, all you cynics? I have to throw in my comments, though there are already plenty. Is it possible that greatness always has a lot of negative response? Some movies I love have been praised plenty. This one, from viewing more than one site, seems to have gotten a lot of thumbs down, along with thumbs up. That surprised me.Anyway, seeing Al Brooks as this hilarious podiatrist was great, especially for one who is already a fan. I loved his work "Lost in America," also one of my favorite movies. He serves up that great, Jewish style of comedy in which the comic is saying "aren't i the biggest buffoon you ever saw?" I also love Ben Stiller, who follows a similar style.But Al really got me laughing in this movie when he became "the cobra" against his wishes. The writers are right on with placing this anally retentive, timid, annoyingly perfect doctor in a position where all of his fears are forced to be realized more quickly than he can even think.Michael Douglas in comedy? Why hasn't he done it more? I can't recall him in comedy that much before, but maybe I'm just ...a buffoon!! He was fantastic. The casting could not have been more perfect. Him in a James Bond type, but a comedy was fantastic. The movie was fast paced - i loved that. it just takes off like the jet in the beginning of the film. It is like this super roller-coaster ride, and soon again you're going "wheeeeeeee!!" I also like the guy who played Michael Douglas's son, especially when he says, "oh, you must be working," when he discovers his dad leaning over a body and standing next to a lady spy in a men's bathroom stall. The tone of voice is exactly that of a young man groomed for becoming a lawyer - exactly what was intended. The doctor's daughter character, and the actress who plays here is great as the rich doctor's somewhat spoiled daughter. Her voice is like a 'valley girl" type and is perfect. The wives are just the kind of women you would expect these men to have married, and Candice was a hoot as the new-age ex-hippie type who speaks her mind.What i like most is that i saw the original and loved that, but found it too dated. A remake was in order, and this was the best remake i've ever seen, adding features like more attention given to the wives. I guess the point of this is: see the movie!! Again, though it's really an adult film, it's also a film that one doesn't necessarily have to hide from the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Patch on the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Didn't work for me. Maybe the original spoiled it, but I'm not sure, because the two movies aren't that congruent. What they have in common are a couple of broad traits. The fathers of an about-to-be-married couple are very different from one another. The more adventurous of the two gets the more recessive one involved in some outrageous caper. Everything ends well. And that's about it.The fathers are different characters from those played in the original, and that's the first noticeable departure from what was a very successful comedic arrangement. If, in the earlier version, Peter Falk was a reasonable-sounding lunatic and Alan Arkin was a comfortable bourgeois, in this one Michael Douglas is an Errol-Flynn-like man of action and Albert Brooks is a neurotic mess. As in so many attempts at remakes, the winsome and amusing situations of the original are distorted for additional comic effect until they're not funny at all, just silly. Imagine a remake of "Some Like It Hot," in which the Tony Curtis figure is a no-neck steelworker and the Jack Lemon character is a genuine transexual.I'm not exaggerrating in my description of the Douglas and Brooks roles. Falk couldn't do anything right. He tries to start an airplane and the windshield wipers begin arcing. But Douglas, like Flynn, can do everything. He's perfectly competent. He even turns deadly serious once in a while. Douglas is okay at comedy, as he's shown in some other roles, his bird hunter in "Romancing the Stone" being the most relevant example, but Falk was an inspired lunatic and Douglas is simply not.Brooks is closer to the original's Alan Arkin, and his persona fits the requirements more neatly. He's really good at projecting anxiety. But again, the anxiety seems to be inbred in him, rather than arising from the increasingly demonic circumstances he finds himself in. Poor Arkin was taken by the hand, along with the audience, and led into a loony bin, whereas Brooks is there almost from the beginning. It doesn't seem to get worse for him as it goes along because it's at its zenith as soon as it starts. It's got nowhere to go.That's a weakness of the script, though, not the performances. The bizarre uphill quality of the original is at asymptote here. The two principles are set down in the lair of the villainous David Suchet (excellent) and they stay there. Most of the laughs developed out of this situation aren't as funny as they might be. What I mean is, they're kind of funny (both the podiatrist and the fetishist are, in a sense, "foot men"), but it's the kind of humor you might find in a sitcom. And the laughs don't come as quickly. The original hit you over the head with one gag after another, from the mark of Zorro to Senor Wences to black velvet paintings of tigers -- pow, pow, pow. Here we get an extended scene of Brooks and Suchet in a jacuzzi, with Brooks wearing a bikini bathing suit. It's amusing but it's just not outrageous enough.This one seems to owe too much to ordinary run-of-the-mill action flicks, of which there are thousands out there lining the shelves of Sam's Blockbuster Video shops. My advice would be to rent an action movie or a great comedy like the original, rather than a failed attempt to combine the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the original Arkin-Falk version is a classic, this version is still highly enjoyable and even brings some new things to the table the original did not have going for it. For starters, the opening of the new film is very cool and exciting that stands up with even serious action flicks, speeding along to an awesome alternate rendition of "Live and Let Die" (still performed by McCaurtney...not to worry). Also, Brooks character is a bit more neurotic however, eventually also more proactive than the previous film's counterpart which was refreshing. He isn't just along for the ride by the finale. Excellent music choices here also only add to the fun, flavor and often times the hilarity of the situation (example: the scene with the save smashing into a party with no sound effects but "Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head" over the soundtrack. This is one of the those highly underrated little gems that hopefully more will discover on home video. Very entertaining!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you put a neurotic Jewish foot doctor from New York together with a CIA agent on a case to bust an arms-smuggling ring? And then have their kids get married? You get Albert Brooks and Michael Douglas as `The In-Laws', a remake of a film by the same name from 1979. Unfortunately, the marriage of these two actors doesn't seem as compatible.Both movies follow essentially the same plot line: the daughter of a conservative and traditional family man from New York is about to marry the son of a CIA agent who happens to be in the midst of cracking a huge international case wide open. When things go inadvertently awry, the fun begins as the doctor gets caught up in the scheme and almost blows the whole thing, and gets himself and his soon-to-be in-law killed at the same time.What made the original movie work is precisely what failed about the current version: the movie is not supposed to be about the `sting', it's supposed to be about the relationship between the neurotic in-laws. In the case of the doctor, Albert Brooks is perfectly cast as the doctor/father, blundering and fearful exactly as you expect him to be, as he faces everything from near death to being in a hot-tub with a dangerous (and gay) arms dealer. He eventually learns to ease his anxiety and deal with his situation, just like his predecessor, Alan Arkin, did in the original film.The problem with the film has more to do with Michael Douglas' role. Unlike his predecessor, Peter Falk, Douglas is far too polished. The role of Steve Tobias is supposed to be that of a quirky, unassuming and somewhat innocent but lovable guy, much the character Falk made famous in his series, `Columbo.' With Tobias, you never really know whether his stories are true, or if he can be trusted, or even if he knows what he's doing. This would drive anyone nuts if they were in a tight situation with this guy, and Falk was made for this role. Douglas, however, is quite the contrary. He's not nuts enough ? he can't be; that's just not him. He's too good looking. In the original film, you never really knew if Tobias was a CIA agent till quite close to the end of the film, whereas the new film makes only one half-hearted attempt at hiding the fact, but it doesn't really fool anyone. Because of how poorly Douglas was cast, and how too many quirky aspects of the film were replaced by high-tech effects and more modern and threatening villains, there is no chemistry between anyone to carry the movie.On the positive side, `The In-Laws' certainly had its share of comedic lines, and I found myself laughing far more often than the movie deserved to be laughed at. But that's me. I love Albert Brooks, and I make no apologies or excuses for being easily amused. That said, I left the film disappointed. In fact, so much so, that I rented the original film again, just to enjoy it one more time. Not that I want to turn this into a video review, but it should be noted that the original 1979 version is well-worth seeing, especially if you were a Columbo fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was both skeptical and hopeful. I had watched the original movie not too long after it was released. With Alan Arkin and Peter Falk, it was an absolutely hysterical movie. So, when I saw this remake available on Netflix, I was quite curious. The fact that it had Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks was another reason I chose to watch it.This version had a really great cast. All of the main actors and actresses did their usual terrific job. Albert Brooks was perfect as the neurotic man. Michael Douglas did great as the CIA agent that took crazy risks.This version was entertaining and had several funny moments. I do not think that it was quite as funny as the original version, but was still entertaining nonetheless. I would recommend watching this one. And, if you can, make sure you watch the original version as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film No In-Law Would Enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The In-Laws (2003): Dir: Andrew Fleming / Cast: Michael Douglas, Albert Brooks, Candice Bergen, Robin Tunney, Ryan Reynolds: Big disappointment about the secret lives undisclosed to those closest to them. Michael Douglas plays a C.I.A. agent who has questionable morals and whose son is engaged to the daughter of a foot doctor played by Albert Brooks. He is less than thrilled and the encounter gets worse as he is drawn into a world of crime without any control. The screenplay goes from bad to worse until it hits rock bottom with an embarrassing climax at a wedding. Directed by Andrew Fleming who previously made a much better film called Dick. He unfortunately doesn't display that same talent here. Douglas and Brooks are usually bankable actors but here they are subdued by lousy formula writing that deducts their credibility seriously. Candice Bergen plays Douglas's ex-wife who can see through his act just as viewers can see through her poor choice in films. Robin Tunney appears as Douglas's partner whose actions are nothing short on predictable. Ryan Reynolds plays Douglas's son who is getting married and the role is all the personality of a rock. It is one of those films where viewers are persuaded to love the anti-hero despite the fact that he is totally unsympathetic. The result is an action comedy devoid of worth that lurks shamelessly in the gutter. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melissa Peyser (Lindsay Sloane) and Mark Tobias (Ryan Reynolds) are getting married. Her father Jerry (Albert Brooks) is a mild-mannered podiatrist. His father Steve (Michael Douglas) is a copier salesman or at least that's his cover. He's actually a deep cover CIA operative. Jerry stumbles onto Steve's secret operation and he is pulled into his crazy wild undercover chaos. The FBI is after them. There is a bad guy that likes Jerry. Steve has a side kick Angela Harris (Robin Tunney). Jerry is dragged along kicking and screaming.It's an odd-couple pairing with Brooks and Douglas. Brooks has a few funny moments screaming and crying. The fact that none of his family believes him is somewhat annoying. It's a lot of hit and miss joking around. There is a lot that makes me roll my eyes. However there is enough laughs that I can barely cling to. Neurotic Brooks gives just enough to let this pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Too Over-The-Top Perhaps, But At Times This Is Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie, featuring the usual good performance from Michael Douglas as "deep under cover" CIA agent Steve Tobias, whose son is about to marry the daughter of Chicago podiatrist Jerry Peyser (Albert Brooks, who also put on a good performance.) The movie follows but freely adapts the story from the 1979 original of the same name that starred Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. The characters have different names, this version is set mostly in the U.S. and Europe, whereas the '79 version was set mostly in Central America, and this version deals a lot more with the wedding. The main difference, though, is that this one is way more over the top than the '79 movie, which tried to take the subject a little more seriously. Comparing the two, then, which you think is better will depend on whether you like over the top comedies. I do, and I prefer this one.Tobias is a bit of a James Bond type, with lots of gadgets and a beautiful sidekick (played by Robin Tunney) to go along with them. Peyser's role as a podiatrist somehow seems funnier than the dentist character from '79. The FBI agents on their trail are more bumbling than anyone faced by the "heroes" of '79. Finally, the part of the bizarre general in '79 is replaced by a totally bizarre international arms dealer (played absolutely perfectly by David Suchet) who says that homosexuality disgusts him but then falls madly in love with Peyser. All these things add up to what I thought was a hilarious ride.Worthy of note is Candice Bergen who was strong in a limited role as Tobias's ex-wife. Some of the story was a bit too over the top. The nuclear submarine in Lake Michigan was a bit of a stretch. One wonders how this thing got through the St. Lawrence Seaway. (I would think it would have been pretty hard to hide going through the Welland Canal!) Overall though, even if it's a wee bit too over the top at times, it's still really funny. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood is littered with bad remakes of great films. One wonders why studios even bother. The original with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin is one of the funniest films ever made. On the other hand this updated version lacks in so many ways. Albert brooks and Michael Douglas do have good chemistry but he script is not up to the challenge of reviving this classic. The first half of the movie is pretty good, slowly but surely goes downhill. There are some good moments but they are few and far between during the last half of the movie. The ending is just plain stupid. Too bad, it could have been a contender. Im glad I saw this on television instead of spending money at a movie theater. Otherwise I would be writing a more negative review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never trust the FBI and don't believe the CIA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't ask me how they manage to bring a Soviet submarine in Lake Michigan just across from Chicago. When you start asking silly question you destroy the comedy and the Home Security Department is landing on your balcony, air borne and under-cover if not underwater. Because it is a comedy and nothing else. A silly comedy with spies from all over the world, planes that are hijacked, wrecked, or plain ? funny for a plane ? sacrificed. That's what happens when your father is a CIA agent at a third level of under-coverage, a triple under-cover-agent in one word. Just add to that a father in law who is a foot doctor who does not exactly like things slightly out of the ordinary because it is too exotic for his taste, like flying in a plane, taking a lift to a very high elevation, finding himself on the top panoramic floor of the highest skyscraper in Chicago, if not on the roof, getting down from up there with a parachute, making some noise to attract the attention of a torpedo while strutting around on Lake Michigan with a water scooter, a pedalo without pedals in a word but with a nice engine. But in spite of all the hullabaloo it is fun to have such a father and your bride is going to like every moment of it, especially when it goes with a lot of millions. And guess who is going to perform the wedding? Certainly not the Buddhist monk, the Jewish rabbi, or the Christian preacher whose denomination is not even mentioned. But you'll have to go check in the film itself because I am not going to say. One thing is important anyway for you and you better remember it: a father is unique and you have to take it the way it is, the way it comes, the way HE makes himself available because no one can change a father.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake or not - a fine film, with two great leads and outstanding supporting cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although originally titled differently, this film was touted as a remake of the classic original, with Falk and Arkin. Many remakes (e.g., "The Out-of-Towners," with Martin/Hawn; and "Cheaper by the Dozen" also with Steve Martin) either are poor replicates of the classic original (the former), or bear no significant resemblance (the latter). This film combines two of my absolute favorites - Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks - in as fascinating a duo as were Falk and Arkin. And the story is updated to include the innovations which agents like Douglas would have today, versus those available to Falk in the original. One other important duplication of the original is the film's ability to mix some interesting adventure with a lot of humor - with neither detracting from or pushing aside the other. All of the supporting cast are also excellent, both those with major and incidental parts. This is another asset to this movie, which sometimes is the one thing otherwise superior films lack. David Suchet is outstanding, as in his "Poirot" television series, and in Michael Douglas' "A Perfect Murder." The contrast between his role here and in that movie demonstrate his tremendous versatility. And the scenes between the clueless Brooks and Suchet are worth the proverbial "price of admission" by themselves. Brooks, the mild-mannered podiatrist, has been introduced as an internationally-renowned hit man, to Suchet, the international super-criminal, in France, where Douglas has flown to engage in his super-spy activities. Their dialog, and the sight of Brooks in the spa with a red thong bathing suit are pure hilarity. Candice Bergen also is funny and engaging as Douglas' estranged wife, kooky in her own way. It is also humorous to note that Doudlas' supposed real job is as a toner salesman/office machine representative. In "True Lies," Swarzenegger was supposed to be a computer salesman. These superhuman international espionage types always seem to use office equipment expertise as their "cover."</fullReview>

I am in love with Michael Douglas, I think he is a very under rated actor and for the most part, his best characters go into comedies. I just loved it when he comes up to Albert and says "You lying to me? Cause if you are..." in the scariest voice like he's going to kill you and he'll know if you are lying, Albert of course comes to his lying defense and says "no"... "Oh, OK!" in the happiest response from Michael.I feel that you should definitely give The In-laws a chance, it's a fun movie. If you enjoyed "Meet the Fockers", then come on! You definitely will enjoy The In-laws! 7/10</fullReview>

But first, the homophobic father of the groom gets entangled in a spy drama which involves him unknowingly meeting the father of the bride (played by Michael Douglas) before the designated wedding rehearsal dinner. The entire sequence of events that lead to the waterfront wedding is just plain hilarious!

		<fullReview>This is a great Comedy film with some funny/bad criminals and some off the wall FBI agents and a CIA Deep Cover Agent. Michael Douglas, (Steve Tobias), "It Runs in the Family", '03, plays a very distant father to his family and especially to his son, who is about to be married to a very sweet loving gal. The bride to be has a father,Albert Brooks, (Jerry Peyser), "My First Mister", '01, who is a foot doctor and is very off the wall about everything in life, 'Can't Do This or Do That' symptom. Jerry Peyser discovers Steve Tobias in a bathroom stall with a very hot sexy gal, both almost sitting on the same stool together. Poor Jerry wonders what kind of family his daughter is going to marry into and the entire picture goes around in complete circles in the Hancock Building in Chicago. Michael Douglas plays the straight guy and of course, Albert Brooks simply makes you laugh constantly. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was not nearly as bad as everybody makes it out to be. It was very fun and any boy growing up in the reformed Jewish temple can identify with the Albert Brooks character. It was exciting as a spy thriller. after the movie was over I was looking forward to the further adventures of the In-laws. but that will never happen. The scene in Barbara Streisnads private airplane was funny. Albert Brooks is the king of the one liners, and Michael Douglas was very good as the veteran spy who was not there for his son but does try to make it up to him. Like catering in KC and the Sunshine Band at the rehearsal dinner. Alan Arkin and Peter Falk were more believable as in laws that learn to like each other but Andrew Flemings handles the updated story with flair and Chutzpah. its not in Theatres anymore But catch it on cable or DVD.

		<shortDescription>What an unexpectedly fun movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILER!!!I love this film! From the opening scenes with the revised Live and Let Die to the song playing when they go for a "soak", this was fun fun fun!Michael Douglas sheds his "serious" side and glides between his adventurer with a sense of humour to a shot reminiscent of his soliloquy in "Wall Street". This is the Michael Douglas I love. His hair was always perfect, his clothes dashing, his dialogue easy and believable.The pace was perfect, never hitting a mid-movie slowdown. Characters were introduced at the right time, and never a superfluous character was brought in - each character had a piece in the pie and added to its flavour. We hated the girl CIA agent along with Albert Brooks, which shows she did a good job. And the daughter, the son, both wives, all so well played. Even the girlfriend was good and added yet another little piece of set up for that wonderful shot of groom's head bobbing and bride's look during KC and the Sunshine Band's song. Everything about this movie seemed effortless and fun, and that's exactly what you want. When you watch a ballet, you don't want to see how hard the dancing really is, with dancers huffing and puffing and making painful faces every time they execute a difficult move. They make it look easy, and that's what makes us enjoy it so much.This movie was the same way - not at all hard to watch, and with only one editing error that I could catch. But truly a contender for a scene stealer was JP - he was a joy to watch! He has the best lines in the movie, starting with his reference to his self-improvement with Deepak Chokra to his wife and his feelings about golf. I have watched this movie three times these last two days (primarily because it's been playing on pay TV), and I enjoy every second. The only part I actually didn't care for that much and seemed to be the expected, big blow apart finale was the sub sequence. But, given what JP did to Angela on the boat, I can live with the second last scene with the water.This isn't a movie to think about, just a movie to have real fun with. It is too bad that we had that stupid "orgasm" and "great great great sex" comments during the party because essentially this could have been almost a smart G movie that the whole family could have enjoyed together and we have precious little of those. (So many movies are marred by the one F word or one stupid sex scene that adds really nothing substantial and ruins a movie that would be great for the family otherwise. Do family movies have to be relegated to Shrek and Garfield type movies? What about the 12 year olds among us?)I will wait for the sanitized version to come out on regular TV so my children can watch it and enjoy the comic timing and physical humour that is so great in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first movie I have rented in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: **1/2 out of ****. The In Laws is the first movie I have rented in a while. The last film I rented was the Italian Job(remake). The In Laws is definitely better than The Italian Job for one reason: its actually entertaing. Yet even though its better than The Italian Job, its still not a complete success.The In Laws is a remake of a 1979 film that has the same title. I have never seen the film or heard of it till tonight. So I do not know if the film exhibits the same problem. The big problem with this film is the performance of Michael Douglas. The actor has impressed me before with his performances in Wall Street, The Game and Traffic but he is simply miscast here. I have never seen Douglas in a comedy and after this i do not want to again. I also noticed times when he was trying too hard and as a result became irritating at times.Yet where Douglas fails, Brooks succeeds. This is the typical Albert Brooks character. But Brooks has mastered this character and he makes the movie worth watching. If you do not like Brooks then maybe you will not like this film. But nearly everything amusing about the film comes from Brooks.With the exception of two, the supporting cast is pretty lifeless. David Suchet has some amusing moments. Candice Bergen makes the most of her scenes but she is also underused. The guy who played the cop actually was not too bad either. But everyone else makes no impression. The In Laws is flawed but it is a reasonably entertaining film. There have been many more entertaing films this year. But its nice to see that Brooks is still capable of making me laugh. </fullReview>

Sure, the bullets fly but you just know no one is going to get seriously hurt and everybody will be buds by the end of the movie. Some hilarious, hilarious scenes...nobody flying the plane while Douglas makes omelettes/the blackmail pictures of the FBI Agent/The Ex "I hate you but I've got a room" wife/David Suchet's pyscho mad man...oh man, I laughed...Michael Douglas (The GAME is still an all time fav. of mine) and Albert Brooks are in top form...it may be no surprise that the FBI can't keep up with Douglas' Steve Tobias character, but that's fun to watch too (especially the elevator scene where in frustration the Feds finally take 90 flights of stairs to catch up with him...).Ever wonder if Douglas or Brooks log onto imdb.com to see what people think of their films? I mean, maybe the clock is going on midnight and Mr. Douglas is sitting in his den in his housecoat drinking tea somewhere in Napa and he says to himself "hey, I wonder what people thought of this film...". Well, if you log and see this review - thanks Mr. Douglas (and Mr. Brooks) - I really enjoyed the film!</fullReview>

Had to be funny, I was positive. But I truly didn't expect the movie to be as hilarious and delightful as it actually turned out to be.This is one of those extremely rare films that I literally did not want to end, it was that much fun. From the raucous opening spy scene, played over Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die, I sensed I was in for a real treat, and by the time Brook's character is introduced, fuggedaboudit. Couldn't wait for these two mis-matched maniacs to occupy the same screen. And there are other hilarious characterizations as well, particularly Vladimir Radian (I believe that's his name), whose face looks like a deranged-clone cross between Sean Connery's and Ben Gazzara's, whose performance is so ridiculously over the top it's sublime.</fullReview>

It actually was a new take on weddings and made the wedding seem so much more fun than people who over plan and want weddings to be so perfect. By mixing the world of spys with wedding reception it makes you actually want to go to the wedding. If you see the film you will understand. The raindrop song scene makes everyone kids again and makes getting married seem like the adventure it should be rather than a stuffy event that grown ups can turn them into.This film was such a surprise. I had scene Bruce Almighty and Daddy Day Care which were both funny but not crude as comedies have recently been. (Almighty is a classic) But In Laws was really funny reminded me of the rare film That Man from Rio. I could have seen a few actors playing the bride's father like Danny Devito but this worked. Douglas is as cool as ever. While obviously aimed at adults I actually went back to see this film again and brought my 8, 14,and 15 year daughters. I am sure few kids have seen this but parents perversely and regularly let kids see dark films like American Pie. My kids would never had seen In Laws but they loved it. There is nothing explicit or bad in here for kids except one kind of gross kiss but no big deal. This film is ultimately uplifting and has a style all of its own. My kids danced in the aisle after the film was over. I have to take others of all ages to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie comedy, and Albert Brooks was outstanding in his part. Michael Douglas was good but I like him better in serious parts. The girl that played the bride to be has the most obnoxious voice, and that marriage would not last too long. I would say wait for the DVD which should be out soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good music, and one or two good scenes... but most of all, a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A buddy comedy with action, a mismatched couple of in-laws, loose ends and a general lack of sense. I can't claim that I had high expectations for this... but I gave it a chance, and I wanted to like it, I really did. Michael Douglas is good, as always. He delivers, action, acting and comedy. The only real problem is, apart from the first-mentioned quality, no one else delivers in this film. Brooks is usually good... at least as far as acting goes, and I could have sworn he had me laughing in at least one of his roles... maybe not film-wise, but his guest-roles on The Simpsons were hilarity itself. Reynolds has limited talent, and he's unfortunately cast, in that he isn't playing the typical womanizing teen-ish guy that we've grown used to him being. I haven't seen enough of Sloane to rate her performance according to how well she typically is, or compare her role to what she usually portrays. Tunney isn't really bad, she just has too little to do, and a character that is fairly uneven. She is a tool to bring about certain circumstances throughout, and that's too bad, because she does have some talent. One of the problems is that it's quite simply not very easy to accept these characters as people... they're too extreme, caricatures of perceptions of people. The ex-wife, for example, is stitched together of all the bad and "far out" qualities one could think of. One would hope that fairly few people in the world are quite that bizarre. The seemingly endless sub-plots are another mistake... for a film that lasts just over an hour and a half, there's story enough for a *saga*. Shakespeare could hardly have thought up more story for just one production. And they seem to just show up at random... as if the writer didn't want to deal with just one story or one pile of complications, so he had to think up more, and just kept adding until he had enough to make a film out of. The material just doesn't work well. We've seen the "odd couple" before, the idea of putting two people who have little in common isn't new... and it really isn't put to terribly good use here. The spy stuff and the action aren't bad... though the tension did seem tame at times, and the threat of the bad guys, the sense of danger just... isn't really there. Douglas makes a fine spy, though I'd wager that Peter Falk made a better one(I have yet to see the original, though I certainly intend to look for it). I didn't find the film particularly humorous... occasionally entertaining, but never really funny. The music was almost all good, though. And that's pretty much it... for those wanting spy-stuff, it'll do. And if you like your movies with a side of feel-good music, this certainly isn't the worst you could do. But for most anything else that this could offer, there are better movies out there. I rate this just above average, for the good things that it does hold. I recommend this to fans of the actors and the genre, and anyone with an hour and a half to kill who'd prefer something spy-related with music that is kind to the ears. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a "re-make"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best "re-makes" ever done. Most significantly, it was not originally intended to even be called "The In-Laws", though they do give some credit to the original movie's writer. However, fans of the first one will NOT be at all disheartened at the direction this movie takes: I knew it was on sure creative footing when a key scene in the CIA agent's (Peter Falk / Michael Douglas) office leaves out the memorable discovery (by Alan Arkin) of a picture from Pres. Kennedy referring to the Bay of Pigs fiasco. This effort skipped right past that cliché and onto it's own plot devices. Michael Douglas does a credibly "hip" job, Albert Brooks is Albert Brooks, and Ryan Reynolds is not utilized well. However, the most outstanding performance (perhaps of her career) goes to Candice Bergen as the Groom's wacky mother, but you will have to watch it for yourself to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny English meets Meet the Parents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas tries to juggle being a spy, making a good impression on his son's father-in-law to be, and being there for his son, who's about to get married.You wouldn't believe me if i told you a wedding movie and a spy movie would go together - well, you'd be right.From the cover, you'd think it was Meet the Parents, but its more like Johnny English meets Meet the Parents. Its not a serious spy movie - but its not hilarious either, save a few laugh out loud lines, like Candice Bergen's (a standout, playing Douglas' hippy weirdo ex-wife) description of Michael Douglas to the new mother-in-law: "He has no soul, so he compensates for the fact by extravagant gestures."Gee this is a strange duck. I've never seen such a misleading cover. You pick it up expecting a straight-arrow family wedding picture (not that I chose to rent it - but i'm glad someone did it for me, because i never would have discovered that this picture is not as dry as its cover makes out!) - when its really off-beat.Considering how straight and dry i thought it would be, it was a pleasant surprise, and not too shabby saturday night fodder (though not completely family friendly - are some iffy scenes for kiddies).Strictly speaking, though, its not very good. Douglas and Brooks don't really work together - though they're good individually. The spy portions and the wedding portions vie for prominance and attention in a very unproductive way. And parts don't make sense, motivations don't match up: if Douglas wanted to impress the new father-in-law, why drag him along on a spy mission? It only really worked for me because watching Michael Douglas be an action hero is one of my favourite things to do - and there aren't too many opportunities to do it.6/10. You'll have a ball if you're a Michael Douglas fan. Just be prepared for how off-beat this project really is. Also included are the voice of Marlin from Finding Nemo, Van Wilder and that chick from Grosse Point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>that's nothing new. I thought this movie was OK and had some entertaining moments. A CIA agent, Steve, teams up with his soon to be daughter-in-law's dad, who is a foot doctor, Jerry. He doesn't like to fly and never takes risk. So, of course, he gets caught up in an arms deal with Steve and flies to France and has to entertain a fruity weapons smuggler. And Jerry helps Steve be a better dad by actually finding time to attend his son's wedding. And the two are put in a lot of risky situations, such as jumping off a tall building and using a jet ski to get a torpedo to change its course.And this movie uses a python in a very unusual and unappetizing way!FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it. While not slapstick comedy, there were enough scenes to make me laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occasionally funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a comedy about two families coming together around a wedding. Michael Douglas plays an undercover CIA agent whose son is getting married to Albert Brooks's daughter (he's a podiatrist).Michael Douglas is a fast-talking con artist in this movie and he's pretty funny at it. He's completely shameless as continues working his job - in this case, pursuing an international smuggler trying to buy a stealth submarine - and making wedding arrangements at the same time.Albert Brooks is the man of a thousand phobias, and it's his role to be set upon by Michael Douglas. He's the weak link in the film because I just don't find him funny. Playing the eternal victim for an hour and a half gets boring. It would have been better if he'd riffed off of Douglas' character rather than just going along and moaning about it.There are some funny scenes and Michael Douglas is pretty good at this comedic change of pace, but some of the gags are dumb. The schtick about the "big cobra" deserved a few seconds at most, not a running theme throughout the film. And the supporting cast adds nothing.Just so-so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been many instances where a remake is funny, but just not as funny as the original. In the case of "The In-Laws" I made a point to watch the original which was released on DVD. Although Alan Arkin and Peter Falk were veryfunny, the original had dull moments and amusing moments. However, thisremake with Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks was so funny I left the theater exhausted with a headache and sore throat. There were moments that I waslaughing so loud that my wife and daughter got embarrassed. I've seen mostly all of Michael Douglas' works and enjoy watching him verymuch. But Albert Brooks absolutely steals this film away from the rest of the cast. If you haven't seen the original, don't worry...you don't need to. Although the story is similar in a few ways, one won't spoil the other.</fullReview>

He was hanging tuff with Albert Brooks in the "laugh department" and both were on top of their game. Another welcome surprise was to see K.C. And The Sunshine Band make a cameo appearance in the movie. It's not always easy to make a good action/comedy, but this was on the money!

		<fullReview>I've never seen the original, but I must say this is a funny funny movie! I hardly spent a minute without laughing! Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks make a great unlikely team. Like you'd expect, Brooks bangs out hilarious one-liners left and right ("I think my food is still eating"). The soundtrack is filled with cool songs like "Live and Let Die," "Get Down Tonight," etc. You can argue that some of the gags are cheap and scatological, but they still work. The film has a fast pace and some exciting action sequences to boot. My only minor criticism is the casting of Ryan Reynolds, who should be fired from the movies altogether. He is a completely one-note actor, whose dry sarcasm gets incredibly annoying. Luckily, he's not in the film long enough to ruin it. But I do like Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, and they're great in the film. Even Candace Bergen has a funny little supporting role. If you're in the mood to laugh, laugh and laugh some more--go see "The In-Laws"!My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

I'm not sure how Candice Bergen reined in, but she did. The stunts are excellent, we especially enjoyed the jets whizzing away from the action scenes.

Don't let the slapstick nature of the film fool you. It is funny, and has some belly busting scenes. There is some dependence on the modern use of computer generated images.

		<shortDescription>Another film that should not have been remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just another reason why Hollywood should stop remaking older (This time not so old) films and concentrate on original scripts but if there is a good sign it's that many of these remakes are bombing. In case you haven't seen the original film this story is about the upcoming marriage between a young man and woman and their in-laws meet for the first time just days before the wedding. Jerry Peyser (Albert Brooks) is a meek podiatrist and his daughter Melissa (Lindsay Sloane) is marrying Mark (Ryan Reynolds) but her family doesn't know the truth about his father Steve Tobias (Michael Douglas) who is an undercover CIA agent. Once they meet Jerry is dragged into the chaotic and dangerous world of spies and when he tries to tell his family they don't seem to believe him.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Steve drags Jerry to France where they encounter an arms dealer named Jean-Pierre Thibodoux (David Suchet) and he wants to buy a secret submarine for his smuggling. Thibodoux is gay and falls in love with Jerry who goes along with the situation while Steve sneaks around. Once they get back home they have to run from the FBI but none of this will stand in the way of the upcoming wedding of their children.This film is directed by Andrew Fleming who is a good and competent director but once you remake something then the inevitable comparisons can't be ignored. Two reasons why this film fails and one is the script that just goes so overboard that it leaps into incredible excess. Are we really suppose to believe that the FBI guys couldn't catch them sooner? The second reason is the casting and this is why the first film was so enjoyable. Peter Falk would ramble on with these outlandish stories that were truly funny but Douglas is miscast as a world roving scalawag type. Brooks has always been a very talented comedic actor but his forte is a droll wit and to make subtle sarcasms about a realistic situation that he's involved in. He's also out of sync and it's because the situations his character is involved in with this film are so ridiculous and over the top that whatever he has to say is unimportant considering the mayhem thats going on. The first film was creative and inventive and had a script that kept you laughing until the end but this is just another bad remake that meanders along without any conviction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The In-Laws (2003)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The In-Laws opens with what looks like stock footage from a bad Bond movie: it begins with a shot of a submarine and leads to a car/airplane chase with Paul McCartney's "Live and Let Die" unintelligibly playing in the background. And at some point you have to ask yourself: is this really how you want your movie (which claims to be a romantic comedy) to start out? The In-Laws (2003) is a remake of a 1979 Alan Arkin-Peter Falk comedy which, while I have yet to see, I'm going to assume is a shade better than this mess. The remake was adapted from Andrew Bergman's original screenplay by Nat Mauldin and Ed Solomon, both of whom have had previous experience refiguring (and often butchering) other people's ideas: Bergman was responsible for 1998's Dr. Dolittle and Solomon for 2000's Charlie's Angels. Interestingly enough, Solomon is the son-in-law of John Cleese and Connie Booth (who gave us Fawlty Towers, the greatest sitcom of all time); apparently, comedy doesn't run in the family. The screenplay is absolutely ludicrous. Not only is the plot a mess, but the lines they try to pass off as jokes are totally incoherent. I suppose one could blame this on bad timing, but the true problem lies in bad writing. Every word is recycled from some other mediocre comedy, and in the end the project was just an attempt to cash in on the success of Meet the Parents. The premise (which really couldn't matter less) is as follows: the son of a laid-back CIA agent (played by Michael Douglas) is marrying the daughter of an obsessive-compulsive pediatrist (played by Albert Brooks), and hilarity (supposedly) ensues. How many times can you laugh at the same joke, when it wasn't even funny to begin with? Douglas and Brooks do their best with what they're given, but by doing this their performances turn out to be more tragic that comedic. And the rest of the cast gives some of the worst performances of the year, in particular Lindsay Sloane and Ryan Reynolds as the soon-to-be-newlyweds, and Robin Tunney as Douglas's partner. Also, I don't know whether to applaud or condemn David Suchet's bizarre turn as a gay French smuggler. And poor Candice Bergen: time was she would star in The Wind and the Lion with Sean Connery, or Gandhi with Ben Kingsley. But starting in 2000 with Miss Congeniality, she followed a slippery slope of cheap romantic comedies (including Sweet Home Alabama and View From the Top) that has landed her here. In The In-Laws, she plays Douglas's ex-wife, a somewhat odd and tempestuous woman who comes off as the ghost of Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. And what does this all add up to? One big sad failure, that's what. When KC and the Sunshine Band make a cameo appearance at a wedding rehearsal, it was as if they were sealing the movie's fate; like them, The In-Laws (2003) is bound for infamy, only instead of being played on the radio whenever the DJ can't think of what to put on next, it will most likely be shown to death on some cable channel owned by Ted Turner in a last desperate attempt to make up the money it lost at the multiplex. Either way, it won't be remembered ... which I suppose is a good thing for Douglas and Brooks. Speaking of which, if you have some strange desire to see Brooks play a bumbling conservative father and are tempted to check this movie out, rent Finding Nemo instead. I'm sure he'd appreciate it.SIDE-NOTE: During the ending wedding sequence, you might recognize the piece of music that is playing in the background: it's the theme from Good Will Hunting. Which leads me to wonder: is this really how Danny Elfman wanted his Oscar-nominated score to end up being used?Grade: D</fullReview>

While I liked the concept and I liked Albert Brooks and Michael Douglas, this movie had far too many pratfalls in direction and writing to be called a winner. If the jokes had managed to create some laughs, this would have been a rather entertaining movie. Instead, it will have to be listed in the `mildly entertaining category.'It's hard to put down the performances, because I felt they were all pretty good, but it just felt likethe writers didn't try hard enough. This is one of those films that could have certainly been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In-Laws" In Trouble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Sometimes there are those days when you are apathetic towards working and just want to hang around the house and do nothing. Now you might say that a movie reviewer SHOULD be immune to this, but that was where I found myself on Memorial Day weekend-nothing that I wanted to badly see was out, but I decided to end my end my torpor and get up and see `The In-Laws'. The film opens up in Prague, where Steve Tobias (Michael Douglas) is busy brokering a deal for a Russian nuclear submarine, which is broken up by what appears to be the Czech Police, which requires some tricky driving to escape. The scene then shifts to Chicago, where our other protagonist, Jerry Peyser (Albert Brooks), an obsessive and phobic podiatrist is busy hammering out details for his daughter's (Lindsay Sloane) upcoming marriage to Tobias' son (Ryan Reynolds). In what could be seen as an outrageously incredible series of events, Peyser finds himself an unwitting and unwilling accomplice of Tobias, who as a deep-cover CIA agent, has been tasked to nab both the buyer and seller of the submarine. The two adventure to France to meet the buyer, a thoroughly odd arms dealer, Jean-Pierre Thibodoux (David Suchet), who has, uh, more things on his mind than submarines. This is a classic case of a Tale of Two Movies-a good one and one not-so-good. I think today, I will discuss the smaller part-the good part. For one thing, the writing of the film was witty and engaging, with multiple barbs thrown out that are pretty dang funny. With this writing, Brooks and Douglas are allowed to play off of each other to, in a sense, become `The Odd Couple' of the new millennium. They are an excellent coupling and a magnificent piece of casting by director Andrew Fleming. And for the not-so-good? Two things really got my goat here, the first of which being the immensely cheesy special effects. The first shot of the film is of the submarine in question, the problem is that I have seen much better rendering in video games, so what is seen is just well, stupid. Also, for most of the action shots the actors so obviously stand out from the picture behind them, that it makes one wonder if he has been transported back to the 1960s where such distinction was commonplace. Shoddy, just plain shoddy. Also, `The In-Laws' is, for lack of a better expression, badly out of touch with reality. I cannot say too much, for fear of ruining the ending, but I can safely say that certain key features of geography in the Great Lakes waterways are blatantly ignored and an underwater weapons system ignores physics in an unforgivable manner (among other things). I suppose that this was a bit of an unusual switch to watch-good writing, but lousy special effects, but `The In-Laws' managed to pull it off. Still, with a decent portion of the movie being good, and only the special effects being truly pathetic, I can give this movie a 5 out of 10, just because I say I can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first walked into this movie I was expecting a complete bomb from all the bad reviews. What I got was actually an okay movie-going experience. I did laugh quite a bit through the movie and Douglas and Brook's had great chemistry. Brook's did a great job as his usual neurotic every-man and basically stole the show. My only complaint is that the movie completely ran out of steam once he got out of the hot tub in a thong. They tried to milk every laugh they could after that which simply didn't work. Also, I found the sappy romance story-line between the soon-to-be married couple contrived and I wish they'd have focused all their energy on Brook's and Douglas because they really shined. Of course the bride's goofy friend could have been cut completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the new version of "The In-Laws" at a sneak preview last night. I hesitate to call it a remake of the classic 1979 comedy because, well, if they done a true remake of the original movie, the new one would have been funny. "X2" has more laughs.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:The same general story applies here. Michael Douglas is a CIA agent whose son is marrying foot doctor Albert Brooks' daughter. Douglas meets Brooks for the first time and immediately sucks the meek doctor into his world of international intrigue. So far, so good. Here, though, the problems begin. And they are many. Too many to list here. Suffice to say, the story makes absolutely no sense, the direction is incoherent, and each joke lands with such a thud you actually start feeling bad for the actors.Douglas isn't given anything funny to do here. He pales in comparison to Peter Falk. (To be fair, Falk WAS given a great character, but he also played it to the hilt.) Andrew Fleming's direction has all the grace of an oil slick, careening wildly from action to "comedy" to sentimental nonsense. The biggest waste, though, is Brooks. Any director should be thrilled to have him in a comedy; Brooks could read a menu and it would be funny. But most of his dialogue is given to shrieks of fear and complaints that he's going to die, or that he wants nothing to do with Douglas. He's more annoying than funny. (Candice Bergen is also given nothing to do, but no one's going to see this for her.)As it stands, the new "In-Laws" is a remake in name and general plot outline only. To say otherwise is to diminish the genius of Andrew Bergman, Peter Falk, and Alan Arkin. Come to think of it, if you really want to laugh, save your 10 bucks, and rent the original. As of May 11, 2003, "The In-Laws" is my worst film of the year. And I've seen "Daredevil".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Douglas continues 'falling down'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is sad to remember that Michael Douglas made a movie back in 1993 called "Falling Down", which was ended being true to his career after that. It was excellent, then Final Disclosure was very good, then The American President was good, then came the awful The Ghost and the Darkness, and from then on, to my humble opinion, everything he has done has been a disaster. Each one worst than the one before. The In-Laws is the bottom line. After this, he should start going up again. I hope. I saw Albert Brooks before in Lost in America. I don't like him as an actor, means nothing. Candice Bergen used to be gorgeous, and she is still very attractive. Here she is underused. David Suchet was Hercule Poirot once, then an Arab against Steven Seagal and Kurt Russell. He is a pitty to see here. Robin Tunney looks nice. I don't know who are the others. It should be said that the cast order given in imdb is in order of appearance. The billing order is as follows: Michael Douglas, Albert Brooks, Robin Tunney, Ryan Reynolds, David Suchet, Lindsay Sloane, Russell Andrews, Maria Ricossa and Candice Bergen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just awful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended a screening of "The In-Laws" with a certain amount of hope. I had read all the bad reviews for the film, but often I find these dumb comedies to be quite fun to watch. Coming out of the film, I can say with full confidence that I agree with the critics on this one - it's not dumb, lighthearted, nor fun. It's just stupid, rude and boring - even its short 98 minutes feels like hours.It's a remake of the 1979 film starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks are the leads this time around, but they lack a comedic chemistry - surprising, indeed, since Albert Brooks (who played the campaign volunteer in "Taxi Driver") is a comedian and Michael Douglas is very good at handling lunatic roles ("Falling Down"). But they are lacking a kind of divinely orchestrated lunacy that a film like this should have.The Brooks character was a dentist in the earlier film, now he's a foot doctor. He has many quirks and phobias about the silliest things - we just know that somehow the Douglas character will cure him. Douglas is a CIA agent deep undercover. The FBI has no idea of this, so they chase him around like a pack of idiots throughout the entire film, always about a step away. Tell me: Why is it that the FBI never seems smart enough to send in more than a few men on foot? Where are the helicopters, the police vehicles surrounding the building? You tell me.I'm getting ahead of myself. I'll start at the beginning: Brooks' daughter and Douglas' son are getting hitched soon. Brooks and his family still haven't met Douglas, so they arrange a nice at-home dinner. Douglas shows up and instead takes them out to eat at a very Chinese restaurant - which, unbeknownst to them, is his contact point. Once there, Brooks finds out that Douglas is really involved in illegal crimes when he overhears a conversation in a bathroom (isn't that how it always is?). Later he reveals that he is deep undercover in the CIA. So Douglas transports Brooks around the globe to make a deal involving a submarine named Orga.First they meet up with a French criminal (played by David Suchet, who I once lived a few houses from in Pinner). Suchet (or, I should say, his character) is a gay man with repressed homosexuality. There are scenes with him that are just plain disgusting - including one where he kisses Albert Brooks (I could go another lifetime without seeing that).After that, the two leads rush back in time to throw a wedding for their kids. Madcap happenings occur, along with double-crossing and submarines and sound-targeting missiles.A comedy like this is asking for trouble. It's recycled and cliched to the point where one can close their eyes and know what's going to happen next. Albert Brooks has phobias - he'll learn to overcome them. Douglas doesn't spend time with his family - he'll get back his wife and learn to put his job on cruise control. There will be a villain that keeps coming back. There will be a Save the Day scene where our two heroes get to rescue everyone.The characters are so written - and by this I mean just motions and words on paper - that they never seem to make their own decisions. Brooks supposedly hates Douglas, he wants nothing to do with him, yet all he seems to do the entire time is be with him and follow him around - if this guy really hates him, I'm sure he could find a better way of avoiding him. Then there's the occasional segment when, during a long stretch without any jokes, Brooks will shout, "He gave me a roofy!" (Don't ask.) Comedy misfire fallbacks should not contain the word, "Roofy." Never.This isn't a light, funny, dumb comedy. It's putrid waste that might just make my list of the worst films of 2003. The movie might be inspired, but before inspiration goes into play one must put some effort into creating likable and three-dimensional characters. Or at least expand funny situations a bit farther than just that. I came out of this movie with a frown. That's a bad sign for a comedy. "The In-Laws" are not relatives I'd want in my family.2/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

I can understand Douglas getting involved - vanity. How actors of the calibre of Suchet and Tunney were persuaded to participate, is less clear.There are a few good comic moments, but the greatest laughs come from seeing a positively geriatric Michael Douglas attempting - unsuccessfully - some rather basic fight moves. How he didn't do himself a serious injury is a mystery. Suchet is suitably hammy and Tunney is always good to watch, but that's all the positives.That about sums it up. Bad writing, bad direction, and a star who should have retired 10 years ago. Give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The In-Laws' provides 90-plus minutes of pure, unadulterated imbecility. This ersatz farce is a remake of the 1979 hit starring Alan Arkin and Peter Falk - material which, if this were a perfect world, would have been left rotting in the bargain bin of your local video store where it belongs. Instead, writers Nat Mauldin and Ed Solomon and director Andrew Fleming have seen fit to remount it, this time with Michael Douglas as the CIA agent who's been too busy out saving the world to forge a meaningful relationship with his son, and Albert Brooks as the uptight, neurotic podiatrist who learns he has to `stop and smell the roses' and live life to the full. The paths of these two mismatched men cross when their children decide to get married.`The In-Laws' makes the mistake common to so many `madcap' comedies: it believes that by keeping the action moving along at a breakneck pace, we somehow won't notice that there really isn't anything all that terribly funny going on. The film could have been a riotous take-off on inter-familial complications (like `Meet the Parents'), but instead it degenerates into an anachronistic and wearying spy-spoof with the characters forced again and again into ridiculous and preposterous slapstick situations. The actors do their best under the circumstances, but the non-stop, frantic dithering on the part of both Douglas and Brooks becomes rather tiring after awhile. This is one wedding you will definitely not want to attend.</fullReview>

Jammed into this is every imaginable date movie cliché, like so much mortar between bricks. There's barely any time allotted for the equation to register (couple is betrothed, a perceived sexual wandering drives them apart, but they are reconciled so we can cheer).It exists only as an excuse for Douglas to act half his age...something he's doing in real life, too. Brooks is just a cipher here - he can't quite implant the meta narrative of looking at all of this as a joke.The climax resolves through "Thelma and Louise" crossed with "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid".There is more or less exactly zero cinematic value here...not a single original thought, word or deed to be found, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boring, done a thousand times before. Unbelievably bad. Incredibly stereotypical. Douglas is the hip-CIA agent father who never has time for his son, and Brooks is the square boring foot-doctor father who dotes on his daughter. Every single typical stereotypical attribute is given to each character....(yawn)..... Brooks is scared of heights and airplanes, he never leaves the State, he wears a fanny pack, he is boring and stodgy. Douglas of course, is the complete opposite, suave, able to beat up thugs, knows everything. And do you think there will be any moments in the film when they are both at a great height or in an airplane? And do you think that Michael Douglas will learn to be a better father, or at least figure out that he has been a bad one because he was away on missions all the time? Barf. Gag. Predictable. Don't know if that counts as a spoiler since it is so incredibly obvious.Everything is moronic about this film. The FBI agents are more incompetent than Boss Hogg, the villains are as nasty as Gumby. The plot is absolutely absurd without being the least bit funny. The movie actually started off with me thinking "This won't be that bad", but that feeling quickly faded. Everything was predictable, nothing was original, everything had already been done 6000 times before.Rent "Meet the Parents". It is infinitely better and considerably funnier. This one has nothing to praise, nothing at all. It is a remake of a moderately humourous movie from the 70s, but atrociously directed. On top of that, in 2 scenes the boom mikes practically konk Douglas on the head. Couldn't they catch that in the editing room? Fortunately, the movie is only 85 minutes long before the credits start rolling so I managed to get out before going completely insane. I don't think Hollywood is capable of making good comedies any longer. They seem intent of dumbing everything down, going for the lame tried-and-true and done 5000 times boring old dried up jokes. There was some forced laughter in the theatre at the beginning during the Vietnamese restaurant scene, but even that quickly died out. People started leaving before the movie got to the incredibly predictable wedding scene.Lame. Terrible. A complete waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hidden Agent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein. Albert Brooks breaks my heart. Every time I encounter him I see near greatness. All he has to do is decide.But there must be some price he is unwilling to pay, because every outing (acting, directing, writing) there is a palpable holding back, an imposed meekness that imperfectly hides his light. This is the guy who brought comic irony as hidden loathing of the media to the masses in TeeVeeland through `Saturday Night Live.' SNL has been coasting on his juice since.This is the guy who failed in writing/directing/acting in film after film that in hindsight now seem little gems of innovative, understated comic placement. This is the guy who turned the prolific James Brooks (no relation) from a gag writer into someone who understands narrative distance and the humor behind joking on how you tell a joke.This is Hollywood's most famous script doctor for comedies, the guy that has saved more turkeys than you can count. He almost singlehandedly balances the Kevin Smith/ Affleck/Damon crowd plus Whoopie plus Harrison Ford (when he tries to be funny). He is, in fact, a secret agent.He keeps his secret here, fading into the background as Douglas mugs, and Bergman's 25 year old situation putters along with mechanical madcappery.This could have been saved if he were turned loose, if he were allowed to do what Gene Wilder did for `The Producers.' Even the extent of what he did in `Broadcast News' would have worked, but that was more up his make-fun-of-what-you-use alley.Or if Robin Tunney had been someone else, someone with the comic timing of the ironic not-doubletake, someone like Parker Posey. She's dyed a dark red here to get her into the mood, but the director seems to not have gotten the joke. He should go back and watch `the Freshman' to see how this works: its not supposed to be funny directly, its funny because it is not funny in a funny way, a way that is selfaware and selfmocking.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

Who is he? What is he? Is he on the level? The basic movement of the plot is resolving these issues. Here, for reasons that can only be guessed at, the movie begins with a long, James Bondish chase that establishes the reality of the zany and thus gives the game away.Both Michael Douglas (zany) and Albert Brooks (conservative) stink. The villain is characterized erratically and totally unbelievably, the wedding action makes no sense, etc., etc., etc. This is a completely worthless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything from the original version is amplified. It's noisier, more chaotic, and more bombastic. The actors appear to be competing with one another for screen time to mug for the camera and get the most laughs, rather than work together as a comedy team. Like the original, the respective dads of the bride and groom meet as an engaged couple prepares for their wedding. Michael Douglas claims to be a CIA agent, but acts more like a paranoid psycho. Actually he over-acts. Albert Brooks is also trying too hard to be funny; he plays a sheepish nerd who apparently is an MD. An MD with, it seems, no patients, as he wanders around with the deranged Douglas character the whole time. Even though slapstick is, by its nature, exaggeration, these guys both manage to still overdo their performances. The whole film plays out like, "Look how funny I am!" At some times, the movie is indeed humorous, but the constant pandemonium without letup gets stale rapidly. You never identify with the two nut balls. You never get involved in the couple's wedding. Characters come and go; no one is particularly interesting. Candace Bergen's sarcasm as Douglas's wife is dull and pointless. Douglas has a CIA sidekick who does a pathetic impression of Xena, Warrior Princess.Fistfights occur at random. People jump off buildings. Ratfink hoods show up out of nowhere. Shootings, explosions, utter chaos. Somewhere, it would be nice to know what the heck is going on, and who is who. Well, KC and the Sunshine Band make a puzzling cameo, but at least the dialog tells you who they are, before more unbridled mayhem drowns out their songs. A tidal wave sequence is moronic, and needlessly protracted. A loosely fitting, wild, meandering mess. Slapstick needs pauses to remain funny. You get nothing of the sort, here. If you like 90 minutes and change of Douglas jumping around, with Brooks in panicky tow, this might be briefly entertaining. You're better off with the 1979 original, however, which was much more creative, interesting, and funny.</fullReview>

Or the scene where Vince and the cabdriver are at the bar discussing The Price Is Right, which Vince has never seen. When Vince tells him, "I'm out of the country a lot" because he has never seen The Price Is Right, David Paymer (the cabdriver) says, "What do you do?" "I work for the CIA," Vince (Peter Falk) responds. "Are you interested in joining? The benefits are fantastic. The key is: Don't get killed. That really is the key to the benefits program." Or, Vince's line during a car chase: "I am such a good driver it is incomprehensible to me why they took my driver's license away." Normally the CIA looks glamorous, flashy, secretive like in James Bond and other Cold War spy movies. This looks like the goof-ball neighbor next door and the last thing you would ever expect the CIA to look and feel like. It was hilarious and still is.This remake was nothing like the original. The jokes are jokes you hear all over the elementary school playground, Sheldon is now a sensitive foot doctor and the villain is gay. Everything is predictable and it takes very little thought as to predict what the next gag is going to be. Very predictable and not really all that funny.

The direction is flat, the story is lame &amp; it really serves no purpose but to rob unsuspecting viewers of 90 or so minutes of their precious time on this earth. Even if you are a BIG fan of some of the actors in this film, don't see this film unless you want to dislike them instantly from here on out. Avoid</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A SENSELESS WASTE OF TIME, MONEY, EFFORT, AND FILM. AN INSULTING REMAKE OF AN ENDURING MASTERPIECE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I am used to seeing this caliber of film at the very beginning of a successful actors career. Although I have always liked the stars in this movie. I consider this film a discredit to their respective careers. In 1979 Arthur Hiller Brilliantly Directed Peter Falk and Alan Arkin in the original comedic smash hit "The In Laws". Anyone attempting to remake this Masterpiece of comedy, should have made certain not to blemish the memory of that great achievement. Also it might have been nice had they at least mentioned the first film in the credits? but then again after the mess they made, perhaps that might not have been, a "Favor".Not worth rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another lame remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>let's get serious here. The original "In-Laws" with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin would be difficult to top, even if you had a grade-A script and this bomb certainly doesn't have that. Instead of going for wit and inventiveness we have one more example of "throw money away on special effects and big gags" and hope the audience doesn't notice that this production has all the genius of a bad sit-com. Save your money and screen the original. You'll laugh your you-know-what off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death by firing squad or watch this again? Um, let me think about it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is unbelievably awful - just rotten. I'm stunned that it even achieves a so-so rating of 5. I'm not a critic and never saw the original. And I enjoy movies not so much for realism, sensibility or anything else - just entertainment. This was painful to watch. "Weapons of Mass Destruction" could be nuclear, biological, chemical... or this movie in wide distribution.If you like clever comedies ("Mother"), quirky comedies ("The Big Lebowski"), plain stupid comedies ("Dumb and Dumber"), entertaining comedies ("Full Moon Over Blue Water"), or any other comedy whatsoever, you will find nothing at all to like about this movie. It's sickeningly stupid, moronically idiotioc - I just can't think of enough bad things to say about it but this movie is so rotten I'm tempted to go on and on.This is one of those movies that you just wonder how on earth it could ever be made let alone attract stars such as Brooks and Douglas? And I am huge fans of both. Didn't the people working on it at the time have a hint at how entirely bad the thing was going to be? The writing is hideous - like a "D" grade film student's first draft term paper. (He did the editing as well.) Wasn't there a studio executive somewhere deciding whether or not to release it thinking he was committing career suicide by doing so?It's not always easy to find movies that are simply a complete waste of time. This movie is in lonely company in my opinion as having absolutely not a single entertaining thing going for it and therefore no reason to bother watching it. I guess that means "death by firing squad" for me because there's no way I'd watch this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The In-Laws" is a busy comedy which does a lot of things and does none of them well. Built around a wedding which brings characters together so we can watch them clash, this film ventures into international spy stuff, personal and family issues, action, comedy, and even tries for some poignancy fizzling every average step of the way. I think this is what they call a "popcorn" flick because if you take it with popcorn at least you'll have the popcorn to enjoy. Best saved for broadcast. (C)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Be Laws Against This.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that would have been so much better if it had just been a two-man show, but ultimately fails due to second-rate performers and a screenplay that is sophomoric at best. "The In-Laws" is a mildly entertaining experience as CIA operative Michael Douglas and Chicago foot doctor Albert Brooks meet when their siblings prepare to wed. Brooks knows immediately that there is something not quite right with Douglas and Douglas tries to downplay his life, but soon they both find themselves involved in international smuggling and very dangerous situations with shady super-criminal figures. Douglas and Brooks make an appealing team, but there is not much substance here for them to work with. No one else in the production is believable or interesting. All that is except sexually-confused French smuggler David Suchet who steals every scene he is a part of. In the end "The In-Laws" was all right for a few laughs, but it is just typical summer fare that under-achieves more than it overwhelms. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale imitator to a true classic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE IN-LAWS (2003) ** Michael Douglas, Albert Brooks, Ryan Reynolds, Lindsay Sloane, Maria Ricossa, Candice Bergen, Robin Tunney, David Suchet. Pointless remake of the comedy classic about the odd coupling of in-laws to be (this time its podiatrist Brooks and rogue CIA op Douglas replacing Alan Arkin and Peter Falk) at odds with one another prior to their offspring's' upcoming nuptials mixing international intrigue with assorted comic neuroses. The tech heavy storyline is upped from the original with Douglas coming off as a sleek James Bond type and Brooks milking his dead-pan one-liners for all their worth yet the film overall is a waste of time; by all means rent or better yet buy the original.

		<fullReview>Watched this because I enjoyed Peter Falk and cast in the original so much. Tremendous let down on all counts. Although the color quality and technical effects were somewhat better than the original due to progress in this area, all other changes were a inferior to the original. None of the minor plot changes were an improvement. And the actors were less suited to the roles and there was a bit too much slapstick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrible movie. The jokes are all bad, Douglas and Brooks overact all the time, and the plot is just nonsense. The only thing that is worth seeing is Robin Tunney, she gets better every year, and she can act!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The In-Laws wasn't funny at all. I was exspecting a whacky over the top comedy, but all I got was an annoying Albert Brooks, running around screaming and getting on everyone's nerves, an extremely unfunny Michael Douglas, a boring script and no charme at all. Don't even rent it, it's not worth your valuable time. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reason that remakes should NOT be made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie, humorous, well thought out, complex plot that required you to pay attention which kept you guessing until (almost) the ending credits, and, most importantly - it was very funny. Extremely funny. (That's my review of the original movie with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk.)HOWEVER - this horrible remake is the exact opposite. It's boring, it's slow, it's not funny (well, actually Albert Brooks is funny in this, but, in spite of Brooks, this is a bomb), it has a simple plot, it has lots of special computer generated effects that detract from what little plot and sparse humor there is. This is analogous to comparing the original `Out of Towners' with the remake. The original movie is a classic, the remake is absolutely and without question, a bomb, a dud, a failure, a fiasco - in short, don't waste your time or money (I'll repeat this again later).I guess the only good thing I can say about this remake of `The In-laws' is that it gave the studio the incentive to finally release the original Arkin/Falk gem on DVD. For that fact alone I am grateful, I suppose, to this remake. But don't waste your money or your time on seeing this remake, spend that money on a copy (DVD) of the original and you'll be forever grateful that you did. If you go to the theater and watch this, and you'll be sorry.It really pains me to trash a movie with Albert Brooks - I generally love most of the movies that Albert Brooks is in. But in this case, it is very apparent that he had nothing to do with the production other than to star in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To think that Michael Douglas believes he is still fit for an action role is really sad news for me(and I'm a real fan of much of his work). I mean, never mind the "funny" undertone, the man believes he can still carry a spy/CIA action part, with all thew fighting and flying involved. This is a cross between "Meet the Parents" and "I spy" with immense script loop-holes and really silly, cliché dialog. Pathetic and not funny at all. I mean imagine Robert De Niro's character in "Meet the Parents" kicking ass left and right and abducting the father of the bride to Europe to catch an arms-dealer...!?!STUPID. Albert Brooks seems to have been forced to appear in this(much like his abducted character), and I will not even start on the ugly Tori Spelling look-alike daughter in law of Michael Douglas's character. WHERE did they dig her up from? Is she the daughter of the producer, or what? Man, this has disaster written all over it...</fullReview>
