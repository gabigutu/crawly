		<shortDescription>The time has come to admit that the Rock is just plain cool (***)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate wrestling, but when I saw "The Rundown" last year I had to admit, The Rock is one cool guy, and a perfect action star. He's big and tough, but most importantly he's charismatic and has a sense of humor and a certain softness that actually makes him seem somewhat vulnerable. This is what sets him apart from someone like Vin Diesel, who was all set to be the next big action star but never was because he has no personality or sense of humor."Walking Tall" is a remake of a 1973 based-on-fact film about a man who fights back against corruption in his town by becoming sheriff and waging war on the bad guys. I haven't seen the original, but I'm willing to bet it's closer to the truth than the 2004 "Walking Tall", which is packed with more machine guns, axes, exploding trucks, and gunfighting strippers than anything that's "based on fact" could possibly be. Here, Vaughn returns home after years of being away to find his hometown in shambles and dependent on a corrupt casino run by drug-dealing, knife-wielding thugs. After he receives a brutal beating and his nephew (Khleo Thomas, from "Holes") nearly overdoses on crystal meth bought there, the war is on. My inner 12 year-old says "Woohoo!". Yes, this film is ridiculously over the top. It's also completely predictable. But it's FUN. A lot of fun, in fact. It's extremely fast paced, well-acted, the action scenes are excellent, and at just under 80 minutes, it's exceptionally lean too. Not one unnecessary or drawn-out scene."Walking Tall" doesn't aim to be anything except old-fashioned popcorn entertainment, and it succeeds, yet it has been made with surprising artistry as well. The cinematography is very good, and there are some interesting things done with sound and unexpected fade-outs. Also, Vaughn is an interestingly complex hero (complex as far as these movie go, anyway). At one point, when he clearly wants to bring a loaded shotgun into a fight with him, he hesitates, and brings a less-deadly 2x4 instead. It's a neat moment.So it's not going to be winning any awards any time soon. But I had a really good time, plain and simple, and the audience I saw it with did too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rock is a Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is the next great action hero. He has all the requisites. He is handsome, an amazing athlete with an awesome physique, charismatic, intelligent, and funny. His star power carries Kevin Bray's "Walking Tall".The Rock is great in an entertaining movie. "Walking Tall" though great fun to watch, and capably produced and directed also punctuates that The Rock needs to work on more edgy and quality projects. He is definitely a movie star, who can become a solid actor. "Walking Tall" has to overcome a very convoluted writing credit. This is not a retelling of the Bufford Pussor story, although its original screen writer, Mort Bristein, is acknowledged. This "Walking Tall" by David Klass, Channing Gibson, David Levien, and Brian Koppelman tells the story of returning Special Forces war hero Chris Vaughn (The Rock), who comes home to a small town outside Seattle. The town mill has been closed down, and his old high school bud, Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough), owns the new town casino and pretty much owns the local police too. Jay is not the man he remembered from his youth. Chris is forced to raise his hand reluctantly against Hamilton's men. They leave him for dead, and fortunately Chris survives. So Chris is out to right an injustice, and exact revenge with extreme prejudice. This "Walking Tall" resembles "First Blood" particularly in it's local and plot setting. Props to Director Kevin Bray for delivering on the story line as Chris exacts his revenge. Bray has a clean and lean style. The action sequences are crisp and dramatic. The Rock truly excels in the fight sequences. For one thing he is an big strong guy, and when he is laying "the smack down" on the villains it is believable and thoroughly enjoyable. The bad guys truly get what they deserve. The supporting cast is solid. Ashley Scott (almost unrecognizable from the short-lived "Birds of Prey") is good as the stripper with a big heart who is Chris's love interest. Johnny Knoxville (of "Jackass") is funny and charming as Chris's bud and deputy Ray. I completely enjoyed "Walking Tall". It is a brisk 75 minutes of cool action, and has the star power of The Rock. I look forward to seeing more movies starring The Rock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Entertaining Rock Flick ala Chuck Norris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock takes a page out of the Chuck Norris bible in his rendition of a special forces soldier returning to his home town. He quickly learns things in his hometown are not as he had left them and not for the better. Soon, things come to a head and he has to make a choice as to whether he is going to put up with it, or Walk Tall.As The Rock himself mentioned- the original Sheriff Buford was a white man in his 40's so remember this is an adaptation of a 1970's movie script that was originally "based" on a true story, so we are a pretty long ways out from accurately representing the original events- this is only representing the SPIRIT of the original true story.Fabulous fight scenes, a tense script and some funny moments all are reminiscent of the numerous Chuck Norris movies that portrayed a quiet guy that doesn't take any bull-crap from nobody man!While the script made perfect sense in an earlier time - the Viet Nam era, it doesn't quite fly 100% in this day and age. So suspend a little belief.You may findyourself scratching your head as to how that could happen in this day and age.. well.. it could back then - even though it didn't really haha. However, no mention is made of the actual time period they are trying to represent- yet they mention current items like home depot and cops TV show. The moonshine whiskey sheriff buford fought is updated in this script to be crystal meth/ice.The acting is surprisingly good for the Rock and he is looking manly in this movie instead of the sculpted eyebrow weirdo looks he has achieved in the past. Instead of looking like a dancer in a gay club like he did in Scorpion King, he looks the rough and tumble part for this role.His attachment to his family is acted in a clumsy and weak manner but that isn't really important to the script- even if he only sort of likes his family he would still protect them with his life so it still works for the momentum of the movie.Johnny Knoxville is mainly weak but has some great shining moments where they allow him to be Johnny Knoxville instead of the stupid 1-d concept of his character that seems to be forced on him through the other parts of the flick. At times he is reminiscent of Barney Fife to Rock's Andy. :-)If you want to READ about the real man that INSPIRED this really great story- http://www.sheriffbufordpusser.com/history1.htm (the welcome page has a picture of him)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable action film, but it felt a bit thin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking Tall is The Rock's fourth foray into major motion pictures, and different turn then his previous three trips to the box office. What separates 'Walking Tall' from his other films to date is The Rock is left alone as the sole 'draw' of this film, without a major franchise (The Mummy Returns, Scorpion King) or other star power (The Rundown with Sean William Scott and Christopher Walken) to draw an audience. Is it a success?Yes and no.Overall, it's an enjoyable action film with good a plot, decent characters and acting, and some hard-hitting action sequences. It centres on Chris Vaughn (The Rock), returning home from the Army after many years of service, only to realize it isn't the place he left all those years ago. A former friend and casino owner Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) controls much of the town through gambling, prostitution, and drugs. After Vaughn is attacked in the Casino, and his nephew overdoses on drugs, he teams with his best friend Ray (Johnny Knoxville), becomes the town's Sheriff, and goes about trying to set things right.It is The Rock's movie first and foremost, and his natural charisma and personality are what carries the movie at its core. The Rock plays Chris Vaughn and delivers as well as can be expected, after four films he is definitely looking more in his element. The Rock is supported wonderfully by the surprising Johnny Knoxville (of Jackass fame) who turns in a wonderfully solid and funny performance as Ray, Vaughn's best friend and later deputy. Neal McDonough plays the main villain of the picture, and although he doesn't have much to work with outside of being just "the bad guy", he handles it well, and is matched well against The Rock.This movie is decidedly 'heavier' then Rock's previous outings, dealing with more significant topics like prostitution and drugs, which gives it a more serious edge. It certainly doesn't feel like a 'fun' film, like all of The Rock's other movies to date.The action scenes are solid, and are a firm connection to the plot. Unlike Rock's previous films, the fight scenes are more traditional 'realistic' looking fights. That being said, for action junkies there's definitely something here for you, with The Rock getting into it with his hands, and guns, there's definitely something for everyone.That said, I felt Walking Tall was a little bit thin. First and foremost, it ran at a meagre 85 minutes, which was simply not enough time for a movie like this. Although all the necessary plot points were properly established, I felt the movie needed another 20 minutes or so to `breath'. Everything progresses logically, just much too quickly to build the level of suspense and anticipation I think the movie was capable of. As a result, leading up to the climax of the movie, it almost feels like a race to the finish. More character development and background was definitely warranted, as well as greater explanation on certain plot points.I felt that this was a movie that a studio may have cut for time reasons or ratings (it also felt like it was being squeezed into PG-13), and if that were the case, I'd love to see the full version. I feel it would be a much more complete film, with a better build up, therefore making the payoff mean all that much more.Overall, I enjoyed Walking Tall, and would recommend it to anyone despite its faults. The Rock is being championed as the next big action star, and I have to agree, he has the charisma, looks and moves to make it far, with Walking Tall being a major 'step' in getting him there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The key note here is inspired by a true story. Not based. So who knows whats true and whats not. I doubt Meth was a big time operation in the early 70's or whenever this was based. But nevermind that, this was a fun movie. Yes it's rushed, yes it's 75 minutes long. Yes there is indeed 11 minutes worth of credits. O_OBut if you wanna see a good Dwayne Johnson movie, this is certainly better than the other movies he's done so far. The acting isn't too bad and good IL Johnny Knoxville continue's to have a lot of fun. He's growing on me. the sheriff's girlfriend seems to be a dead ringer (at least for the movie) to Britney Spears. Although just like Spears, her acting abilities are much in doubt. Dwayne's a good actor. Hey he's a wrestler, and he's had a lot of practice in that area. Wrestling is all about acting. ;)7/10Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a Man Makes the Difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After eight years serving the U.S. Army Special Forces, Sergeant Chris Vaughn (The Rock) returns to his hometown seeking for a job in the local mill. He is informed by Sheriff Stan Watkins (Michael Bowen) that the mill was closed six months ago and now the Wild Cherry Casino, owned by his former high school friend Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough), is the major source of jobs and income to the town. Chris goes home, and meets his best-friend Ray Templeton (Johnny Knoxville), who organized a football game with their friends. After the game, Jay invites Chris and his friends to spend the night in his casino on him, but when Chris finds that the casino stick-man is cheating with the dices, he fights against the security men and is almost killed by them. When his nephew Pete (Khleo Thomas) has an OD with amphetamines sold by the security men of the casino, Chris realizes that the town is dominated by the mobsters and the corrupt sheriff and with a huge piece of wood, he breaks the casino and the criminals. He is prosecuted and in the trial, he promises to the jury and to the population that if he is considered non-guilty, he would be candidate to the sheriff position and clean the town. Later, Sheriff Chris Vaughn has to fight against the organized crime to keep his promise."Walking Tall" is a non-stop action movie, with The Rock playing a character inspired on the legendary McNairy County Sheriff Bruford Hayser Pusser. I had never heard, read or seen anything about the life of this brave man, but there are lots of references about his heroic fight against crime and tragic fate of his family, inclusive a 1973 movie also called "Walking Tall" based on his biography that I believe has not been released in Brazil. I liked a lot this 2004 fictional film, with the charismatic The Rock excellent in the role of a honest man that makes the difference in a corrupt town. Johnny Knoxville is hilarious, as usual, and this movie is a great entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Com as Próprias M?os" ("With the Own Hands")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plays the revenge scenario right!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes Walking Tall such a good movie, in my opinion, is that you really want The Rock to beat the bad guys. Obviously, in these type of movies the good guys always have to win, so it's really important that the director make sure the good guys come out looking much better than the bad guys so that when the good guys win, the audience is satisfied. This movie does that perfectly having The Rock have something extremely cowardly done to him near the beginning of the film. Johnny Knoxville adds a lot to this movie as well with some good humor. Overall it's just good entertainment the whole time.So check this out some time because it's a prime example of how a slightly more adult feel-good movie should be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking Tall A Decent Remake With Some Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking Tall is a decent remake with some flaws from director Ken Bray whose admirable in making this movie but a short running time, some over the top action, and the lack of a more central villain is what weighed it down. Walking Tall however isn't that bad and it's one of the better remakes out there. Dwayne Johnson is solid as the lead and proves to be a talented actor while bringing some of his wresting experience to the movie during the action/fight sequences. Johnson turns in a good performance of a man who returns home to find it overrun by crime and corruption, which drives him to become sheriff in order to put an end to it. The rest of the cast including Johnny Knoxville, Neal McDonough, and Ashley Scott are okay in their roles but (except for maybe Knoxville) they're not given much to do. The movie felt short and rushed with an 86 minute running time. Some of the fight sequences especially the one near the end between Johnson and McDonough go over the top. Johnson's performance however and the action sequences make this movie worth seeing at least once. Overall despite its flaws Walking Tall is decent remake one of the better ones with intense action, fist fights, some humor, and good performances by the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking Tall - The Cliff Notes Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having found Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's last film, The Rundown, a very enjoyable action outing, I was hoping for big things from The Rock. When I discovered his next film was this remake of the 1973 version of Walking Tall I was hoping for great things. The week before the premiere my enthusiasm was tempered by three huge things the film had working against it.The first disappointment was in discovering it was to be an MGM release. From the studio that once boasted "more stars than there are in heaven" it can now be referred to the studio that makes it as cheap as possible, then throws it on the big screen for a few weeks, and finishes it off by rushing the DVD out to market. As a profitability concept, I can't argue whether the strategy is working or not, but having seen many of their recent films I can say it fails as far as any kind of cinematic achievements are concerned. Oh sure, once in a while they get lucky with one and it's half way decent, but it's not because of any real concern for quality.The second slap in the face was to discover the running time was a little over an hour and fifteen minutes. Considering that the original Walking Tall with Joe Don Baker ran for over two hours, this was definitely not a good sign. Add to that the fact that I had once seen the running time of the remake listed as one hour and forty minutes, one could only guess as to what footage was now cluttering the cutting room floor.Then the coup de grace was after reading some of the IMDB comments before leaving for the theater, we find that Vince McMahon, the guy who gave us Wrestling and even worst, the XFL, has his hand in this film some where. Things were not looking good this morning but my mind was made up and I was going to go. So, were my early hopes realized, or did my worst nightmare come true? The answer is somewhere in between.Whereas the first Walking Tall film was a fictionalized account of Sheriff Buford Pusser of McNairy County in Tennessee, the writers, producers and director of this remake decided it wasn't fictionalized enough. Not only does it no longer take place in Tennessee, it now takes place in Washington. Our hero is no longer Buford Pusser the ex-wrestler he is now Chris Vaughn, ex U.S. Special Forces Sergeant. I guess it wouldn't have looked good to have The Rock talking negatively about wrestling the way Joe Don Baker badmouthed it in the original. Especially since Vince McMahon is a producer. Chris, unlike Buford who had a wife and two kids, is single. But he does have an ex-girlfriend lurking about somewhere. The reason I relate this information to you is because a lot of the original film depended on Buford's home life. In this version it is only slightly needed, which would partially explain the short running time. It also makes this remake a film that lacks the ability to involve us in it's storyline like we should be.Walking Tall actually does start off well and is relatively faithful to the original. Upon returning home, Buford...err I mean Chris, returns home to find that the Lumber Mill that supported his home town has closed placing his father, Chris Sr. (John Beasley)out of work. Also living at home are his mother, his paramedic sister, and his nephew. Unfortunately, unlike the original film, his family is here for the purpose of supplying a few plot devices that develop later in the film and nothing more.What is new in town is a corrupt casino, built by the an old buddy,(Neal Mcdonough), who closed the mill putting everybody out of work. On a visit there with his friend Ray (Johnny Knoxville), Chris finds some crooked dice at a crap game. After fighting with the casino's security force, he is subdued, viciously cut and left for dead. Later when Chris's nephew overdoses on drugs (ahh! the plot device I mentioned) supplied by the same people who knifed him, Chris decides to seek revenge. It is at this moment that the film begins to loose it's grip by degenerating into a series of poorly staged fights and even worse shoot 'em ups.Portions of the film are entertaining, in large part due to the on screen natural charisma that The Rock has. Just as in The Rundown, the role of action hero seems to come naturally to him, and as far as acting ability is concerned, after only three leading roles he is already ahead of Schwarzenegger's capabilities after the same number of films. An even bigger surprise was Johnny Knoxville as his best friend Ray. He has some of the best written lines in the film, and seems to have just the right screen persona for his role. The rest of the cast is basically generic. Neal McDonough's villainous Jay, talks more threatening than he appears and that's a major problem. In the original film, the threat of danger always seemed imminent and except for Chris's initial fight, we never believe he or anyone else is in any real danger. Even a tussle between Ray and some guys holding Rock's family hostage is played partially for laughs, which also indicates how badly the film slips into being just another cardboard action film.Another gripe I have though, is obviously there are chunks of this film that are missing. I don't know whether it was a studio decision, a McMahon decision, or a decision by director Bray, to cut the film, but the decision was a bad one. At times the film loses what little cohesiveness it has by leaving some scenes unfinished, and jumping inexplicably to others. Go figure.I suppose there's nothing totally bad about being a formulaic action film, except there is no reason why this film couldn't have been and shouldn't have been so much more. If it had been developed into the same kind of engrossing story that the original was, it wouldn't matter how much they changed it. It was a golden opportunity for The Rock to really shine and strut his stuff, but it is an opportunity now lost. If memory serves me correctly, the original Walking Tall was blasted mercilessly and I think unfairly by some critics. Audiences didn't care though and they flocked to it. This remake has also been blasted by some critics and I won't disagree with them. Unfortunately for The Rock, I don't think the audiences are going to stand in line for this one.If you want to see more about the original Walking Tall film you must do two things. First, forget that you ever saw Joe Don Baker in Mitchell, and second, get the DVD that is readily available. That's my recommendation, and when I have to recommend another film to people, I have no choice but to give the remake my grade which is a more than generous C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good movie with a strong performance from the Rock, the new action hero and actor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm a huge Arnie fan. I love the action flick and my hero of action is Arnie with Willis coming a close second. So when I heard that Welcome to the Jungle represented Arnie handing the mantle to some WWF wrestler I was extremely disappointed, how could anyone entertain me as Arnie had?Well I never did see Jungle, but I have just watched Walking Tall and met this Rock fella, and you know what? I'm impressed. If this is the guy to carry on what Arnie did, I'm with him all the way.Movie: In this movie Rock can act, and act well. He's big and really grabs a hold of the action hero role, but on top of that he's personable, engaging and very believable. He has a great screen presence, his lines aren't delivered flat, there's not any overacting and he's very real in the role.What's more surprising is that Johnny Knocksville isn't that bad either. I've heard many negative things about this guys acting, but in this movie he doesn't do too badly. Sure, he does look a little awkward in some scenes but overall he's very competent.Neal McDonough who I last saw in the TV show called Boomtown is, if it wasn't for Rocks surprising performance, the star of the film. Essentially playing his character from Boomtown but without any of the good characters aspects, he's mean and ruthless here, a part he plays superbly well.The story does have an older more western or fifties feel to it, and this stands it in good stead making it feel less like a modern action movie and more of a character based story. Something it carries off really well and helped by the large performances of the actors involved. It also does a good job of building tension and developing the story at a good pace.There's a good filming style in the movie, simple and realistic, helping the feel of the movie along leaps and bounds. That seems to come through on everything from the camera work to the dialogue and from the fight scenes to the sometimes excellent editing - most memorable as the Rock drives through town after his second Casino visit. The fight scenes benefit most from this style, giving a wide view of very realistic hand to hand fighting which often turns out to be quite brutal. The characters pick up anything to fight with and there's no stylish moves here. They are tough, vicious and the characters get seriously hurt.Picture: Widescreen 2.35:1 - Anamorphic In keeping with the realistic tone of the film the picture is filled with natural colours and lighting, nothing is over saturated and it's clear and sharp throughout.Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital 2.0 - The audio is good and particularly strong during some of the fight sequences. It also features a soundtrack which matches the setting and tone of the film well.Extras: Audio commentary from director Kevin Bray, director of photography Glen MacPherson and editor Robert Ivision, Audio commentary with star Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Alternative ending, Outtakes, 'Stunts' featurette introduced by The Rock, Photo gallery, Theatrical trailerThe deleted scenes and outtakes are interesting but not that entertaining or overly informative, apart from the Rock's accidental breast grab. The same applies to the alternative ending which is a little bit funny, but nothing revealing about the editing decisions.The audio commentaries are the strong part of this DVD offering, with one from the Director, Director of Photography and Editor, and the other from the man himself, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Although the filmmakers commentary is informative, the commentary from the Rock is as much of a surprise as the movie itself. It's both amusing and insightful for the movie making process as well as the person himself. Surprisingly humble, self depreciating and open, the commentary lets you get to know the Rock as well as a ton of facts about the movie and the actors. This guy can talk!Overall: I saw the first comment about this movie on IMDb and it slates it, calling it a mindless action movie. Quite frankly that's rubbish. This movie has a lot more to it that most action flicks and has a fair chunk of characterisation over them too. It's quite a morale tale, as well as one based on a true life story, and apparently it's quite true to the real story. However it does have its fair share of action, but something that stands out for the movie is the realism in which it is portrayed and shot. There are still some traditional action scenes, but for the most part it keeps it grounded and tells a good tale that does give you a warm feeling. Entertainment with a good message, I like it.Also, for your consideration, is the performance of the Rock. Not only does he prove himself to be a great action hero, but he also surprises you in his acting ability. I was wholly taken in by him and really latched onto his performance. Don't forget we also have the delights of McDonough as his adversary.It's well shot, well acted, and a good entertaining story with more meat than you would expect. Don't write this off as a simple action movie, look deeper, give it a chance, and check out the audio commentary by the Rock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half was promising. They did a good job of building up the Rock as a man of integrity amidst a sea of moral sewage in his hometown. He has a likable family. He has good friends. It really made me lok forward to what I knew would happen-- he would be beaten senseless, exact a measure of painful revenge on his enemies, and go about cleaning up the place and setting things aright. My expectations were high.But then he becomes sherriff. It must be something about the office because his moral compass turns out to be just as screwed up as everyone else's. He hires a felon as a deputy (against the law), sleeps with his girlfriend in the office (seems he didn't mind her being a stripper as long as she put on her show for him at the jail). He tramples people's rights, plants evidence on suspects, intimidates through physical violence, etc. Sure he was trying to clean the place up but I was hoping that, with an appropriate measure of butt-kicking when needed, he would overcome evil with good. But he only knew how to fight evil with more evil.The whole back half seemed to be rushed and almost unplanned as events hurled toward the inevitable winner take all clash with the bad guy. The Rock put on a good performance as did most of the other actors but the script and directing were awful after the mid-point of the movie. I gave it a 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*If the Rock wants to be the next big action hero, he's going to have to learn to embrace the R rating. If any movie needed excessive violence to make up for its complete lack of plot, intelligence, etc., it was "Walking Tall". I am a big fan of the original Joe Don Baker movie and was interested in seeing the Rock take a big stick and bash a new generation of bad guy's heads open."Walking Tall" is a very efficient, no frills PG-13 action flick. The Rock comes back home only to find filth everywhere he looks. Seems the new casino in town is run by a bunch of lowlifes that need to get a big stick slammed upside their heads. The Rock is happy to oblige. Soon the bad guys and The Rock will do battle. You could write the rest of the movie yourself. Actually, don't bother. A movie this brain-dead just keeps lumbering along on its own.As a brainless action flick, "Walking Tall" was OK. Fair. I wanted to see the Rock bash people's heads in and "Walking Tall" delivered. I can't fault the movie for that. However, The Rock version has nothing on the mighty Joe Don Baker version. Baker's version was about being a man and Walking Tall. Joe Don needed to prove he could be a real man and clean up the town. The Rock's version is about bashing skulls. Period. Dot. The end. The Rock was already a man the second he walked into town. He had nothing to prove. He just wanted to attack somebody. There was no need to call this one "Walking Tall". They could have easily have called it "Rock Smash!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not what makes an "American Action" movie... *Spoiler*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people; I enjoy the over-the-top, mindless drivel action movie every now and then. Who doesn't have those moments when they walk to their DVD collection, grab a couple Van Damme movies or their worn out copy of Die Hard and know that for the next hour and a half; they won't have to think. Instead, they'll be able to kick back on the couch, maybe have a couple beers and let their testosterone levels overflow with explosions, fight scenes and the random chick who's only point in the movie is to get half naked and throw out her three lines about how manly the main character is.Walking Tall disappointed me on every level of what makes an American Action movie. It's not that we don't get those three elements; everything is there. They're just horribly disappointing.Explosions - This may be all this movie has to offer. It's just disappointing it was done on such a small scale. Slot machines get smashed, a truck blows up (another one gets taken apart) and a building gets shot up. While I did find it amusing when Johnny Knoxville took a chain saw to a huge truck (and the 5 minute segment of them destroying this truck to look for drugs was finished), all they did was take off the doors, roll-bar lights and the grill. The only explosion was The Rock's truck. Everything else that was demolished or destroyed looks like something from an old western, saloon style brawl (ie. tables, glass, random junk that makes impacts look bigger). One positive thing, we do get to see big guns. It's only for 5 - 10 minutes though. Before and after that, the gun play is virtually non-existent. The Rock doesn't even carry a gun as the sheriff. Instead, he widdled down a 2x4 and upholds the law with that.Fights Scenes - without say, this is the key element. While explosions are important, they're just there to glorify the fight sequences. With The Rock as the main character, you expect a lot of fighting. They delivered, but once again; on a horribly small scale. The importance of them is, well... Not important, but that's expected in an action movie. The downfall is the dynamics of the fighting. To be honest; I'm not a fan of professional wrestling, but I put that aside and watched The Rock as a legit "action superstar" (in other words, the same as I'd watch a Vin Diesel or Jackie Chan film). The fighting itself is less then glamorous. I'll use the mid-western, saloon metaphor again. It's nothing but bare-knuckle, no style fighting. And the worst thing about it is, there is no foe that rivals The Rock's ability. Every good action movie has that one guy who is an awesome fighter and pushes the hero to the edge. Not in this movie. The final stand off is The Rock vs. The Lanky Albino. The only thing that keeps the fight balanced is the umpteen-million falls they have in between the Rock beating him down to a pulp. Then to make matters worse, the trip TO the final stand-off is nothing more then a hop-skip and a trip around the block to the scene. There's NO static on the way, there's no henchmen keeping him from the final meeting, there's nothing. I think they accidentally killed off 3/4 of the cast in 10 minutes, and the director didn't realize it until it was too late. I guess that would explain the numerous falls in-order to compensate for the less than "action-esque" finale."Supporting" role - This will be quick. There is one "side action" scene in the entire movie. Which is normal, I'm not dogging that at all. No one expects The Rock to be good at romance, or have some lady's man charisma that gets all the girls. It just happens out of no where, which again; totally fine by me. The part that bother me is that we have to spend more time looking at The Rock with his shirt off then the "stripper turned sweetie." I mean, the scene ENDS with the former-stripper taking off her shirt.This movie is definitely not The Rock at his best (whatever 'his best' might be). If you're desperate for an action movie and nothing else is sounding even remotely good; I'd still advise against it and rent an old 70's Kung-Fu movie instead. If you're not into Kung-Fu movies, well... Go ahead and rent it. If you watch it with absolutely no expectations and don't try to compare it to any other classics; you might actually get a miniscule amount of entertainment from it. If you can watch bad movies and laugh at them, then you'll enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking Tall is more like The Rock is sitting down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is one of the greatest performer in and outside of the ring, but 'Walking Tall' isn't one of his best. Dwayne Johnson is missing the stuff that made him famous. His character of Chris Vaughn lacks his sense of humor, his charisma, and his ability to hook the audience's attention. Hooking the audience is the key and sadly this movie does not. The Rock's persona got cut back, as Chris felt more like a bland Boy Scout. Chris Vaughn is supposedly based on famous sheriff, Bufurd Pusser of the 1960's. This film ever cut the best parts of the original Walking Tall story by having the events place out in Washington, rather than the Deep South. Nothing against Washington, but the Deep South is where the real Buford Pusser's story begins. Pusser is known for his virtual one-man war on moon-shining, prostitution, gambling, and other vices on the Mississippi-Tennessee state-line. As sheriff, Pusser survived seven stabbings and eight shootings. At less, the 1973 version kept him in the same area and same name. That movie had Joe Don Baker as Buford Pusser, and it did kinda strays pretty far from the basic facts of the crusading sheriff's life. It's not a great film, but there is some entertainment value associated with it despite the endless amounts of boom mikes in some of its shots. The film made Pusser, a ex pro-wrestler who comes over to stop a casino and prostitution ring with a 2x4 Wooden Board, that was later use as a gimmick for another wrestler Hacksaw Jim Duggan. Walking Tall was rated R, having more violence than the 2004 version. For goodness sakes, Pusser almost got his jaw almost blown off, and his T-shirt so soaked with blood. The 2004 movie plays it safe with it being PG-13. Having it PG-13 somewhat hurts the film, due to the reasons that I can't find the villains to be much of a threat, the Rock can't be the bad-ass he is, and the movie felt like safe career move for Dwayne Johnson. Vaughn, the homespun do-gooder underdog type, will only further cement Dwayne likable movie persona. That's why it seem like Chris Vaughn is carrying a 2x4 of boredom while cleaning his town. After return home from service, U.S Army Special Forces Chris Vaughn looks for work at the mill to find it closed and a casino has taken it's place as the main source of income of the town. He soon find out that his old school mate Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) is the owner. Neal McDonough is just what you'd expect from a generic bad guy - he does a lot of sneering and nothing more. Not only does Jay own the place, but his ex-girlfriend Deni (Ashley Scott) works as a stripper there. Ashley Scott is just what you'd expect from a generic girlfriend - she has a nice body, an acceptable face, and almost no dialogue. After noticing the casino is fixed and selling drugs. He wrecked the place. So if you want to become Sheriff, go berserk and wreck a casino. Then become your own lawyer at your trial, and plead why you should be Sheriff to a town that hasn't saw you in years. Tell them that the casino is evil despite probably most of them income comes from working at the casino. Yes-surely that would trust you. Chris Vaughn runs for sheriff, wins somehow and fired all the polices due to original Sheriff abusing his power. Rock doesn't like that, so Rock abusing his power to fight against the casino. Meh. Chris call upon his friend Ray (Johnny Knoxville) to try to stop the casino's drug running. Clearly Johnny is just there to be a comedy relief and it's just awfully clear. He plays himself most of the time. Sorry, but I don't buy Chris Vaughn, a crusader against drugs hanging out with a foreign alcoholic man like Ray. Their goal to ruin the casino, and save the town by doing so. Wouldn't the town go under if the casino went away, and how on earth will they rebuild the mill with no money? Does he have a million dollars somewhat to start it back up? Face it, this movie is lackluster at best, and is lead by a man who is only famous for beating up other men in questionable context. The action fighting scene looks faker than the pro-wrestling, he came from. For somebody that came from the Special Forces, his character really doesn't know how to do hand to hand combat. Lot of dull moments full of combination of very loosely based fact and Hollywood revisionism. Walking Tall had the potential of being something very good, but end up playing it safe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buford Pusser is turning in his grave...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have ever seen the 1973 film Walking Tall staring Joe Don Baker as Sheriff Buford Pusser then there is really little need to see this version. The original was based on a true and sad story about a man fighting crime and corruption in a small town and would ultimately cost him his life. It had style and made you feel for this man standing up against the scum that was taking over his town. This new version is nothing more than a joke staring a man who dares call himself an actor. Dwayne Johnson (AKA The Rock). It is nothing more than a cheap parody of an original classic and in my view mocks the real Sheriff Pusser who was nothing like Dwayne Johnson. See the original and you will see what an insult this film was to a man that stood for what was right and take down the worst scum of society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here it is. The, movie. The creme of the crop.First I should warn you of spoilers. With that out of the way let's get to the review.The basic plot of this one: overall great guy and ex-special forces member Chris Vaughn comes back home to find new work. His town is now run by criminals so, as the only good guy in town who know's how to snap necks, it is up to him to set things right. Just go with it okay.Now how can you ruin a deep plot like that you might ask (if you haven't already realized it I'm trying to use as much sarcasm as I can here). Well we have a run time of 75 minutes. That gives our main actor Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson (look for this guy to win academy awards in the future ;D), when you consider the amount of low quality action and pointless one-liners, almost no time to actually act.Let me give you a big spoiler to show how stupid this movie is. After being a victim of tainted justice, Vaughn decides to run for sheriff. He slams his fist in a courtroom and rips open his shirt, showing everyone his cut up chest (after being tortured by the evil casino guys). Next scene. He's the sheriff! He's driving around in his police truck with his trusty two by four, now with a carved handle, hanging on a gun rack behind him! How do you fight criminals? Why with a corrupt policeman of course! He pulls over one of these casino guys and smashes out his tail lights. That's right Vaughn, you clean up that town! This movie is awful. It is so, so awful! Perhaps you should go see it just to see how awful it is. It is so awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsChris Vaughn (The Rock) has returned home from active duty in the US army and wants to settle back down with his old friends and relatives,including old aquaintance Ray Templeton (Johnny Knoxville).However,the hard reality soon starts to seep in that his old home town isn't as sweet and innocent as he remembered it and that childhood rival Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) is running various nefarious activities.Finally tiring of the corruption and the flippant attitude of the local police force,Chris decides to take a stand and make his old home really feel like home again.The cruel irony of the whole thing is that,as the front cover proudly promotes,"this is based on a true story."Yet the plotline is so formulaic it could have been derived from any generic Hollywood cookie-cutter action flick that you care to mention.The story is similar,in a very lot of respects,to Steven Seagal's Marked for Death or even the Cynthia Rothrock movie China O' Brien,and there are quite a few cliches,in terms of both plot and character,that are indicative of such movies.But they are just what you are expecting (and sub-consciously hoping) them to be.In fact,the only thing that really scratches your surface and that you care enough to notice,is the noticeably under-played and undeveloped romance between The Rock and his childhood stripper friend.Nevertheless,the predictable but effective story of the burnt-out hero returning to his home town to escape his demons only to encounter more problems strangely remains as engaging and even endearing a premise to base an action film on as ever before,despite the lack of originality.As for The Rock's charisma as a leading man,I'm not sure what I missed out on with Welcome to the Jungle and The Scorpion King,but here he doesn't seem to be giving Lawrence Olivier much competition in terms of dramatic thesping.But he tries hard and seems well aware that this ain't Shakespeare and that we as an audience can ultimately take it or leave it.Aware,in fact,that it is exactly as I described it in my OLS above.I,for one,can certainly smell what The Rock is cooking here.And it smells kinda familiar.And kinda good.**</fullReview>

This was one of the worst films I have ever seen, without a doubt, absolutely shocking! The whole idea of The Rock blatantly smashing up a casino and getting away with it because because they cut him up was ridiculous, he still did the crime for f$$K sake!! The crowning moment had to be when they threw him the piece of wood (The evidence!!!) and he went off to become sheriff (sacking all the staff) and then preceded to walk around with a piece of wood and Jonny Knoxville as his partner!! What the F**k was the director thinking??! There is only one film I have seen worse than this and that is True Friends. Both films were funny because the acting was so bad! Someone owes me money for the time I spent watching this! I even preferred Kangaroo Jack! Do yourself a favour and avoid this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall seeing the hit Bing Crosby-produced original in 1973 and thought it was okay... and a fitting tribute to the memory of Sheriff Pusser and his family. So I reordered it on NetFlix and they sent me the remake by mistake. My complaints? First off, this bears no resemblance to the Pusser story (Washington state?). It's more of 'Road House' meets 'Rambo.' There's nothing here that anyone hasn't seen done better a dozen times before. The phoned-in script could've been written on a damp cocktail napkin and 'The Rock' could be used to describe his acting range. Nothing about this version approaches the level of creative inspiration. It's a total waste of time. Thankfully, it's also one of the shortest movies I've ever seen. Bleeaaach and yawn... back in the mail you go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rock is getting better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the Scorpion King the Rocks acting is getting better. This is not the best film, but for action I would watch it again. The Rock from his wrestling days is a good physical actor, like Stallone, and Arnold. This is a must, not many people can do physical acting, and that is half of what makes a good action movie. That action film with the guy from Cruel Intentions shows how awful and action movie is with out good physical acting. That movie had 1) too little believability. 2) emotions of pain, physical stress do not look real 3) the action looks phony and out of place. If people think Stallone did not take some real punches for Rocky they would be mistaken, for Rocky would loose it realism with out physical realism. That part said, I find the story line good, but inferior to the original. I like true storys better than fiction. Bad events like this story shows really do happens; I would bet this movie is going be on TBS 'Guy who like movies' week. One thing I notice in this film is the Rock seems to have a real nice streak in him, I wonder if that is ture or more to do with the movie.6 or 7 out of 10 depending if you seen the original Walking tall, for the film becomes more believable if you see the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Vaughan (The Rock) is a former Special Forces Soldier who returns to his home town looking for work. Upon arriving home, he struggles finding work due to the fact that many businesses in the area have been closed down. Vaughan learns that a Casino owned by his former school friend Jay (Neal McDonough) is the primary source of income in the town, but it seems that Vaughan's school friend is using his influence to effectively run the town (cheating occurs in his club, he sells drugs to kids) and as he runs the town the police turn a blind eye to all of Jay's activities. When Vaughan learns that his nephew Pete has taken drugs at the hands of Jay's cronies he takes the law into his own hands and makes it his mission to put an end to all the corruption in the town.Even though Walking Tall only clocks in at around the 84 minute mark it sadly felt a whole lot longer; the initial problems lie with a rather pedestrian and directionless first half - very little of actual 'merit' actually happens in the first half making it feel rather boring. The second half of the film is slightly better when The Rock goes on his rampage but even then a lot of it looks and feels rather generic and not terribly exciting.Walking Tall is based on a true story so I'm going to presume that artistic licence has been used in this film for the purposes of entertainment. I'm fine with all of this, but one thing that puzzled me about this true story was in the second half where Vaughan became the sheriff of the town. I guess this did happen, but I find it hard to believe that it occurred in the manner that was depicted on screen. It seemed to skip from his trial, to his acquittal, to him then being sheriff and firing all the police??? It seemed to me that large gaps were missing in the narrative (presumably to keep the running time shorter and to make the film more entertaining), but to be honest the film lost all credibility for me after this reveal and I pretty much lost all interest in the film from this point forward.Walking Tall also suffers from other problems such as unlikeable characters (with the exception of Vaughan) and awful comic relief in the form of Johnny Knoxville - I'm sorry but I just don't find him funny. The script is also predictable and despite the film being about Vaughan's life I left the film knowing as much about him at the end than I did at the start - the picture has no real depth or substance and seemed more content with The Rock's 2 by 4 doing the talking most of the time.I can handle 'mindless fun' but when I say 'mindless fun' the emphasis is on the word 'fun'. There's not much in the way of fun on offer here, nor is there much excitement or surprises and it has to be said that the film is also boring and heavy-handed at times resulting in a roundly poor film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The actors were fine, OK? But this movie is just a stupid mess of outrageous nonsense.If you have nothing better to do, don't even consider watching this groan-er. You're better off watching paint dry instead.Just a few examples (and these are spoilers): The family-owned mill, which was the major employer in town and the region, shuts down to build a cheating casino that also makes and sells drugs to kids.Huh?!?!? They shut down an on-going for-profit mill that was the MAJOR source of income for the region, to build a casino -- that needed patrons who had an income (from the mill?) to lose? The Rock, before he becomes sheriff, comes to the casino and spots the crap table croupier switching dice for a loaded pair. The result? The Rock gets beaten up to a pulp by the casino security thugs, in front of everybody else.And nobody cares. This ain't a good example of a casino's customer relations policy to keep people coming back.And, among others, the scene were the Rock's office (he's now the sheriff) gets massacred for around 15 minutes of movie time with machine gunfire and other mayhem. And NOBODY from town shows up? To see what's going on? To recognize the bad guys by sight? Meanwhile, the bad guys were laughing in front of God and everybody and didn't care if anyone was watching? Again, watching paint dry is a better option. Or maybe "My Mother the Car" reruns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just chose a random movie from Netflix. Well, not that random, I just wanted something with The Rock. ' When you haven't read a summary, it's hard to follow a movie. Like I still don't know what part of this movie was the main point in the plot. When Chris Vaughn went against the people in the casino? When he became sheriff? The story is pretty typical, not good but not bad either. You watch the movie, hoping Chris Vaughn will get the bad guys, but otherwise are you invested in him? Or in anyone? Like most characters bring something to the story, but no one is really that interesting. Well, there was a moment when I started thinking about the main character's past, because it was never really revealed to us, but his actions seemed to reveal a little something. Yet nothing was truly said out loud, so that was only a little moment.When watching Walking Tall I kept thinking that the movie is basically bad decisions after another. Sure, Chris Vaughn has his heart in the right place and all that, but mostly I had to shake my head. Why, Chris? Why the hell would you do that? Also how he became sheriff, fired everyone and only hired his friend? No way, that would never work. The worst idea ever!Apart from few interesting details this movie is extremely boring to watch. It's simple though, it's satisfying but it doesn't stand out, it doesn't really feel like anything. Kind of a waste of time because of how average it is.</fullReview>

You know exactly what you will get from a movie like this, and the movie, story and actors all deliver exactly as you would expect.That being said, then don't get me wrong. I am not saying that "Walking Tall" is a boring movie, far from it actually. It is an entertaining movie for what it is; a straight forward, generic and predictable action movie. And the emphasis is on action here, because there is a lot of it throughout the entire movie. You just simply lean back and unhook your mind and enjoy the ride.The story is about a former military guy named Chris (played by Dwayne Johnson) who returns to his hometown, only to find it very changed. The small town has fallen into a downward spiral fueled by drugs and gambling. Chris decides to take matters into his own hands and weed out the bad seeds."Walking Tall" actually does have some well-cast actors on the cast list, including Dwayne Johnson, Neal McDonough and Kevin Durand.If you enjoy a good action movie that is fast paced and can be watched even if severely hung over and just need something that your mind doesn't need to be present for, then "Walking Tall" is a good choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slim but fun action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has always had a strong fan base. Even starting out early in his film career, he had loyal followers just by playing the lead in the silly and yet fun The Scorpion King (2002). Although not every film The Rock auditioned for had this kind of tone, not many outside viewers could take him as a serious actor. Most of that skepticism was from his other career in the WWE. However no matter the case Johnson kept his feet in the pool and made a couple of movies here and there before he really took on more projects as years passed. For Johnson's rise to stardom, it was his first batch of films that got him seen by more people. This film was one of them along with The Scorpion King (2002) and The Rundown (2003). Is it to say that this film tops or is equal to a lot of other great action/revenge films or the remake of Walking Tall (1973) it was based on - no. But does it still entertain? Yes.Directed by TV show director Kevin Bray and had a screenplay written by four people, this tale of "don't mess with a man's home" certainly shows how hostile people can become when their nostalgia is messed with. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson plays Chris Vaughn, a military veteran who just returned from service. After visiting his home, he heads out and begins to notice the town he grew up in isn't all that it used to be. The lumber mill factory his father (John Beasley) used to work at is closed down. His young nephew is being influenced by the wrong people and an associate of his, Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) established an out of place casino in the middle of town. That's just a few things; as time goes on, Chris begins noticing more and more things that make him realize how far south his hometown has gone. Once Vaughn gets angry enough he grabs a 2x4 and takes matters into his own hands.Accompanying Vaughn in his self-made mission is Ray Templeton (Johnny Knoxville) and Deni (Ashley Scott). The character of Deni is an important part of the plot because she gives Vaughn another reason to retaliate. As for development, the four writers couldn't manage to make her any different from any other action film. It's not that say the development does not exist, it's just overly predictable and cliché to use. It can be said that for the character of Ray (for people that know of Knoxville's acting) that it's not very different from other Knoxville performances. Yet, Knoxville is funny and lively edition to the cast. He balances out the straight, no games attitude Dwayne Johnson carries around and Ashley Scott's typecast action role. There's several moments where Knoxville is just allowed to go cuckoo and it just makes the appreciation for the character go way up. For all it's worth, Knoxville may just be playing himself, who knows. Neal McDonough as the casino owner has a number of deadpan comical moments as well. This is mostly due to how he sees Chris Vaughn and how their relationship changes over time. Kevin Durand has a minor role in this film and although his character isn't likable, his character also has a key part to play in the unfolding of the story. As for action, all sequences are well staged and pack enough energy to keep the film going (even if the end credits take up 12 minutes of time). Dwayne Johnson carrying anything (it doesn't have to be a gun) as a weapon is an instant win just because of how sheer deadly he can be. However, in the writing there was a missed opportunity and that belongs to the finale fight. It's not that it doesn't look good or isn't fun. The thing is, where the fight initially starts actually looks like it would've been a better setting for the final action sequence to take place. Sadly as soon as the setting was introduced, it was quickly moved to somewhere else. Imagine if it did stay there though (for those who saw it already)?The cinematography for this movie belongs to Glen MacPherson. Although a lot of MacPherson's experience is being the director of photography for TV movies, his camera-work looks good here too. Even with a number of scenes taking place in doors, the shots are all well lit and have lots of color. Plus like several other cinematographers, getting shots of landscape is important to give the audience a sense of the scope the setting takes place in and MacPherson did that nicely. The music produced by Graeme Revell was adequate although it was a bit undistinguished. A number of scenes have country/rock soundtrack songs inserted for transition and then there's just instrumental music that are only acoustic. It's difficult to say whether that's Revell or not. However when it came to action cues it was definitely Revell because of his use of tribal drums and electronic clicks. For those parts it reminisced to that of the Daredevil (2003) score. It is weird how Revell doesn't get all of his scores released though. What's the point of making music and not releasing it?Aside from a missed opportunity in setting for the finale and cliché character development, this is a lean, solid action flick. Dwayne Johnson brings the muscle into the action sequences, Johnny Knoxville brings the energy with the laughs, the music suits the scenes and the cinematography is well shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Back from the wars in Iraq &amp; Afganistan highly decorated US Special Forces butt-kicker Chris Vaughn, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, is looking to settle down at his former job at the local ceder mill as well as spend time doing some landscaping on the side. To Chris' surprise he finds out that the Norman Rockwell like all American town that he left eight years ago has turned or degenerated into a Sodom &amp; Gomorrah! It's there where everything goes, gambling drug trafficking and prostitution, with the cops lead by Sheriff Stan Watkins, Michael Browne, in the pay of casino owner and childhood friend of Chris' Jay Hamilton, Neal McDonough.Invited by Hamilton to spend some time and money at his Cherry Casino Chris ends up working over the security staff when he find out that their, by loading the dice, stiffing him on the crap table and ends up tearing the place apart. It's later that Chris is kidnapped by some of Hamilton's, without his knowledge of course, goons and brutally tortured and left for dead on a bridge. With his friend Hamilton trying to patch things up by giving Chris a free pass, as well as opportunity to work for him as a bouncer, and not pressing charges he feels that will cool things down. It's later when Chris' nephew Pete, Khleo Thomas, is found stumbling around strung out crystal meth that Chris discovers that Hamilton is running a drug laboratory in the nearby woods and really loses his cool. Paying the Cherry Casino a second visit Chris as mad as a bull seeing red finishes the job he first started in putting it and it's personnel out of commission and in the hospital!***SPOILERS*** On trial this time for destroying property breaking and entering and putting some dozen of Hamilton's security staff in traction Chris beats the rap on a self-defense defense in that his life was endanger and, like the saying goes, he only did what he had to do in order to keep from losing it. Now on a mission to clean up the town Chris runs for county sheriff wins by a landslide and with the help of his good friend ex-convict Ray Tempelton, Johnny Knoxville, as his deputy goes into action!Re-make of the original 1973 "Walking Tall" With "The Rock" as, even though he's not a character in the movie, the legendary Sheriff Buford Pusser that the film is based on. Despite the very convincing action scenes that "The Rock" is in he can also act and shows what comes across as genuine emotions that he obviously learned in doing as a professional and championship wrestler even though "The Rocks" actions in the film are not quite on the up and up. Lets just say that he and Deputy Tempelton bend the law just a little bit to get the job done. That it's those thugs that he does it against, Hamilton and his goons, you just can't bring yourself to feel, in the uncalled for beating and criminal destruction of property that they suffer, a bit sorry for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Walking Tall last night for the first time in years I still feel the same way I did the first time I watched.I found it to be one of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson best movies that he has done in his acting career he brought a strong character to the film and shows what a man can fight for what he believes in.The film stars Ashley Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Neal McDonough, John Beasley, Barbara Tarbuck, Kristen Wilson, Kevin Durand. What makes the film stand out is that The Rock showcase his skills as a action actor and Dwayne said he accept the role for it was the right thing to do.The film was like a mix of "Road House". But needless to say that the film did well on it's own.The film has some good action scenes and showcase how well the Rock can perform in tense battles also the film has some good one liners, just watching the film is better for you to understand and give it a chanceWalking Tall has a plot that makes you want to cheer for the good guy and it showcases what a true man does also there is some good acting in the film as well as the fight scenes are something you want to see in a real fight Also the soundtrack gives the film somethingOverall if you're a fan of The Rock and enjoy action films you might want to give Walking Tall a tryI give Walking Tall an 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a wrestling match</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, given its star actor, is what I imagine watching a wrestling match is like. There is nonstop action and movement with breaks taken only due to fatigue. From the opening camera moving across the landscape, to Chris on a moving ferry, to Chris walking for the entire opening credits back home, you don't encounter many, if any, scenes of one setting, with two actors in a one-on-one situation, engaging in dialogue for several long minutes. Maybe that's a drama, and this, to be sure, is certainly no drama movie. So much happens in this movie, which seems to make it so interesting, and a rush. What some people spend their entire lives doing or could take more than one lifetime doing -- weeding out corruption and social rot in a city/town, seems to get accomplished in the span of a couple months. Also in that time-frame Chris wins a small election (details of which aren't shown) which turns in to a good job and gets back with his former girlfriend. Does life happen this quickly for some people, especially somebody who was away for eight years? In "Walking Tall", it did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>74 minutes was filled with action-packed, shoot them up scenes. The Rock is like a character out of a Sylvester Stallone film.The premise where a returning soldier goes home to find his town filled with corruption is a familiar theme. Getting involved when a family member is affected with a drug overdose is also trite.The film proceeds too rapidly on that memorable trial, and our hero becoming the town sheriff and immediately cleaning things up as they did in old Dodge City.The violence is expected as the new sheriff tries to set things straight.I liked the film, but there needed to be more character development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is evident that over the years The Rock's career as an actor has improved, but I do think this is a fun enjoyable fun that does have its negatives but also definitely has its positives. The story sees an ex army guy Chris returning home as he attempts to clean up his town from the corruption within. The Rock was quite new at this point and for this film he was great in the role, he used all his charm and charisma in the role but not a lot of acting is really portrayed by him. Johnny Knoxville did a good job as the Rock's best friend and adds good comic relief to the film. I also thought the main villain was portrayed well with him being a good adversary for The Rock. But I thought the Rock's romance was underused and not given enough screen time also the corrupt sheriff is in the same position and doesn't add much to the film. The story is decent seeing a story of an average man attempting to do what's right and fix his down. However, there was other parts of the stories that were not given enough screen time and it took away from the whole film. The script was alright with the chemistry between The Rock and Knoxville being really good but some of the dialogue was poor from some of the other characters. The style in the film is really cool with the action being great and the hard hitting emphasise the realism of the film. Overall this is a fun film but isn't a great film which could of surely been improved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent enough off-the-shelf action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is absolutely nothing special about this movie. It is average all the way. It is however a decent enough off-the-shelf action flick which fulfills its purpose. That is to provide an hour and a half of decent entertainment.Our hero comes back from being away for quite a while and finds the bad guys are in control. A pretty classical story which have been used since the first movies were made (and even before that). The movie can easily be said to be a modern day Western movie as far as the story goes.Our hero, Dwayne Johnson, is doing a decent job of being a hero. The actions scenes, which is really why you are watching this movie after all, are reasonably well done. Of course they are more of TV-movie quality than anything else but good enough in the context of this movie.The movie plays out more or less exactly as you would expect. Hero comes home, find bad guys in control, gets into shuffle with bad guys, bad guys tries to take on hero via family and friends, fails, hero goes after main bad guy in a long chase/fight, happy ending, roll after texts. As I wrote, it could just as well have been an old Western movie. The traditional western saloon is replaced by a casino and the whiskey and cattle is replaced with crooked gambling and some modern drug dealing.The one part I though was silly, as in bad silly, was the trial in the first half of the movie. Warning, spoiler ahead! I mean, come on. Hero demolishes Casino and gets put on trial, hero shows jury his scars and asks to get a non-guilty verdict, jury happily obliges him. What the f?? Apart from this the movie completed its mission of knocking and hour and a half off my life while keeping me from being bored in front of the TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was pretty much as I was expecting--a watered-down, generic action vehicle for Dwayne Johnson. It's pretty much why I waited eight years to check it out.Johnson has the charisma and stature of a serious action star but now, 10 years into his film career, I can't name any iconic characters that he's played or flat-out great films that he's been in. In the same amount of time (say 1982 to 1992) Arnie was already Conan and the Terminator and in Predator, Twins and Total Recall. Johnson is a man who needs to headline a top-tier action franchise and he needs it now (F&amp;F and GI Joe are more ensemble pieces).That being said, Walking Tall is sorely lacking in substance and flair. The working-class, flag-waving, take-no-BS attitude is completely canned and the storyline is best forgotten (which is easy enough). It has virtually no connection to the original Buford Pusser events or the previous adaptations, to it's discredit.I had to entertain myself for much of the second half with an awesome idea for "Walking Bad" in which the Chris Vaughn character moves to New Mexico and takes on Walter White.WALTER WHITE: I'm the one who knocks.CHRIS VAUGHN: I'm the one who knocks...teeth out with my Vaughn stick.Only recommended if you absolutely *heart* the Rock or have never seen an episode of the A-Team, read a Jack Reacher novel, seen Roadhouse, are tired of watching the Rundown, etc. and your roommate accidentally left his DVD when he moved out and you have nothing better to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The theme is old but who cares? This is really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wouldn't be an attack or a negative thing to say that the kind of plot "Walking Tall" presents is old. It's old but it's never tiring and that's why movies like this still exist in this day and age: Man returns to his hometown to see that it's not the same place where he grew up, sees plenty of errors and decides to make justice with his own hands. Pouring us with the sweet taste of the action, Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) plays the Sergeant Chris Vaughn, who after a long absence from home, returns and notices that things aren't like in the old days, many good business shot down and now one casino, commanded by Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough), is the only source money on the small town, but also a place for illegal activities. You probably know the rest. Vaughn finds the truth, receive some "special treatment" on the hands of Hamilton's guards, almost got killed, recovers and decide to get revenge for all the crimes committed by this group and save the town from such bad influence. According to the producers this story really happened. And you know what? I believe in such disclaimer, it looks real and you can imagine something like this happening all the time, somewhere in the world. Even the amazing parts like Vaughn getting elected as Sheriff after a trial in which he was the defendant accused of disturbance of peace when he attacked the casino. It's the noble pursuit of good and peaceful values and an high class action film that would make some of the tough and bone breaker heroes feel ashamed to ever make stupid flicks where violence was the only excuse for action instead of having a real plot. It stays on the same road through the whole walk, the man fighting for his ideals and sense of justice, has some up's and down's, fighting all the time. Take a look at the killings in this film, they're all justified since there was no other alternative, the opposite of so many films with the same theme.With the simplest of formulas and without wasting time with character developments or personal dramas (only for brief and valuable moments), "Walking Tall" is an above the average action picture that can be watched countless times and you never get sick of it. You can't say much about many current movies. Entertaining, well acted and positively efficient in its short time. Supporting cast includes Johnny Knoxville (as Vaughn's best friend), John Beasley, Khleo Thomas ("Holes"), Kevin Durand and Ashley Scott. Have fun! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking too fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I did enjoy this film and the Rock's performance to an extent, I wished the film would've taken some time to slow itself down and allow for more plot and tension to develop instead of the rush job we were given. The movie was entertaining, and since I didn't need to write a thesis or philosophize on who, where, why, and when, I allowed myself to simply enjoy mindless fun and the acting of Dwayne Johnson(the Rock), who's performances have been criticized, and rightfully so, but he's fairly adequate here. The real star to me was Neal McDonough, who looks like an albino Ray Liotta, but pretty much carried the film as the sleazy Jay, a crooked casino owner and ruler of the little town, along with an equally crooked sheriff, played effectively by Michael Bowen. You also might recognize John Beasley(Chris's father)and Johnny Knoxville, who has some amusing scenes as Ray. The good guys win in the end as Chris is elected sheriff in the quickest court case in history, and a past love interest is thrown in the script for good measure. I would say to watch this film for what it is, and not get too overly critical of what is a fun, but very fast ride.</fullReview>

There was an extra document on DVD regarding fight scenes on the film (I saw this film on DVD naturally). Camera work was creative with interesting angles and couple of visually beautiful shots... Rock was great and could really pull out this role.

		<fullReview>Well, yet another good film to come from The Rock (aka Dwayne Johnson). Now, i've been following The Rock's career since his wrestling days, and he was my favourite wrestler when he worked for the WWF/WWE. I've continued to follow his career now he has become an actor. I think he is awesome! He has such an authoritative face he could play anybody! But I think he's best at playing the action hero, with of course comedy thrown in, because thats the way he is...and thats the way he is in this film.I'm unsure as to which bit is the true part of this movie, seeing as it's based on true events.But anyway, this film was one of my Christmas presents and I always look forward to watching a film starring The Rock...and he didn't let me down.The film is about an ex-Sergeant (Rock) who returns to his home town after spending 8 years in the army. A lot of things have changed in 8 years, but he still has his family and his best friend, Ray (Knoxville). A brand new Casino has been built in the town, and it appears that the guy who owns it is The Rocks possible rival. His name is Jay Hamilton (McDonough), and he has a gang of guys working for him to make sure he permanently owns the town...The Sheriff is even as bent as they come.When The Rock confronts Jay about his disliking of the casino and how much the town has changed for the worse, all hell breaks lose...and as in most of The Rocks films...he performs superbly in the action scenes (and I know he loves to do his own stunts).You really start to feel for The Rock as he does admittidley fail first time round, but he's back on his feet as soon as he can and ready to win the fight...and you can feel his rage and his passion to get the town back to what it use to be.This film is very good, and I would suggest that if you're a fan of The Rock, watch it...if you're a fan of action films with a slight hint of humour, watch it....seriously, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's not to love in this hard-hitting action movie.Plot: When former member of the U.S. Army Special Forces Chris Vaughn (Rock) returns to his small hometown in rural Washington, he finds that the once peaceful idyll has been shattered by an influx of drugs and outbreaks of violence.Sensing that his wealthy former high-school rival Jay Hamilton (McDonough) is behind the closing down of the town's once thriving lumber mill, Vaughn stands for election as the town's sheriff and, once he has his badge, takes his deputy (Knoxville) and a sturdy 2 by 4 to clean up the town...Review: The Rock really is the next Arnie with flicks like Walking Tall, The Rundown and the upcoming Gridiron Gang which looks awesome! he's on his way. Back to Walking Tall, Rock does an excellent job as Chris Vaughn actually i could not think of an actor now in his prime who could do a better job 'Vin Diesel' Ha don't make me laugh! he does not have the charisma Rock brings to the back screen. It's not just his pecs he can flex! Co staring with The Rock in Walking Tall is Jackass(MTV) star Johnny Knoxville who pulls of a good character in Ray Templeton with his humour he's very likable. The bad guy in Walking Tall is Neal McDonough this is the first time in fact iv'e ever seen him in a movie he does well in his role the best he could as The Rock just outshines him. After seeing the 5 movies The Rock has stared in so far this ranks 2nd or 3rd it's better than the Scorpion King but not as good as The Rundown. Overall: After watching the movie around 3 times now i can still say i enjoy watching unlike many movies with me. The running time is a poor75mins which i do not like it should be around 90 but hell it might not be so action packed if not. Violence, Humour and one big freaking stick which Rock kicks ass with Walking Tall is one rare movie which is better than the original!! I recommend to anyone one who likes a good kick ass action advantage.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock? Wrestler-turned-actor...hmmm. I'm sure this concept has raised many eyebrows since his big role debut till now. There have been others though; the yellow spandex wearing Terry 'Hulk' Hogan is probably the best known.The Rock did well in The Scorpion King but that movie showcased his size more than his talent for acting.Welcome To The Jungle (The Rundown in the U.S) was also a great movie, but yet again it was a film that took advantage of The Rocks size and his stage combat history (wrestling).Walking Tall however, is a lil different. Although his size is still important to the role, The Rock gets to act more in this movie and he does it very well.His size is very important to the characters he plays in all his movies but I definitely think he pulled off the acting in this one.Johnny Knoxville was also very good in this movie. I think he played the sidekick character well and due to his Jackass background he brought the comedy to the movie.Neal McDonough played the bad guy very well too. So well in fact that I now hate him! LOL! At the end of the movie I felt a strong sense of justice and it's nice to know that in a world of bad, people still do good.The tag line 'One man will stand up for what's right' really says it all! After watching this movie many times I actually e-mailed Buford's daughter to tell what an amazing man I thought her father was. He was a man that did not take well to injustice, and I admire him for that. He had the strength physically and mentally to intervene when he witnessed wrongdoing in all forms. He proved that you don't need to have some kind of special power to be a true hero.I look forward to seeing him in Be Cool, Johnny Bravo and some of the other movies he will be appearing in this year.</fullReview>

Of course he is going to be better in the rough and tough movies more that romantic ones as he has the body for it. I really hope they come out with some real action movies with him in them. He doesn't seem to want to be in movies where they use guns. He is more use to using his fists without all the shooting. His wrestling helped him in his acting career as some of what they do in the ring has to be acting or they would get seriously hurt.</fullReview>

Sure, the movie has a pretty obvious setup, but that's not what the movie is about to begin with. You don't watch the movie to figure out a surprise ending. But you do watch the movie for a good message, and for some pretty sweet fight scenes. The movie kept me interested the whole time, I laughed, I gasped, and I had a good time. The Rock plays his role well too. His character is not much of a stretch for him, but that doesn't really matter. Oh yeah, and Johnny Knoxville is hilarious. He is excellently cast in the character he plays, helping to being a good number of laughs to the table. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who likes straight-forward action movies with a good sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**The Rock appears to be popping up on lots of British chat shows lately, and always comes off well. He's articulate, has great presence and seems pretty quick off the mark. Why then, did he make this godawful film? I did only catch this film by chance, one of those 'lets see the next film that starts' things. And fortunately we were the only people in the cinema because we were so bored by the time it got to the climax that we were talking about The Bourne Supremacy. About the only thing this film has going for it is that it's mercifully short. And Johnny Knoxville.Maybe I'm being a little harsh here, maybe this film worked better for an American audience - we just don't hero worship our military like they do. And our villages and communities tend to be ruined by little things like pit closures rather than the opening of casinos. But overall, the story was just too twee for me. And as for writing . . . It felt very much like the director didn't trust his audience to recognise the goodies from the baddies. And so we were treated to clumsy scenes where the two opposing factions play American Football together - which is ridiculous in itself! However, what made it worse was the way that the football game was used to highlight the ethics of the two groups - The Rock and co discuss real tactics; the generic baddies plot to disable and possibly maim their opponents. And just in case anyone wasn't sure who was who, the big bad guy then pops open a bottle of beer and gets in his car! Damn, these are bad people! Why didn't they just give him an eyepatch, or maybe even a fluffy white cat to stroke!And don't get me started on the female lead. She pole dances pretty well and wears a bra pretty well too. Of course, that's all the script required her to do.This film claims to have been based on a true story. I bet the real life residents of that town have now lynched their sheriff in protest that this film was ever made.Not even Johnny going postal with a rifle in someone's living room can save this piece of rubbish. Avoid!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock delivers a pulse pounding, cranium cracking, wood wielding tribute to Sheriff Buford Pusser. It is a well thought out remake/re-imagining of the original Walking Tall like The Italian Job (2003) remake. I love action films and this definitely enters my top five at the same level as Welcome to the Jungle (The Rundown). The Rock is a very competent actor and has great chemistry with Johnny Knoxville when they share screen time. If you are a Knoxville fan there is a very amusing sequence involving some bad guys and a shotgun. The film also has great music throughout, my personal favorite is the opening song. If The Rock continues to make movies like this then his fans will be very very happy. See this film if you like your action fast, realistic and frequent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta Love da Rock... and the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though Walking Tall cast itself as a remake but changed a lot of the fundamentals of the story, it made for an intriguing story, one that appealed to both male and female audiences. I absolutely LOVE the Rock and whether or not you may consider me biased with this account, it doesn't matter. That's the beauty of the Internet. It really doesn't matter, does it? :)In any case, the Rock's background in wrestling was a good foundation for acting which he has improved on, beginning with The Rundown and moving on. (I did like him in The Scorpion King, too... and hated the Return of the Mummy or whatever it was called. To us Rock fans, it was a farce, promoting the Rock but only showing a few minutes at the beginning and the end????) I enthusiastically suggest Walking Tall as a good flick, full of action and with a strong storyline pertinent to our time, with states and counties fighting against casinos or against the bad elements that follow the emergence of casinos. You like the Rock? You like good story plots? You like action? Walking Tall is worth the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>whatever measly story line there is to this is centered around a couple of wild-west confrontations, which mostly consist of the Rock swinging a large piece of wood. It's so shallow that I won't even bother rehashing the premise. Suffice it to say that the Rock is one 'Walking Tall' away from the end of his movie career.If you want to see a movie starring the Rock, rent 'The Rundown', which is vastly more superior and entertaining. He simply doesn't exert enough force in this movie to carry it, and the rest of the cast are more decorative than functional. He wasn't much better in 'The Rundown', but the other key characters (Chris Walken, Rosario Dawson, Sean William Scott) provided enough finesse to counterweigh and even complement his brutish, thick-necked manner. There's simply no comparison possible that would have 'Walking Tall' holding a candle to 'The Rundown'. I think the Rock has potential, but it's clearly not evident here.</fullReview>

I don't give a rat's ass if anybody besides The Rock can act. I don't care if the camera work sucks. I want to see people get beat up and s**t blow up. Walking Tall delivers.

		<fullReview>There aren't a whole lot of movies these days which focus on the average person standing up for what is right. Yes, perhaps Chris Vaughn was not the "Average Joe", but he saw something that had to be cleaned up and he did what was necessary to take care of it. Under normal circumstances, many people would have given up after the Sheriff's Department told Chris to look the other way. Many people would have backed down. However, Chris knew that his family, friends, and even the future of the town was at stake. Although Chris was up against adversity from old friends and even the police, he did not back down. I think everyone should take something from this movie and learn that no matter what forces you may oppose, as long as you are in the right, you shouldn't back down from anybody. No matter how "big" they may be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw "Walking Tall", and was actually surprised; it was really good! I'll admit, I pegged Dwayne Jones aka The Rock, for a big, dumb muscle-head, with no real skill other than to get wrestling fans all excited when he raises an eye brow, but I was wrong-he can also act pretty well.The movie also includes one of the "Jackass" founders, Johnny Knoxville, acting the role of the best friend of Chris Vaughn (The Rock). Knoxville, also does a decent job in playing his role of a guy trying to get his life back on track after some hard times; quite a different turn from performing stupid stunts which usually leaves about a pound of skin on the sidewalk!!"Walking Tall" (2004) had lots of action (mainly involving a 2x4), a few funny moments, like one involving the "thorough" searching of a truck, and even a steamy love scene. Yep! you read that right; The Rock does a love scene-not too bad either, if I might add ;). I had no real expectations before going to watch this movie, but was pleasantly satisfied. I'm no Ebert or Roeper, but I give it my 2 thumbs up!</fullReview>

He should have had better supporting characters, like putting in his buddy Stone Cold Steve Austin and Vince Mcmahon would have been a better bad guy then the blonde pretty boy model they chose.

This movie falls short of The Mummy Returns, The Scorpion King and, The Rundown, the Rock's 3 previous movies. Among action movies in general it falls short of lofty expectations. The Rock has the potential to be the next action star taking the torch from Arnold Schwarzenegger. I hope to see the Rock in better roles than this or at least with better directors who will give the Rock material better suited to his personality. 5/10*****The Rock will certainly get his actor's wings in the future and will gain the ability to broaden his repotoire and tackle other realms of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'Edgy' New millennium version: high on octane, short on story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original Walking Tall; it had more story, suspense, and tension. However, this version was updated to the style, action and substance most action movie-goers want to see. I thought the cinematography was well done and I enjoyed the edgy editing techniques applied. This was most noticeable when Chris Vaughn (The Rock) was recuperating from his first encounter at the casino.The hip mix of humor and action is becoming a trademark for The Rock's movies--with each movie he makes, he continues to get better. Along with 'edgy' editing style there was a good mix of music and score. It was 'MTV' like, but not over the top(done to one or two scenes).Normally I don't notice the sound effects, but again I believe it was superbly done. The technicians did a wonderful job from beginning to end with this film. When critiquing films, they are sometimes overlooked.The movie extracted the same emotions I got from the original(although they didn't last nearly as long, due to the extremely shortened version of the story), and with this movie there was no room for Walking Tall II, Walking Tall Final Chapter or Walking Tall the series( of course Hollywood could find a way); all the lose ends were tied.This film was not on par with The Rock's previous venture (The Rundown), but hopefully the next film he partakes in will give him an opportunity to display more of his comedic talent.Thumbs ups/ B+ / 8 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While lovers of the original Walking Tall and it's director Phil Karlson are still nauseous after last weekends sneak peak, and with a 75 min. running time here's a film everyone can dislike. It's hard to believe that even remake redundancy can stink so low. To its credit at least there was no attempt at emotional or character development, originality, tension or suspense, although it did manage a horrible substitution of wretched comic relief, dull acting and a one note story line. Even the villains were boring. Plus there were scenes in the TV trailers that were not in the film. Isn't that fraud?? But considering that Vince McMahn is a credited producer of this empty mess there's no surprise here; it follows his usual line of business; show the audience something that in reality is not true. There's a difference between entertainment that's mindless as opposed to insulting. It's time to wake up people; if you continue to support TV fuelled debasement of cinema you'll keep getting 75 mins. of stale, flat retreads. If your thinking of shelling out $8-$10.00 for this time waster, do yourself a favor; buy a six-pack, popcorn, invite a friend over and rent the original. Why even consider stomach turning pre-packaged fast food when for the same price you can have filet mignon. But that's not fair, Walking Tall 2004 is lousy at any price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shock at the Suckage of the Rock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking Tall (2004)Within the remake of 1973's 'Walking Tall,' a tribute to real-life Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, who stood alone in his fight against crime in a corrupt town, are the faint shades of what might have been a good movie. Unfortunately, these small glimpses are not nearly enough to make up for a devastating clichéd whole of an action film.For instance, some of the fight scenes, though brief, are very satisfying. When Dwayne Johnson, better know as WWE's "The Rock" shows up at his former friend Jay Hamilton's casino looking for vengeance, after security guards have stabbed him and left him for dead weeks earlier, and causes a tidal wave of destruction and mayhem with a 2x4, we can't help but root for him. When Hamilton's flunkies storm the office of The Rock's Chris Vaughn, who was subsequently elected sheriff, blazing assault rifles, and Vaughn succeeds in layin' the smackdown on them with the same block o' wood, it's pure guilty pleasure.It's only too bad the screenwriters, who it apparently took four to write this monstrosity of a picture, didn't just go completely to hell with the story and make the movie one giant action sequence. Isn't that what the Rock's fans, the core audience of the movie, is really after anyway?The basic flaw in the film is that it's too over-the-top to be anything but mindless. The characters are shallowly contrived and we can't relate to them. The Rock's 'struggle' to bring down the town casino and re-open the closed mill, a symbol of order and decency, is all too easy for him to achieve. The original Buford Pusser, who Vaughn's ex-soldier is supposed to personify, didn't have it easy. In this movie, the odds are totally stacked in favor of the Rock. There's no sense of real tension, loss, or fear for our protagonist. He's kinda like Superman, without the kryptonite.For those wishing to see The Rock beat on some unworthy jabronis, this is your movie. For all others, especially those who fondly recall the original, your time is better spent renting the original and basking once more in the memories. You ain't gonna find anything special here.Grade: C+</fullReview>

As a child, I wasn't meant to see it. It was one of those films parents try to protect their children from seeing.This is not Walking Tall. This is very weak, something I'd show a little kid to teach him to behave. Sheriff Buford Pusser didn't have any help and he didn't need any. There were no good guys.

		<shortDescription>A lame case for vigilantism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It says that they spent $56 million making this movie, and $54 million of it must have been for the salary of the star, the otherwise estimable Dwayne ("The Rock") Johnson. The production values are too cheap to explain a big budget, and only that much money could have tempted this star to have appeared in this stinker. It is about grievances of the hero expressed in mindless, unnecessary violence, much of it committed by the hero in plain violation of the law, as often as not with him guessing about the rightness of his action. He's actually a vigilante, not a hero. In the end the bad guys were vanquished, all right, but that is almost a coincidence resulting from the maelstrom of general violence. This is a movie that purports to be about right and wrong. If there is any virtue in this movie at all, it is that it teaches, by opposite example, that how you go about being victorious matters. There is a right way to do these things, and this movie shows the wrong way. The original version of this movie was very careful to show the right way, and made a case for nonviolence as well. This version betrays both those values. Don't let your kids watch it.</fullReview>

Actually too comfortable, he could have been a little more passionate. Johnny Knoxville's performance is great. I really enjoyed watching him.Movie and the story is powerful too. As you know, the story is coming from a local hero Sheriff Bufford Pussers real life, who fought and beat the organized crime in his county at late 1960s... Many people wrote that the movie is short. I think it is great that this movie was short, because otherwise it would be boring. 80 minutes is a nice time to see the action.

		<fullReview>Walking Tall (2004) - Starring The Rock and Johnny Knoxville - Written By David Klass, Channing Gibson, David Levien, and Brian Koppelman - Based on the 1973 Screenplay By Mort Briskin - Directed by Kevin Bray - MPAA Rating: PG-13 - 5/10Why it was necessary to make a film like this so short, I have no idea. Walking Tall could have been, SHOULD have been much better than it was. I was especially worried when in the beginning credits, "WWE Films" was given company credit. Since when does WWE have a film division? Whatever. I didn't let that bother me too much until I saw the film itself. It was just a bunch of fight scenes strung together. Any storyline thrown in there was only thrown in to justify a fight scene. In fact, it was just LIKE watching the WWE. No disrespect intended towards the WWE, I myself have a soft spot for sports entertainment. But it has no place on the silver screen. Considering what this film was based on, it could have done so much more. The Rock was a good casting decision, it had some fun and witty lines, and that kept Walking Tall from being a total waste of money. But in the end, it was too short, and I expected much more from it.Smitty's evaluation: 5/10 - Worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So THAT'S A Pusser Stick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 25 years, I finally know why my dad called his favourite round twig a "Pusser stick". 'Walking Tall' is a remake of the 1973 Joe Don Baker vigilante flick about a man who was mad as hell and wasn't gonna take it no more, Jack. That man was named Buford Pusser. Now, the first mistake with the '04 version is to give the hero a different name. Chris Vaughn? Come on, I know The Rock is too cool to let anybody call him "Buford", but how do you take away the "Pusser" part? Yes, this is WWE wrestler The Rock's 3rd leading role. He's been proving to wrestling audiences for about 6 years that he is a marvelous entertainer and last year's 'The Rundown' proved he was more than just a Scorpion King. He continues to one-up the likes of early Stallone and Ah-nuld with his combination of physicality, coolness, and sense of humour. Too bad this movie starts out so well, then coasts through on violence cruise control in the second half.Returning to his small hometown after a stint in the military, Vaughn discovers that a childhood friend has turned the town into a mini-Vegas. Shades of 'Ben-Hur' abound as Neal McDonough (playing the power-hungry Jay Hamilton, Jr.) tries to get Vaughn to come aboard as his head of security at his seedy, drug-pushing casino. The hero refuses, quickly finds himself at violent odds with Hamilton, and runs for sheriff to allow the scared citizens to walk tall again. Oh, and he starts out his crusade by demolishing the casino and its security guards armed only with a 2x4, his, uh, Vaughn stick.The Rock plays the early scenes as well as Stallone did in 'First Blood', showing the quiet pain behind his eyes. These are warriors who've seen too much killing and want to fit into a normal society. But just as 'First Blood' becomes stupid and unintelligible, 'Walking Tall' doesn't trust its star to play more than one dimension...even though the opening of both films proves they can! Vaughn initially chooses the Pusser stick over a shotgun, proving that you CAN sink to violent levels without resorting to bloodbaths. But it doesn't take long before everybody is getting shot and I was checking my watch. Oops, no need for fidgeting---not even 80 minutes after the opening credits came the closing credits. How much character development was dropped to make room for all the gun-play? The cast is up to acting, but director Kevin Bray was salivating for the heavy artillery.In the very few instances the actors can relax and do something with the cookie-cutter screenplay, 'Walking Tall' has some easy banter and even a few laughs. Johnny Knoxville (as Vaughn's sidekick and eventual deputy) acquits himself far better than I would have thought possible. The Rock is due to get a good script to match his charismatic talents. Not this time, though. Oh, I gotta mention one more thing...if I'm ever on trial for assault, I want the jury that's so easily swayed by Vaughn. We may be rooting for our hero to go all vigilante on the bad guys, but this movie makes a mockery of the legal system. Oh, why do I care about common sense in an ultimately dreary action picture? The filmmakers don't.</fullReview>

Hollywood remakes, similar to sequels, are just vain attempts by movie producers to replicate the success of previous movie blockbusters. However, on the second time around, the replication rarely works. And, unfortunately, the 2004 version of "Walking Tall" is no exception.In the 2004 remake, famed wrestler Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson plays the "Walking Tall" lead character, Chris Vaughn. However, unlike Joe Don Baker, who played Buford Pusser in the original '70s' movie, Chris Vaughn is a biracial bachelor, with a family consisting of his two parents (black father and a white mother), a sister, and a kid nephew.With his brawn body definition and commanding presence, "The Rock" effectively personifies the appearance of the movie's lead character as a one-man militia out to take on the mob. However, and as many would expect, Johnson's lack of professional acting experience and skills significantly hinders his capability in efficiently delivering the lead role in this movie, making his performance, at best, somewhat mundane. And, unfortunately, Kevin Bray's quirky direction of the movie does very little to compensate.However, the story line and theme of the second movie doesn't deviate significantly from the original '70s' cult classic, telling the based-on-real-life tale of a principled, morally upstanding man returning to his hometown and waging a battle against the corruption and crime that currently plagues it. And the 2004 version also showcases all of the most notable elements of the original--the violent, near-fatal knife slashing; the subsequent display of body scars in court; knockdown, drag-out casino brawls; gun battles; and, of course, the signature trademark weapon of revenge and authority: a wooden club.Yet what makes this remake so disappointing is that the emotional impact that made the original movie so popular during the 1970s is entirely absent from the 2004 movie. While the original movie effectively used disturbingly violent scenes and on-screen tragedy to incite the viewer to sympathize with the plight of Bufford Pussner, the remake--even with its own display of incessant violence--doesn't seem to generate the same effective emotional empathy with the Chris Vaughn character. And the remake, particularly with its lame and somewhat abrupt ending, also lacks the substance and the climatic grip that made the original version of "Walking Tall" so powerful and poignant.As with most Hollywood remakes, you're probably better off to watch the original movie and simply pass on the imitation. The 2004 version of "Walking Tall" will most likely disappoint, especially if you have previously viewed the original 1973 movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking Tall Short On Quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't you just hate it when a movie misrepresents itself by calling itself a remake, uses the same title, but has no resemblance to the original film? Enter Walking Tall (2004). The Rock stars as the new Buford Pusser character, who even goes by a different name. The film is no populist, crowd rousing pleaser like the original. Instead, it's a poor excuse of a predictable formulaic action movie with toned down violence for its PG-13 rating. Instead of identifying with the Rock as fighting for a righteous cause, as in the original, we almost immediately see him turn into another thug. This is especially true after he is elected sheriff. This transformation distances us from any real emotional connection we could make with his character. Instead of an earnest crusade against vice and corruption, the Rock uses the same amoral tactics that the villains use. The battle between them erupts into an escalating exchange of violence, or at least as much violence as a PG-13 rating allows. The Rock salvages an old girlfriend from the clutches of the baddies just in time for her to cozy up to him in his office. Instead of swinging on a pole in firefighter garb, she heats things up in the sheriff's office. What a change in character! Johnny Knoxville plays the Rock's felon sidekick deputy, uh huh, and does an adequate job in comparison to what little other character development we see from the rest of the cast. Neal McDonough is the villain, and phones in a predictable "black hat" performance. In all likelihood, no one will come to see this film expecting character development, good acting, or a great script. The Rock has good screen presence, but Walking Tall is short on quality. *1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this really a movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember paying to go to the movie, getting my drink, etc. and then I saw something that seems to be familiar as TV Plot #601B or such. You know the type. Warrior leaves army to return to town he wanted to leave. Finds old girlfriend now having to pretend to be slutty. Finds town gone to seed with father out of work and old rich kid rival now controlling the town. Police are corrupt. Warrior now has to take on the town and system and kill everyone in site while doing lots of general carnage. Gee, wonder if he will win? Will he get the girl? Will the bad guy lose and show that all rich people must be evil? Duh? Like in any TV show when they put the main character in peril, you know pretty well that the character will survive because, well, there are other shows still to come and it could not happen if they killed him. So the "danger" is fake (even for a movie) and you already know pretty much what is going to happen.I really like The Rock and as others have said, here in this movie he seems to just be phoning it in. I hope he got paid a lot to do this and that he will have gotten doing films just for paychecks out of his system so next time he can pick one with something unique, like a plot. The Rock is a great action star and we need some good action films. This isn't one.My advice is to wait for the DVD. Or watch any episode on TV of any action type show. They all are similar to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey guys, lets re-makes are all the rage, let's do one for Walking Tall, but who said we cast as our flabby everyman. Hmmm..oh I got it Dwayne something...you know that Rock guy, my kids love that wrestlin show. What, huh? No Mick Foley won't pull it off he's too rednecky for this. Get me the Rock. My kid's love Jackass too, lets work that in somehow. maybe a buddy-buddy type thing. This is gonna be great!! Make sure it's no longer then a little over an hour, so we can show it more times per screen. Ka-ching!! OK, slipping out of this skit for a second, let me just say this movie doesn't hold a wooden slab over the original or part 2. Hell it's dubious to Part 3. It could've been a TV film, you know the kind where they have a reality show to find "The Next Action Star" and the dubious prize would be to star in the movie or something. Skip it.My Grade: C-DVD Extras: Movie commentary with the Rock, 2nd commentary with director Kevin Bray, cinematographer Glen MacPherson, and editor Robert Ivison; stunt featurette;deleted scenes; Bloopers; Alternate ending; Making of Species 3 (and no I'm NOT kidding); Theatrical trailer; Trailers for "Soul Plain", "Species 3", "Bulletproof Monk", "Dark Blue", "Out of Time", a few compilation trailers, and a video game trailer for "Everything or Nothing" It's pretty damn bad when the best feature doesn't even have anything to do with the movie you just watched, but "Species 3" (or as I'd like to call it "Species: the College Years)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After The Scorpion King and The Rundown, I guess they needed another generic action movie to turn The Rock into a big action star. I just bet they had this idea of remaking Walking Tall on the shelf for years; just waiting for the right star to cash in on. I'll tell you right now- this is not a good movie. It barely even feels like a whole movie (you'll be hearing this over and over in reviews, trust me). The action was only okay, the story doesn't evolve any further than what you hear on the commercials, and it's just dull. I don't really resent Walking Tall, it's not horrible or anything. It's just not good. It didn't even really try to be good. At all. The people who made it probably just figured, "Hey, if we get The Rock to star in it, people will see it." Well, people did go see it, and people were disappointed. I know cause I'm one of them.My rating: 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They tried! That is all Hollywood movie makers know, I do believe. Are they sure how to make a movie on their own anymore? Has all the imagination gotten lost somewhere along the way? In my opinion, it has.I will admit that they did a good job on the film, but at what and whose expense? The story is no longer about Buford Pusser anymore, it is about a guy from Washington named Chris Vaughn. The acting from both The Rock and Johnny Knoxville is much better than either have done or did thereafter, including "Be Cool" and "The Dukes of Hazzard".Much of the storyline is the same as the original "Walking Tall", but there are noticeable differences. First of all, Buford Pusser was married and had two children. He had no sister or nephew. All though there are these differences, the film still faired well.It received a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film focuses upon Chris Vaughn(The Rock)a former US soldier who goes back to his home and finds the town is ruled by a corrupt ringleader(Neal McDonough) owned of a casino.Drug and crime run over the place and he along with a friend(Johnny Knoxville) decides clean it converting himself in Sheriff .Meanwhile he falls in love with a stripper(Kristen Wilson). The film is a powerful story about one army man and his fight for what he believes in and he has to find justice outside of the law . Director Kevin Bray captures every bone-crunching hit,kick,punch ,he wants to make sure that the action was raw,intense action sequences.Today's cinematic world of explosions,gunplay,people floating through the air and everything else you could imagine however this film is a just straight-up,old-fashioned,old school,hard nose,blue-collar and great feeling of realism .Club-wielding sheriff with a four by four piece of ceder gives hits and punch.The protagonist admirable rendered by the Rock has a big stick and he's trying to knock somebody's jaw loose.Violents incidents have a different flavor and character to go on and do more to succeed at his goal.The first incident in casino has a train-wreck chaos and hell breaks loose in old-fashioned stomp .In the next incident when he returns for revenge,it's more stealthy kind of shooting style because it's a more stealthy incident,he's got a bit of a plan even though he's acting out of rage,he's using the techniques and skills that he learned in the military.The third is basically just make it as riveting and energetic as possible,just a real thing,director is bringing back the movies of old,of yesterday that really took visceral raw action and put it on screen .This is an ultraviolent crime film wowed the movie-going public. The picture is dedicated to the memory of Tenesse folk hero sheriff Buford Passer but is based on real deeds.In fact,the movie is a remake of ¨Walking Tall¨1973 by Phil Karlson (with Joe Don Baker) and spawned numerous sequels(with Bo Svenson)and TV series.This film is even more violent than original .

		<shortDescription>A short and brainless action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock plays Chris Vaughan, a special forces soldier who returns home to revive his family lumber business only to discover that the town has been corrupted by drugs and violence thanks to a crooked casino boss (Neal McDonough). Swearing to clean up his hometown, Vaughan takes matters in his own hand in a way that epitomizes the saying "speak softly and carry a big stick".The story is pretty generic yet this could have been a good, stylish, slick action movie. The final result is only average and a bit of a disappointment. I only rated the movie above average because of The Rock. He's makes a good hero and he gives a pretty good performance. Just watching him kick ass is pretty fun and he's good at that. He's working with a weak script though. The story is kind of lame and it doesn't really develop well. Actually nothing really develops since the film is only about 75 minutes long. This may or may not be problem depending on if you want a brainless action film or something with a little more substance.Besides for The Rock, the only other person that stands out is Neal McDonough. He does the best with his role and gives a good performance. Johnny Knoxville tried too hard to be funny and he ended up being annoying. He doesn't hurt the film but he doesn't help it either. Kevin Bray directs this remake and he does a decent job. He's pretty weak when it comes to telling a good story but he does a decent job with the action. The action itself isn't that impressive and the film gets boring from time to time. Walking Tall is also highly unrealistic so don't go in expecting a realistic movie. Example, someone falls two stories and he is still able to fight without much trouble. Compared to The Rock's previous films, Walking Tall is better than the Scorpion King but not as good as The Rundown. In the end, this might make a decent rental for those who want a brainless action flick but there's very little substance to support the action. Rating 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking action film. Dwayne Johnson is awesome. Walking Tall is one of my favourite movies of 2004.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start things off, I just wanna say that the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) has been my idol longer than any other idols i have. He was the first celebrity i ever knew, and i've known him longer than any other celebrity/wrestler. I've been a fan of the Rock for well over 13 years now. He means a lot to me, and so does wrestling. I think that's the biggest reason of all, why i love this film - it's because of the Rock, main starring. Chris Vaughn (Dwayne) arrives back in his town, years after he left. It's different now, and things have changed. The place is overrun with crime, secrets, violence, newer features and places, and corruption. When Vaughn gets viciously and brutally beat down and near-killed, he makes it his mission to get revenge of those who left him for dead. Filled with action-packed fights, good dialogue and mild humour, Walking Tall will surely have you at the edge of your seat --- cheering for the Rock as Vaughn, of course. Walking Tall is a great action film with explosive and intense action - it's one of my top 10 favourite pure action films of all-time. My rating for it is a strong, locked and deserving 9.5/10.</fullReview>

I guess the movie is not supposed to be refined in any way and it certainly isn't.

It's the spirit of the good republican, who doesn't confuse freedom with exploitation and understands, just like any good man of any belief-system, that there can only be freedom if everyone is free and has an equal share of the material wealth at hand and not like now, where the very few have everything and the very many have zilch.

After all, The Rock is a pro wrestler and Knoxvile emerged from one of those incredibly stupid-guy shows of the 1990s. Here they are buddies who take on their little town's endless army of bad guys who work at an old friend's casino. Neal McDonough, perhaps most memorable in RAVENOUS, plays the old school chum and casino owner/drug lord who has taken over the town. The Rock looks great swinging his 2x4, and the fight scenes are some of the best of the past decade, clean and lean. No eye-jarring quick cuts so that you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys. Very nicely photographed in a scenic area I imagine is somewhere in Canada. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking Tall starts as ex-marine Chris Vaugh (The Rock) arrives back home in the small town where he grew up after eight years away, Chris heads for his parents house &amp; there's a tearful reunion. As Chris looks around his old town he notices how things have changed, local sleaze Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) has closed the mill &amp; opened a casino that Chris finds out rips people off, has security guards that sell drugs &amp; feature strip show's that just lower the tone of the once respectable town. Afetr his nephew Pete (Khleo Thomas) takes drugs sold by the casino security guards Chris decides to smash the place up with a plank of wood &amp; break some bones in the process, after the police try to convict him Chris also runs for Sheriff so he can clean his once beloved town up legally &amp; make it safe for innocent Americans to live there again...Directed by Kevin Bray this fairy straight forward action film is actually a remake of the much grittier Walking Tall (1973) which itself was based on a the true story of Sheriff Buford Pusser who almost single-handedly cleaned his small town up of corruption &amp; crime. The one thing that stands out about Walking Tall is just how short it is, at just 86 minutes long over ten of those minutes are the end credits over black so in reality Walking Tall barely lasts over 70 odd minutes &amp; with such a scant run time at least it moves along at a decent pace but consequently there's not much build-up or development. Also the whole time-line seems too fast, one moment The Rock has just been acquitted of GBH &amp; criminal damage (because of a sob story he reads to the jury) &amp; the next he has been appointed Sheriff who then sacks all the corrupt Deputies &amp; hires an ex-junkie to partner him, now don't you need some sort of qualification or training to become a Sheriff? The Rock &amp; his best mate then don't do a whole lot of police work before he gets to beat up more bad guy's &amp; in a rather unsatisfying ending bring the main villain to justice &amp; see him put behind bars, somehow there's no real feeling of retribution or revenge in just arresting someone. The pace of the film is at the expense of development &amp; not that much actually happens to The Rock before he goes mental, the script should have dragged him to hell and back just to make his revenge even more sweet &amp; meaningful. Having said that it's fairly entertaining &amp; at least it's short, it certainly passes the time harmlessly enough.With the obvious limitations the PG rating brings Walking Tall is fairly tame, rather than a dark gritty tale of one mans quest for revenge &amp; justice Walking Tall feels more like a standard cops &amp; robbers type flick where the motives are more moralistic, clean cut &amp; black and white. Having said that the fights are very good, there's no CGI or quick machine gun editing of shaky hand held camera as the action is clear, well shot &amp; edited so you can actually see what's going on at all times. There are some shoot-outs &amp; explosions too although none of the action is groundbreaking it is competent enough.Filmed in British Columbie in Canada this had a supposed budget of about $56,000,000 &amp; it's well made for sure. The acting is alright, The Rock should start choosing his scripts &amp; dare I say it director's (why so many inexperienced ones?) a little better or this action hero for the twenty first century thing might not go as well as he had hoped. Johnny Knoxville of Jackass fame plays the comic relief.Walking Tall is a fairly simple teen action film, the story could have made a great dark revenge morality tale but the film never goes anywhere near far enough with the premise. The action scenes are great with no CGI or machine gun editing &amp; along with a likable performance from The Rock that's the main thing that saves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Remake and a Bit More than an Update</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a pretty long time since I last saw the excellent 1967 "Walking Tall" - an embellished but basically true story about Sheriff Buford Pusser, a southern small-town version of Harry Callaghan or Popeye Doyle. Casting Dwayne Johnson in the role of Chris Vaughn (a radically different role than Joe Don Baker's Pusser), young Director Kevin Bray has made an admirable debut in the action film market with this radically fictionalized and very contemporary version of Walking Tall.Chris Vaughn, unlike Pusser, is a towering, muscle-bound, compassionate and irreproachable veteran. With strong convictions about right and wrong and simple but equally profound solutions to problems, Chris returns to his close-knit family and small home-town from the military hoping to define a new course for his life. He is, however, unprepared for the changes that his little town has undergone during his absence. One of his high school rivals, a smarmy blonde who is allegedly 1/16th Native American, has opened a casino which has replaced the lumber mill his father once worked in as the economic engine for this little town. Though it is difficult to explain this, given the fact that almost all of Jay's (Neal McDonough) employees appear to be from somewhere else, it is easy enough to let this little problem go in order to enjoy the film's very basic good vs evil plot structure.Basically, the casino appears to be making more money than its gambling business can explain, and when Chris and his family twice become victims of Jay's underhanded dealings, Chris takes the high road, runs for Sheriff, and takes matters into his own hands.Nicely supported by McDonough, Johnny Knoxville and John Beasley, Johnson - for once - gets to show off his acting talent as much as his amazing physical presence - as he creates a character as memorable for his libertarian approach to getting things done as his ability to throw people several feet away with one arm.However, the film is what it is - a simple, albeit strong, action film, which often relies too heavily on exploding props, guns with endless supplies of ammunition and some very improbable stunt work. Since it sought to deliver what makes money in the typical contemporary action film, it is fairly easy to lose what the film does right in in flying break-away glass and splintering floorboards.Recommended for action fans. Not recommended for fans of the original film.</fullReview>

Much to his surprise however, things have drastically changed as most of the town inhabitants are under the influence of a corrupt local casino run by an old high school buddy who has the entire law enforcement administration in his pocket. Vaugn's solution: become the sheriff and run the muck out of town himself. The Rock is certainly the right choice for this familiar one-man vigilante setup, but even with an alarmingly short running time there isn't much of a story to tell, or a plot that can rise above its seen-it-all-before limitations. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>admirable for film economy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing more or less than a fun action film diversion starring former pro wrestler "The Rock". In this film he's better than I've ever seen him, and comes close to the kind of goofy but charming action hero excess that saw its heyday in the 1980s with Arnie and Stallone. This film appealed to me more than anything else I've seen him in and in fact than most action films I've seen recently because the style is more down-to-earth. You don't have these hyperfast editing moves; the pace of the film only really speeds up when it needs to, and the film-makers seem to realize that you can't empathize with the characters if you can't even watch them stand still. It's interesting how the film's story (this is a remake) harks back to the "good old days" in contrasting the economy of the small town with a casino to that in the days when lumber was king. A bit sentimental, yes, but it gives this movie somewhat more to hang its hat on than the normal actioner these days. I laughed at a couple of the action scenes; it was most entertaining when he took a piece of lumber to the casino and smashed all the machines, at one point scaring a security guy so bad that he ran into a pole and knocked himself out! Johnny Knoxville is surprisingly serviceable as his good friend, a man new to the ways of following and enforcing the law.Definitely not a great flick but it provides some laughs and some good action and I think that's really all the film was designed to do. It's notable that the film has no real female protagonist -- this is a film that really knows what it's doing and doesn't try to do anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former WWE superstar THE ROCK (DWAYNE JOHNSON) stars as a young man recently returned to his hometown only to find it controlled by a sleazy rich boy &amp; his scum buddies. When he finds one of his friends being ripped off at a casino owned by the bad guys, he intervenes &amp; winds up being horribly attacked &amp; left for dead &amp; when the law enforcement refuses to punish them, he takes the law into his own hands including running &amp; winning the role of town sheriff during an election, however this soon aggravates the baddies who attempt to put him away. With the help of a buddy of his, the bad guys are going to find out that this is one sheriff they are not going to mess with! Despite it's extremely brief running time, just 74 minutes! WALKING TALL manages to do what so many Hollywood style action movies have failed to do recently, pack one heck of an fun action film with enough stunts, shoot outs &amp; fights, duels (check out the nail biting &amp; suspenseful fight at the end!) suspense &amp; even a touch of comedy here &amp; there &amp; you have an action movie that should get the adrenaline pumping for action fans looking for a good action movie. The direction was extremely well handled, the acting great &amp; THE ROCK continues to be a good action hero with a talent for acting rather than just solid muscle to back him, which is more than one can say for most professional wrestlers turned actors &amp; current action stars. A good job by all involved. However despite being billed as a remake of the 1973 original, the film bares little resemblance to it, even the characters names are different. Must set some type of record though as being close to topping the longest end credits in film history (14 whole minutes!) Followed by two (in name only) direct to video/DVD sequels. The first is called WALKING TALL: THE PAYBACK**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kitsap County, Washington</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good action film, but I take exception to the setting. Since the producers/writers created the fictional town of Ferguson, Washington, they should also have created a fictional county! Kitsap is real, and I live here, so I found the scenery, ferry ride (which appeared to be on a lake, not a salt water inlet), and other references quite funny. For example, near the beginning someone told Chris to try Aberdeen if he wants mill work (a real city in southwest Washington, Grays Harbor County, that is supported by the lumber industry). There was also a reference to going "down" to Seattle. Someone near Aberdeen would go "up" to Seattle. If you live in Kitsap County, you go "over" to Seattle -- on a ferry across Puget Sound. I know the actual filming was done in British Columbia and so would not look like my county, I just wish they'd used a different county name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dedicated to the memory of Sheriff Buford Pusser, but this is a far cry from the original WALKING TALL(1973)starring Joe Don Baker. Retired U.S. Special Forces Sgt. Chris Vaughn(The Rock)returns to his small hometown and finds out the old lumber mill has been replaced with a big gambling Casino ran by an old high school rival Jay Hamilton(Neal McDonough). The innocence of his boyhood town has been tainted by a XXX video shop, thugs and drugs. Vaughn finds himself the victim of a brutal beating and sets out to avenge the mistreatment and clean house starting with the Sheriff's office. Vaughn DOES walk tall with a big hunk of lumber and there is plenty of ass-whippings dealt out. Intense violence scoots by with a PG-13 rating.For someone with limited acting ability, The Rock is dynamic and dominating; possibly his best performance. Other cast members of note: Johnny Knoxville, Ashley Scott, Kristen Wilson and Michael Bowen. This action drama also packs a punch with a heavy soundtrack featuring: Gregg Allman, Dr. John, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ohio Players, Johnny Cash and Joe Cocker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking Tall, starring The Rock, is a very well-produced action movie. It basically has the same kind of plot as those old Chuck Norris movies, but here it is done very well. The characters and the action are extremely believable and convincing, whereas the isolated town where absolutely nobody (except one friend and one girl) dares to ally themselves with the new sheriff to get rid of the bad guys didn't ring true. He should have been able to get some new deputies, esp. seeing as a majority of the town actually voted for him to be sheriff. But, fortunately for the cowardly citizens, our pal The Rock was man enough to get the job done by himself! :-)Great action and an exciting story. As action movies go, this was a very cool one.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RE: Not bad, , what there was of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I as a rule like action type films, so thought this would probably be quite good, &amp; I wasn't disappointed. The Rock, though quite a poor actor, has got a pleasant personality &amp; I usually like him, &amp; in these sort of roles he is okay. The rest of the cast were alright, though nothing special, &amp; fitted in to what story there was. The main problem though was the storyline lacked any real depth, &amp; what there was of it seemed to end quite abruptly. It also didn't make much sense, in that the time period seemed to cover a few days when in reality it must have been months. The one thing that also struck me was why there was such a large law enforcement team, as there was clearly no crime, as the Rock cheerfully dismissed them all, &amp; no one ever visited or called him or the station.Overall it wasn't too bad, though if I had seen it at the cinema I would have felt robbed, as the film ends abruptly around the 70 min mark, with the titles then taking an incredible 15 minutes. No doubt to fill it out.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former Special Forces member Chris Vaughn (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) returns to his rural Washington State hometown to find the that town he left is overrun by drugs and violence ? and the frightened citizens can lay the blame at the feet of Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough.) Hamilton is the owner of a casino and also controls the police. After being nearly being killed when he nearly destroys the casino over a crooked craps game, Vaughn is put on trial. In his own defense, Vaughn claims he was justified and promises run for sheriff and clean up the town. The jury finds him not guilty and Vaughn wins the sheriff's election.But Jay Hamilton isn't ready to give in and targets Vaughn's family. Vaughn, with the aid of a convicted felon and a former girlfriend turned exotic dancer, wreaks havoc on the bad guys.Walking Tall is, at least in name only, a remake of the 1973 classic starring Joe Don Baker. That film dramatized the exploits of the late Sheriff Buford Pusser of McNairy County, Tennessee. Pusser's battles against corruption made him a legend. The battles were not without a price, however. Early on the day of August 12, 1967, Sheriff Pusser and his wife Pauline responded to a call. But it was an ambush. Pauline Pusser was killed and Buford was seriously injured. He ultimately underwent sixteen facial operations to correct his disfiguring injuries. To this day, no one has been charged in the incident. More details about Buford Pusser's life can be found at the outstanding memorial website created by his daughter, Dwana: sheriffbufordpusser.com.Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is a born entertainer, and "Walking Tall" contains his best acting to date. Although he could have fallen back on it, very little of Johnson's wrestling persona is evident in Chris Vaughn, which is a positive. Johnson's a little stiff in some of the dramatic scenes and the bad guys are clichéd. But this is primarily an action film and depth would probably get in the way of the story."Walking Tall" won't reinvent the action genre, but it's a very credible effort, and Dwayne Johnson does justice to Buford Pusser's ideals and memory.</fullReview>

I only went to see it because there was nothing else on, so when faced with desperation i ended up playing eeni meenie minee mo with 'Walking Tall' and 'Mean Girls' and this one won. After watching, it ended up being OK compared with my expectations. The Rock's third movie and you can already see that he is getting better at acting since those bloody mummy movies, and i don't mean that there was lots of gore. The movie got overall bad reviews from film magazines etc. But i think that they just wanted to hate it seeing it as the stereotype kind of movie that the rock would be cast in. The movie really wasn't that bad, the storyline was OK, possibly due to it being based on a true story, and the acting was quite good too, even Knoxville. Go and see, by some popcorn and have a good time, don't be too critical of film and you'll see it's not so bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want 86 minutes of violent, yet somehow wholesome footage of an angry man hitting people with a big piece of cedar, then this is the film for you. Take an old western blueprint then cross it with your standard '80s action flick, and you've about got 'Walking Tall', the story of one man and his goofy sidekick's mission to clean up their hometown by banishing drugs and gambling, and to restore good old fashioned values, like loving the family. The flick rests Sol on The Rock's ample shoulders, as he further proves to be the new king of action. The guy has a simple kind of charisma, which makes it a lot easier to like the protagonist, who could easily seem like a very boring psycho. There is certainly an element of propaganda here, with an underlying message that preaches to the kids that drugs are in fact bad, yet for all that the film is as subtle as a brick in the face, it's also pretty charming, and if you need an action fix it won't outstay it's welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off saying the original one was way better, longer, and stayed more to the truth then this newer version.But what made me enjoy this one is that it is having so much fun with itself even though it was short as hell.The Rock plays a war hero coming home.Only to discover his home ain't what it same any more.Drugs are being sold, police are corrupt, and all this is being run by an old friend(Neal McDonugh).So by winning the police election, he and he's best friend, played wonderfully by Johnny Knoxville of JACKASS fame, decide to clean up the streets. The movie has it 's moment, even dough the movie is only 73 mins long. But as i said the movie has fun with itself, especially the Johnny Knoxville role who with sences with The Rock highlighted the film. I guess there was a lot of editing left on the cutting room floor, but for what. Well any one who is a fan of The Rock or Johnny Knoxville will love this movie, many will hate it for it's shortness, and others will think it's a fun film even for it's shortness.</fullReview>

Jonny Knoxville provides much amusement as the hapless side kick although a little more development of his character wouldn't have gone a miss. The court room scene is very short almost painfully so but it does keep the pace up. I is what it says on the box I is not intellectual nor thought provoking but then thats not the point. It would have been nice if it was a little longer if only to enjoy the appearance of Ashley Scott a little further. I would definitely recommend as a rental.</fullReview>

But I'm thinking that a sequel could possibly come of this, or at least I am hoping their will be a sequel. The Rock had some very wonderful stunts and Johnny Knoxville is seemingly weak in the fact that he always gets hit in the nose and that always brings him down.

His homecoming party with his old friends, at the casino, goes awry. An argument with a cheating dealer turns into a brawl with casino security. The casino security acts very strange and unprofessional and Chris Vaughn get several knife cuts. The incident is reported to the police, which quickly close the investigation. Casino owner Jay Hamilton (McDonough) then tries to bribe Vaughn to forget the matter. So all is not right in his hometown, and when Vaughn finds out that the casino security sells drugs to local teenagers he takes it in his own hands and goes on a rampage through the casino. After being arrested and acquitted of all charges he runs for sheriff, an election which he wins. With a new badge, he fires all deputies, hires his old friend Templeton (Knoxville). Together, the two of them ignores all normal police work, and goes on a mission to clean up the criminals connected to the casino.Inspired by real events it says, but I think both Vaughn and the criminals act very dubiously. Vaughn repeatedly goes on a rampage instead of using more lawful methods like reporting to the police, or when their allegiance is doubtful, go to higher authorities. By the same means the criminals act so unprofessional and use so much excessive force (especially when the former sheriff participates in an attack upon the police station) that even if they succeed in removing Vaughn they are bound to attract attention from elsewhere, like the FBI. These things, however truthful to the real events they may be, gives the story an improbable air about it. However, the story is in the backseat with pure action/fights in front. Those are good, but become less exciting in the long run when they're not backed up by a good story. The cast is good, Knoxville much better than I expected, he is really good in his role. The Rock is good, does what is expected of him but not very much more. Then there are beautiful Deni played by Scott who unfortunately is not given a lot of time to establish her character more than Vaughn's love interest. All in all, an rather average movie, good fights but that's all there is. There is one riddle though, why does the Rock need a personal hair stylist?5/10</fullReview>

At least the film makers had the wisdom to not call the tall, well built, Hawaiian Rock - "Bufford". It's simple: if you want to relax and forget about the world and see a man beat the snot out of people with a stick, then this is a good movie. If you want to over analyze a "film" and be an uptight snob, then watch Fellini or Lynch. I'm not against cerebral films, but don't go into a movie called "Walking Tall" and expect to see something other than mindless action... or big sticks.</fullReview>

The newest "WT" has a surprisingly good story and character development (for an action movie). I appreciated the interraction between Chris (The Rock) and his father Chris Sr. The Rock does a good job acting but a much better job fighting. The violence in this movie is MUCH darker and real-looking than in any other movie starring The Rock. In fact, I believe this movie could have earned an "R" rating for the violence. That doesn't mean there isn't humor in "Walking Tall". Johnny Knoxville (of whom I am not a fan) did a good job as The Rock's comic sidekick/deputy. At only 85 minutes, "Walking Tall" is a fast, fierce and fun action film.</fullReview>

He was a sheriff, whose life(and death) was portrayed in three Walking Tall movies.The bad news is: this movie doesn't live up to the original. The good news? On its own merits, its a pretty good movie. The Rock stars as Chris Vaughn, an army veteran returning home to stay.He soon finds that things are very different at home.The local mill has been closed, and the owner has opened a casino.The local police are corrupt,and so is the casino. The Rock decides to take matters into his own hands, and in the course of time, becomes sheriff.Thing in the town deteriorate from here, as standard action movie fare ensues.The Rock stands alone against the bad guys,the sheriff's station is attached, and the Rock faces the lead bad guy alone. With suspension of reality(which is necessary in all these type of movies{I.e.why weren't the State Police called in}) ,this movie is excitingly brought to the conclusion. My final rating? A good solid B-. Worth renting, but I'm glad I didn't spend $8.00 at the theater.</fullReview>

At certain parts the story skips a couple of days, maybe even months. It is filled with losts of action, though sometime it grows violent and teeters on the edge of an R rating, but none-the-less this is a cool movie.The movie does tend to go overboard when Chris(The Rock) becomes sheriff, he begins to go on a crooked cop rampage. Firing all of the deputies and hiring his friends. It's not that I don't think it's cool, it's just a little unbelievable.The movie is enjoyable though.

		<fullReview>Not Bad! Not bad at all. (DVD Review/comments). While the movie it self is typical Action fare, the most enjoyable aspect of this film was seeing *THE Rock* and his progression as an actor.It is apparent to this viewer that *The Rock* has a long career ahead of him. J. Knoxville was a pleasant surprise. I fully expected this person to play the Village idiot to *The Rock*. His acting was a pleasant surprise.I expected nothing less than the stellar performance of Neal McDonough. He is one of the most underrated actors in Holly-weird, today!I was a little disappointed in the DVD collection of *Extra's* **SPOILERS FOLLOW**3 deleted scenes, and three bloopers? Where is *The Rock* and his surprise when he realized his was not supposed to smash the tail lights? Tha'ts a classic "Oops!" from the industry. I would love to have seen that on film.This film is worth a solid 3 out of 5 stars. Well worth the 15.00 dollars it will eventually sell for (Probably 9.99 at a Fry's near you and soon)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than what i heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the reviews for this movie on this sight and I was reluctant about watching it. Well I did, and it wasn't as bad as everyone claimed it was. It was actually very good. The actors knew how to act and the action wasn't that bad. The Rock and Johnny Knoxville were a pretty good team.This movie starts out with Chris Vaughn coming back to his home town after eight years in the army and finding out everything has changed. After his first day back, he realizes how much things have changed. SPOILERS AHEAD MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!After his fight at the casino, he is left for dead. After this event and the fact that his nephew almost OD'd on the drugs that the casino's security guards gave to him, he decides to run for sheriff.The part were The Rock and Johnny Knoxville tear apart the one guy's truck is hilarious. But the part were the Rock's truck and the police station is shot apart are a little far fetched. Especially when the old sheriff and his friends are shooting at them with machine guns is a bit much, but still, overall this movie was pretty good. It's definitely worth renting. I'd give it an eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS My first thought when reading the synopsis for this movie was that it sounded like a Jean-Claude Van Damme film without Van Damme, protect the downtrodden and fight the evil nemesis using whatever force necessary. Of course with The Rock there is a whole lot less kicking and much more punching and beating with wooden planks. I think it tried to have morals and the usual 'good triumphs over bad' theme however it was so clichéd and formulaic that I wonder if it really tried to be anything other than a vehicle for The Rock to exert his physical prowess. The basic idea is that Chris Vaughn (The Rock) returns home from a stint in the Army to find his beloved hometown overtaken by a big-shot millionaire casino owner (whom he went to school with) who has the local Sheriff's department in his pocket (hmmm how very Back to the Future 2). He decides to take matters into his own hands to end the corruption after a violent run in with 'the henchmen'. This is where it gets ridiculous, if it wasn't already, he somehow goes from being on trial for assault amongst other things to being elected Sheriff. Where he then proceeds to fight corruption with... corruption, intimidation and violence. There is the lovable sidekick (Johnny Knoxville), the love interest (Ashley Scott, as the stripper who's really just a very nice girl in a bad situation who sees the error of her ways) and the stereotypical bad guy (Neal McDonough). I never thought I'd say this but Johnny Knoxville actually made the movie a little easier to endure. Apart from that, the plot is weak with events contrived to lead to the gratuitous violence and the take home message from this movie, which is that its OK to kill people as long as they are the bad guys. Apparently its based on a true story, I shudder at the thought, hopefully a lot of artistic license was employed. Maybe if you can switch your brain off and/or are a big fan of The Rock you may enjoy this movie which is thankfully not long enough to be too painful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid. I can't really say much else.The Rock is pretty tough. I wonder when he'll change his name on the credits to his real name, rather than 'The Rock'. But he's better than Vin Diesel and better than Bruce Willis.The story is pretty great in this movie. Some guys get The Rock because he gets them first, and then he gets them back again. But minor details like that don't really matter when you're 'The Rock'. He literally carries a big piece of wood for a weapon through most of this movie and smashes some dudes up with it. It's pretty cool.Overall there are good fights and it's a great story of one man's fight against the crooked system. Three stars! (next time they should get more big guys for The Rock to fight against)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Short For Impact- May contain possible SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though there are no major twists reading this may come as a spoiler to some of you ! so you have been warned.To tell you the truth, I went to see this movie for "The Rock", if you too are going to see it for the "The Rock", then you will be satisfied.Having said that, one does wonder why the director was so in such a hurry to end the movie, it required a little more conflict with villains,drama (not action sequences, there are enough of those) but instead showing how the rock got elected to become the sheriff,some more character development on the father son relationship ,rock's stint as sheriff could have shown more bad guys going down, some moves and counter moves from the bad guys, Etc etc would have been nice, but as this is a simple action movie and no thriller or suspense, lets not expect a expert narration.The plot of the movie is simple, Rock is Ex-army and comes home to find corruption, drugs, prostitution etc. He decides that its enough and simply takes control himself, kicks ass and conquers evil that too in only 82 minutes.When the rock becomes the sheriff the movie does seem promising but the speed at which rock vanquishes all evil is simply amazing, and a little unbelievable, bringing us to the ending extremely fast.So overall if u liked the rock's previous movies then go and see this one also, Do not expect a James Cameron, John Woo action flick and you will come out a happy!! and walking tall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but way too short, lots of action tho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Walking Tall. I thought it was a good movie. It had lots of action, fighting, drama, and the Rock kicking serious ass. The plot was very similar but not exactly the same as the 1973 classic movie, which is fine. I didn't want it to be 100% exactly as before. The Rock returns to his hometown after 8 years in the army and finds his parents out of work, his father's mill has been closed up, and the town is now run by casino crooks, a dishonest police force, and drug dealers. He vows to clean up the town. The Rock can definitely play the part of an action star. My only beef was that the movie moved so fast, that it was over before I knew it. The movie was actually only 75 minutes long from start to finish (not including the ending credits). The plot was very realistic and believable, unlike many movies today that have such far fetched and unrealistic plots and story lines. This movie was definitely entertaining and I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies. I would never pay $ 10.00 to see any movie. But I give this movie an overall grade of A-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I'm from Europe but saw the movie in the states (at a $ theatre), I actually thought it was the earlier Rock movie The RunDown (aka Welcome to the Jungle). With no expectations of the movie, my first thought was that it was short. It is primarily an action movie with little or no time for any character development, but on the plus side the Rock proves that he has the acting ability to achieve some depth. The courtroom scene deserved more time, as it seemed hurried but was a pivotal moment. This movie tries to go beyond the action genre but falls short. In conclusion it wasn't the worst movie I've seen (Tango &amp; Cash) and shows that as an actor, the Rock has potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-Packed Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the original Walking Tall (1973, I believe) and it is different from this new version. But, the original was incredibly drawn out for 2 hours and very slow. The basic points of the original are here in this remake, but the action is revved up.The movie is short with less dialogue, but it is also an action movie. No Oscar hopefuls in this movie, just good, clean ass-whipping that only The Rock can deliver. As he takes on the casino, you can sense his frustrations and put yourself in his shoes. The way he fights his enemies are the way that you or I would want to. Not many action films do that nowadays.Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has taken a lot of flack for his acting, which I think is a shame. Every review you hear, there's always a 'WWE' reference. I don't believe that when Arnold Schwarzenegger started acting, his reviews always included how his movies were like bodybuilding or was similar to Mr. Olympia. There's a stigma attached to The Rock that's really unfair. Especially since he's already a better actor than Arnold ever was, and he's still improving. He's also a more versatile actor as well. Arnold was always the same character.Also, it seems as though people are upset that a Samoan/African American man is playing that part of a Caucasian and changing his name from Buford Pusser to Chris Vaughn. Honestly, who can see The Rock with the name Buford? Really?In short, the movie is similar to the original, just more action packed. Compare this to the original Walking Tall, and you'll see which one captures your interest more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie That Pretends to Be Nothing It Isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is a movie star. After The Rundown and now Walking Tall, no one can argue that he can carry a movie and provide it with heart, action, and humor. In Walking Tall, he plays Chris Vaughn, a Special Forces soldier who returns to his home town to find an old friend has closed all businesses and opened up smut stores and a crooked casino in its place. The Rock spends the next 80+ minutes kicking and carrying a big stick.Much has been made about how short the movie is and they are right. This movie needed another twenty minutes to add more depth and more character development, but what you get in return is an action movie for action fans. If what you want is a brisk, funny action film, Walking Tall is a movie you have to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking Tall is a well made action movie, and the audience has to understand that that is what it is. It's certainly no Academy Award Winner, but it does provide some slick dialogue, great action sequences and it is well cast.The Rock does a decent job in this film. Granted he doesn't have more than three facial expressions, but he has the character of Chris Vaughn down. He also has great chemistry with Johnny Knoxville, who provided the comic relief. There are some really funny lines (and actions) that are great because they aren't over doing it. Sometimes lines are written just to get laughs, but the dialogue here is realistic and genuinely funny because it's something the character would actually say.Don't forget the fight sequences.....there were some hardcore fights, that made the movie really fun to watch.All in all, this is a great movie to see if you're looking for a good time.....or if you just want to see The Rock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Walking Tall and found it predictable but enjoyable. I went in not expecting to have my consciousness expanded, I mean the movie stars a Dwayne Johnson and Johnny Knoxville. There was the bad guy, his dumb muscle, the hero, his sidekick, and a lot of kicking butt.I saw things which were not too believable, but I learned long ago to ignore certain things and just enjoy the movie.Fifteen years from now if THE ROCK is doing excellent drama with subtle nuances in his characters I think everyone will be a bit surprised. This is definitely not that. Dwayne Johnson turns in the performance you expect, the film moves as you expect, and just as you expect the highlights are when things get smashed, broken, cut up, or shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Walking Tall" is "inspired by a true story" which means the names and places have been changed compared to the more closely biographical 1973 film of the same name about a Tennessee sheriff, Bueford Pusser, who used his own form of justice carrying a "big stick" to clean up the polictical corruption that ran rampant in his county. The hero has become Chris Vaughan, returning to his hometown in the Pacific Northwest after a 2 year duty with the military to go to work in the mill only to find the mill closed down and the town in economic ruin centering around a strip club/casino complex and adult bookstores. When Chris Vaughan (Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock)notices cheating at the casino and his young nephew overdoses on crystal meth supplied by the casino's thugs, and is himself left for dead, takes matters into his own hands by inspiring the downtrodden citizens and becoming a no nonsense Sheriff who wants to clean up the town and restore it to its former glory. "Walking Tall" has been stripped down to a more simplistic, formulaic, crowd pleasing film. What saves the movie is The Rock himself, he has great screen prescence and there is a down to Earth quality to him. The scenes with his friend and sidekick played by Johnny Knoxville seem very natural and not forced nor contrived. The Rock even showed respect to the family of Bueford Pusser by having a screening of the film in Tennesee and visiting the Bueford Pusser museum. "Walking Tall" was entertaining and the Rock and Johnny Knoxville were likeable enough. Unfortunately, it is still a by the numbers action flick but the one good thing about it is that it leaves one looking forward to the Rock's next film which will hopefully be a breakthrough showcase for his underestimated acting talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that this was exactly the kind of movie The Rock needed to do. As noted by other critics, this up-and-coming blockbuster actor actually has acting ability, which he demonstrated in The Rundown. Now, in Walking Tall, The Rock demonstrated his ability to play a more traditional "action movie" role where there are very few lines, lots of fighting and a more predictable story line.Falling right into the "guy movie" category, Walking Tall is exactly the kind of movie a guy loves to watch. Bad guys p*** off the star who spends the rest of the movie getting his revenge topped off with a climactic battle with the "Big Boss" at the end. Although we already know how this remake ends, guys still love that story line.As long as you don't try to make this movie something it isn't you will enjoy the experience. I would hope, and expect, to see more of The Rock in future blockbuster movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Walking Tall and thought it was worth the money paid for it. The Rock was flawless in his performance as was Johnny Knoxville. There are a few things which stand out as not quite right. The biggest being the locale of the movie, Kitsap County, Washington. They should have used a bogus name, or, something a little more unknown than one of the largest counties in Washington since the place protrayed is an out of the way rural community, not a county of half a million people. (I live near Kitsap County) Over all it's a good movie and I recommend it to people who want a good action movie with some righteousness in it.</fullReview>

The Rock surprises me everytime I see him. I loved him as a wrestler, now I'm loving him as an actor. And God forgive, but I even enjoyed Johnny Knoxville. The movie had comedy and drama. The story line deals with today's problems, just like the original dealt with problems during that time period. The fight scenes were so strong, you could almost feel the pain. The language is a bit strong, but after a while, you don't even notice because you are too wrapped up in the story. I will definitely purchase this one when it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i went to this movie i checked out what other people commented on it. I saw nothing but good things about so i decided that this was a good idea. So I went and I saw nothing but non stop action and great acting from The Rock as well as from his co stars. His co star, Johnny Knoxville, is amazingly funny that brought a lot of laughs in the theatre. This movie is definitely a must see film that will leave people leaving wanting more. There is one action scene that will leave people in awe because it is pretty graphic with what The Rock does with just a piece of wood. Ashley Scott is unbelievable hot in this movie(definitely looks better with long blonde hair). She also has been in S.W.A.T. and the tv series "Birds of Prey." So, i give this movie an 8 out of 10 and I think everybody should see this movie at least once, cause if you like The Rundown, then you'll love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, this is not Triple X or some bad Arnold movie, Walking tall is a good movie...I can't believe I am saying this, but it is...the Rock gives a surprisingly convincing performance, he generates and reflects emotion on a much broader spectrum then Arnold or Stallone ever could...he also is more charismatic, especially in the real world and it translates to the big screen. Aside from my impressions of his performance, I thought the story, though predictable based on the genre and clear cut revenge theme that the movie builds from the opening scene, was enjoyable, I found myself as the film intended pulling for the Rock's character and disliking the antagonists...the action is excellent, very good hand to hand combat scenes and the rock is very believable in this realm of course based on his performance in the WWE and or WWF...Also Johnny Knoxville adds some levity without being the distraction most would assume he'd be in a motion picture. He is as pleasant to watch in film as his stunts on jackass and unpleasent...and both to the right audience are equally entertaining. I was thoroughly impressed with this movie and while it's no epic, in it's world , stacked against it's competition this films stacks up and lives up to it's title walking very tall.While I know nothing I recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed:ConAir, The Last Castle, Under Siege</fullReview>

All I knew about the plot was some guy is away from home for a large amount of time and comes back to see the town has gone down the drain. So he goes around and beats people/casinos up to fix it. Sounds great!Actually, the Rock (Chris Vaughn) is not that bad of an actor. He's better than Schwarzenneger will ever be. Johnny Knoxville (Ray) gave the movie some comic relief and was my favorite character in the movie. The casino guy looked like a nazi or something.The language wasn't too bad. WT had it's share of swearing (including a PG-13 token f-word) but it wasn't constant swearing. There was a few scenes with casino dancers and one of those dancers had a intimate moment with Chris Vaughn. The violence includes a lot of shooting, 2x4 smashing, and stabbings in the chest.

		<fullReview>Greetings, The Rock returns in his third feature film (not counting mummy 2) as Chris Vaughn, the only man able to turn his hometown around after it is corrupted by a local casino. The Rock was the most electrifying man in sports entertainment but he doesn't shine as bright as he did in the Rundown. I believe he is the next Ah-nold and is just waiting for his Terminator to come along. My favorite performance comes from Johnny Knoxville who plays Chris' best buddy. He's funny, not annoying and he's not a bad actor at all. The story is a little thinner than it could have been but I don't think they were trying to make an epic. It isn't the Rock's best but it is fun and shows you that the Rock is action's future. I have heard good stuff and bad stuff about the newest 'Rock-show'. I actually liked this movie. I would let a 12-13 year old see it even though it has some drug-related material, fighting, profanity (1 "F" word) and some sensuality. If you like the Rock and liked the Rundown you will probably like this film. Buford Pusser is cool! Regards, Matt</fullReview>

When he discovers that people are getting wripped off. He gets in a fight and is badly beat up in the end. That's just twenty minutes of the movie and the first of four phases. The Rock is surprisingly believable unlike he was in The Rundown. Johnny Knoxville is good as his loyal best friend. There is some action, but not enough because of the short length of 80 minutes. Still is is watchable if you have nothing to do on a Saturday and want to see an action movie. If not then this isn't the movie for you at all. B -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen the other 'Walking Tall' movies, so I did not have to sit through the movie and compare it to anything. I have only heard a few things about them. 'The Rock' does a good job of acting in this movie. I have not seen his other movies, so I cannot compare his acting skills either.The movie was genuine in its story line. A man returns home to his small town and does not like the path taken by the changes. Stripping, gambling, drugs, police corruption and the like were not apart of the town that he left behind prior to joining the army. He feels that there is no place for these things now, so he decides to stand up and do something about correcting these wrongs.This movie is free of the whole 'blood and guts' theme that many movies are offering up to us these days. I am not into the gore thing so this was definitely a breeze for me to sit through. There is a small amount of humor present and a 'man on a mission' mentality.I believe that this movie is well worth watching. I really enjoyed it, as did my husband. My only complaint is that I was not ready for the movie to end when it did, it left me wanting to know/see more.</fullReview>

It's very believable and it a well thought out film. The action is intense but not over the top. I've become so sick and tired of wire-work fight scenes that when a movie like this chooses to use raw, real action instead of wires, I applaud.

		<fullReview>When The Rock announced he was heading to acting I was one out of hundred people that shook their head and went "arhg why?, how many of these guys do we have to continue to bare and watch on the big screen?" but I have been actually very surprised by The Rock's acting abilities and even though I kind of gringe and hate to say it, I've become a fan. Unlike most muscle bound actors especially one who came from TV wrestling his acting is not the best I've seen but it's pretty descent. The Scorpion King sucked as a movie but his acting was alright, The Rundown was awesome! the blend of action/comedy/drama was blended well together and I enjoyed it, I'm personally very glade he stopped his trademark eyebrow thing he was known for. When I first saw the laughable trailers for Walking Tall I was just that, laughing through it, very cheesy, it was a seen it, done it kind of thing. I remember seeing the '73 original with Joe Don Baker and unlike the original this remake had absolutely no real plot, and at only 83-85mins. how can it? is an 1hr and 20min. even considered a movie? the original ran about 2hrs+ which told a more in depth story about this small town and Buford Pusser who after becoming police chief removes the corruption in his town in Tennessee. In this so called "Inspired by true events" version this film takes place in Washington and characters and events have been added and removed, they should have added in the opening title card "based LOOSELY on true events" I was stunned when I saw it took 3 screen writers to write this film? anyone with a elementary based education could have written this, there was nothing there! no real plot, absolutely no character development, you feel nothing for these people, it was like you paid 8-10 bucks to sit down in front of a big screen for an hour and watch Cops or any other so called program on Fox. This film was just done very poorly and with all these remakes that have and are coming out with allot more plot and detail, I was very disappointed that the producers did not take the time to check into who these people where, what the town was like before and after Buford Pusser left and returned home, just the fact as I said before they changed the location from Leapwood, Tennessee to a small town in Washington should tell you something. Even the bad guy was shot in the head by Buford in the true story and this never happens in the new version. It was just a ripped and snipped version of what happened I guess, which is totally disappointing and a rip-off to those who know the story and spent money to see this re-telling. I heard comments about relating this to bad films such as Gigli, now see there is a difference between a film like that and a film like this, first Gigli was just a very none stop annoying flat out painfully awful film, it was just bad, based on ridiculously written fictional characters and subplots (if any) that ran way over it's 2hr. running limit and was dead the minuet the first title faded on the screen. Walking Tall on the other hand is a film that had allot of potential, these where true people in a true town with a true story to tell about this man who was brave and strong enough to WALK TALL and run against the corrupt legal system there and of course the whorehouse/casino friend/owner with a big stick. If you go not knowing this was based on a true story, then it's just a fun ride on a Saturday night with friends or a date, (which she will like because "OMG HE HAS HIS SHIRT OFF!") Walking Tall is watchable and a tolerable movie. Knowing the story etc. it was a rip-off. As for The Rock's acting it was descent, not as well done as in The Rundown but I enjoyed his acting, he carries a sense of emotion, smarts and sincerity to his characters, you can tell he puts time and effort into his acting. I do think again if they would have spent more time and detail with the story, plot and character development then it would have reflected on his acting and don't give the excuse that the young people of today don't have enough patience for a longer movie, I think we all saw that LOTR epic proved that wrong. Hopefully The Rock's next adventure in acting and movie will be more enjoyable and impressive and maybe when Walking Tall is released on DVD the producers will see fit to include a directors cut or some extra scenes to high lite more of the story and people involved. ** 1/2 out of 5 (for movie) *** (for The Rock's acting)</fullReview>

Best scene : Rock's testimony in court. Oh yeah, Johnny Knoxville provides some solid laughs. Given that I was around to see the 1973 version of the story ( a solid picture starring Joe Don Baker ), and Walking Tall Pt 2 from 1975 (another good one starring Bo Svenson) *** I never saw Pt 3 - the final chapter *** 2004's version stacks up well, but is only remotely connected. The only links are : the big 2x4 whacking stick, and a credit dedication to the late Sheriff Pusser. Thanks for reading. Bye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'm no fan of WWE or Jackass. So I went into this movie expecting the worst. I came out of it wondering why they didn't do more with it. Dwayne Johnson and Johnny Knoxville are both AVERAGE actors at best. But here they work well together with a script that was kinda thin. The fight scenes were well done but too short. Not enough background on many of the story lines (the rivalry between Chris Vaughn and the casino owner, etc.) There were some genuine laughs, a few funny moments. If the writers had spent a little more time on the story, this might have been a very good movie. While this is not a total waste of time, there is NO COMPARISON to the original masterpiece. If you want to see some true ass-kicking, rent or buy the original. Grade B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie being the rocks third big movie has some very strong violence. This movie was supposed to be told off of a true story but the obvious elements in a true story are not apparent in this movie as other true stories.Standing Tall is about the Rock, playing Chris Vaughn, an ex army special forces commando who comes home to his Kitsap County home many years after he left only to find that the entire town is not what it was when he left. Upon arrival he is assaulted in a more or less one sided fight in the town's casino owned by an old friend Jay Hamilton. After recovery the town's cops do nothing to the men who assaulted Chris and after his nephew almost overdoses on drugs he goes to the casino and with his trusty 4x4 piece of wood, smashes up both the security guards and the machines in the casino.The Rock has to go to trial and after words states he will run for the town sheriff and ends of winning. Here he brings in his friend Johnny Knoxville formally from Jackass as his deputy. Together they try to make the town the town that it once was, usually by abusing their power and intimidated their opposition.Once Chris gets too close, Jay Hamilton tries to have his goons shoot and kill both Chris and his family. With three guys and three M-60 machine guns and the occasional assortment of shotguns there ends up being a lot of stuff blowing apart; The perfect ingredient for a guy movie.I found this movie to be quite entertaining but I found that one subplot in specific about Chris's former love reuniting was not fully explained and made for an incomplete movie.I was also disappointed at the length of this movie being just over an hour; it seemed to me to be way too short to effectively demonstrate what I felt the director wanted to say.This also seems to be one of the Rocks better movies. It allowed him to show more of a serious side, having to deal with drugs and prostitution in a once clean and peaceful town. Differing from his previous movies such a the Mummy Returns, The Rock's role is much larger and could be stepping stone he needs to come to much better played out movies and fulfilling the vacancy that Arnold left.Although Standing Tall could have been better told, especially considering how short the film was. I felt that this movie is almost perfect for any guy who wishes to see some stuff blow up revenge taken on behalf of the good guy and a rising star get some more attention.</fullReview>

I was pleasantly surprised to see two beautiful actress' that I hadn't expected, Ashley Scott from "Birds of Prey" and Kristen Wilson from "Dungeons &amp; Dragons". The action was great and well choreographed and the use of a 4x4 to further show that "The Rock" is bigger than life was a great touch. The story was known and good, if the director had spent more time developing characters it could have been a much better movie. It is worth watching just to see "The Rock" develop as an actor.

		<fullReview>Just when you thought Arnold Schwartzenegger-style action adventure movies were dead, here comes The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) in "Walking Tall". Less comedic than "The Rundown" but more intense and action-packed, "Walking Tall" is pure, popcorn-chomping fun.In "Walking Tall", Chris Vaughn (The Rock), a former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier, returns to his small hometown in rural Washington State to take a job at the local lumber mill. Once there, he finds that drugs, crime, and corruption have consumed his hometown. At the root of the town's problems lies Vaughn's former childhood friend, Jay Hamilton Jr. (Neal McDonough) who owns the new casino.Of course, Vaughn gets pushed too far and wants his old hometown back. This sets him on a collision course (pun fully intended...) with Hamilton, which includes bone-crunching fistfights, massive fireballs, much gunfire, wanton destruction, and perilously thin plotting.But hey, you don't go see movies starring The Rock for Shakespearean acting or Hitchcock-style plotting. I had a great time with this movie and highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit right away that I am not a fan of wrestling, I find it hokey and an out and out waste of time. I am however a fan of The Rock as a rising action star. "Walking Tall" is a beautiful follow up for him after "The Rundown". I won't give you a plot summary of the movie because you can read anybody else's, but I will give you my educated opinion of it. If you are expecting to see an Oscar worthy picture than you will be disappointed. However, if you are going in expecting to see some off beat humor and some well manufactured, good old American violence, than you will enjoy the movie thoroughly. In all honestly Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, has a lot of acting talent and Johnny Knoxville (MTV's Jackass, Men In Black II) adds a certain amount of comedy hijnks to the mix. It is worth seeing at least once and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just caught the film at a college press screening, and if you enjoyed The Rundown, Walking Tall is another positive step in Dwayne Johnson's path to superstardom.The Rock's handlers are still being ultra-conservative, assigning him to scripts that are light on acting and heavy on butt-kicking. At least this time around, The Rock is allowed to flex his acting prowess in addition to his already formidable upper body.No, this film won't blow your mind, but it's a nice resume filler for a man who seems destined to become the next great American action hero. At a breezy 75 minutes, its the perfect date film for teenage kids.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie follows a former U.S army special forces member Chris Vaughn (the Rock) and his return to his rural hometown. He comes back to find the town overrun with corrupt cops and thugs, including an old friend, Jay Hamilton, played by Neal McDonough. Chris, feeling the need to walk tall, begins to take things into his own hands.The acting in this movie was pretty solid. The Rock easily delivered his best performance to date, although not oscar-calibur.I just have to say thanks to the Rock. Just when we needed a great action movie, he delivers. There have been loads of senseless and crappy action movies out lately. (Ecks vs Sever, Paycheck) I almost thought that we would never see a good action movie again. I guess all we needed was some new blood, someone else to carry on the torch. The Rock is definitely that man.This movie does have a somewhat intriging story. And the action was very well done. As you may already know, the Rock's character prefers to take care of business with his 2x4. Its nice to see something besides senseless explosions and pointless gunviolence.(Though both do occur in the movie.)Overall, this was a great movie. Though not EVERYONE will like it, anyone who has a craving for a fresh new action movie should check this movie out.</fullReview>

The movie could really have used more plot, dialogue and character development. Considering these shortfalls, you're thinking negative review.... WRONG! Walking Tall was a great action flick! It had you cheering for the good guys and booing for the bad. It is not just an action movie; however, it has a great comedic element as well. At the end, I was staring at my watch... 'What? Noooo there should be more!' Like I said, despite feeling that the movie was lacking some depth, it was still a lot of fun to watch. This one is definitely a must-rent. Or on the other hand, it might be a must-see if you want to see a 20-foot-tall Rock kicking ass! PS. The Rock was there at the premiere!!! Okay for only 15-20 minutes, but still.

The cinematographer and editor do a barely acceptable job with the shots, sometimes panning so fast that the scene blurs, or using shots that make no sense and limit visibility. The writing's done well, with a good mixture of humor and comedy, though far off from the story that it's based on. Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson and Johnny Knoxville make a good team, with Knoxville playing funny man to Johnson's ever-serious ex-special forces toughman.

		<fullReview>I made the mistake of taking my action-fan son to a preview of this film, expecting something along the lines of the Rock's last film, "The Rundown." I was horrified to encounter extremely explicit scenes involving exotic dancers, and very sick, scarring violence. Naturally, in a film starring The Rock, people aren't going to sit around drinking tea -- that's a given. But in previous films the violence was limited, and in better balance with other elements of the film. This film, which is extremely short, by the way (around an hour and fifteen minutes!), was long on shock (sex and violence) and short on story, character development and logic. The Rock is a very watchable screen presence and deserves better than this flawed vehicle. If you decide to go, however, DO NOT BRING THE KIDS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a sneak preview of this last night...To be brief: not the disaster one might expect (assuming one is turning up ones nose at the notion of The Rock playing this role). The Rock is obviously making a serious effort to escape the ghetto of "wrestlers who act". He doesn't show any extreme depth here, but it is played pretty straight. The supporting cast is better than I had expected as well, with a moment or two of seemingly genuine family emotion. The most impressive part of the film (aside from Mr. Johnson's physique) is Johnny Knoxville's performance, full of hilarious moments. The MAJOR fault of the movie is it's brevity: it runs under an hour and a half! More specifically, it feels too short for the "progress" in the plot. Many events take place off screen that feel as if they would've been pertinent to the story. The fight scenes are quite long and frequent in comparison with the amount of time allotted to the moments in between the brawling. Which seems like a bit of a cheat. It suggests The Rock isn't ready for real acting or the filmmakers didn't think so. It would have been nice to see the whole story and find out. I hope by the time it is actually released they flesh it out a bit, because it had potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOT: A soldier returning home is shocked to find his hometown corrupt due to the new casino that has moved in. It has been not only rigging games and taking money from the townsfolk, but also a secret racket for selling drugs on the streets. When the police refuse to help him, he takes the law into his own hands and soon becomes sheriff with the sole purpose of taking back his town.MY THOUGHTS: Honestly, The Rock is a very good actor. It is difficult to find not only someone who is big, but also has acting chops as well. This movie is one of my favorites to star Dwayne Johnston. It is a very good story. The story of one man standing up against many for the greater good has been done many times, but this one is told a little different. At first, nothing is wrong, but eventually, the main character realizes the issues with what the town has become and he gets involved himself not caring who will try to stop him or what they may use in order to do so. What is depicted in this movie is really how this world works, it's hard to believe, but it is true. Watching someone stand up to it (though in a movie) makes you want to "walk tall" too. It sends a good message.PROS/CONS: This movie is pretty good. I mean, it is a WWE studios film, which at the time, they were just starting to really push themselves with what they could do and it shows. This movie is very well thought out and also very well done. The only nitpick I have to say personally, is the fact that Johnny Knoxville is in it. He is not a good actor. He was a bad choice for this movie and you can tell he is the weakest link in this picture. All in all though, the performance is passable.OVERALL: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Vaughn, a former soldier, returns to his small home town in Washington State. Like a number of films ostensibly set in the Pacific North-West, this one was actually filmed, for financial reasons, in British Columbia. Like the original "Walking Tall" from 1973, which I have never seen, it is based on real events which took place in Tennessee in the 1960s, but the producers were obviously unable to find anywhere in Canada which resembles the Deep South.Upon his return, Vaughn finds that his home town has changed. And not for the better. In his youth the main employer was a timber mill, but this has closed and been replaced as the town's main source of income by a new casino. This establishment is owned by Vaughn's old school friend, Jay Hamilton, but Vaughn finds that Hamilton's character has also changed for the worse. The casino is not only crooked (the craps dealers use loaded dice) but also a front for drug dealing. When Vaughn discovers that a casino security guard has been selling drugs to teenagers, he decides to clean the town up, an operation which involves smashing up the casino and beating up the guards. Vaughn is placed on trial, but manages to secure his acquittal, following which he successfully runs for sheriff, defeating the incumbent who is a Hamilton stooge.Some "tough guy" cop films, the original "Dirty Harry" being a case in point, manage to take an intelligent look at the politics of law enforcement and ask some pertinent questions. "Walking Tall" is not a film of this type; Vaughn is reminiscent less of Harry Callaghan than of John Rambo, with the local hoodlums of Washington State standing in for the Vietnamese or Russian Commies. Dwayne Johnson, in any case, is not an actor likely to be cast in any film which has ambitions to ask pertinent questions. Johnson is, of course, the artist formerly known as "The Rock", a pseudonym well-suited to his emotionless, stony-faced style of acting, although a real rock might just manage to seem slightly more animated. Johnny Knoxville, who plays Vaughn's sidekick, is best known for starring in the manic TV show "Jackass", and his performance here shows him to be a prime example of the jackass school of acting.Hollywood in the twenty-first century is generally noted for its liberal politics, but just occasionally it can come up with films so reactionary that they make "Triumph of the Will" look left-wing. The 2004 version of "Walking Tall" is a case in point. Even after his election as Sheriff, Vaughn's preferred method of law enforcement is to lay into anyone of whose morals or lifestyle he disapproves. His philosophy seems to be that most of life's problems can be sorted out with judicious use of the fists, and if that does not work there is always the club or the gun. Despite his arrant thuggery, he is nevertheless presented as the upright hero, and his actions as being necessary in the cause of restoring peace and tranquility to Kitsap County, Washington. From this I think we can safely deduce that the scriptwriter was not a fully paid-up member of the ACLU. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is nothing but a poor remake of the original with Joe Don Baker in the role of Buford Pusser, which was based on the real life of the Tennessee Sheriff.Setting this version in Kitsap County, Washington doesn't even come close to portraying it as it really is because the real Kitsap County's economy is dominated by by the heavy presence of the U.S. Navy (Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, the county seat, and the Trident submarine base at Bangor, just north of Silverdale and west of Poulsbo. The scenario of this movie, set in this location lacks any credibility whatsoever.The only real casino in Kitsap County is run by the Suquamish Indian Tribe on tribal land near the west end of the Agate Pass Bridge, where state highway 305 connects Bainbridge Island with the Kitsap Pennisula.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me a rather long time to get hold of this movie.I haven't seen the original from the '70s, but was quite taken with Walking Tall 2: The Payback and Walking Tall 3: Lone Justice; and as many comments suggested that Walking Tall 1 was the one with Dwayne Johnson - and much, much better - I thought I might give it a try and...Ouch! Let me be quite clear: I have absolutely nothing against violent movies, I don't mind repetitive plots provided they're well told, I am quite comfortable with actors not trained by the Royal Shakespeare Company and I don't expect everyone operating on limited budgets to deliver camera work worthy of an Oscar.There is however always a but...Maybe I start with the good: Dwayne Johnson is better than in Scorpion King. Meaning that he now displays four instead of three expressions (although the trial-scenes are still something he clearly can't pull off), is a tad less late with his replies (it's always tedious to see someone deliver a supposedly spontaneous one-liner by literally moving his head first into the phrase he is supposed to say, thereby obviously anticipating). And up until the end - that is before he has to enter hand-to-hand combat with the sheriff - his opponent is quite believable.And then there is the rest: a director who can't direct, but desperately wants to pretend he can (and not just direct, but direct in an artistic manner - there is hardly a more painful experiment to watch than an action movie displaying Goddard ambitions, and the scene with "The Rock" filmed from below, so that his frame walks as tall as the trees... give me a break! Just how tacky can something get?), making a cast who can't act, but - if at all - at best deliver replies on not always very timely cues stumbling through a script, that doesn't consist of much more but loosely applied one-liners, all of this in a setting that begins to bore one to death. (Honestly, people, I know Canada is cheap to film in and the Vancouver-area lovely, but I've seen these mountains now in X-Files, Stargate, Stargate Atlantis, Andromeda, Battlestar Galactica, Deadly Pursuit, etc. And as lovely as it all looks, there must be other mountains out there, too.) And all of it peppered by over-stunt, cartoon-like fights.And yes, the famous budget about 30 times larger than the one for the sequels... Where did all the money go? I suppose it was spent on advertising this product, for it sure as hell isn't to be seen in any effort that might have ended up on-screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Walking Tall" resembles a half-baked "A-Team" episode!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Late Tennessee lawman Buford Pusser led a life far more complicated and compelling than what "All About The Benjamins" director Kevin Bray depicts in his new movie "Walking Tall," a big, brawny, brainless, baloney of a biography, starring the Rock (a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson) and Johnny Knoxville of "Jackass: The Movie" infamy. Neither as good as "The Rundown" nor as campy as "The Scorpion King," this loosely-based remake of the 1973 Joe Don Baker hixploitation crime-corruption thriller stumbles somewhere between the Rock and a Jackass. Of course, the Rock delivers another of his hugely charismatic, crowd-pleasing performances, alternating between his mega wattage smile and his beetle-browed snarl. Similarly, prankster Johnny Knoxville enjoys himself shamelessly as the comic relief, a reformed druggie named Ray who becomes the Rock's one and only deputy. Check out the way Knoxville's deputy gleefully destroys a shiny new truck in search of narcotics. When you aren't rooting for the Rock to smack down the villain, you're hooting and hollering at Knoxville's pranks. Meanwhile, an array of villainous thugs headed up by "Timeline's" Neal McDonough oppose our heroes with their own brand of sleazy, lowdown shenanigans. Unfortunately, these guys pose even less a threat to our heroes than this movie poses to our sensibilities. Nowhere near as grim, graphic, or morally conscientious as the original, this "Walking Tall" remake comes up light, not only in the plot department but also where the villains are concerned. In the original, the Joe Don Baker hero lost his wife in an ambush and got badly shot up himself. In the remake, the Rock does some time in the hospital and the remainder on his daddy's couch. Nobody blasts his jaw off with a rifle like they did in the original. No, he doesn't have a wife, so there is that much less carnage. This "Walking Tall" resembles a half-baked "A-Team" episode rather than a celebration of an individual's battle against real-life corruption. Arguably, this "Walking Tall" remake opens more like the Sylvester Stallone movie "First Blood" as the Rock returns to his hometown after an eight year hitch in the military (he fought in Iraq) than as a wrestler in the original." Mind you, if you've never laid eyes on the Phil Karlson classic with burly Joe Don Baker in the biggest role of his short-lived leading man career, you have no idea how poles apart these two rural law &amp; order sagas remain.The major problem with "Walking Tall" is the shortage of narrative in a lackluster screenplay credited to four scribes: David Klass of "Desperate Measures", Channing Gibson of "Cradle 2 the Grave," and David Levien &amp; Brian Koppelman of "Knockaround Guys." (Perhaps they will replace the deleted scenes that might have made this an R-rated epic on the DVD.) The two biggest changes are the locale shift from the deep South: Tennessee, to the great Pacific Northwest: Washington State, and the Rock uses a different moniker: Chris Vaughn instead of Buford Pusser. The Rock said in a Parade magazine article that he looked more believable as a Chris Vaughan rather than a Buford Pusser. Earlier, a lumber mill had served as the industrial hub of town, but it got shut down, and a casino replaced it as the town's biggest moneymaker. After the Rock goes home to meet mom and dad, he learns his former high school adversary Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough of "Minority Report") runs the casino while his low-life louts deal drugs on the sly. This revelation hits home the hard way when Chris' young nephew Pete (Khleo Thomas of "Friday After Next") buys some bad crystal meth. Hamilton stocks his casino with strippers, too, but no mention is ever made of prositution. Keep in mind, "Walking Tall" received a PG-13 rating, and some evil things don't exist in PG-13 movies. Anyhow, our big, muscle-bound hero gets into trouble early when Jay invites his friends and him over to the casino for free drinks. Chris discovers to his shock that the casino gives its customers loaded dice so they can lose, lose, lose. This precipitates a wholly improbable fight where the thugs gang up on Chris, carve him up with a box-cutter, and leave him for dead on the highway on a dark, rainy night. Later, after the trial, Jay apologizes for his henchmen and tries to bribe the new sheriff. Naturally, Chris turns him down, then single-handedly tries to destroy Jay's casino. Jay retaliates and dispatches a hit squad out to wipe out Chris' family, but deputy Ray (Johnny Knoxville) wards them off. Meanwhile, the rest of the antagonists set out to spring one of their own from Chris' jail. Chris and Ray have struggled without success to locate the whereabouts of Jay's drug lab. A well-armed army of villains shoot up the jail the same way the Las Vegas cops shot up a house to shreds in the Clint Eastwood thriller "The Gauntlet." When Chris isn't busting the heads of Jay's men, he takes a tumble with his former high school sweetheart Deni. Actually, this "Walking Tall" remake has more in common with Bruce Lee's "Fists of Fury." The best thing about helmer Kevin Bray's direction is "Walking Tall" clocks in at 86 breezy minutes, so expect a bunch of previews. Plot complications rarely enter the picture. Deni and Chris have a roll in the hay, but they aren't together long enough for her to win a bull's eye t-shirt. Further, Bray has eliminated those ever predictable scenes that usually flesh out conventional crime thrillers. For example, after our hero displays his horribly scarred chest to the jury and proclaims his intentions of campaigning for sheriff, Bray cuts to the Rock applying law enforcement decals to his truck. Indeed, that's a neat way to hurtle those obligatory scenes that slow down the narrative. Like the sprawling scenery, the fights are just as rugged and entertaining, but the bad guys just aren't bad enough to awe either us or the Rock.</fullReview>

Likewise, those tuning in for the comedy stylings of Johnny Knoxville will find what they're looking for.No elaborate plot set-up needed here. Wind them up and let them go. Great action sequences.

		<fullReview>The original Walking Tall was a childhood favorite of mine. The Rock makes a nice substitute in this movie that has lots of action and fighting as expected. Vaughn (Rock) comes back from the military and finds his old town taken over by the rich kid who closed down the mill in favor of gambling, porn, and drugs. He tries to intervene when his young nephew is almost killed by drugs and is beaten back and arrested. Watch the movie to find out how he wins his trial and what he does afterward to bring the town back from the dark side. Acting wasn't as crisp as it could have been, but it wasn't the worst either. A strong cast helped all the way around. Good camera work, a little tight in during the fights indicating they had some trouble with choreography.</fullReview>

I have enjoyed a few movies I have seen with him in it. He can be funny and well, he can kick some butt.The story of a guy who wants to clean up the "evil" in his small town is truly inspirational. Chris Vaughn (The Rock) would not take crap from no one and when the police made it clear to him they were not going to do anything about it and he'd better just mind his own business, he didn't walk away. He stood up for what was right.This movie is loosely based upon a true story. Of course you add the rock you are going to get much more action than the reality. When it is all said in done, I did enjoy this movie and it made you really think, WOW I am glad there was someone like this that wouldn't back down for what was right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the return trip home, Chris Vaughn (The Rock) notices changes since his last days there. The town mill closed down and a new casino replaced the main source of income. He finds out about cheating going on in the casino among the dealers. He notices his friends are different almost as if they are hiding something. He notices massive amounts of drug use by everyone. As he tries to put a stop to the cheating and drugs, he is overpowered by low lives, and it almost costs him his life. When trying to press charges with the police and getting nowhere, he realizes they are in on some kind of drug ring with his old friends. He then goes out on his own to stop everything.In this action thriller, the directors (Kevin Bray) overall message is that when you see something that goes against the law, approach the situation. Walk tall and find a way to get justice, even if there has to be some vigilantism. Do not let people walk all over you just because you think there is nothing you can do. If you push back harder and harder, you will move people in the right direction.I want to talk about how The Rock lets everyone know he is back in town. The boy has some moves, and it looks believable because of his size. He really knows how to push, and he does not care who he pushes. The Rock has serious muscle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie and I loved it. I was never aware of Bufford Pusser and this movie enlightened me. The Rock was great and the story line was so common but one you cant stop watching. I LOVED IT!! This is a movie that has little profanity and lets you see the way things should be. If you are not familiar with Bufford Pusser you still will like the movie. The movie is based on his story line not his life which to me makes it more a movie and not a biography. So i think that anyone that likes a good movie with a good actor should definitely see this one. So check it out and post your comment because theses comments help others know if they may like a movie or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chris Vaughn: Get your tail-light fixed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jay Hamilton: What's wrong with my tail-lights? (Smashes the tail-light with a 4X4) Chris Vaughn: It's broken.My favourite line in a movie inspired by a true life hero, Sheriff Buford Pusser. This movie was a updated type, with differences to give it it's own little edge. People didn't expect much from it and even less when it was announced that The Rock would be starring in it. It debuted with little to no fanfare and was seen as enjoyable but generic. I bought this DVD for ?3.99 in a shop and went home to put it on. I sat there and prepared myself for very little.I watched one of the best films I have ever seen. It had great humour, it had violence for the men. It had the Rock showing off his body for the women, Johnny Knoxville provided his ass-kicking loving self, the story shown through despite it's simplicity. Neal McDonough was one of those villains you so wanted to get the crap beaten out of them. There was complaints of it being too short, but it doesn't matter. The small time frame it inhabits is enough for you to enjoy the adventure of Chris Vaugn. The Rock's charisma trail-blazes through the screen and lights up the movie. Definitely a popcorn movie."When a former member of the U.S. Army Special Forces returns to his small hometown in rural Washington State hoping to realise a childhood dream of working in the local lumber mill, he discovers that much has changed, as the normally tranquil town is now besieged by drugs, outbreaks of violence and a general feeling of malaise and terror, with many pointing a finger at the influence of a crooked casino where his ex-girlfriend now works as a dancer. Seeking to wreak vengeance, with a four-foot-long 2-by-4 in his hand, and righteousness in his heart, the highly-trained soldier, now the county's sheriff, and his deputy, realises it's time to bust some heads with a very hard piece of wood."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>watchable for the Rock, for more of the story, look to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this as I saw the familiar MGM lion and logo--God, one of my favorites!--and when I did, i was vaguely familiar with the story of Bufford Pusser and what happened to him back in the late 1960s. But apart from seeing the Rock on screen and a few moments of action, and the Rock does have charm and likability, this movie bares hardly any resemblance to the 1973 original starring Joe Don Baker. If you want to see more of the story and what caused him to become sheriff and take on the corrupt townspeople, this movie doesn't do much. I finally got to see the first film.You do see the Rock like Baker come back to his old town, and Baker's character was a wrestler wanting to retire, like the Rock in real life. But here the Rock is coming home from serving in the Army, and finds the mill closed and the town going to hell. You do see some of the discontent, but here apart from seeing his girlfriend forced to strip for a living, his father feeling bummed out from being laid off, and signs of people loitering about, there are no signs or indications of say how the town was! before the Rock left. you have to take it on faith that the closing of the mill destroyed his home town. There was gambling and corruption in the Baker film, but there the men were more visible, there was more antagonism, and more reason for Baker to feel he had to do something. The movie fights were dated and maybe the look is dated, but there was more motivation. The movie drifted from some of the facts about Pusser's life, but you see those creeps leave him for dead, and they did in the remake too, but there were a few more attempts on Pusser's life, more anguish--his wife was shot and killed, and he was repeatedly threatened and intimidated. The Rock got disgusted by the police's inaction, and broke the guy's bar and I don't blame him!--and in both movies he was wrongfully arrested, and both made their speeches to the juries--but in this version, somehow, it doesn't seem as affecting or as involving.This version is also too short, clocking in at 70 odd minutes, and it seems there was something missing in between his arrival and his arrest and then his successful run as sheriff. It is amusing though that he hires his friend to be his one and only deputy, and he even tells the Rock he is a convicted felon. But the Rock doesn't care, he wants a guy whom he can trust. But it doesn't seem to be smart, having only two against all these other guys that have more muscle power than you do. And to ignore criminal procedures isn't the smartest thing either; Baker did the same thing too, but there it seemed to be a reaction to the utter lack of respect for the law that the supposed upholders of the law held, and those men used the law at every turn for their own benefit. At least, when the Rock and Baker twist the law, they have the excuse of the good of the community.The movie ends with the opening of the mill again after the Rock and Knoxville defeat the villain. Seems easy somehow, after all that had happened, it can be re-opened just like that. Who bought it, for one, and why did it close in the first place? There isn't much motivation or story here. Apart from seeing the Rock and his getting McDonough in the end, there isn't too much to this version.Based on a true story..inspired by actual events...The Baker one was based on Pusser's story but some things were inevitably changed. The one with the Rock appears! to be a remake of this movie, but it is based more on the movie and adding details to further fictionalize the story more than it is based on Pusser's life, and it isn't really a re-make either.In conclusion, while this isn't a bad film, it is really not a good one either. It seems to start, get somewhere and just stops...It doesn't really end.Good use of the Allman Brothers song though. The opening sequence is about the best moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect rental release for a bloke's night in - 66%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living with my flatmate, I have come to develop a taste for the WWE. It is a million-dollar pantomime, all fireworks and sequined spandex and for the longest time, I never really got on with the biggest star in years - Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock. He always seemed much better off the mat and on the Mic, running his mouth off and entertaining the fans that way. So when he became a movie star, it wasn't any great surprise. And when Jim Ross repeatedly referenced "Walking Tall" during the Rock's gimmick match at Wrestlemania XX, I felt strangely compelled to investigate. Not out of respect - Undertaker still rules if you ask me - but more out of curiosity."Walking Tall" is an updated version of the 1973 redneck classic, itself based on real-life events. Rock plays Chris Vaughn, a former Navy SEAL who returns to his small-town life after an eight year absence. But his home has changed and not for the better. His old school colleague Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) now owns a casino in the town which also happens to deal in cheap drugs and cheaper women. The lumber mill where his father worked has closed down and the casino is now the biggest earner - no surprise, seeing as the dice are loaded. Deciding to take a stand, Chris is viciously attacked and left for dead and the police can't (or won't) do anything about it. In the end, Chris runs for the Sheriff's office and begins his mission to rid the town of corruption - aided and abetted with his old buddy Ray Templeton (Johnny Knoxville).The biggest problem that "Walking Tall" faces isn't the blink-and-you'll-miss-it duration (a mere 80 minutes or so) but the recognisability of the two main stars. Knoxville struggles to escape the millstone that is "Jackass" but the Rock has no such problems ditching his WWE persona. He is an absorbing presence on screen, whether he's knocking skulls or simply flexing his pecks. Whether he can do any actual acting remains to be seen as this film doesn't really give him the chance to show off and let us judge. He simply kicks ass because there isn't enough time to do anything else. The action is, as you might expect, heavily stylised but you can feel the impact - no fancy wire-work to be found here. This suits the film just fine, which is quite old-fashioned anyway. The token female characters (few and far between) serve little purpose besides basic titillation (choose between red bra or police uniform...) and truth be told, it's difficult finding a villain of such stature that he can be opposite the Rock. And frankly, McDonough isn't even close.There is no doubt that this will not pick up any awards any time soon. But "Walking Tall" is a competent action flick that demonstrates to cynics that the Rock is certainly improving with every film (his appearance in the ensemble cast of "Be Cool" is another such step to superstardom) and he could yet become the new Arnie, now that the Austrian Oak has hung up his gloves for the last time (probably). It's not big and it's certainly not clever but "Walking Tall" is a perfect no-brainer for a lad's night in when the football is off, the lager is in the fridge and the girlfriend is off out somewhere. Rent it rather than buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insipid direction lets The Rock down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the great original "Walking Tall" and thought to myself "Imagine what they could have done if they had a budget". I was really keen to see this remake with "The Rock". Especially after an interview with him where he talked about no CGI and making an old style action film.Pity someone didn't tell the director of this one. His use of angles and dissolves does everything to destroy the movie's strength. That is it's simple yet believable (Something similar actually happened) story and the realism that made the original so striking.The best thing about the movie is The Rock. He has a terrific presence on screen and although he falls flat during a courtroom scene, I am willing to attribute that mostly to the director. Johnny Knocksville also puts in a decent turn.All in All. Hire out Phil Karlsons original. Watching the remake is like listening to someone tell a joke they heard...only they can't quite remember the opening....and they end up missing the punchline!!!3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a movie with such potential that it completely fails as an actual movie. I can't believe that this film was actually agreed upon to be produced. For the most part this is an excellent film, however, given that it is only about an hour in length and that the storyline is quite skewed from that of the original I don't feel that the audience is given a true chance at really enjoying it. In this day and age it is unheard of to make a film this short. There are so many things that could have been done with this film, and yet the director was incapable of adding anything else to it. If you're going to remake one of the great classics, make sure it is done correctly, don't just slap the title of that classic on something that would be ranked in the same field as an "After-school Special". The Rock was Great in this film... that is the only good aspect of the entire thing. I will never watch a movie by this director ever again! I was TOTALLY shocked by the amount of thought put into this movie. This is definitely a guideline on how NOT to make movies. If that was the goal of the director, I applaud him.</fullReview>

I have to confess, I really like The Rock's charisma, it seems to have absolutely nothing to do with what's going on around him, so it's kinda make him a stability center, a point of reference, rather than an actor in a plot; aside of that, he's pretty natural in front of the camera, which makes the rest of the cast look a little out of key.A standard "soldier returns back home" story gets out of hands when the darn soldier kicks the bad guys out of the sheriff's office and it becomes clear that he has no idea whatsoever of what to do next. So he starts to act (IMHO) like a complete degenerate. Namely, doing almost exactly what the bad guys had been doing before he'd kicked them out. Well, that could work in early 80s (and it did) but I don't buy it today, sorry. I seem to be in a minority here, but during the back lights and the truck tearing-apart scenes I felt like I was watching a fascist propaganda movie.If it wasn't for this lack of sense of reality and time, it could be a normal kick-ass flick with some fun moments (the phrase "you stabbed me with a potato peeler!" IMHO is worth the rest of the script) and a linear, pretty stupid story. I'd give it 3 out of 10, just for the pleasure of seeing Rock's playacting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into watching this film with an idea of what it would be like. I wasn't wrong! Mediocre but watchable stuff!To me 'Walking Tall' felt like it wasn't a film. It felt like a pilot to a television show (like A-Team pilot) than a cinema release.Dwayne Johnson or whatever he wants to be called does a good job as a leading man and could easily become the new Arnie or Sly if the movie watching public allows it!The script is lazy as is the direction and the support cast don't do a lot including the crazy-man that is Johnny Knoxville (there IS talent there though!)Not going to be liked by a lot... but it will be enjoyed by others!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's missing is about 30-40 minutes of story. There are at least two, maybe three entire substories from the original "Walking Tall" and the real Buford Pusser story that just aren't there. The problem is the movie sort of skips from Act 3 to Act 5, and Act 7 to Act 9. The only thing it doesn't skip is the fight scenes.Also, the "bad guy" is not that believable. Nowhere near as believable as The Rock as the "good guy". They should have found a bigger, nastier actor. It just isn't believable that he could almost be a match for The Rock in a fistfight. I wanted to like this movie, but didn't. My son, who is 13 and a massive Rock fan from wrestling, didn't like it either. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking Tall is a remake of a Joe Don Baker movie that was bad to begin with, so the remake is a bit of a better movie but not by much. I do admit that The Rock is a turning out to be a better actor than I expected but he keeps doing bad movie, which is a shame because he does have potential. The movie is basically a revenge movie with The Rock betting the crap out of bad guys with a huge two by four, which bear to mind is not bad but with a script that feels like it was written on the fly, it just does not fly off the ground. I've follow most of the movies The Rock has done, going from the Scorpion King to The Rundown (Two movie, that's all) and this film is his best but if he wants to get into a serious movie career, he better start choosing his roles carefully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>was based on the true story it claims to be. It was so far-fetched. Sure, there was probably a guy who comes home after being in the military and has a beef with old school mate, who now is involved in illegal activities. He becomes sheriff and cleans the town up. In this movie, the Rock, plays Chris Vaughn, the soldier who returns home. He takes a 2 by 4 smashes up a casino and is found not guilty. WTF! He gets carved up by casino security because he catches the dealer cheating and won't drop it. There are many fights and shoot outs. And he fires all the deputies and makes his goofy friend the only deputy. The bad guys put thousands of bullet holes in the police office, yet never hit Chris. And Chris doesn't even call the state police? Then there is this silly axe fight scene at the end. I don't know how this didn't get a R rating. But, the worst part of the film has to be Chris's love interest. She is some sort of stripper and is only there to run around in a bra during the police office shoot out scene. It was so silly.FINAL VERDICT: Bad script, very violent not to be R rated. I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Walking Tall", a grossly revamped version of several previous films of the same name, all about legendary Tennessee Sheriff Burford Pusser, features "The Rock" as a badass ex-Special Forces Army sergeant who returns home to find his small town has been taken over by a local bad guy who runs rigged casino games and pollutes the local population with meth. (Guess he hadn't been keeping in touch, huh?) Very derivative and reminiscent of many previous hero flicks, this stuntfest packed with fist and fire fights gets down and dirty straight away and keeps moving with more brawn than brains as it spins its ordinary tale of heroism with a dash of personal issues including some family, a friend, and a hottie. "Walking Tall 2004" keeps The Rock's devil-may-care attitude but forsakes the comedy relief which has made The Rock popular. Okay stuff for action junkies and Rock's fans. (C+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>empty, halfhearted remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As society in general became progressively more liberal in the 1970's, an entire genre of films rose up in reaction to the trend - movies in which an individual, frustrated with a legal system that seemed to be coddling criminals, took it upon himself to mete out his own brand of "frontier justice," usually involving personal vengeance and vigilante-style violence. The seminal films of this genre - "Billy Jack," "Dirty Harry," "Death Wish" and "Walking Tall" - all found favor with mass audiences, although critics tended to dismiss them as, at best, reactionary, and, at worst, neo-fascist in nature. Now, one of them, "Walking Tall," has been retrofitted to cater to audiences in the already far more conservative 21st Century.The original 1973 "Walking Tall" was based on the true story of Buford Pusser, the sheriff of McNairy County, Tennessee, who won fame by single-handedly wiping out the criminal elements who had overrun his town. It was a one-man "crusade for justice" that came at great personal cost to himself and his family (his wife was murdered and Pusser died a few years later in a "mysterious" car accident). In this new version - which eliminates most of the grittier elements of the story and turns it into a rock'em-sock'em, live-action cartoon - Pusser's name has been changed to Chris Vaughn and the locale has been moved from the Appalachians to the Pacific Northwest. Chris is a recently discharged soldier who, upon returning to his small hometown, discovers that the place has become a hotbed of vice and corruption, its citizenry forced to live in fear under the tyrannical control of the local casino owner and all-around meanie, Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough). When Chris has finally had a bellyful of malfeasance and sleaze, he decides to run for sheriff, vowing to bring the criminals to their knees, and thus allowing the good folks of the town to reclaim their community.This is a silly and shallow film whose only real purpose seems to be to give the perpetually self-righteous and outraged Vaughn an excuse to hurl endless bric-a-brac and breakaway furniture around the set while the local townsfolk look on in slack-jawed amazement. Never one to be deterred by such quaint and fusty notions as civil liberties or Miranda rights, Sheriff Vaughn chases down the bad guys one by one, smashing heads and busting bones as he goes. The plot is so underdeveloped that the final confrontation scene between Chris and his arch nemesis, Hamilton, feels like a mere afterthought. The film runs barely 75 minutes, yet boasts a 10-minute long closing credit sequence to pad it out to 85! It's as if even the filmmakers themselves had run out of interest in the project and figured they might as well just wrap things up as quickly as possible so they would be free to move on to bigger and better things.Usually, in a film based on true life events, when the names are changed, it's to protect the innocent. In the case of "Walking Tall," it's more likely that the people who made the film were trying to protect themselves from being sued by the Pusser estate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Buford Pusser story gets a Rock make over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since old age and politics sent the last wave of action heroes to the memory bank, tho Stallone manfully keeps trying to resurrect a comeback each year, there's been a massive hole left to be filled. Where once was Sly, Bruce and Arnie, now sits The Rock, Jason Statham and Vin Diesel. Now those are some pretty large shoes to be filled, for however much the action hero is frowned upon by the non popcorn crowd, they are part of a cinematic niche that thrills millions of movie goers. However, if one is to like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's remake of Phil Karlson's 1973 Sheriff Buford Pusser based picture, Walking Tall, then you really have to take it on its very basic action beefcake form.That the film is distinctly average is not Johnson's fault, he remains (long after this was released) a very likable and watchable star; and with Gridiron Gang he more than proved he had some acting chops to go with his considerably large frame. This film, directed by music video director Kevin Bray, just feels like an excuse to cash in on Johnson's wrestling popularity; two years after The Scorpion King had already done the same thing! The action is well put together, especially during a great police station shoot out, and the humour that is in here, works rather well. But the problems are many, not least the old familiarity breeds contempt train of thought with the plot. Think town tamer Western meets ex soldier fighting back against the bullies, and you have Walking Tall nicely packaged into one popcorn flavoured pie. Then there's the awful performances of love interest Ashley Scott and head villain Neal McDonough, so bad you wonder if the makers had spent all the budget by the time it come to the support cast decisions.As an action movie fan myself, yes in its primal form, I still found enough to have me cheering The Rock on as he went all Rambo on their buttocks. But if you are the sort of film watcher who hated the likes of Cobra, Raw Deal and Striking Distance? Then you probably should avoid this like the plague. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rock in a hard place...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schwarzenegger has turned to politics, Stallone has grown old, Seagal's too fat and Van Damme is too bland. Hollywood is looking for a new action hero and, somehow appropriately, it has turned to the ranks of the choreographed pantomime artists that pass for professional wrestlers in the States to find him.The Rock is actually quite good in this film. In fact, apart from Ashley Scott's 10-minute stint in a fetching red bra, he's the best thing in this run-of-the-mill action flick that can't hold a candle to the original Joe Don Baker vehicle on which it is based. He plays Chris Vaughn, returning war hero, who discovers his hometown has changed for the worst since he went away. The mill has closed down, and the town's main employer is now a flashy casino run by old schoolmate Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough). It isn't long before our hero runs foul of our villain and the town sheriff and determines to get even by getting himself elected to sheriff.The film starts off quite well as Vaughn re-establishes contact with family and friends (among them, Jackass's Johnny Knoxville who admirably refrains from inserting any inappropriate objects into any of his orifices), but the characters are never fleshed out and the film quickly reverts to genre form and dispenses with such trivialities as creating a realistic milieu in which the story can unfold. So the Rock only wins the respect of his unfriendly nephew after getting beaten up by Hamilton's Casino security goons, and Vaughn is found not guilty of trashing Hamilton's casino and beating up his security staff because he was acting out of admirable principles. Now that one's really going to go down well with the more impressionable percentage of its target audience (about 97%). In fact it's from the laughably bad trial sequence onwards that things falter badly, and the rest of the film is just a typical shoot-'em-up. There are a couple of nice touches from director Kevin Bray but he shows his music video roots a little too often, and the neat touches aren't enough to lift the movie above the level of just another brainless action flick.On this evidence, The Rock may well prove to be the next big action hero. For a wrestler he makes a pretty good actor ? but then we only really have Hulk Hogan to compare him to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WT 2004 is a mostly bloodless, PG-13 remake of the incredibly violent 1973 classic, with the Rock standing in for Joe Don Baker as the returning war vet who decides to clean up his lawless town. The lumber mill's been closed, a casino opened, and all sorts of drug dealing and prostitution and crooked gambling have come into play. The Rock is actually pretty good in the role of the square-jawed, all-American hero, and Johnny (JACKASS) Knoxville is along for comic relief as his scruffy deputy and old high school pal. The fights are clumsily staged but frequent and fun. The film is mercifully short. A great time waster.</fullReview>

There are many actors out there, that are really much worse. But whomever it was who wrote the script - absolutely and definitely cut too many corners, and left out to many details.I know that it is a question of money - but there is also a question of truth and consistency - and there's simply too many holes in the plot to make it really workable.

After a run-in at the local casino and with the sheriff's department, Vaughn becomes sheriff and decides to take the law into his own hands, specifically using a large piece of wood. With the mill shut down, it's gambling and drugs that fill the streets and fill the pocketbooks of the local gang, headed by an always spooky Neal McDonough as Jay Hamilton. When there's not violence, Deni, a former school mat of Vaugns, is available for a few mandatory sexy scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is Chris Vaughn, an Ex Navy SEALS commando type who has returned to his home town in Rural Washington. Upon returning, he sees that the Mill in which his father worked has closed down, drugs are rampant, the cops are a bit too laid back than usual, and a casino dominates the land. His not-so-much-of-a-friend from highschool, Jay Hamilton owns the casino and basically owns the town. Finally fed up when he is pushed too far, he decides to become the new town sheriff.The Rock is not quite there yet, but is shaping into the next action star of our time. Now, when you see Johnny Knoxville's name being advertised in an actual movie and not a "Jackass" type fare, you wonder to yourself if he's going to sink the film. In "Walking Tall", he surprises by turning in a pretty good performance. It's just the script that's the problem here Hollywood tried before to make a movie about one man basically owning a town because he's so rich and powerful. That movie was called "Road House". if you saw that movie, you'd know that I wouldn't need to say much more. but if you haven't, "Road House" was crammed full of ridiculous plot deices, unrealistic violence, and just a lot of bad dialog that is still frowned upon today.I have got to say that "Walking Tall" is much better than "Road House" by a landslide. The script's dialog scenes were way too brief, but still a bit interesting. The action scenes are pretty good. Nothing truly believable, but still good. The bad segments concern The Rock's courtroom scene and his relationship with the stripper.The movie would have been even better if it had slowed down and taken some care in some of it's scenes. Everything was shot from uninventive, "let's get this over with" angles, and the editing was just crap. Take the the football scene near the beginning, for example. it's opportunity for the audience to have some fun with the characters, but it turns into a quick sequence of very short cuts that makes it not very fun. When the Rock gets taken down at the end of the game, it just looks like they were covering up a mistake.in the end, it comes back to the script and the film crew. I felt more care and inventiveness was needed for all the scenes.**/****</fullReview>

You have a new king.When hearing he was in this one, I knew what to expect; lots of violence, bad language and utterly ridiculous court-scenes. Well, I got all of those, rammed into one hell of an entertaining package. Walking Tall: a dumb, popcorn film.It starts off with ex-soldier, Chris Vaugn, returning to his home town, seeing it seriously changed round. Drugs and seedy hotels are taking over. It's time to get all back. With a vengeance. After seeing his nephew (Khleo Thomas) smoking hash down at a football park, and then taking crystal myth, and finding out that it's from the casino (also after winning money and being cheated) he decides to take over. He goes into the Casino and gets the beating of a lifetime. He goes back, and gives them the beating of a life time. See the general direction? After Swiping the sheriffs badge after a ridiculous court scene, he really, really wants to set the town straight. Him and his club go out for justice, to get his once calm town back, and to kick the crap out of Casino Nasty (Neal Mcdonough). He also finds a very hot girl and decides to embark on a very un-saucy relationship.All in all, brainless, fun entertainment, Walking Tall is strictly a rental movie for a rainy afternoon and nothing else. You have been warned. Final Rating: *** out of ***** (3 out of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking Tall was a decent film with great action and very entertaining. The movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I kind of liked it to tell you. The action was great and it kept you on the edge of your seat. The acting was good. The Rock isn't a very good actor though, he did okay in the movie but some of his lines were dull and like usual for his pathetic characters. The positive part is that he is slowly getting better though in acting. Johnny Knoxville, I thought did really well in this movie. I thought he would be bad in this film but he really wasn't. Of course the plot sucked and the character development was awful. I mean it's kind of dumb when Chris Vaughn gets home and right away he's in a fight. It's just kind of stupid. Overall, an entertaining and decent action flick that should've done a bit better on the plot.Hedeen's outlook: 6/10 ** C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ROCKing Tall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, there are two kinds of bad action movies, those that are still watchable ("XXX") and those that aren't ("Tomb Raider"). The line between such flicks is quite thin and usually relies upon either the quality and originality of the action (as in "XXX") or the magnetism of the stars (Schwarzenegger movies) to "succeed." I say all this to provide a little context for my review of "Walking Tall", a remake of the the 1973 film of the same name. The 2004 version stars the professional wrestler The Rock, without whom the movie would likely have been completely worthless.I find it appropriate that "Walking Tall" features a wrestler, since the entire plot line could have been lifted straight from a WWF script. In fact, the more I think about it, the more the similarities bear out. To the best of my knowledge, the story mirrors that of the original. After serving in the military for a decade or so, Chris Vaughn (The Rock) returns to his small hometown to find it changed for the worse. He takes it upon himself to clean the town up, with varying degrees of success. There is nothing surprising in the plot; you can likely predict almost every event.It's a basic WWF storyline: Potential hero with sketchy background returns. He soon clashes with a bad guy who was trying to be good. The protagonist triumphs initially; the antagonist retaliates in a near-fatal manner. Our hero, now with the girl, must now battle great adversity to overcome the villain. Guess what happens. But realistically, nobody is seeing this movie with expectations of being shocked or taken for an emotional roller-coaster ride, so the lack of suspense isn't much of an issue. But the movie still must be executed well to be worth a viewing, and on this front "Walking Tall" succeeds to varying degrees. Wisely, the movie doesn't try to reach beyond itself. At no point does the flick harbor illusions of making political or social statements. Nor does it attempt to cross unnecessarily into the comedy or drama genres by forcing jokes or melodrama. Instead, with mixes of both, it plods along a tried-and-true action path without wandering, providing a similarly watchable but not interest-grabbing movie. As mentioned earlier, The Rock carries the flick because he has the "It Factor" going for him. Whatever that mysterious and elusive combination of screen presence and audience appeal is, he has it. His easy-going mannerisms, charming smile, and butt-kicking ability combine to potentially put him on a career path like that of Arnold or Stallone. As expected, his work in the decent-to-good action scenes is quite solid; for once, you actually believe that a guy can do the wild stunts required of him.Although Neal McDonough ("Band of Brothers", "Boomtown") plays the sleazy villain with appropriate toughness and sneering, he is still overmatched. He doesn't seem to be capable of going head-to-head with The Rock, either physically or in star-power (not that many people are). Johnny Knoxville is Robin to The Rock's Batman, tagging along, providing comic relief, and effectively playing the sidekick role. Everyone else is just there, filling typical roles without drawing attention for better or worse.Usually the editing of a typical movie such as this isn't noteworthy, but numerous odd cuts drew uncalled for attention. Newcomer Robert Ivison and veteran George Bowers ("Country Bears", "From Hell") utilized a number of odd jump cuts and reverse edits that jilted me from my semi-stupor. While the technique itself isn't outlandish, in a straightforward flick, they're plain distracting, not revolutionary. Sometimes you need to turn your mind off and cruise through a movie. Thanks to The Rock, "Walking Tall" is a good movie for those times.Bottom Line: It's watchable, just don't expect much. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seventy minute movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of a man who comes home from the army and finds his hometown not as he left it. Its been taken over by vice brought in by a rich boyhood friend who wants to get even richer. Eventually there's a new sheriff in town and it all comes to an action packed conclusion in roughly 70 minutes minus end credits.Movies should be as long as it takes to tell the story, be it three minutes , three hours or three days. Then again the shorter the movie the more screenings you get get in a day and the more money you can make.This brings me to the new version of Walking Tall, a movie I'm guessing was designed purely to make money. Its not that its a bad movie, its just that its about twenty minutes too short. Frankly this would be a good movie is the second half, er... second 35 minutes wasn't a blind race to the end where things stop making sense and action is cut short just to get to the next plot point. Either this was done to make money or because the second half was so terrible it had to be cut down. Personally I think its a money thing since the rest of movie is nicely paced.The Rock is quite good as the only one willing to fight back, and he's nicely paired with Johnny Knoxville as his ex con friend who becomes his deputy. Only the villains are a bit over the top, but then again its a cartoon of a movie so its okay.If this had been a complete movie I'd say go see it or rent it, but its so jumbled in the second half that the best I can say is wait for cable since an obvious rip off should not be rewarded with cash.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special, but far from bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking Tall is a film inspired by the story of Beoford Pusser, who in this is called Chris Vaughn (The Rock). He has just returned home from an eight year service in the Special Forces. But when he returns home, he finds that it is not the town he left eight years ago. The mill, the place where his father worked and where he wanted to work, has been closed and replaced by a seedy casino, owned by his former friend. After sveral events involving this casino (don't want to spoil anything), he decides to take the law into his own hands. This movie was decent, somewhat of a typical action flick. It had surprisingly good cinematography direction, yet the film seemed a bit short. The pacing was rather fast and off by a tad. It ended pretty abruptly, and while it wrapped up the story, it didn't really have a feeling of conclusion. The Rock was good, but he was only required to have about three facial expressions throughout the movie. The story was good, and the script was fairly well-written. All in all, this film is must-rent, as opposed to a must-see. Worth seeing, but not neccessarily worth the eight bucks to see it in theaters (I got a free pass to the premiere in Nashv</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock plays Chris Vaughn, an ex-vet who returns to his home town and finds gangsters have taken it over. After Chris gets beaten up and left for dead by the criminals, he runs for sheriff and wins and tries to clean up the town with the help of a 4 foot long hunk of wood he carries with him. Based on the true story of Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser.Pretty good show but i have to say it pales next to the 1973 original. Joe Don Baker starred in that one and really looked the part. JDB back then was a big ugly tough looking guy in contrast to The Rock who looks more like a male model. The original also stuck with the name Buford Pusser. Sure that's a stupid name, esp for a tough guy, but that was the actual name of the real-life sheriff and it made the show seem authentic.Neal McDonough is very good as the leader of the bad guys. He acts circles around The Rock, though acting doesn't matter much in a show like this. Some really good fight scenes in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Rundown" is better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary written by Bubba: When a former member of the U.S. Army Special Forces returns to his small hometown in rural Washington State to revive his family's lumber mill business, he discovers that much has changed, as the normally tranquil town is now besieged by drugs, outbreaks of violence and a general feeling of malaise and terror, with many pointing a finger at the influence of a crooked casino where his ex-girlfriend now works as a dancer. Seeking to wreak vengeance, with a four-foot-long 2-by-4 in his hand, and righteousness in his heart, the highly-trained soldier, now the county's sheriff, and his deputy, realizes it's time to bust some heads with a very hard piece of wood.A solid action movie. But last years "The Rundown" was better. The Rock may have just been better fit for that character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking Tall walks short of The Rundown. Actually by a lot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rundown. One hell of a movie. Remind you of that Guns and Roses song, doesn't it? The Rundown is an absolutely superb, action-packed, thrilling, adventure ride. When this came out this year, the same could not be said. From running to walking, Walking Tall is a big road bump in the earliness of Dwayne Johnson's movie career. It is unappealing, the drama is horribly done, action swings here and there and the most random things are done or said. All the jokes of the movie, which made is more anticipated were all used up in the trailers, now what good use is that? However, Walking Tall still has some great action sequences but the movie falls apart in the final act.Walking Tall stars The Rock obviously. It also stars Johnny Knoxville with a good performance but again, the jokes fade fast. Neal McDonough stars as the rival of The Rock and Ashley Scott plays an old friend from high school.Chris Vaughn (The Rock) returns to his hometown in Washington as he just finished his military services. He is back home and loves it. He gets back with the family and his friends including his best buddy Ray Templeton (Knoxville). He walks around the town to see how it's changed. Him and Ray decide to a game of football with their friends while the leader of the other team is none other than Chris' high school rival, Jay Hamilton (McDonough). They then decide to show off to each other so Jay shows Chris the casino he owns downtown. What has happened to Chris' hometown? How could someone allow this to happen to his quiet, peaceful town? Chris isn't too pleased. His friends then pay for a pole dance and the girl giving it to him is none other than his high school crush Deni (Scott). What are the chances? (Sarcasm). Then he notices more change. His nephew is doing major drugs. He finds the source is the security guards of the casino. Chris takes action but then is assaulted by the guards later. More drivel occurs as he calls the police but the sheriff and everyone else are no good. Chris sets out to set his hometown the way it used to be.Overall, Walking Tall isn't all that impressive. It's got its great one-liners and great action sequences but they are short lived. A lot could have been cut from the movie but it's already only 87 minutes. Walking Tall is probably the biggest disappointment of the pre-summer. With six upcoming movies ahead for The Rock in the next two years, he better make up for this one with Be Cool, Doom, Instant Karma, Spy Hunter, Johnny Bravo, or Gridiron Gang. These next two years are crucial. Not considering The Mummy Returns, as Dwayne's movie career rolls past 2004, he's 2-1.My Rating: 6/10Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thing it is based on a true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie was not based on a true story, I would have serious issues with the plot. Seeing, that this really happened adds a sense of forgiveness to the plot. The script isn't well polished even though it had writing credits for about 6 people. With that being said, it is a good movie.The Rock really makes this movie. The energy that he demonstrates on screen is massive. His prescence is a commanding force. He trully is the next big action star. You got to see The Rock's acting ability, which is pretty good.In a time where movie-goers are use to 2 hour long movies this movie was only about 1hr 20 minutes and that was including the credits. Many websites have this movie listed at 111 minutes which is 1 hr 51 minutes and the movie is not that long, do not be fooled.Even though the movie is short it is still a complete story. Being a writer myself I've found that the shortest version of a movie script is usually the best. I would hate to see this movie come out on DVD and they have 30-40 minutes worth of deleted scenes. If that is true then they cleary cut the movie down to keep a sacred PG-13 rating.This is good date movie. It has action scences for the guys and a little romance for the ladies. I give this movie 8 out of 10!GO ENJOY THE SHOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking Tall (2004) is a remake of the original movie in 1973. Walking Tall is based on the true story of Sheriff Buford Pusser played by Dwayne Johnson (The Rock). Chris Vaughn (Pusser played by The Rock), is a former U.S Army Sergeant that returns to his hometown. Unemployed and looking for work, he soon learns the cedar mill has been closed down for a few years and a new major source of income is the casino run by Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough), an old friend of Vaughn's.At the casino Vaughn learns that Hamilton is running a crooked operation and later discovers that casino security has been selling drugs to his nephew, Pete, and that they are monopolizing the whole town. When he first finds out they are using loaded dice he begins a fight at the casino and in turn is tortured by Hamilton's men quite badly, and sustains injury to his torso. After Vaughn recovers, he takes matters into his own hands.This movie tackles a popular theme, which is to fight against corruption, against people who look good on the outside but not on the inside. If you've ever done it, you'll enjoy this movie. - Asif Zamir</fullReview>

Also, all the comments about the "legality"... of course it doesn't mirror reality, if only the real justice system catered to martyrs... we all need some real "Robin Hoods" these days. And the good guys are always supposed to win in the end... otherwise, what's the point of the movie?? There's gotta be some sort of justice! Its a movie!! Fake!! Pretend!! Fun!

		<shortDescription>The Rock is good but the plot is undeveloped and, by lacking moral complexity and thought, seems to justify criminal violence when it is done by "good" men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When he returns to his hometown after leaving the army, Chris Vaughn is surprised to find that the mill has shut and that Jay Hamilton's casino and strip club is the main source of revenue. During his first visit he finds his ex-girlfriend stripping, drugs being sold under the table and the dice loaded. After he gets in a fight with Hamilton's men, he decides to stay away ? until, that is, his nephew is taken to hospital after using crystal meth obtained from the casino. After storming the casino with a thick piece of wood, he is taken to court by the law who are in the pocket of Hamilton. The risks are high (18 years if found guilty) but it is time for one man (and his stick) to take a stand.Apparently based on a true story as well as being a remake of another film, this is a short little action film with little in the way of thoughtful plotting and, surprisingly, little in the way of fun action. The story sees a man standing up to wrongs in his hometown and, erm, that's about it. The action is pretty run of the mill with a few fist fights and such but nothing particularly interesting or exciting and they aren't helped by the fact that I didn't really get into the story or characters. The main problem for me was the lack of development within the script ? it never looked at the morals of the situation, nor the dark side of Chris' actions; in fairness I never expected it from a film of this genre and target audience but it is hard to ignore it as a failing. Of course, if you are in the mood for it then this film is short enough to distract and vaguely entertain but just don't hope for much.A major reason it provides at least some entertainment is the presence of the surprisingly charismatic The Rock. It would have been easy to join all those comparing him and his stick but the truth is that he is really suited to basic action movies ? he is charming, intelligent and has a real screen presence that I really enjoy. This is the third or fourth thing I've really seen him in and yet again I find myself surprised by how good he is ? not an "actor" in the Brando sense but you can see an action star in him. Knoxville seems like more of a gimmick aimed at the male MTV-viewing target audience. McDonough is OK but film gives him little to work with ? likewise Wilson, Beasley and others.Overall this is a fairly average thriller that will not impress many viewers despite the charismatic playing of The Rock. The plot is very basic and is the main problem with the film because, without thought and moral complexity, Chris comes off just as bad as those he is chasing down and it is a little disturbing the way that the film never chooses to judge him in any way. For target audience it may suffice but even then may prove a little dull ? I was distracted by it but didn't care less; next time respect my intelligence and things might go better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of "Walking Tall" is kinda surprising to me. The Rock playing Chris Vaughn was very interesting. Joe Don Baker's Buford Pusser was an original piece of work. Though The Rock has a lot more muscle, he had laid the SmackDown on the no-gooder (you know what). I liked some of the changes in this movie. That way, the movie won't be so campy.Ashley Scott playing Deni was magnificant. She was awesome, has a nice body. If The Rock wasn't married the would make a great couple. The parents of Chris Vaughn was very unique. A interracial couple. Very common in a lot of movies. What the 1973 version started, this version of the movie took it to a whole new level. I don't care what the critics says or what other movie goers say. I thought the movie was great.

I guess this is because the rock fired the other assholes that were in collusion with the casino owner!! But wouldn't she know any of this? I don't know it seems like the whole movie revolves around The Rock. With out his credibility the movie wouldn't have been worth even renting.
