		<shortDescription>The Emergence of a Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of Lon Chaney, but I have never had the opportunity to see some of his early films. "Outside the Law", released in 1920 is one of his early gems.Chaney at this time, had not yet achieved the stardom that he was to experience in a few short years. In this film, Chaney plays two supporting roles, that of a thug named "Black Mike" and a Chinese servant named Ah Wing. The hero and heroine are played by Priscilla Dean and Wheeler Oakman. I had not heard of Ms. Dean before this, but I can say that she gave an excellent performance. Oakman, who wound up in "B" westerns in the 30s, was good as well.Chaney's characters are totally different and his makeup for the Ah Wing character is phenominal. It gives us a glimpse of kind of makeup artistry that we would experience in his future films.The tape that I watched this film on was duplicated from a partially decomposed nitrate print, however most of the "bad film" is in the final reels but is still watchable.In "Outside the Law", we can see the emergence of the genius that was Lon Chaney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There will never be another Lon Chaney!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an awesome film, Lon Chaney is so creepy looking as the gangster 'Black Mike'. When Lon Chaney is on the screen you can't get your eyes off of him, his facial expressions and body gestures speak a thousand words. Not only was he brilliant as the gangster he also plays another role as a chinese servant, (a somewhat similar role he would reprise 2 years later in the film Shadows) the transformation is astonishing! Thats why he is called a man of a thousand faces!The story is about Black Mike's attempt to frame an affluent citizen in a crime, and then have him turn against the law because of his time spent in jail as an innocent. Most of the story focuses on the man's daughter who turns to a life of crime by stealing some expensive jewelry. There is tons of swindling and double crossing in this film.This Film Directed by 'Freaks' Director Todd Browning is a tense thriller that can still keep you riveted to your seat. It is most saddening that many of Lon Chaney's films are lost, the quality is pretty bad on this one with last reel being totally washed out. Something must be done to restore all of these films or we will loose an integral part of film history, and one of best actors ever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Browning's and Chaney's First Significant Collaborations!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chinatown, San Francisco serves as the backdrop to this intriguing story of a couple of criminals, having stolen some jewels in a heist, holed up in an apartment building to stay low from the cops and another criminal they rooked named Black Mike. The woman, played with fiery intensity by a ravishing Priscilla Dean, and man, Dapper Bill played by Wheeler Oakman with some charisma, soon realize they want to go straight and make new lives for themselves. An older Oriental figure of some importance in the Chinatown community had been telling Molly, Dean's character, and her father that crime does not pay and lives can all be changed for the good. This influence and the kindness/understanding that goes with it, the love that develops between Molly and Bill, and a small child that wends his momentary ways into their hearts all help this transformation of character take place. Outside the Law is a really remarkable film for a number of reasons when you considered it was made in 1920! Director Tod Browning shows that he can direct. After all he learned under the master himself, D. W. Griffith. Browning paces the flow and action of the film very nicely and manages to create characters that are not just stereotypes but three-dimensional. The acting helps do this naturally as well as all of it is quite good, but make no mistake - acting honors go to the "Man of a Thousand Faces" Lon Chaney in an early screen role well before he and Browning were stars. Chaney is brilliant not only as the nefarious Black Mike - oozing oily charm, but also as Ah Wing, the Asian helper to the old Chinese friend of the Madden family. Chaney could have played both roles in a very stereotypical fashion and still be credible, but Chaney pours his heart into each and makes them truly believable. As Ah Wing he is also almost undetectable. As far as Chaney's very early features go, Outside the Law is currently my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor but solid early Browning-Chaney collaboration recommended to fans of their collective output</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a stab at the movie's quality but (as with many Lon Chaney vehicles) it's worth a watch mostly for his typically electrifying performance. He plays another tough as nails gangster bad guy called Black Mike (and has a secondary role as Ah Wing, Chinese sage Chang Low's assistant) but instead of merely fulfilling his genre role as antagonist and villain, he brings a level of malevolence that elevelates his character to a whole other kind of grotesque not far from horror territory.As is true for other films that Chaney received second billing, he's mostly in the opening and closing 15 minutes which are packed with explosive action. The middle deals with the mandatory romance between protagonist Molly Maddoc (played by the sashy Priscilla Dean who steals scenes) and Black Mike's right hand man Bill who double crosses his boss out of remorse and love for miss Maddoc. They spend the middle act holed up in an apartment after a successful jewel robbery, hiding from cops and Black Mike alike.All in all Outside the Law is not a masterpiece of any kind but fans of silent films and especially Lon Chaney will find enough to appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confucius and Tod Browning say, "Crime Does Not Pay!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a sometimes hard-to-follow storyline, "Outside the Law" begins with some observations from a famous Chinese philosopher. Confucius said, "If a country had none but good rulers for a hundred years, crime might be stamped out and the death penalty abolished." This view lives through the ages, and brings us to the present setting of filmmaker Tod Browning's crime drama, "On the crest of a yellow torrent" to "the Orient of America" in San Francisco's Chinatown. The poppy-smoked streets and alleys are a haven for crime, but trusty Chinese do-gooder E. Alyn Warren (as Chang Low) is attempting to reform underworld mastermind Ralph Lewis (as "Silent" Madden).Elsewhere, forces are plotting against Mr. Lewis' reformation. Fearsome and vengeful Lon Chaney (as "Black Mike" Sylva) arranges for Lewis to be framed for killing a cop during a shoot-out. Nasty business. Next, Mr. Chaney plans to lure Lewis' strong-willed daughter Priscilla Dean (as Molly "Silky Moll" Madden) into participation in a jewel heist. But Chaney's sticky-fingered friend Wheeler Oakman (as "Dapper Bill" Ballard) decides to team-up with Ms. Dean and escape with the booty. As the film plays, we see Dean and Mr. Oakman as a possible romantic couple. Oakman develops a fatherly relationship with a "Kid Across the Hall" (Stanley Goethals). Confucius approves.This is a nicely-produced film. The actors are much more natural that you might assume, with Mr. Browning's direction being an obviously positive factor. The problem is that the story, while a good one, unfolds in a confusing manner and seems to leave out details regarding the characters' relationships and motivations; we must make assumptions. "Yellow-face" watchers note Chaney also plays Mr. Warren's devoted servant; both men use the standard tape method to achieve their "slant eye" effect. There is some obvious film deterioration during the climax (making it look like a fire is also blazing!) but the film's basic integrity is intact; still photographs reveal beautiful detail.Also note the words "you dirty rat!" often wrongly attributed to James Cagney are written herein for Chaney.****** Outside the Law (12/26/20) Tod Browning ~ Priscilla Dean, Lon Chaney, Wheeler Oakman, Ralph Lewis</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast?ancient lively crime melodrama, with Mrs. Dean, Chaney and Oakman, directed by the legendary Tod Browning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OUTSIDE THE LAW, a very enjoyable, lively, suspenseful and occasionally funny (intentionally, I mean) crime melodrama about railroading, features Priscilla Dean, an average beauty with slightly objectionable nose, as the tough babe shortly detoured from her criminal endeavors by the Confucianist wisdom, and Lon Chaney doing two roles, and is of interest to those interested in silent thrillers and crime melodramas, Tod Browning, Mrs. Dean, or Chaney.The bitchy Molly, played to the hilt by the enjoyable and piquant Mrs. Dean, seems the most interesting character in this movie.Wheeler Oakman is mild, but interesting, with a good?guy modern look.Chaney plays both the villain of the movie, and a Chinese servant. OUTSIDE THE LAW should be of interest not only to regular Chaney or Tod Browning _completists (two partially superposed crowds), but to any silent cinema fan; it looks like a very decent job, by an insufficiently honored maestro, Tod Browning, and also recommended by a handful of good performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Browning and Chaney offer style and villainy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outside the Law marks the second time Todd Browning and Lon Chaney teamed together to make a film and it shows both of their great talents. Chaney was by no means a star when Outside the Law was made but he was considered the premiere character actor in Hollywood, and his turn as gangster "Black" Mike is one of his finest character driven roles.Chaney's characters all ways had a quality of redemption or sadness to them that we as an audience could relate to. The villains like The Blackbird, Alonso the Armless, and Echo all had a soul that the audience could find and relate to and all though we didn't agree with their methods or actions we understood what made them tick. With "Black" Mike none of that is there. Chaney plays a villain that the audience despises. There is nothing even remotely worth liking in this character. Chaney is outstanding in this role. We need to remember that Outside the Law isn't Chaney's picture, Priscilla Deann is the star and Chaney is here to be an antagonist.Priscilla Dean deserves great credit as well. She offers a terrific performance as Molly. We have to identify with her for the picture to work and she more than succeeds. Molly offers the different convictions to her character. She has to go from being a dislikeable villain to trying to find that conscience. Dean excels at portraying every end of the spectrum. I wish her transition from being a crook to a moral woman wasn't so fast because I would have liked to have seen what more Dean could have done with the thoughts and emotions of this character. I like her a great deal as the villainous crook. She is the one who wants to go through with the heist despite the fact Black Mike has set her up. Dean is very spunky and sexy as the crook but when she finds her morality hugging that child we see real tenderness. Ahe was a fine actress.What I was most impressed with was the fact that both Chaney and Browning have essentially created a blueprint for the Cahney gangster films of the 30's. Outside the Law in it's visuals and in Chaney's performance is a 30's gangster film. I imagine the remake got lost in the shuffle but it looks as if this picture was truly ahead of it's time.Here is what brings it down, the Chinatown subplot with Chang Low. It isn't needed whatsoever. The setting to the story is really irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and E. Alyn Warren is painfully unconvincing as an Asian wise man. Chaney gets the opportunity to try out his Asian make-up and it is impressive and very realistic. If Browning felt he absolutely had to have this aspect of the story, Chaney should have played Chang Low. In the long run, the morality and Confuscisim could have easily been substituted by Christianity and Chang Low could have been a Reverend or a Catholic priest. The boy's kite takes the form of a cross not a Daoist symbol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While, this film might not be, my partner in crime. It was still a somewhat watchable classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the perfect crime. The man of a thousand faces being outside the law. What could, go wrong with a movie, like that? Surprising, a lot! Directed by Tod Browning, this movie is under arrest, for being pretty mediocre. Made, during the height of Browning's alcoholism depression, and made before Lou Chaney's crowning achievement in 1923's The Hunchback of Notre Dame &amp; 1925's The Phantom of the Opera, this movie, in my opinion, wasn't as good as their previous work in 1919's Wicked Darling. Don't get me wrong, it's not a horrible movie, at all. Honestly, I like that Outside the Law is considered to be one of the first psychologically driven films in the gangster genre. However, it also pretty forgettable to the point, that Browning had to remake it in 1930, just to make it, profitable. Outside the Law tells the story a gangster's daughter, Silky Moll AKA Molly Madden (Priscilla Dean), being forced back into a life of crime, after her reform mob-father, Silent Madden (Ralph Lewis) was put to jail, for a crime, he didn't commit. Driven by revenge, and with no money to support herself, she goes on a daring jewelry heist, against her father's rival, crime boss, Morgan Spencer (Melbourne MacDowell) and his henchman, Black Mike Sylva (Lon Chaney). She does all this, in order to marry the man, she loves, Dapper Bill Ballard (Wheeler Oakman), and start a new life with him. Can, Silky Moll, achieve her goal or will Black Mike Sylva gain the upper hand? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found the plot to be, somewhat interesting, but really slow at parts. The film is also pretty jarring for its overall tone. One minute, the film is very violent with gunshots and blood being spill; the next minute, you got cute little kids and puppies trying to make warm the criminal's cold hearts. It really comes out of nowhere and never truly explain. It was so distracting. Every time, I saw the child on screen, I was left, wondering where is the kid's parents? Also, I was thinking, why does the little boy acted like the robbers, are his parents? How did this relationship, between the criminals and the neighbor kid, started? It's more confusing, than Confucius. There has to be, a different way to show, character arch than introducing a kid into the story, with little to no backstory. For a movie that preach a lot of Confucius teachings. It rather used, much of it. It wasn't really needed, whatsoever, in my opinion, since the movie would rather, put Christianity imagery, instead. A good example of this, was the scene where boy's kite takes the form of a cross in the shadows, rather than a Daoist symbol. It was pretty clear by that, that any of the Confucius subplot with Chang Lo (E. Alyn Warren) was going to take, an irrelevant backseat, to the main plot of the stolen jewels. Warren did alright with his limited screen time. He really looks the part, I have to say, but Lon Chaney as his Chinese henchman, Ah Wing wasn't that impressive with the make-up. The 'slant eye' effect with the over the top, buck tooth was a little too much for me, too handle. He looks very stereotypical offensive goofy, here, rather than looking convincing. He looks more realistic in 1922's Shadows, as a Chinese immigrant than he does as Ah Wing. Honestly, the whole Ah Wing character should had been cut from the film, as he rarely does anything to move the plot. Still, I do love that Outside the Law generally a very positive depiction of Chinese characters, compare to others films that portray them, as a Yellow Peril. While Chaney as Ah Wing was disappointing; Chaney as the villain, Black Mike Sylvia was not. You really get to see, how great, he was, at playing the bad guy. I love the murderous look on his eyes, and the sinister way, he smiles. Roles like this, are the reasons, why he regarded as one of the most versatile and powerful actors of early cinema. While, Lon Chaney might seem like the star; he wasn't. He barely in the film, much. Instead, the movie focus more on the acting chops of Priscilla Dean. While, her performance, might look upon as simplistic or campy to some, for me, she offer a terrific performance as Molly. I love her stubborn, but stern look. Remind me, so much of a young Drew Barrymore. Wheeler Oakman as Dapper Bill was also great. He has the characteristic of a young James Cagney in his prime. I really like his upbeat persona. For a silent film, the on screen intertitles used to narrate story points, wasn't really needed that much, during the action scenes. However, when there were some key dialogue scenes, the wording was way too short or vague. Some of the 1920s slangs words, used in the film, now, means different things. It was a bit jarring. For the most part, the film was pretty clear and visible, but there seem to be some obvious film damage during the climax of the movie, making it, somewhat barely watchable. I really hope, there is a copy of the film, that doesn't have this, but I doubt it. The visual quality of silent movies are often high of having film damaged, due to years of neglected. In addition, many prints may suffer from censorship cuts and missing frames and scenes, resulting in what may appear to be poor editing. This film has that. . Another problem is the lack of a film score. Very few film scores survive intact from the silent period. Sadly, the music that they often use, in these DVD copies, often, doesn't match, what is happening on screen. Overall: When it comes to a most wanted list of the greatest's Lou Chaney films. This movie isn't on my list, but it's still worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside the Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always great to see Lon Chaney films. In this one he plays two roles, two men at opposite ends and although his screen time is limited, he rescues the film. This is the second collaboration of Chaney and Browning and there are already seeds of further and more elaborate collaborations. Although Tod Browning had assisted D.W. Griffith some four years prior in "Intolerance" there is precious little he picked up on camera movement. In fact the camera never moves at all in this film, and after a while it begins to "feel" like filmed theater with the camera nailed to the floor and not much more. In fact, the only film I can recollect in Browning's work is where the camera actually does move during the opening scenes of "Dracula". Then, the camera work is mesmerizing but apparently Browning dismissed the cameraman and that was that. This is a film for Lon Chaney fans who will not be disappointed.Curtis Stotlar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lon Chaney...man of not quite 1000 faces.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lon Chaney has been nicknamed "the man of 1000 faces" for his amazing ability to make himself look like so many different people. I have seen an awful lot of his films and am amazed at his makeup and characterizations--they were very impressive. However, at the same time, he played a couple of Asian roles where, frankly, he sucked. Perhaps for a White guy who doesn't look Asian he was pretty good in films like MR. WU and OUTSIDE THE LAW--but he still didn't look like a native! Fortunately in OUTSIDE THE LAW the film does not rely completely on this silly characterization. That's because although Chaney plays the part of 'Ah Wing' (a Chinese man), he also plays an evil gangster ('Black Mike')--and Black Mike is one of the major players in the film and Ah Wing is not. So, it's bad but the film doesn't hinge on the Ah Wing character.The film is rather moralistic--beginning and ending with a quote supposedly from Confucius about enlightened leaders producing a Utopian society and all that. In other words, good politicians can somehow make society overcome its baser nature (something Freud and many others would probably not agree with).As an illustration, you see the story of a gangster who is changing--giving up his evil ways. Yet, despite his new desire to do good, Black Mike is determined to destroy the man and his daughter. So, he tries to have the gangster framed for murdering a cop. Well, the plan isn't quite 100% perfect--the gangster is convicted of the crime he didn't commit but this enlightened legal system is fooled enough that he serves 8 months for being at the scene of the crime.Here is the odd part. Despite this minor conviction, the gangster's daughter goes off the deep end. She joins forces with Black Mike to commit a jewel robbery and is now a hardened woman--presumably because of her father's wrongful conviction. So, we are asked to believe that a short sentence in prison causes this daughter to switch from the side of niceness to evil so quickly--not a particularly believable idea. Had they done the transition more slowly it would have worked more convincingly for me. What also isn't so convincing is how easy it was later in the film for the now evil lady to be turned towards niceness one again. She sure did seem fickle!! All this leads to a huge confrontation with Black Mike and there is certainly a lot more to this story. But, these are all things you'll need to find out for yourself.Overall, while far from believable, the story is interesting and very well constructed for 1920. For lovers of silents, I'd give this film an 8. For the average shmoe, I'd score it a 6. Well worth watching--but just don't expect magic when it comes to seeing Ah Wing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Silky" Moll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Priscilla Dean was Universal's top female star of 1920 and was very much part of the Lon Chaney/Tod Browning team. She made nine features with Tod Browning as director, who knew how to showcase her unique personality, usually with her playing adventuresses and even thieves."Silent" Maddern (Ralph Lewis) and his daughter "Silky" Moll (Dean) are two shady characters slowly being reformed by wise Chang Lo but when Maddern is framed by Black Mike (Lon Chaney), "Silky" turns from the teachings of Lo and back to her lawless ways - just what Black Mike had hoped for. He plans to get her involved in a jewel robbery and double cross her but he hasn't counted on love - the love that "Dapper" Bill (Wheeler Oakman, Dean's husband at the time) has for "Silky". He informs her of the plans but rather than pull out she convinces Bill to help her pull a double cross.Hiding out in "Knob Hill", Bill is going stir crazy and befriends the little boy down the hall where together they build a kite. The little boy (played by Stanley Goethals) brings about their redemption, well Bill's anyway as "Silky" finds the little boy very easy to resist!! The movie does get a bit bogged down in sentimentality (crying children, cute puppies) but fortunately Mike returns for some very realistic fight scenes at the close. Chaney was apparently given permission to play his part to the limit and his "Black Mike" character alternated between business like ruthlessness and uncontrollable violence best seen in the film's climatic gun battle, that escalated to fists and furniture. It was terribly realistic - even "Silky" Moll was in there throwing punches. She wasn't shy about drawing her gun either.Chaney further enhanced his reputation by playing Ah Wing, a kind hearted student of Chang Lo's Confucious philosophy - conveying all his emotions with the movement of his eyes. Priscilla Dean really needs to be rediscovered - she had such an expressive face. In the scene where she is hugging the little boy (yes, she finally yields) her eyes express the whole range of emotions from unbending toughness to a dawning of maternal affection, all in the same take. Also look for Anna May Wong in a small uncredited bit with a group of girls.Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outside the Law (1920) ** 1/2 (out of 4) After her gangster father is framed and sent to jail, a young woman (Priscilla Dean) decides to take revenge and start stealing herself. This goes against the wise advice of Ah Woo, an Oriental wiseman and Black Mike Sylva (Lon Chaney) a gangster who framed her father. This Tod Browning directed gangster/moral tale has a brilliant start and finish but the big problem is the center section when the girl is hiding out with a man who she eventually falls in love with. During this middle section Ah Woo isn't in the picture nor is Chaney's Black Mike or Ah Wing, a second character he plays in the film. The moral section of the middle half lasts way too long and just isn't very interesting. The shootout at the start and end of the film are highly entertaining and look terrific. Chaney is good as Black Mike, although he's a tad bit better in The Penalty made a few years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to go into the plot of this movie. I will just comment of the realism of the fight scenes, clever cutting allows both Chaney roles to be seen in rapid succession; the opportunity, as in "Ace of Hearts" to get a glimpse of 1920 fashions, decor and motor vehicles. It was interesting to see a wall-mounted light switch, as opposed to a pull-string on the lamp. Scenes in Wong Low's store also feature a ceiling; previously I had been led to believe that this was not done until, I think "The Magnificent Ambersons" (Orson Welles). Finally, it struck me that the actor, Wheeler Oakman, occasionally bore a resemblance to James Cagney both in his looks and mannerisms.Oakman had been in films since 1912, when Cagney was 13 years old.</fullReview>
