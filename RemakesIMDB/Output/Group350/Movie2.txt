		<shortDescription>Not that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why this is compared to the original. That film was no classic, and at least this one doesn't pull any punches. Indeed, the DVD version is R-rated and definitely not TV fare. Mila Kunis is so young in this that one wonders if it was made earlier than 1995. Anyhow, the story is ridiculous and pretty hackneyed, but William Katt and Monte Markham add credibility. It's always a pleasant surprise when James Karen shows up too. As a cheapie horror flick it delivers exactly what it promises and holds one's interest throughout. Making films like this made Roger Corman a legend, and his contribution to this particular film is probably what makes it work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Rip-off of Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The private investigator Maggie McNamara (Alexandra Paul) from Lyon Investigation is hired by the wealthy J.R. Randolph (Monte Markham) to find his niece that has disappeared with her boyfriend. Maggie seeks out the lonely environmentalist Paul Grogan (William Katt) to help her to look for the teenager. They head to an abandoned army facility and Maggie decides to drain the pools to see whether the body of the girl is there. They are assaulted by a woman with a crowbar but they subdue her. However she escapes and soon they learn that the woman is Dr. Leticia Baines (Darleen Carr), who is researching a hybrid species of piranha that is capable to survive in fresh and sea waters for military purpose. Further, Maggie has release the piranhas on the river and they are heading to the Lost River Lake Resort. Maggie and Paul inform the corrupt local Sheriff but Randolph tells him to lock them up since he does not want to jeopardize the party he has promoted to his resort."Piranha" is a B-movie with the same storyline of "Jaws". There are ridiculous scenes, like for example, Maggie tasting the water of an abandoned experimental pool. Or the heroine Maggie opens the drain valves without measuring the consequences and causing the death of several people. Or when Dr. Baines dies and Maggie and Paul say that they need to find someone with knowledge in piranhas. Or the instructors of the children camping that do not use the boats to rescue the children, walking on the water under attack of piranhas. It is funny to see Maggie driving the high-speed motor boat at full speed pulling Paul tied to a rope. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Piranha"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprisingly solid TV remake of the 1978 movie, with William Katt and Alexandra Paul investigating the disappearance of a teenage girl, only to discover genetically engineered piranhas swimming about in the local rivers, eating anyone they come across and heading for a kids summer camp. Like the original, most of the enjoyment comes from the cheap fish effects, and it's helped along by decent performances, an exciting score and some welcome black humour. What also works well is the unpredictability of the piranha's victims: I thought I could guess who'd get eaten and in what order, but more often than not I was wrong.It's cheesy fun and an improvement on the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A needless but okay remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this made for cable remake of the truly fun 1978 horror/comedy/sci-fi Opus of the same name, an private investigator named Maggie (ALEXANDRA PAUL), meets with a backwoods man named Paul (WILLIAM KATT), over the disappearance of a couple of kids that went missing around the area. Upon arriving at a small cabin, they accidentally unleash nasty killer Piranha from the pool near the cabin &amp; into the towns streams &amp; lakes. But these are no ordinary Piranha, these are a lethal band of (you guessed it) genetically engineered predators, that were developed during the second world war, but were not fully deployed when the war ended &amp; are able to live in all kinds of environments &amp; lakes. Soon Maggie &amp; Paul set out to stop the hundreds of Piranha that are now free &amp; are going about eating those unfortunate people that decide to go swimming in the lakes. Soon the fish make their way to a camp, that Paul's little daughter (an early role by MILA KUNIS) is attending &amp; an newly opened resort, where visitors soon find themselves under attack by the flesh hungry fiends, but can the Piranha be stopped? In the mid 90's B movie king ROGER CORMAN made a deal with cable TV to remake several of his best, well known classics, therefore out of all the films he remade (HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP, BUCKET OF BLOOD etc.) it comes as no surprise that PIRANHA (1978) would be one of them. Unfortunately his remake is nothing more than a flat, serious minded horror movie, with none of the wit &amp; humour that made the 78' version so memorable. The film is played straight, as if there was nothing funny about the original's silly premise &amp; that's a lot of what takes the fun away from the films cheesy story. Not surprisingly &amp; true to Roger's nature, a lot of this film is just footage lifted from the 78' version (mainly the fish attack scenes) &amp; there is no suspense or surprises as to the fate of some of the victims, because again the film is basically an almost shot for shot, word for word remake of the original. Which dampens any suspense there could have been as to the fate of these characters. Director SCOTT LEVY does okay behind the camera, but he fails to set up shock sequences, provide us with any kind of interesting characterization, messes up on the suspense sequences, &amp; does nothing new with the material besides a sex switch on some of the characters, with the crazed scientist played by Kevin McCarthy in the first, played by a woman, the mayor as played by BARBARA STEELE is here played by the always talented JAMES KAREN, the strict head counsellor played by PAUL BARTEL is played by a woman &amp; adds a dopey subplot about a commercial being shot at the camp that does nothing for the films plot &amp; goes nowhere. The films running time is brief, running at 80 minutes &amp; downplays many plot elements of the original &amp; characters like the scientist, Paul's daughter are merely brushed aside &amp; the fun character played by DICK MILLER in the original (as the owner of the newly opened resort), is nowhere near as fun or interesting here. There's a couple chuckles to be had, but mostly the film just chugs along from one moment to the next without any emotional involvement in the characters or situations. Not all that bad &amp; better than what passes as most genre fare, &amp; much better than the flat &amp; boring PIRANHA 2, directed by James Cameron, but it's nowhere near as good as the 78' version. Still while it fails to match up to the first, we should all be thankful, that we at least wound up with a watchable remake of the 1978 film, since back in 1998, 20TH CENTURY FOX had announced a remake of it's own, for it's Family Film Division! thankfully that idea never came before the cameras! All in all, PIRANHA 95' as stated is a watchable film, which is something that cannot be said about a lot of the films Corman remade back in the 90's. But still with no humour, an interesting sci-fi subplot, suspense, scares or tension it leaves you wondering why they even bothered. Written by ALEX SIMON. Remade again (very loosely) in 2010 as the far superior PIRANHA 3D. PROLOX TRIVIA:JOE DANTE was asked to make a cameo appearance in the film, but he turned it down. *** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrific, and very fun update, of the 1978 John Sayles-Joe Dante drive-in classic. This one has it all: gore, laughs, movie buff in-jokes, gorgeous babes, and some genuine suspense and scares. Well-directed and keeps just enough of the original script intact, while adding a lot of clever new writing, to make this a fun ride to grab from the video store. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a complete shamble's from start to finish i ahve seen some remakes &amp; thought yep ok not a patch on the orginal but they have tried something different, but this i know the original was made on a shoe string but it looks like titanic when compared to this mess, i wont go into the story as most people will be familiar with the original it dosent really detract from the original script aside from a few character changes however the most shocking thing about this film is that the producer's must have thought everyone who would watch this film would have there brain removed on the way in, the performance's where lousy actor's attempting to be tongue in cheek &amp; ironic dosent really cut it, a really bad music score as well which dosent live up to fantastic one by pino donnaggio, but the biggest crime of all is that they have used effects footage from the orginal with the orginal actor's ( like how are we gonna miss that) it's like having Jaws 2, 3 &amp; 4 &amp; just re using all the shark attack footage from the first filmPlease do yourself a favour Avoid at all cost's &amp; if u really need something to watch go back to the orginal as all this version does is leave a very nasty taste in the mouth</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give it a break! It wasn't that bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to my fellow IMDb users, the film is a remake. But, since I have not seen the original, I cannot vouge for that. And they also say it uses stock footage from a number of other creature features. Again, I cannot say. But, if you think of it as a TV movie that was made some seven years ago, you cannot possibly expect a classic.PIRANHA, in my opinion, was not that bad. It was certainly better than some of the other crappy action adventure films with the same plot line. Examples: BLOOD SURF, BENEATH LOCH NESS, PYTHON (the worst movie of all time) and an endless number of others.You should all seriously give this movie a break. After all, it never wanted to be a classic. Just wanted to be there to give off some campy good fun...if only for a short while. PIRANHA gets 3/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, like "Frogs" (1972) is a great introductory horror film for children who are showing signs of liking horror movies.There's no real graphic violence here; no vulgar words spoken; no real nudity except that which amounts to not much more than what's seen at a good beach with hot women; and, little boys can have their little fantasies about Mila Kunis as a little girl, as I once did as a little boy about Kristy McNichol and Tatum O'Neal; and, Kim Richards.With today's standards, this is the kind of "STARTER" movie that little kids watch before they grow into 'REAL HORROR' movies like...what we 'adults' all watch and love today.It's not a bad movie, it's just 'soft-core' horror for children; and, for adults who just can't hack the way the world really works.I'd like to thank pbrandon074 for his review, which is the reason I watched this movie.Again...It's not a bad flick; and, it's 'very realistic' in the way that the police and politicians act (don't act at all) without any care or concern for people they're paid to protect! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killer mutant piranha...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being old, this remake of the classic "Piranha" movie is actually not all that shabby. And I would say that it is actually better than the 2010 remake (aside from the effects in the 2010 version).The story doesn't get any easier to follow than it is presented in the movie. The government have been experimenting on piranha fish for insertion into Russia and the East. Yeah, seems plausible enough, right? Haha... Then the project was shut down, but the experiments continued. Now, years later, the piranha are accidentally released out into the nearby river. Wait, it gets better, this new strain of piranha can live in both salt and fresh water, as well as warm and cold water. And the piranha are hungry... There, story summarized."Piranha" actually manages to keep you entertained throughout the entire feature length, and you want to see what happens next.As for the cast in "Piranha", then there were some pretty good names, such as William Katt (playing Paul Grogan) and a very young Mila Kunis (playing Susie Grogan). There are some other familiar faces on the roster as well, and of course an always welcomed face on the screen, James Karen (playing the governor)."Piranha" is worth checking out if you like cheesy horror movies. If for nothing else, then watch it for the hilarious song that plays when the end credits are rolling over the screen; killer mutant piranha...Oh, and notice how the film makers used the same footage of the swimming piranha school over and over again, and sometimes would just zoom in, but still use the same shot. That was wonderful. And also, take notice of the eagle-like cry the piranha emits when they attack, that had me laughing out loud. Priceless entertainment right there.You should check out this 1995 version of "Piranha" if you have watched the original or the 2010 remake. Trust me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pirahna" is a rather fun and enjoyable, if familiar creature feature.**SPOILERS**After an unexplained disappearance, Maggie McNamara, (Alexandra Paul) is hired by real estate developer J.R. Randolph, (Monte Markham) to find his niece. Taking her case up to recluse Paul Grogan, (William Katt) in the mountains, her story eventually takes them up to a closed secret military base in the mountains which they find contains a large pool as well as evidence of their previous appearance there. Despite warnings from Dr. Leticia Baines, (Darleen Carr) they drain the pool to conduct their search, only to find out that it was teeming with a school of ravenous, genetically-engineered piranha created during the Cold War to destroy enemies but have since been put aside for study. As the creatures lead a path of destruction up the lake, they realize that they're heading for a kids' camp and a newly-opening resort, they try to stop them before they're all devoured.The Good News: This here is a really enjoyable and entertaining film. One of the best aspects in this is that this one flies by with it's pacing. It's barely beginning when the investigation starts, barely fifteen minutes have gone by when they're released out into the open, and it's only a short time after that where the fish are starting their trail of destruction. It has a really superb pace which has a lot of possibilities for it to really ratchet up the action, and by making it fly by so quickly, it's able to do that with flying colors. That is also due to the placing of the action scenes in here to keep the film rolling along, which is mainly the violent and gory attacks. There's several really great ones in here, including one in a small pond that takes out a couple as well as the conclusion, which leads to a rather suspenseful sequence where there ravenously attack the boat to get at a bleeding victim which leads to a rather fun and bloody ending. The sequence with the battle at the camp, which scores more points for having the audacity to have it include children in the attack. This is helped along even more with the attacks coming in as very brutal and bloody. There's innumerable who are bitten around the legs and back, resulting in many bite marks and giant swarms of bloodied water, one is bitten on both legs, stripped of flesh from feet up to the knees as well one that has plenty of bite marks around the back, chest, shoulder, stomach and arms, with much more biting to come from this one. It's bloody and gory enough, and works for the style. The piranhas are really well-designed and come off as appropriate predators, making for some really nice moments with them. It's also really fun and enjoyably cheesy at times, just the way it should be. From the manner of escaping the cell to the creatures and the overly fun, at times creepy opening, this one works for it's cheesy air. All of these here really work for the film.The Bad News: This one here doesn't have a whole lot of flaws to it. One of the main things with the film is how similar it is to the original. As a remake, this one uses the storyline to the exactness of the original, and it uses them almost in the exact same position as the first one. To see the exact same scene repeated in the exact same manner with the exact same shot placing is something that this one utilizes for it's majority of the time, could give this one the impression of being completely unneeded at times. To have a film already do this one before calls the integrity of this one into question, as it's nearly a shot-for-shot version which is something that could be completely taken against this one. This one also has a hard time trying to justify the ending here, where the pollution angle that made the original work here feels completely out-of-place and stuck there mainly for the purpose of having an ending. Other than these, the film doesn't have that many flaws at all.The Final Verdict: With only the fact that it's an almost-exact duplicate of the original makes this one feel really fun and entertaining when those are put aside. If those feelings can be done, then this one here should be given a fair shot, but unless that can't be done, then it's better off to just ignore this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Nudity, children in danger and Language</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely humorless dud compared to the 1978 original version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often I give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre. A movie can be BAD in that it isn't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour, bizarre characters, etc. A case in point are a great number of horror/sci-fiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era. They are enjoyable for genre-buffs and guilty-pleasure seekers because their "badness" is entertaining. However, this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the "Piranha" (1978) original. I suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on TV was at a minimum. Now in the mid-2000s with the C.S.I. shows, TV's an absolute blood-fest! (Good for us horror fans!)William Katt and Alexandra Paul are no Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the original 1978 stars.) It's not Katt's and Paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey. How the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. I won't say how because that is part of the plot. This TV movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror, as can be seen from the user votes here. Stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a good movie. I saw it on youtube last year. A doctor has been experimenting on piranhas and has made them virtually unstoppable. his assistants, Maggie and Paul, accidentally release the fish into the River and Lake threatening to destroy everyone in their path. They tried to stop them before they opened the dam. The people would not listen and opened it. They need to stop them before they eat anyone. they released pollution in to the lake and it killed most of them. I liked this movie. A different movie i liked was frogs [1972]. This movie is also on youtube. Frogs 1972 is a great horror movie for young children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Third entry in the popular "Piranha" Film Series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success and popularity with the release of "Piranha" in 1978 by Joe Dante and it's first Sequel "Piranha Part Two: The Spawning, Flying Killers" in 1981 by James Cameron, this Third (but definitely - not final) part in the Series was only natural. Marketed in some areas as a 're-imagining' (that's a posh expression used by Hollywood to discourage people from calling it a re-make) of the original film, this really does pay homage to the 1978 classic.So much so that the filmmaker's thought it would be wise to use footage from the original Movie for certain scenes in this one, thinking no-one would notice. Well we did, at least I did anyway. Using footage from "Piranha" 1978 was a bad move. It makes the film look cheap and I was surprised that they did not use the original gnawing noise the toothy killers were heard making in the first two films. Think of the exact same footage of the Boeing 747 used in all of the "Turbulence" Movies.But back to this film, released over here (Ireland) on DVD under the title "Piranhas", it slyly references the first two films at certain points, but make sure you are listening and do not miss these in-jokes. Upclose shots of the Piranha in the penultimate sequence of the film show, what looks like hand-puppets with no jaw movement, terrible fake yellow and black eyes that do not even blink at us and the fish change size throughout attack scenes.With a decent cast that has Alexandra Paul (TV's "Paper Dolls") and William Katt (TV's "The Greatest American Hero") in the leading roles, plus Soleil Moon Frye (TV's "Friends") and a very young Mila Kunis ("Get Over It"), this 1995 film is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not an advocate of Remakes, but I do recognize a good one! This is not a good one.Why would anyone bother to remake a movie if they do not intend to improve on the original? Or at least alter it slightly as to merit an "Update"?This version of Piranha is cheaper and nastier than the original.... The Original knew it was Cheap and Nasty and played upon it.... but this movie takes itself seriously. The little 'fishy' effects are worse then the original and the plot itself is identical. This is basically a frame by frame remake... why?It was made for TV and one has to question why they bothered to invest money into this when they could have easily screened a re-run of Joe Dante's original classic! I am sure more people would have stayed tuned for that one. It was obviously a clever little parody of Jaws... this is a tired and lonesome stinker!I give it 1 out of 10 For having the guts to be made at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although many will disagree with me here, I have to say that I enjoyed this film and actually prefer it to the original. The original is too old for me to appreciate it and even though this movie is made for TV it is still preety good and is well acted and directed. The plot is slightly different in this one but i like it. The script is exactly the same but does have some extra decent one-liners and funny parts, especially with that idiotic director who fancies that girl 20 years younger than him! That had me laughing for ages! William Katt was very good in this movie and is in a lot of other movies i've seen him in. He deserves to be in much better, well-known movies than this one. Also good is the guy who plays Randolph (the bad guy in the movie.) The music is preety good as well. Although it ends a bit weirdly and there isun't much development between the two main characters as there was in the original this is still good entertainment for a Saturday night in. So go check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a TERRIBLE reputation... but, frankly, I've seen far worse, and, lately! (I know, hardly high praise-- heehee.) I was mainly interested because it featured 2 of my favorites-- William Katt &amp; Alexandra Paul (SIGH!), plus, with Monte Markham as the slimy corporate developer baddie, it wound up with no less than 3 PERRY MASON alumni (I can't believe that was a coincidence). Katt played Paul Drake Jr. in the first 8 Raymond Burr TV-movies in the 80s, Paul was in the first 2 movies after he left (along with William R. Moses-- I was always surprised that she didn't stick around longer), and Markham starred in the ill-advised revival in the early 70s.All I can say is... it HELD my attention, and I managed to plow through it with fewer breaks than a LOT of Corman-produced films. (It was funny how they actually made reference to several of his 70s films in the dialogue, including one of the "women in prison" films.)</fullReview>

It?s almost the same movie as the original, and nothing has improved since, in fact, this has to be one of the most unnecessary remakes in the long history of unnecessary remakes. As for the special effects, almost every single shot is lifted from the original which makes this hard to defend for even the most jaded fan.

The sound which accompanies those shots is great too.One last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope he gets another day in the sun; watching him as "The Greatest American Hero" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and he hasn't been very visible since. He seemed kind of depressed in this movie. Somebody give him a fun job on a good show, or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two interesting facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. One of the camp counselors is played by a grown up Soleil Moon-Frye, who played Punky Brewster on the early 80's US sitcom.2. The scene with the scuba divers was lifted in it's entirety from the original version of the movie. Strangely, the picture quality is better here than in any time I've ever seen the original on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ehhh...why???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure this may have been intended to be a fresh "update" of the original 1978 film, but gad, it turned out to be almost a scene-by-scene copy of the original. I think I counted exactly two sequences that varied from the original, although truthfully after a while I wasn't paying close attention, I already knew nothing interesting was going to happen.William Katt and Alexandra Paul don't have the same chemistry as Heather Menzies and Bradford Dillman did, although neither one of them is especially bad. In fact, overall the film is competent. But what makes it bad is that is winds up being incredibly dull and utterly pointless. Definitely a case where you should watch the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen in my life! The acting is laughable and Corman has not improved his piranhas any since 1978. 90% of the special effects are lifted from Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). It makes Piranha II: The Spawning look like it belongs on the American Film Institute List.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake ? A Re-Film Surely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thgis is supposedly a remake of the 1978 film PIRANHA directed by Joe Dante and written by John Sayles but right from the opening scene you're aware of how similar it is to the original movie . There's a pre-title sequence of two horny teenagers breaking in to a facility and getting consumed by a school of piranhas that ends with a light in the darkened tacitly being turned on just like in the original . Did I use the word " similar " ? My mistake the word I meant to use was " identical " . And so it continues . Not only does the film use the identical structure of the 1978 film it reproduces nearly every scene word for word and scene for scene almost to the point of sharing the same camera angles There are a couple of very small modifications . One is the role reversal of characters who were male in the original whilst here they are female characters . In fact the one original scene is inserted featuring a female character and a wannbe film director is inserted in to the narrative and the fall out of having one of the characters die is quickly forgotten about . Wouldn't this be a major plot turn and lead to a warning that the lake is infested with deadly fish ? This film has a very low average rating and some of the commentators feel it deserves a higher mark . Perhaps it does but that would be down to it basking in the glory of the original film and perhaps I would have been better copying and pasting my review of the 1978 movie . Same difference</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Nature Attacks Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Piranha (1995) ** 1/2 (out of 4)Remake of the 1978 cult classic by Joe Dante features pretty much the same story as we hit "nature strikes back" mode again. This time out a bad girl and her dorky boyfriend go missing so a detective (Alexandra Paul) goes looking for them. With the help of a mountain man (William Katt) they learn that the government has made some man-eating piranhas and sure enough they've let them loose in a popular lake. Whereas the original film was tongue in cheek in terms of its black humor and violence, this one here plays it rather straight, which is a minor problem. I'm not sure if the production team here, which included Roger Corman, just decided to not try touching the original but a little humor here would have helped things. Without the humor we're left with a pretty standard, made-for-TV horror movie that ups the violence and gore. Outside some stock footage from the original movie, the attacks here are pretty good especially one scene towards the end when our hero is trying to save the day when a group of fish attack him. The rather violent bites will certainly make your squirm and this is preceded by some other nice attacks including one poor soul who leaves his feet in the water a tad bit too long. Katt and Paul deliver fine performances and are strong enough to carry the film. The supporting cast doesn't get much done, although the James Karen (THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD) was nice. Fans of the original really aren't going to find this film topping it in any way but fans of the nature attacks genre will want to check it out as harmless fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first Piranha remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Piranha starts late one night as two teenagers Barbara (Lorissa McComas) &amp; Dave (Richard Israel) break into a disused army research facility, they decide to go swimming in a pool but are attacked by something inside it... Barabra's uncle J.R. Randolph (Monte Markham) hires private detective Maggie McNamara (Alexandra Paul) to find his missing niece, the trail takes Maggie to the area where Barbara was last seen &amp; speaks to local recluse Paul Grogan (William Katt) who mentions the nearby army facility. Maggie convinces Paul to take her out there where they find personal items belonging to Barbara &amp; Dave by the side of the pool, fearing they may have drown they drain the pool &amp; find skeletal remains at the bottom. Genetic scientist Dr. Leticia Baines (Darleen Carr) tells them that they just released a new breed of Piranha that she created into the local water system, the river runs down towards a newly opened holiday resort &amp; the Piranha are headed straight for it eating anything living in their way...Directed by Scott Levy this made for cable television was the first attempt to remake the modestly effective Jaws (1975) rip-off Piranha (1978) which as gained a fairly strong cult following over the years as one of the better rip-offs out there, more recently Piranha was remade as a big budget 3D Hollywood release so that makes at least three versions of what is essentially the same film &amp; one has to say that the '95 version is by far the worst. To be honest it's not even close. This Piranha is an almost scene for scene remake of the original that adds absolutely nothing to the mix, at least the recent 3d remake tried to change things about a bit rather than just rigidly stick to the original. Sure a few things are slightly different, the genetic scientist is now a woman rather than a man &amp; the camp counsellor is now a woman rather than a man but generally speaking the two films are almost identical in terms of plot. This version lacks the humour &amp; knowing self awareness that the original '78 Piranha had going for it, this is fairly dull going with little inspiration, creativity or gore to keep one watching. The back &amp; forth one liners between Maggie &amp; Paul are alright &amp; there's a certain chemistry there but otherwise Piranha is populated by boring forgettable character's. At only 80 minutes in length at least it doesn't go for too long &amp; has a decent pace but it's not very exciting &amp; is pretty predictable even if you haven't seen the original &amp; if you have seen the original then this will hold no surprises.Despite being made nearly twenty years after the original Piranha actually uses special effects shots from the original &amp; has virtually no new Piranha scenes at all, the same shot of the Piranha swimming through the river is seen again &amp; again as they make this strange high pitched squeaking noise. There's a bit of gore, there's a guy with the flesh ripped from his lower legs, there's a severed arm, people are seen with various bites, there are some shots of blood stained water &amp; a bit of a Dog but nothing too nasty. There's a couple of instances of female nudity as well. The attack scenes are poor, most just consist of people splashing around on top of the water &amp; if you feel something bite you wouldn't you instantly take your foot or hand or whatever out of the water as a natural reaction? I mean that guy sitting at the end of the pier has Piranha attack his legs but he just sits there rather than take them out of the water, does that make any sense to anyone?Probably shot on a low budget this has reasonable production values in a cheap made for television way. The acting isn't too bad, Alexandra Paul &amp; William Katt give better performances than the film deserves.Piranha is one of two remakes or the original piranha &amp; is easily the worst despite what anyone else says, it's a routine &amp; dull rehash that adds nothing &amp; even resorts to stealing the shots of the Piranha from the original such was the impoverished budget. Check out Piranha 3D (2010) instead, it's much much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Low budgeted, but botched remake of the original 1978 camp classic is played straight this time with no humor. Even though it is an almost scene for scene remake, it comes nowhere near the original. Dull performances, cheap effects, slow pace and routine direction bring it down. Rated R; Graphic Violence and Nudity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of '95 "Piranha" back-to-back with Joe Dante's '78 original. I did the same last week with "The Omen". Curiously enough, watching the remake right after the '76 original, really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasons.But this approach sort of backfired on the '95 Piranha version. It enhanced the fact that it really is a lesser picture. Basically, the '95 version is more or less the exact same film, as it tells the same story and follows it practically scene-by-scene (only Barabara Steele's character and the military intervention were written out of it). But the cinematography wasn't as good. The acting was worse too. Especially Alexandra Paul (playing Heather Menzies' character) showed me again what a horrible actress she is. Bradford Dillman (from the '78 version) had his Charlton Heston way of acting going, which was amusing, while in the '95 version William Katt does a good job at being William Katt. So I didn't mind him, really. But the whole cast is pretty much inferior and the only worthwhile event was spotting James Karen ("Return of the Living Dead", parts 1 &amp; 2) in a cameo. John Carl Buechler's make-up effects aren't as neat as Rob Bottin's. The musical score had some ring to it, but Pino Donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original. So all these shortcomings really shone through with having just re-watched the original as part of this double bill.Since Scott P. Levy's remake does follow Dante's original, I guess it is entertaining enough to sit through, though it's lacking the wit Dante's original had. But what really made me not like Levy's version very much, is the fact that quite a bit of stock footage from the first film was re-used during the piranha attack scenes. I never like it when filmmakers do this (and I'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons). I mean, if you don't have the budget (or imagination) to come up with newly shot material, then for Pete's sake, don't do a frickin' remake. But Roger Corman produced this (cheaper) remake, so I guess I shouldn't be all that surprised about the re-use of footage.If you do decide to watch "Piranha", then make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original. You might enjoy this remake a little more then. And oh yes, that cool little stop-motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film, as to be expected. But what's worse, there also isn't any female nudity in this one (the original really had quite some titty-shots going for it, and that blonde girl from the opening-scene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit down too far when removing her jeans!). Figures, as this '95 version was made for TV.</fullReview>
