		<shortDescription>Not just a cult film, but a cult film with all the right moves!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a dark, foggy night, two back-packers ignore the "no trespassing" sign, to engage themselves in a rest after a long while of mountain-climbing. They discover a pond, and instantly feel obliged to cool off. Before they can manage to enjoy this nice break, the most horrid feeling comes over them, and both become victims of a savage death, resulting in blood, only blood. Such an opening is familiar, yes, but also attention-getting, and enjoyable. This is "Piranha", the 1978 camp-classic horror film from acclaimed director Joe Dante and the production of Roger Corman. Given, the production values are some what less than "Jaws" and "Close Encounters.." but the heart and joy of film-making is also there, and thusly, the film is much more enjoyable than most Hollywood film of that era. The film is scripted by a then, young John Sayles, whom also makes a cameo! The two leads, Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies are perfect, and chemistry is dead-on making for a very fun time indeed! The writing is, perhaps, the best part of the film, seeing as Corman obviously wanted a real cultish feel, and as such, the film has so many noticeable , fun, and convenient in-jokes such as a swimmer reading acclaimed novel 'Moby Dick', and lazy workers watching old cartoons involving fish. The thrills are pretty good too, seeing as the situation involves genetically enhanced knowledge within the fish. Therefor, it is much harder for Dillman and Menzies as they attempt to over power the deadly fish while chasing them down stream a beautiful Texas river. Dillman and Menzies lead a cast of familiar faces seen in earlier Corman films such as Paul Bartel, Dick Miller, and Barbara Steele. The piranha themselves don't look too bad, and thusly, the effects are pretty good for a low budget film such as this. Other goodies are one-liners, and other dialogs that are so witty, they will either make you howl, or are just plain great to hear over and over again. Yes, this film has all the right moves, as well as many other to boot! It is comic when needed, and when the element of serious conflict is present, so is the presence of serious characters. This film was remade in '95, with the most wretched cast and concept ever! And the thought of another remake causes my blood to boil! You cannot re-create an original classic! That is what makes it original! In any case, this film is a great classic, and an always enjoyable film, every time viewed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie bites....in a good way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of "Jaws" came countless man vs. nature flicks with everything from bees to grizzly bears to frogs coming out to get man back for his crimes against the ecology (and don't forget "Night of the Lepus" in which huge bunny rabbits munched on hapless victims!) This film is considered one of the best imitators, primarily because of its tongue-in-cheek approach and it's deliberately campy writing and casting. Menzies is a hotshot missing persons expert who goes in search of two young hikers who have disappeared. She enlists the aid of hermit-like Dillman who lives near an abandoned government testing facility where the hikers were last suspected to have been. When they come upon a murky tank and believe the bodies could be at the bottom, Menzies releases the contents, unwittingly unleashing a school of vicious, genetically-altered piranha onto an unsuspecting river full of camp kids and park revelers. From there, it's a race against the clock to get to Dillman's young daughter who is about to enter a camp relay race in the water downstream. The film is deliberately peppered with actors who've made their mark in either horror or suspense films and it makes no pretenses about its lack of originality (though it does manage to come up with some despite itself!) Dillman (sporting an atrocious come-and-go Southern accent) and Menzies have a surprisingly decent rapport with each other with a few amusing scenes tossed in amongst all the panic. McCarthy pops up as a terrified scientist who knows his plans have gone awry. Wynn has a cameo as a gruff, but likable neighbor of Dillman's. Steele plays an ominous scientist in cahoots with Army colonel Gordon to keep the whole situation under wraps. Bartel is the persnickety camp counselor and Miller is the smarmy amusement park owner, both of whom disbelieve that there's any danger. Despite it's minuscule budget and rather homemade effects, the film does generate a bit of eye-opening gore and more than a little discomfort as these tiny fish nibble away at anything in the water. If "Jaws" caused people to avoid the ocean, this film could make people think twice about cloudy rivers and lakes! The murkiness of the water only adds to the horror of it all as the bikini-clad tourists and innertube-wielding kids can't begin to see what's coming. It's just a sting, then a nibble, then blood everywhere! Some of the effects are tacky and amusing, but there's a certain level of true fear as well. If one likes this genre to begin with, it will probably be a pleasure to watch. Others may be less enthralled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Jaws-inspired flick swimming around out there!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Debut film of B horror director Joe Dante is this fun, exciting Jaws spoof that's the best of its kind! A school of deadly, mutant piranha is released from a government laboratory and it's up to an alcoholic man and his detective love-interest to warn folks down stream!A fast-paced, campy, and humorous ride all the way, Piranha is a genuinely entertaining B film that recalls not only Jaws but many of the classic monster flicks of the 50's. The screenplay by John Sayles has lots of good suspense and a witty kind of humor. Dante's direction is nicely done, keeping the energetic mood of the film high. The special FX aren't half bad, especially considering the limited budget. In fact the movie packs some truly gory images. Pino Donaggio's music score is beautifully well done.Stars Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies are quite good, making for some amusing and unlikely heroes. The supporting cast is good as well and has a number of veteran actors - Kevin McCarthy, Keenan Wynn, Dick Miller, and Barbara Steele.Over all, Piranha is a good old-fashioned horror delight for genre fans. See it!**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1978 Roger Corman produced picture Piranha was about?well, piranha. Killer fish escape a government research lab and kill hapless vacationers, fishermen, and scientists. The film could have been real hokey if not for writer John Sayles and director Joe Dante. The two of them would become very successful in Hollywood with the release of The Howling. The cast is full of familiar faces such as Kevin McCarthy, Paul Bartel, Dante regulars Robert Picardo and Dick Miller, and Barbra Steele. The effects are cheesy but that's part of the fun. I believe that they made the best movie about menacing fish that they could. It has just the right mix of comedy and terror and it's entertaining. The Jaws video game was a nice touch too."They're eating the guests, sir."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws parody with enjoyable moments and plenty of gruesome carnage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many movie-makers do parodies better than Joe Dante ? the director who brought us The Howling (a werewolf movie parody), Gremlins (a monster movie parody), Innerspace (a Fantastic Voyage parody), The 'Burbs (a neighbours-from-hell parody) and Piranha (a Jaws parody). This 1978 comedy-horror is one of Dante's early movies, but despite that he shows an assured touch and gets generously tongue-in-cheek performances from his cast of horror veterans. While the film is never a truly great rival to the awesome Jaws, it is a fun and entertaining homage that has much going for it. Easily the strong point of this film is the gruesome make-up provided by whiz-kid Rob Bottin, but more will be said of that later.A couple of teenagers go missing while trekking through the woods. Private eye Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) goes searching for them, and discovers a burnt-out hermit Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) living on the mountainside who offers to help her in her hunt. McKeown and Grogan stumble upon a secluded military research centre where crazed scientist Dr. Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) is busily conducting experiments to create a strain of piranha fish able to survive in rivers and oceans, and always eager to devour anything in their way. The plan is to release these super-fish in enemy rivers, thereby making the entire river system too dangerous to use. McKeown and Grogan mistakenly release the piranhas into the local river, and realise that anyone using the river for recreation ? including the bustling summer camp miles downstream ? are now in desperate danger. The army is brought in, but instead of helping to solve the terrifying situation they seem more concerned with covering up the whole business. In particular, General Waxman (Bruce Gordon) has cause to keep the existence of the piranha secret, as he has invested his savings in the summer camp and doesn't want to scare away his paying customers. In a race against time, Grogan and McKeown try to release poison into the river to prevent the piranhas from devouring everyone in sight and proceeding to the ocean?..Piranha is fast-moving, gory fun. It's nice to see Dillman in a heroic leading role after so many years of playing the supporting bad guy in numerous films. Menzies is fine as his partner-in-adventure, and there are great supporting roles for horror legends like Barbara Steele (as a military scientist), Dick Miller (as a cowboy entertainer) and Keenan Wynn (as Grogan's doomed buddy who lives at the riverside). As I said earlier, Rob Bottin provides some bloody make up effects that make some of the half-eaten victims look pretty yucky. The gently mocking script is by John Sayles, and is full of humorous references to earlier books and films along the same theme. The finale in which the holiday-makers fall foul of the piranha fish is packed with blood and guts, and should definitely appeal to gore-hounds. Even though the film keeps its tongue in its cheek, there are still some dumb moments along the way that mar credibility even on this level. For instance, Grogan spends much of the closing scenes underwater being attacked by the piranha?. earlier in the film we were made to believe that the piranha devoured their victims in literally a few seconds, but they seem to make ludicrously hard work of attacking Grogan while he's in the water (in fact, he surfaces after several minutes in the firing line with just a few bites, which seems somewhat fortuitous!!) Piranha is enjoyable, though, and should be well received by genre addicts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining "Jaws" rip-off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even in the late 70's studios were trying to cash in on the "Jaws" phenomenon and to this date they are still doing it. This is a Roger Corman produced film and he never saw a genre that he didn't exploit. Story is about an insurance investigator named Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) who is trying to locate two lost campers and she runs into an alcoholic hermit in the woods named Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) and she persuades him to give her a ride to a supposedly closed military facility. They look around and Maggie finds the campers gear certifying that they were there. They start to drain the pool to see if they drowned and they're attacked by a man who says not to let the water drain. They knock him unconscious and take him back to Paul's cabin. They tie him up and with the use of a raft they head downstream to the authorities. While on the raft they find out that his name is Dr. Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) and he has been working for the government undercover and has developed a mutant species of piranha and that they let them out of the pool and into the river! The military comes in and they try to keep Maggie and Paul quiet but they escape and try to stop the piranha from heading downriver and into the ocean. The piranha chew up several people and even little kids swimming at camp. A local businessman named Buck Gardner (Dick Miller) is opening a resort on the river and even though he knows about the piranha he doesn't delay the grand opening. This was the directorial debut of Joe Dante and even though this was made on a shoestring budget his talent is very evident. Yes, the film is silly but the special effects are not that bad and the script was written by John Sayles. The only flaw (For me that is) is that Dillman and Menzies spend way to much time on that raft. The film does slow down a notch but luckily it's not for that long. There is one truly scary scene and it's where the piranha attack the little kids at camp. The kids really get chomped on and the scene where a pretty counselor is killed is very effective and well made. The opening scene in the film is a direct "Jaws" rip-off where the two campers go swimming at night and are eaten. Menzies is then seen playing a "Jaws" video game. Like all Corman films this has many recognizable faces in the cast like Keenan Wynn, Barbara Steele, Paul Bartel, Belinda Balaski, Richard Deacon and Sayles himself plays the Army guard that is fooled when Dillman and Menzies escape. Definitely a film that you don't take seriously but this is pretty well made and a must for fans of Corman and horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corman classic rip-off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Piranha is a film more self-aware than most of the post-Scream crap to come out of Hollywood. The film knows it follows a formula. In an early scene, we meet the protagonist Maggie playing a Jaws arcade game -- acknowledging the film it shamelessly rips off. It knows it packs a clichés punch with its characters as well as showing off that trademark Roger Corman cost-saving devices. It knows it carries an obligatory anti-war message as a product of the 1970s. And Piranha brings with it an appropriate sense of humor towards its material.So watching the film, I found myself despising the formula it follows; however, I couldn't help but appreciate how the film never takes itself too seriously. Good thing too, because the other protagonist, Paul, represents one of my greatest character pet peeves -- the self-serving social reject SoB who gets talked into tagging along who eventually evolves into something sympathetic. I can barely stomach that character type in this goofy ride, I don't think I could endure another character like that in a straight movie. Thank you Joe Dante.Most films will toss out a painfully contrived excuse to get the adventurous Maggie and the hermit-wanna-be Paul to run through the plot together even though no amount of logic or reason could possibly yield that result, but not Piranha. Oh no. It doesn't even bother with an excuse, it just defies logic and common sense to put the two together and doesn't ask questions. Thank you John Sayles.Of course, I still hated Paul, but that's okay. With any luck he'll wind up Piranha bait.Keenan Wynn plays a colorful old man who lives out in the same neck of the woods as the Paul character, and he confirms the viewer's suspicion that Piranha opts for less realistic characters in favor of silly caricatures. This prepares the viewer for the big balding camp activities administrator, Earl, who encourages little kids to overcome their fears by essentially calling them sissies for having said fears. Also the evil Colonel Waxman who is evil solely because he represents the US Government around the same era in history as the Vietnam War. And let's not forget the cocky highway patrol trooper who informs the main characters, "Don't try nothing 'cause I got my gun right here in my left hand." What I find most amusing about Piranha is the fact that the "good guys" (Maggie and Paul) are the two characters most deserving of a crucifixion over the events in the film. These characters waltz into an abandoned Government test facility and start pushing buttons without asking any questions, or even attempting to go through the right channels, or find out anything about this once top-secret and highly classified test facility. They metaphorically walk into a antique shop blindfolded while swinging a baseball bat, and it's the store owner's fault for leaving stuff out. But they said they're "reawwy, reawwy, sowwy, and it'll nevah happen again." Is it any wonder that no one believes their word about the river that bypasses the dam? I mean, most sane people hesitate to take directions from a guy who just ran full speed face first into a brick a wall.Piranha's story, in essence, describes two characters who screw up, and spend the rest of the film trying to fix it while the narratives desperately tries to lay blame on its villain of the day. In a straight horror flick, this would no doubt irritate me; however, in this caricature jamboree of clichés ? it feels right. Especially with Dick Miller playing the "corrupt" businessman and owner of the aquatic park, and Barbara Steele playing a scientist associated with the project that generated the killer piranha -- both characters in league with the evil Colonel Waxman, thus villains by default. And, honestly, you can't go wrong with Keenan Wynn, Dick Miller, and Barbara Steele in a film like this.What about the stars of this film? The piranha's themselves? There's a certain charm to the hyperactive fish going into epileptic convulsions while their teeth shred away at human flesh and, of course, the foggy silhouettes that stiffly pass by the camera like glorified cardboard cutouts. In other words: fun low budget creature effects whose flaws only enhance the viewing experience.Unfortunately, the mayhem the Piranhas cause generally falls short to the point of, dare I say, boredom. The fish begin to bite, and the scene degenerates into a mass of extras kicking, screaming, splashing, intercut with convulsing piranhas feasting. The chaos in frame drags on with no arc, no climaxes, barely any visible progress. At best, every now and again, Joe Dante offers hints of a mass exodus from the water at such a casual pace that it's difficult to believe these people's lives are at stake.Having said that, I must confess that I respect and appreciate one of the climaxes where Joe Dante not only places a child's summer camp in danger, but also follows through by having the piranha actually attack the kids. An apparent Hollywood taboo despite the fact we're talking fiction -- where's the suspense of children in danger when the viewer knows a mainstream studio won't dare go there? Sad that this parody has more balls than some of its serious horror film brethren.That self-awareness and sense of humor separates Piranha from the pack, and saves it from the same bashing that other creature features would receive. However, it does not grant Piranha total immunity. While littered with flaws, Piranha is not afraid to acknowledge what it is, it's not afraid to go against Hollywood taboos, and it's not afraid to mock itself. And hey, you get a dose of Roger Corman, Joe Dante, Mark Goldblatt, Dick Miller, Keenan Wynn, and Barbara Steele all in the same package. If that's not worth the price of a rental, some popcorn, and a few laughs, I dunno what is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie rocks! One of the very best B movies of the 70's. OK I did see this movie on TV when I was a small child and yes I was scared for very good reasons. It wasn't safe to swim in the ocean and now rivers weren't safe. What next pools? This horror classic is fun to watch with friends just for laughs. OK you can see the strings on the piranhas, and yes the fins don't move? It is a little unbelievable. Or is it??? Unfortunately this movie is a hard to find which I find very disappointing. I would love to carry this title on DVD and purchase this as a great gag gifts for a few of my friends whom also love classic B movies! I myself highly recommend this movie especially if you enjoy B movies such as Day of the Animals, SSSSSS, and Alligator. I promise you a good time? Just beware of fresh water!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drive-in, b-movie fun at it's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, it's more fun to see a popcorn movie at the movies than one that's meant to be taken seriously. Not that I'm knocking more serious and socially relevant films, far from it, but the experience of watching a really fun movie with a crowd is like no other. B grade movies sure can be a lot of fun, including those that are obviously trying to cash in on really successful films. 'Jaws' terrified moviegoers and made a killing at the Box Office. Three years later came the first of three sequels, but this was also the year to see the release of one of if not the most popular of the 'Jaws' rip-offs.Pros: Great cast, fun performances. Nice country scenery. Several good and bloody attack scenes. Moves at a good steady pace. Some suspense. Made with an obvious affection for these type of films. Made with tongue planted firmly in cheek. Nice job on the gore effects. An exciting and gory finale.Cons: Pretty dated. Some weak spots in the writing. The low budget really shows and keeps the film from reaching the potential of the concept.Final thoughts: I can imagine this must have been a ton of fun to watch at the drive-in. Still is a treat to watch on the small screen though. Instead of being a b-movie made by people out to make a quick buck, this one was made with heart and by people who cared about their craft. One of the best of it's kind and of the time.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I always enjoy a river horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like horror movies that happen along or in rivers. Not that there are many "Shock Waves" and "Empire of the Ants" are the only two that come to mind right now. I do not know why, something about the scenery maybe? This movie is of course about piranha released in a river by two people who should not have been messing around a facility. Of course, if they did what they were supposed to do then there would be no movie. This movie was obviously trying to capitalize on the success of "Jaws", but for me it worked. The piranha are slowly making their way down the river and along the way they run into some kids at camp and this resort place. No one believes that they are coming, but that is the way it is in these movies. A sequel would come later and it would be directed by a then unknown James Cameron and it would be awful and a bit boring. Another piranha movie would be made by Roger Corman in the 90's, but it is essentially the same movie as this only not as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a terrible film, but didn't execute itself properly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the films that are released on video that try to ride the coat tales of other popular entries in film, people forget that early on there really was only one man who did that. That man was Roger Corman, a producer who worked at creating cheap films that entertained viewers no matter what the material. Then there's Joe Dante, a director who hasn't worked with many theatrical released films, but the ones he has made have faithful followings. Dante is another filmmaker that enjoys taking ideas from popular films and turning it on its head. The thing is, Dante at least does it with a non-subtlety attitude and style. Seriously, looking at the poster alone tells you that Dante and Corman were borrowing the concept from Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975).For the most part, the film is watchable but there are various elements that don't work. One of those elements is John Sayles' writing. It works well at building tension in how the story plays out, but the dialog and back-story to why the piranhas are in a local resort feel flimsy. Turns out, a school of piranhas were genetically enhanced to help win the Vietnam war. So in other words radio activity is the problem. It's understood that this comes from a time where it was prevalent but now it no longer is plausible. Using radioactivity as a plot device for a sea creature is no longer usable. It has been exploited since the early 50s era films. Not many of the actors that take part feel like they are that of something new either.Bradford Dillman as a divorced drunk father of one daughter is possibly the most interesting of the bunch. And this guy was the only one to ask to have his character have more depth. So you can imagine what the rest of the characters are like. Next is Heather Menzies-Urich who plays a missing persons detective, who also looks to find the truth behind the piranha epidemic. She also becomes Dillman's love interest - without little explanation. Okayyyy,...see what I mean on character depth? Some of the dialog is silly to hear at times too. Unfortunately, these things are big parts to the film that weigh it down because they are essential to telling a good story. Thankfully, there are a enough good parts to help make it somewhat enjoyable. For example, Dick Miller has a role. And who doesn't like Dick Miller?For one, the practical effects are quite convincing to say the least. Phil Tippett's ability to make the piranhas themselves, the gore and blood look authentic is important. I mean, even if the cast isn't the most convincing, the plot device should at least. I do question one scene however. There's a scene where stop motion animation is used and it looked great but it never served a purpose. What was the point? Kudos to using the technique but thumbs down for not giving it meaning. Jaime Anderson's cinematography is good specifically for the underwater scenes. Surely that wasn't the easiest thing to do. The editing by Joe Dante and Mark Goldblatt was competently done too. Specifically for keeping the illusion of the Piranhas looking like actual fish and not puppets. Lastly, Pino Donaggio's music was OK. It wasn't great but at least had a theme specifically for the piranhas. That at least is recognizable. It's watchable but not all that exciting at times.It has good practical effects and a borrowed concept from Jaws (1975) that only can be considered flattering. However, its story and majority of its characters aren't all that different from other characters in other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give "Piranha" a fairly high rating not because it's a great movie (like "Jaws") but because of its high entertainment value -- it's just a FUN ride!The film was recorded along a river near San Marcos in the heart of Texas (Northeast of San Antonio). It's highlighted by numerous peripheral cuties with the alluring Belinda Balaski (from "The Howling") and Melody Thomas Scott (from "The Young and the Restless") featured in fairly prominent roles."Piranha" is widely (and inexplicably) available at a very low price and is well worth it.

		<shortDescription>The ideal B movie, perfect for the right audience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Piranha is the best example I have seen of precisely how to do a rip off. It may sound like an oxymoron to call a rip off impressive, but this is what accurately describes Piranha. Today, we have the Asylum, a direct-to-DVD company which gives us so-called "mockbusters" that completely lack the heart and fun of a film like this. Instead, those are merely dull "just-going-through-the-motions-to-make-a-small-amount-of-money" displays of ineptitude.There are several things to strongly commend this movie for, like the fact that the lead characters are likable so that you care what happens to them (unlike in some horror films), the way it is very self-aware and has small tributes to Jaws, the campy sound effect of the school of fish, the excessive amounts of blood that is shown in a comic manner, and how it is genuinely comedic and yet not a pure spoof in the way that films like Scary Movie are. Basically, the film comes just close enough to Jaws to be an obvious attempt to cash in on its success, and yet also stays just far away enough from Jaws that one isn't bored by a repetition of the same story all over again.I also feel that this film did something well that I don't typically see in creature feature films. And that is that it maintained a good balance between the screen time that the piranha attacks had, and that the background story about the people and the origin of the problem had. I say "piranha attacks" because admittedly, the fish themselves are hardly shown close-up at all, but it didn't really feel as if I was missing anything by not seeing very much of their fins. Usually, the scenes involving the creature itself are short as well as far and few in between, while I am bored with all the meaningless dialog (a good example of this is "Demon of Paradise" where I was thinking "When do I get to see the monster?"). But in this movie I did not have that disappointment. As a matter of fact, the scenes where the human characters are talking actually interested me and had me curious what would happen next. It is very rare for me to enjoy these types of scenes.See this movie if you like B movies, by all means. However, if you aren't a fan of that type of cinema, Piranha probably won't convert you. We all have different tastes. I know people who simply don't enjoy a schlocky low budget B movie, even if it's great at being what it is. As for me though, I'll take this little exploitation film over Jaws, because it's just more fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>School of scientifically bred piranha are inadvertently released from their holding tank into the pristine waterways of a Texan community, causing headaches for locals, a kid's summer camp, and the inauguration of a new aqua marine resort. Chronically inebriated recluse Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) and audacious city skip tracer Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) searching for a missing pair of hikers attempt to warn those in the path, with little success.Scary, suspenseful and extremely witty little shocker with great visual effects, an eclectic cast, memorable score by Pino Donaggio and a superior screenplay courtesy of John Sayles. "Piranha" is an entertaining romp, suitably spiced up with glimpses of nudity, some cheeky humour and enough graphic horror to keep the gore groupies well satisfied. Sensational cast, ably guided by director Joe Dante and his Roger Corman-inspired New World Pictures crew, create a film with terrific momentum and enough polish to elevate it beyond exploitation status. Notable are New World regulars Paul Bartel as an over-zealous summer camp instructor, and Belinda Balaski as the ill-fated camp counsellor Betsy. Dick Miller also has a scene-stealing supporting role that warrants close attention.Naturally, there's an open ending prompting speculation of a sequel, which didn't take long to surface - 1981 - though it bares virtually no relation to this movie (which considering the standard of the successor, isn't a bad distance to enjoy). Aside from the witty dialogue (e.g. Miller to Nelson: "what about the goddam piranhas?!", "they're eating the guests sir") and frequent thrills, there's some depth to the characterisations, and the production values look far more impressive than the apparent budget would have you suspect. Overall, this is a triumph for the post-"Jaws" imitation market, sophisticated enough in its own right to be considered an independent product, and remade not once, but twice in 1995 (as a TV movie) and 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piranhas: Great effort from Joe Dante</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Joe Dantes work, even going so far as to buy every movie has directed. There's something about his style, especially the mixture of humor and lighthearted horror elements that always seemed to resonate well with me. Piranhas is a movie I had on my watch-list for quite some time but I was never able to find a copy of it with a good quality. By total accident I found the special edition Blu-Ray Edition of Piranhas. I was exhilarated and bought it immediately.So, how well does Dantes second feature film hold up after all these years? Surprisingly well! This has all the good stuff in it that you'd expect from a Roger Corman production. Blood, boobs, humor, fake looking special effects, its all there, but its all done with a lot of passion! I watched some bonus material of how the piranhas were made and discovered that Phil Tippet (now an Oscar winner for his work on movies like Star Wars) actually made the pesky little fish rats. I gotta say, after watching the bonus stuff, I had even more respect for the movie, for the sheer fact alone of how much work went into it. No wonder they all involved to Hollywood legends, these people are creative forces! Now, with all that said, its still amateur film-making. So don't expect next level Kubrick. The acting is at parts really good, especially from Bradford Dillman, and at parts really cringe worthy, just like it should be. The story is rather simple and I wont bother going into details, its just entertaining schlock with some great moments. I was surprised how serious it actually took itself. There were quiet some funny scenes but for the most part, its actually pretty dark. All in all, this movie really impressed me. I was entertained for the entirety of the film and there never seemed to be a dull moment. The underwater scenes still look great and the gore effect don't disappoint. Give it a try!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually better than I thought it would be. Apparently, the normal piranha is not as dangerous as its reputation, but here we have a kind of mutant variety. Two young people are eaten right away and set the stage for more and more fish delicacies down the road. The fear is keeping these things confined to a limited area and out of the ocean where they could create a gigantic imbalance ecologically, not to mention these things running rampant (swimming rampant?). This is one of the movies that rode on the back of the popularity of "Jaws." It does have some good suspense and some terrifying scenes, but it is another gratuitous gorefest. Perhaps a bit of communication by the military might have helped prevent the carnage. Anyway, it's worth a watch for those who get into the right spirit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mutant strain of vicious carnivorous piranha get lose in a Texas river. It's up to boozy, grumpy, and reclusive backwoodsman Paul Grogan (a fine and engaging performance by Bradford Dillman) and plucky go-getter skip tracer Maggie McKeown (a winningly spunky portrayal by Heather Menzies) to stop the finny flesh-eating fiends before it's too late. Director Joe Dante, working from a sharp and witty script by John Sayles (who also has a cameo as an army sentry), relates the fun story at a nonstop brisk pace, adroitly builds a substantial amount of tension, stages the piranha attack set pieces with real rip-roaring aplomb, delivers a handy helping of graphic bloodshed, and tops the whole thing off with a wickedly amusing sense of blithely self-aware and self-mocking sardonic humor (McKeown plays a "Jaws" video game, a bikini-clad babe reads "Moby Dick" on the beach, plus there a few appropriate clips from wacky cartoons and vintage 50's golden oldie vintage creature features playing on various TV screens). The first-rate cast of familiar low-budget exploitation cult cinema faces rates as another major asset: Kevin McCarthy as obsessive scientist Dr. Robert Hoak, Dick Miller as sleazy, greedy, penny-pinching resort owner Buck Gardner, 60's Italian Gothic horror goddess Barbara Steele as the aloof, sinister Dr. Mengers, Paul Bartel as prissy and obnoxious summercamp owner Dumont, Keenan Wynn as amiable old-timer Jack, Bruce Gordon as the stern Colonel Waxman, and Richard Deacon as Maggie's no-nonsense boss Earl Lyon. Barry Brown appears in his last theatrical film role as a state trooper. Better still, this movie even offers some spot-on stinging social commentary: the military create the piranha for use in the Vietnam war, but prove to be totally all-thumbs when it comes destroying them, Buck Gardner cares more about making money than he does about the safety of his guest (he's warned ahead of time about the piranha), and, in a terrific bit of irony, it's ultimately up to the local down-on-his-luck drunk that everyone treats with complete contempt and disrespect to save the day. Moreover, Dante certainly doesn't punk out on the horror: a gaggle of innocent little kids and merry tourists are eaten and killed while Belinda Balaski's lovable camp counselor Betsy meets an unforgettably haunting and startling untimely end. Pino Donaggio supplies a perfectly stirring and spirited shivery score. Jamie Anderson's sunny cinematography gives the picture an attractive sparkling look. The special effects are a tad rough around the edges, but overall effective and acceptable. An absolute delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I always enjoy this Jaws rip-off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where would we be without the venerable Roger Corman? Lovers of B-movie madness would likely have a lot more time on their hands to read books, interact with family, or take part in generally otherwise fulfilling life experiences had old Rog chosen a different career path. Fortunately, or unfortunately as the case may be, Corman sat out in Hollywood for three or four decades making low budget exploitation films. He also tried to cash in on every movie fad in modern cinema. And I do mean EVERY fad. You see, Roger had a dream to take an idea and make a profitable picture out of it that would entertain the masses. The problem was that someone else invariably had the idea first. Thus Lucas's "Star Wars" allowed Corman to unleash "Battle Beyond the Stars" on an unsuspecting public. Car chase movies saw Roger replying with "Grand Theft Auto" and "Eat My Dust." I could go on and on. There wasn't anything Corman couldn't do with someone else's idea. Perhaps the best example is "Piranha," a 1978 ripoff of Spielberg's "Jaws." This film made our man a lot of money, which allowed him to make even more spectacular ripoffs for years to come.The flick starts with a couple of kids breaking into some sort of rundown fish hatchery for an evening swim. Something in the water kills them. End of movie. Seriously, something rather nasty does do away with the two idiots. We then see an insurance investigator by the name of Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies on loan from Julie Andrews) heading out to discover what happened to these two dolts. She rather quickly hooks up with an embittered alcoholic with a penchant for flannel named Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman channeling Grizzly Adams) who lives in a cabin down by the river. Somehow or other Maggie convinces Paul to head over to the fish hatchery with her. Sure enough they discover that something sinister has been going on there under the aegis of Dr. Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy). How do we know this? Because there's lots of nasty looking scientific stuff lying around all over the place. Anyway, Hoak eventually lets our two heroes in on a little secret: the government paid him a bunch of money to create a breed of piranha as part of some weapons program. Personally, I'm for anything that keeps communists out of our swimming pools, lakes, and rivers.While all this nonsense goes on we know the piranha have escaped from the hatchery (thanks Maggie and Paul!) and are preparing a full-scale assault on the human race. A few locals fall prey first, but the real threat is the summer camp and an aquatic park downriver. Just to ratchet up the emotional element of the film a bit, we also learn that Paul's daughter is currently attending the camp. Oh dear! It's a race against time as Paul and Maggie set out with the twitchy Dr. Hoak in tow to stop the madness. As for the folks at the camp and the park, they haven't a clue as to what's about to happen. The only concern at the camp is the fascistic machinations of Mr. Dumont (Paul Bartel), a guy who takes great joy in ordering kids into the water and snooping on the foxy female counselors. At the water park, the owner plans on making a bundle on opening day and couldn't care less if a battleship full of exposed nuclear waste sailed into harbor. You can pretty much guess what happens in the last part of the film. Screaming, blood in the water, and a lot of out of shape Americans in unflattering bathing suits thrashing around on the beach in agonies. Fun! I don't know whether to laugh or cry with this one, folks. The swarms of piranha zipping through the water look so like the pieces of plastic they are that it's tough not to snicker. It's even worse when we see them up close chattering away on an exposed leg or belly. We're definitely looking at cheesefest central on a buck and a half budget here. At the same time, I did find a lot to like about the film. Seeing veteran horror actress Barbara Steele popping up from time to time as a government scientist named Dr. Mengers was a nice surprise, although she's largely wasted in the role. Kevin McCarthy plays frazzled well, and the script requires him to morph into a sniveling wimp for most of his screen time. Heck, we even see Richard Deacon (Mel from "The Dick Van Dyke Show") in a small role as Maggie's boss. Can't beat that. The talent behind the camera is moderately impressive too considering the budget. Joe Dante directed this flick, and John Sayles wrote the script. Both men went on to greater success, Dante with "Gremlins" and Sayles with "Eight Men Out," "The Howling," and several other mainstream movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie to get your teeth into</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that annoys me about many I.M.D.B. reviews are the number of people who think it clever to insult a movie by calling it 'low budget'. The inference is that all low budget movies are somehow terrible. I beg to differ. Some of my all-time favourites have been made on shoestring budgets, and 'Piranha' is one.Produced by Roger Corman's New World pictures, 'Piranha' was a cheeky attempt to cash-in on the 'Jaws' phenomenon. It begins with a pair of hikers - a young man and a woman - breaking into a deserted army camp and taking a midnight dip in a pool. They don't know it but said pool is full of piranha. The couple are devoured in minutes flat. Maggie McKeown ( Heather Menzies ) comes looking for them, and teams up with a local man named Paul Grogan ( Bradford Dillman ), who is drowning memories of his acrimonious divorce with the aid of alcohol. They drain the pool and find a pair of skeletons. A wild-eyed man ( Kevin MacCarthy ) comes rushing out, yelling: "You've let them out!". Indeed they have. The army had developed a mutation - piranha fish capable of thriving in non-tropical climates, intended for use in the Vietnam war. Now they are out, and headed towards a nearby holiday resort, where they will find plenty to get their teeth into...Directed by Joe Dante ( later to make the 'The Howling' and the Gremlins' movies ), 'Piranha' is tremendous fun, boasting a wicked sense of humour and some not bad special effects ( including a stop motion piranha that seems to be able to breathe air and which nobody notices ) and make up. John Sayles later wrote the 'Star Wars' rip-off 'Battle Beyond The Stars' for Corman and became an acclaimed director. Dillman and Menzies make an appealing couple. The former has played villains in just about every television series you care to name, while the latter was 'Jessica' in the short-lived sci-fi drama 'Logan's Run'. When this went on release, much excitement was generated by the sight of Menzies topless ( although I have since learnt it was a body double ). One of the cast, the late Paul Bartel, had directed a cult classic of his own - 'Death Race 2000' ( 1975 ) starring David Carradine.Dante is a fan of old movies and 'Piranha' has loads of references to these. The casting of Kevin McCarthy is itself a homage, as he was warning of impending disaster in another classic flick -'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers'. Barbara Steele, who plays 'Dr.Mengers', is a cult horror movie star who amongst other things was in Corman's 'The Pit &amp; The Pendulum' and Cronenberg's 'Shivers'.'Piranha' ends with Grogan polluting the little swines to death. So now you know. If you fancy an outdoor swim, but are fearful of piranha fish, take along some industrial waste with you.A sequel was made three years later - 'Piranha 2: The Spawning'. It was directed by one James Cameron. Wonder what happened to him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 5/9/2005 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Joe Dante): Cheap b-movie retread of Jaws despite having the talents of Joe Dante as director and John Sayles as writer. This Roger Corman produced cheap flick mimics the storyline of Jaws in many different areas except we get to see bloodthirsty piranha's eating flesh in a variety of ways, including chomping on little children and bare breasts of teenage girls among other body parts that the non-discerning piranha partake of. As long as there's meet on them bones they go for it. Poor acting doesn't help this movie at all because the best lines aren't delivered well. Small parts by Kevin McCarthy and Keenan Wynn are the best but they're both eaten early in the film and we're left with cardboard characters to finish the film. Why this film deserved a 20th anniversary special edition DVD I'll never know. The best part about the DVD is the condition of the film itself and the packaging and etc..., but this doesn't make up for a lame movie made in 1978 and still a lame movie in 1998.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two people stumble across a facility and accidentally release piranhas into a river that leads to a summer resort. Now it's up to them to convince people of the danger coming down the river.This is a great b-grade rip-off, right off the back of Jaws success. Though it has a touch of comedy added in it, basically making it a sort of spoof/thriller. A notable sharp script filled with a lot wit and excellent performances from the leads and amusing parts from the supporting cast make this great entertainment. The piranha designs look alright and at times when it shows them moving all together it looks like cardboard with painted fish on it, but the key is that they aren't clearly shown as a group and the film doesn't just centre on the piranhas. The music score is reasonably potent, just like that of Jaws- but it's definitely not in the same league. The sound of the attack is a sharp high-pitch bubbling sound given when they're about to attack.The cinematography is stunning enough, both in and out of the water and not forgetting the ravishing scenery along the river. The atmosphere is just brilliant, with the suspense and tension to match that of Jaws. Though what director Joe Dante (Gremlins 1 &amp; 2, The Howling and The 'burbs) does better than that of Spielberg, is that he never let's the pace and story get bogged down. The whole concept of the piranha story is outlandishly over-the-top, but because of the superb laid-back performances and the ingenious screenplay, you forget the plot and just enjoy the ride. It's pretty hilarious watching people getting nibbled at first, but when you get further into the movie it becomes more effective and a little disturbing when you see a whole a lot of children getting eaten (especially when there not that annoying) and that's before they even reach the resort. There's one striking scene that's incredibly haunting because the image is perfectly laid out. Bradford Dillman brings a lot depth and humour to his character Paul Grogan and Heather Menzies brings a charming and out-going temperament to her character Maggie McKeown. The supporting roles, Kevin McCarthy is unforgettable as the crazy doctor Dr. Robert Hoak who created and labored the piranhas, Dick Millar fits perfectly as the greedy Resort owner Buck Gardner and Barbara Steele as Dr. Mengers, Dr Hoaks ex-work mate and now working for the army.Just another very good film produced by b-grades finest Roger Corman.4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bimbo and drunk team up to save innocent people from killer piranha ! Sounds like a grade Z movie of the worst sort and maybe it is but PIRANHA is nothing less than grade A entertainment . Pride of place goes to John Sayle`s knowing script which telegraphs the coming carnage with a scene featuring Dumont ( Played brilliantly by Paul Bartel ) a sort of fascist summer camp commander : " People eat fish. Fish do not eat people " Hey I think that line might be leading somewhere . And the dialogue throughout is just as camp but that`s what makes it a joy . DRUNK : " Distract the guard " BIMBO : " What if he`s gay ? " DRUNK : " Then I`ll distract him " And who can forget the all time classic line " It`s the piranha sir . They`re eating the guests " Joe Dante doesn`t take the script seriously either and films it as a tongue in cheek homage to JAWS. Everytime someone takes a dip we`re treated to a fish eye view of the potential victim where you expect the John Williams theme of Du Dum Du Dum Dum Dum Dum Dum to appear on the soundtrack . And never in the history of cinema have so many film goers laughed at so many people getting eaten alive. Please don`t write into the IMDB goof department to point out the revealing mistake of the woman screaming at the badly eaten rubber corpse. That`s delibarate on the part of Dante I`m sureWithout doubt the most enjoyable JAWS spin off ever made</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cretinous early "effort" by Dante.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Makes "Barracuda" look like a Hollywood classic. This pathetic little film wants to have the cake and eat it, too. Sayles and Dante put some "humour" to make it look like a spoof of "Jaws", but at the same time hoped to make the movie exciting. They never even got close to the cake; the film is neither funny nor exciting. From what I know, a spoof is supposed to be funny and make us laugh at its target. The jokes bomb 99% of the time, and instead of laughing at "Jaws" I wished I was watching it instead of this garbage. As for the action, as far as I can recall an action film involves a little thing we call excitement. This garbage is about as exciting as a Bergman family drama. Dante's first film leaves absolutely no hints - zero - that he would proceed to later make some good films. His directing is unimaginative - spoof or not, a direct rip-off of the action sequences from "Jaws", only boring. The entire action sequence in which the little critters attack a group of children is so badly directed that the kids appear as though they are having a good time and not fighting for their lives! I cannot think of any other movie that left me so cold and unexcited at the prospect of a couple of kids getting massacred. I mean, if the viewer doesn't get emotionally involved about kids getting butchered by savage animals then there is something seriously wrong with the movie! Every single character acts like a border-line cretin.The piranhas attack the bad, bad military guy with ten times as much viciousness as they do the kids. Apparently the piranhas can differentiate between good and evil, and prefer evil flesh. They are meant to be intelligent, and understand enough about boats to know how to make them sink and thereby get to the boat's occupants quicker. Real piranhas are, of course, not that smart; they are just fish. However, even real piranhas are smarter than a John Sayles script. This Marxist, left-wing, wanna-be intellectual actually makes both the army AND the police the bad guys. The military is so "evil" that they actually do all that is in their power to prevent potential swimmers getting warned; to the extent that it almost appears as though they are doing everything they can to make sure the piranhas kill as many humans as possible! This isn't original. This isn't funny. This isn't quirky. It's imbecilic and annoying; an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Barbara Steele is a scientist working for the military who - for no explanation whatsoever - does all that she can to ensure that the piranhas continue their business of slaughter. Of course, the whole mutation fiasco was a military experiment to help them win wars, blablablabla. This pitiful film isn't a spoof of old B-movies. It IS a B-movie. John Sayles is an overrated mediocrity who thrives on his dubious and not very credible image as a "Hollywood outsider"; neither his writing nor his directing is remarkable - only his "hip" image is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Piranha (1978): Dir: Joe Dante / Cast: Bradford Dillman, Heather Menzies, Kevin McCarthy, Keenan Wynn, Dick Miller: While Jaws is an underwater thriller masterpiece. Director Joe Dante presents a miniature version that involves rows of razor sharp teeth. Piranhas are accidentally released and they swarm down river devouring anybody who falls into the water. Thankfully Dante allows for some interesting characters and humour. Bradford Dillman plays Paul Grogan who is perceived as a drunk, which complicates any attempt to warn authorities. Heather Menzies plays Maggie who arrives on the scene to find answers to the disappearance of two backpackers. Viewers are given the answers to this in the film's opening sequence. The chemistry between Dillman and Menzies holds strong due to humour interaction. Kevin McCarthy steals moments as a scientist who contained the piranhas for an experiment that was intended as a war weapon. McCarthy plays a character perceived as being out of his mind until he risks his life to save a boy stranded upon an overturned canoe. Other characters are not as well drawn but well cast with actors like Keenan Wynn and Dick Miller. The piranhas are amusing but a scene where children are mauled in the water is not so fun to watch. It is gruesome but somewhat fun in presenting a less imposing creature than in Jaws, and instead shrinking the viscous scale. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

What is scarier than one man-eating big fish, well a lot of flesh-eating little fish who can cause a lot more mayhem among people who like to have fun time in the water. Yes these fish are some really ugly pieces of nature being able to survive in cold and salt water which a normal piranha cannot live in. I actually liked the whole back story for why the fish were grown and turned into a mutated species by scientists. Fish as weapons in wars it could sure be effective as the victims did experience. I liked the combination of Heather Menzies as detective Maggie McKeown and Bradford Dillman as Paul Grogan who are eventually the ones saving the day. Kudos also to Shannon Collins as Paul's daughter Suzie. She played the role of fearful but eventually brave kid really well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Joe Dante is best known for his darkly humorous take on established genres (the monster movie in Gremlins, the werewolf film in The Howling), it is worth noting that his career almost came to a halt because his first proper picture - not counting B-movie assemblage The Movie Orgy - was a full-on spoof of Jaws, meaning Universal considered taking the matter to court. Luckily, Steven Spielberg saw the film and enjoyed it, subsequently lending Dante a producing hand on Gremlins and offering him the chance to direct a segment of the Twilight Zone movie. All that for good reasons: perfect it may not be, but Piranha is a lot of fun.Instead of the ocean, Piranha situates its action on the shores of a lake, where insurance investigator Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) is sent to find two missing teenagers (no prizes for guessing what happened to them). With the help of a local drunk (Bradford Dillman) she finds an abandoned compound, and through her encounter with a scientists Dr. Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) and Dr. Mengers (Barbara Steele), she uncovers the location's terrible secret: the military was engineering a particularly lethal strain of piranha to use in Vietnam (!), but the project was shut down. However, the fish are still there, and they have found their way to the lake...Being a Roger Corman production, Piranha was obviously made more on the cheap compared to Jaws, but it does boast a certain ambition, thanks to John Sayles' script, filled with anti-militaristic subtext, and Pino Donaggio's score, showcasing the knack for suspense he went on to develop with Brian De Palma. As for the visual and practical effects, they suffer the most from the low budget, which explains the wise decision to leave the piranha unseen most of the time, using (slightly campy) sound effects to produce thrills, although the cheap-looking creatures sort of fit the film's overall irreverent tone.As far as the acting is concerned, it embodies another Corman staple: not much to write home about, with cardboard characters played by relatively unknown actors, with the major exceptions of Dillman, who specifically asked to have his role properly developed, and Steele, evidently happy to help out another first-time director after her deranged performance in David Cronenberg's Shivers. That said, McKeown isn't too bad either, although most people are more likely to remember her for one specific scene that doesn't require that much acting talent.So yes, this is a pretty cheap knock-off of a much superior film, and even by Dante's standards the effort comes off as sub-par at times. But hey, everyone has to get started somewhere, and as a piece of unpretentious entertainment Piranha truly delivers. And unlike the sequel (forgive the pun), it has just enough bite.</fullReview>

Not only did it launch the career of a noteworthy director (as did its sequel) but it also spawned two separate remakes, with the latest being what looks like this summer's biggest guilty pleasure film. But before all that was the little film that could, an unlikely b-movie underdog that does its job surprisingly well. Because of this movie, you will believe that fish on sticks can be threatening.Before he would go on to become a big name in the horror genre in the 1980's, director Joe Dante ("The Howling," "Gremlins") let loose on this shoe-string budget b-flick. Although the film has little style, it gets by with a strong sense of humor and its oddball assortment of characters. Heather Menzies plays Maggie, a video game obsessed insurance investigator who is thrust into the arms of Bob Vila look-alike Paul (Bradford Dillman) -- a bitter drunk with a dry sense of humor -- when she sets to the wilderness in search of a missing couple. The two inadvertently stumble upon a military experiment, letting loose a school of blood-thirsty fish into the local lake where a delicious feast of fat tourists and innocent children awaits them.Although sorely dated, "Piranha" is not without its charm. A young Rob Bottin provides some surprisingly decent special effects and make-up, while Dante keeps the pace of the film moving effectively, especially in its ridiculous final act, which just so happens to feature an explosion so random it probably keeps Michael Bay up at night in fits of jealous rage. Seeking a silly yet solid horror spoof? You just can't go wrong taking a midnight swim with "Piranha".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puts the "ha" in piranha</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight I watched the classic cinematic experience "Piranha" which puts the ha in piranha. It moves at a pace that only be described as excruciating, while the movie itself defies adjective or simile. The acting is pure Juliard...Aeschylus invented theatre so that this kind of perfectly tuned drama could be played out. With quotes such as, "Hey you cool your jets young lady..." and "Terror, horror, death. Film at eleven." The fact that the "actors" were even able to deliver their lines without bursting into laughter or tears, is testament to their professionalism and dedication. The script itself is a hoot and no cliché is left unturned. It is never explained why the girl Suzie is at summer camp, when she lives on the other side of the water from her father. It is inexplicable like so many things in this gem. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gruesome, cheesy stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I may have seen this when I was in my teens, but taken it more seriously and freaked out by the flesh eating critters. 20yrs on, the film is less scary, more cheese filled but none the less an entertaining film.Jaws really was a moment in cinema making and Piranha is something of homage/spoof, yet despite it's obvious comparisons, it actually holds it's own. The film has some pretty cheesy moments, acting and special effects but at the same time, there are some great sequences full of tension and excitement, the water skiing scene and when the kids are in the water and are attacked are perfect examples. Not to mention poor old Betsy going down infront of poor little Suzie! Anyone but Betsy!Despite playing the spoof, there are some gross out moments as partially devoured bodies are shown and the cleverly edited sequences where the fish attack, pecking at their victims is actually quite unnerving. The blood count is quite high, when the boy and his father are attacked the blood in the water was really quite gruesome, that poor kid is going need some hell of a therapist! Despite it's low budget, it works really quite well and despite it's tongue in cheek persona, the film does manage to deliver, even if it's a picnic compared to today's horror films.Whitney: The piranhas...

		<shortDescription>A Saturday Afternoon Classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Piranha" on a local television station during a rainy Saturday afternoon when I was about 12 or 13 years old. At that point I hadn't seen many horror/creature films so this one really left an impression on me. I've seen it several times since and I rank this as a personal favorite in the annals of late '70s drive-in cheese. It's action packed, it has just the right amount of gore without going over the top, and with dependable B-Movie actors like Paul Bartel and Bradford Dillman never letting things get too serious, "Piranha" still holds up as a classic creature feature. Legend has it that Steven Spielberg hand-picked Joe Dante to direct "Gremlins" on the strength of "Piranha," which he called "The best Jaws rip-off I've ever seen," so that alone should be enough to recommend it. I hope the rumored 2006 remake (directed by Chuck Russell, who did a fine job remaking "The Blob" in the late '80s) doesn't screw up its legacy. Followed by the mostly-unrelated sequel "Piranha II: The Spawning," which is worth a look only for the masochistic among us</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat, cheesy "Jaws" spoof/rip-off has bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After accidentally releasing a large school of genetically altered species of piranha into a stream, the deadly fish find their way to children's summer camp and tourist resort. It's up to an insurance investigator (Heather Menzies) and a drunken recluse (Bradford Dillman) to prevent the hungry piranhas from chowing down on children and vacationers, with the help of a scientist (Kevin McCarthy) who has been breeding the piranhas in secret.Producer Roger Corman responds to the success of Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" with this spoof/rip-off (and makes no apologies about it). While "Jaws" was frightening, this film went for scares, campy humor, cheesiness and cheap special effects. Best viewed with a few beers. Corman should be commended for boosting the careers of director Joe Dante ("Gremlins", "Looney Tunes: Back in Action") and screenwriter John Sayles ("Lone Star"). Keenan Wynn, Dick Miller, and Barbara Steele also star. Followed by "Piranha II: The Spawning" and remade in 1995. My evaluation: *** out of ****.</fullReview>

Based on the fact that it is billed as a HORROR movie is the one and only reason I watched it. Released in 1978 , I just watched this flick in its entirety , uncut - this week.I totally feel like the producer and director on this went for a "I really LOVED Jaws and I wanna make a summer movie with terror in the water" feel. Oh , they have succeeded. Not totally terrorizing - but this movie has some good shock value. Special effects are pretty decent. Actors are pretty decent also.I also seen the making of this movie and that is just funny. But , once again , this is Horror and the 70s and I have a very hard time saying no to that.

		<shortDescription>The original "Jaws" ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film made me miss Roger Corman movies. Utterly absurd and action-packed, you can see the machinery start to creak heavily about halfway through, but there are enough clever moments and quirky acting bits (my favorite is Keenan Wynn, as the Babbling Codger) to make this a completely enjoyable ride. The genetically engineered piranha which are released into a mountain river and terrorize the waters (they're cross-bred with salmon, apparently, and intend to spawn downstream) are much more frightening when they are not seen, as in the creepy opening skinny-dipping "Jaws homage", so once you start actually seeing them dashing towards their victims the broad humor aspect of the movie is played up, thanks in large part to Paul Bartel as the Authoritarian Summer Camp Director, Bradford Dillman as the Grizzled Mountain Man, Kevin McCarthy as the Good Mad Scientist, and, of course, Barbara Steele as the Evil Mad Scientist, whose huge, shifty eyes are a punchline in and of themselves.The broad humor doesn't really sit well with a genuinely unpleasant attack on a bunching of swimming children or its bloody aftermath, and the following attack on a resort is anticlimactic (practically identical to the attack on the children), if in line with the film's politics (military experiment backlashes first against the nature lovers, then the children of the middle class, and finally the middle class itself, while the right-wing authoritarian and capitalist structure prevents the tragedy from being averted). But it's all done with palpable enthusiasm, and should certain push the right buttons in those of us who dread feeling our legs brush against foreign objects while underwater, especially when those foreign objects have little razor-sharp teeth and make whirring noises. Highlights include the scene where a piranha frenzy dismantles a raft and the climactic heroics from Dillman, whose character has supernatural lung capacity.</fullReview>

A lot have praised Dante for his inside jokes, but most of them (the jokes, not the people) aren't that clever. Some also have said "fast-paced", which I don't recall at all, as the fish aren't featured as often as I would've liked. The most memorable thing you take away from this is that "whooshing" sound the charging fishies make, which still gives me goose bumps all these years later.</fullReview>

I was just completely bored throughout the entire thing. The attacks are dull and lack suspense. There were no interesting characters, even though the actors seemed to be game.

Turns out it's not bad, and better than I expected.Starts very well - setting the scene, developing the plot and characters. There is a genuine feeling of intrigue and engagement. You keep thinking "How are they going to stop this?".From a point, however, it does degenerate into a B-grade creature feature, with action, body count and gore being the main drivers. It also feels like a bad ripoff of Jaws.However, for the most part it is reasonably enjoyable and worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all the "Jaws" ripoffs and parodies out there, Joe Dantes' "Piranha" stands tall as one of the best. It's a smart, funny, engaging picture in the best B movie tradition. There's no dull moments, and no filler, just a lot of good piranha action and a terrific cast that makes it tons of fun for film buffs.Marking the first solo directorial effort for Dante (after having co-helmed "Hollywood Boulevard" with Allan Arkush), it stars Bradford Dillman ("Bug") and Heather Menzies-Urich ("Sssssss") as Paul Grogan, a cranky loner / boozer and Maggie McKeown, a not terribly competent skip tracer who band together to find the objects of Maggies' latest search. When Maggie hastily drains a pond to determine its contents, she sets the plot in motion: the pond contained ravenous piranha that have been genetically engineered. So now the mission is to save as many of the people in the piranhas' path as possible.You know you're in for a good time with a cast also including Kevin McCarthy ("Invasion of the Body Snatchers" '56), Keenan Wynn ("Point Blank"), Barbara Steele ("Black Sunday"), Dick Miller ("A Bucket of Blood"), Belinda Balaski ("The Howling"), and Paul Bartel ("Eating Raoul"). Bartel is especially funny as a macho, hard driving camp director. The savvy screenplay (his first) is by John Sayles, who makes a great uncredited cameo appearance as an Army sentry. He balances the appeal of low budget genre pictures from decades past with an irresistible amount of campiness, some memorable lines, and a political subtext. The movie was a great starting off point for some movie veterans (such as producer Jon Davison and production manager Tom Jacobson), and combined the efforts of a couple of visual and makeup effects experts - Jon Berg, Robert Short, Chris Walas, Adam Beckett, Phil Tippett, Peter Kuran, Rob Bottin. Look for Bottins' own mangled head in a brief appearance. To complete the drive-in package, there's also some brief breast shots in the movie. And at the end, Pauls' method of solving the problem is amusing in its ecological incorrectness.This is one movie that deserves to be considered a cult classic.Followed by a sequel and two remakes (the first for cable TV), with the theatrical remake itself getting a sequel of its own.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

Washed-up lawyer Bradford Dillman and investigator Heather Menzies poke around an old army test site in search of a couple of missing kids and unwittingly unleash a shoal of genetically engineered piranha into the river, where they munch their way to a summer camp full of kids. It's a 'Jaws' thing.The first half of the movie is solid stuff, but later on the pace slackens and the tension dribbles away. Still, it's not bad. Dillman and Menzies are a lot of fun and the piranha effects are far and away the movie's highlight, not least the bizarre burbling sound they make when they attack.

But what it was good at and really do mean fantastic at was the suspense. You didn't know when the piranha were going to attack which I must admit did leave me on the edge of my seat. Which the remake didn't do as much. As I did watch the remake first the CGI in this was appalling but to be fair great in its time. I found the remake more enjoyable because the storyline was slightly stronger and gory level did rise magnificently but what do you expect from Alexandre Aja.

Acting is good, story is good, it's a good sci-fi movie classic that's still entertaining after 30 years.It's a classic that recent "Piranha 3D" (2010) is almost a verbatim copy of this story, substituting the government lab with a mesozoic excavation ground, and kids camp with college spring break.This is a quality movie with no cheese, and is recommended for viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic tongue-in-cheek carnage from Joe Dante. Yet another example of why the 1970s rule!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched 'The Howling' for the first time in years, and was surprised at how well it stands up, so I thought it was about time I watched Joe Dante's previous movie 'Piranha' again (he did some uncredited work on The Ramones classic 'Rock'N'Roll High School' in between). Dante was a long time horror movie buff who got his big break working for Roger Corman. Corman gets an Executive producer credit on 'Piranha' and it's scripted by John Sayles, who would later collaborate on 'The Howling'. 'Piranha' is basically a cheap, tongue in cheek cash-in on the success of 'Jaws', but for me it's ten times more entertaining. What I really admire about Dante is that he manages to juggle parody with genuine scares. This movie is full of in jokes but still delivers some real shocks. Dante may be continually winking at us, but what recent movie can you think of that features the mass slaughter of young children?! You just don't get movies like this anymore! Bradford Dillman ('Bug') a recluse, and Heather Menzies ('SSSSSSS') a perky investigator, accidentally unleash a group of mutant piranha into a river which flows down into a holiday resort. Kevin McCarthy, star of the original 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' plays the scientist who helped create them, and Corman legend Dick Miller is the blowhard in charge of the resort. Dante has used both actors regularly since. The supporting cast also includes cult favourite Barbara Steele ('Black Sunday', 'Shivers'), character actor Keenan Wynn ('Dr. Strangelove') and the late Paul Bartel, writer/director of 'Eating Raoul'. Bartel worked with Roger Corman quite a bit during this 1970s, directing 'Death Race 2000' and 'Cannonball' for him, both of which I recommend. 'Piranha' is great fun and I enjoyed every minute of it! Yet another example of why the 1970s rule!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Piranha is not unintentionally funny. It is supposed to be like that. Any film with so much flagrant misogyny, silly lines and completely gratuitous gore can't be otherwise. Full of recognisable faces (which you cannot name), Piranha tells the story of a group of mutant piranhas who have been released from an army base by a couple who have gone searching for two missing persons. Directed by Joe Dante who later went on to make the equally silly Small Soldiers has the b-movie art down to a tee. It's completely over the top, and the characters and story reflect the campy action. Frequently the characters perform actions, which make little sense what so ever and even more frequently resort to the worst clichés possible. The ending (if you can call it that) is inconclusive to say the least and the acting, is at best, hammy. But then that's the point. The only scene that misfires is the scene, towards the end of the movie where the piranhas attack the young children at the beach. The film up to that point was walking a thin line between comedy and nasty exploitation- and unfortunately crosses it at this aforementioned point. Very silly, very shallow and ultra-camp, this is b-movie cinema at its best. If you put your brain aside you will fall in love with this 1970s gem. Don't expect it to withstand repeated viewings, though. This is a b-movie after all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Corman's answer to "Jaws" is funny and scary at the same time. I like the concept of a bunch of little fish a bit more than one big fish because there's no where to swim as they pull you deeper into the water. This IS top-notch stuff, not to be missed!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AwfulProbably the worst B movie (TV Animal Planet) i saw last 12 month. Despite the fact that it maintains some suspense, the acting is miserable, and the story is full of nonsense. To mention some: 1. The Pool must have an outlet diameter of several inches to allow draining human skeletons 2. I couldn't understand why Mengers attacks with her pole and doesn't cry to stop the drainage proceedings. So many security devices and no filter grid on the outlet! 3. The rescue trial of Dr Mengers is useless, silly, and done just to kill the character. 4. Why, the hell, the army wishes salt water piranhas in enemy rivers? By the way, I know Amazonic piranhas, I'd fished several. They NEVER attack after sunset. 6. A working flooded circuit breaker on the dam! Oh, please! 7. What kind of poison was stored in the dam, for what, and why so selective, that nothing happens to Paul?My vote 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often mistaken for a parody, "Piranha" is actually a full-blooded (and extremely bloody) "Jaws" rip-off, with only a handful of humorous lines. While it can't even approach the level of "Jaws", it's a lot better than the three fairly terrible "Jaws" sequels, and provides decent entertainment...if you don't mind the heavy doses of blood</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice try, but...[POSSIBLE SPOILERS]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose if I were a genre buff, I might have liked PIRANHA better. As it is, I started out liking it OK, then over the course of the movie found myself liking it less and less, then actively disliking it more and more. By the end, I was really sorry I had shelled out ten bucks for the DVD. At this point, I don't even know if I'll bother to go back and check out the commentary track.Joe Dante is a reasonably talented director, John Sayles's screenplay mostly (*mostly*) avoids the aggressive stupidity of the average genre B-film, and most of the male actors are old pros (Paul Bartel is terrible; to be fair, I think that for some reason I don't understand, he's actually trying to be terrible). The women, of course, were hired for their looks, and they do fine on that basis.Still, it doesn't work, for several reasons:It doesn't come close to transcending the genre clichés. Gee, evil military men, shortsighted gummint scientists, stupid cops, greedy businessmen, and a pompous and annoying authority figure. Ho-hum. Look: if you do exactly what other movies do, in exactly the way they do it, your movie isn't transcending the clichés. It's clichéd.One exception to the above is that Bartel's annoying authority figure is not, as genre convention would dictate, a self-serving coward. Indeed, in one scene he is actually permitted to display considerable physical courage in saving other people's lives. So never let it be said I'm unwilling to give credit where credit is due.Worse, the piranhas kill in patently impossible ways. One character bleeds to death after the piranhas eat the foot which he dangles in the water. The next victim dies when the piranhas pull him out of a boat by his hand. The problem with all this is that when the victim felt the first nip, he would yank his hand or foot out of the water, and piranhas (even evil mutant warmongering gummint piranhas) are just not big enough to stop it. This isn't a matter of choice. If you've ever accidentally touched a hot stovetop burner, you'll know what I mean. Your hand jumps away from the burner by itself; no act of will is involved. It's pure reflex. It might be possible to *intentionally* place your hand on a burner and leave it there while it sears your flesh off your bones, but if you're not expecting the pain, you'll pull away.So we are forced to watch characters make *literally* superhuman efforts to let the piranhas eat them. It just looks stupid, no matter what the intentions of the filmmakers were. After this, it becomes impossible to take the film seriously on any level. If they wanted to do this kind of thing, they should have played it for laughs--on the other hand, given the level of the "comic relief" in this film (hey, Cletus, those pants hit that cop in the face, hyuk, hyuk), maybe that wouldn't have been such a good idea.[POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT]Then, the film's first big setpiece mass attack includes (toward the beginning) a piece of business so stupid that one laughs--derisively--just at the wrong moment. And it ends--in spite of the presence of at least a dozen people in the water--with only one fatality (because the rest of the potential piranha snacks were children, and the filmmakers didn't have the guts to waste a kid). In other words, these superfish can pull a grown man off a boat, but they can't manage to chomp a few small children who are already immersed in the water. What a world, what a world.Of course, in the climactic attack, the piranhas are able with very little trouble to pull full-grown adults off of air mattresses and innertubes, which makes their failure in the preceding attack look just a little bit silly.And of course there's the basic problem with 99% of horror flicks: horror isn't terror. I fail to understand how anyone can claim to be frightened by gouts of red liquid which they know isn't blood (you'd think this would be a source of embarrassment, rather than pride). In order to be truly frightening, a movie must present realistic and believable characters who we actually care about, and place them in danger. The body count isn't the point. JAWS is a perfect example of what I mean. Even the few minor victims (Chrissie Watkins, Alex Kintner, Ben Gardner and the unnamed guy in the rowboat [not to mention Pippet the dog]) are perfectly delineated in their brief appearances; they seem like real people. Their deaths serve to establish the shark's menace, so that when our three main characters (whom we have come to like and respect) go out on the *Orca*, we genuinely fear for their safety.Here, we have obviously fake people getting bitten by obviously fake piranhas and squirting out obviously fake blood. Ooh, how scary. Even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief enough to find it creepy and horrifying (I wasn't), it just isn't frightening.PIRANHA gets far more respect than it deserves.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg called PIRANHA his favorite of the numerous JAWS "rip offs" but it really deserves better than that label. Though clearly made in response to Spielberg's monumentally successful film, it has its own unique style and attitude and is really no more a rip-off than JAWS itself was a rip-off of the numerous 50s creature features that inspired it. I also wouldn't refer to it as a spoof or even a comedy. It's a horror movie first and foremost; one that just happens to have a good sense of humor. Released just months after the first JAWS sequel (itself a big hit), Universal strongly considered filing an injunction against producer Roger Corman and his company New World Pictures on the grounds this was an unauthorized spoof of their big money-maker. Supposedly, it was Spielberg himself (a fan of the film) who actually talked them out of it. As a result, PIRANHA became one of New World's biggest hits; grossing 16 million dollars worldwide (6 million in the U.S. alone) on a budget of just 660,000 dollars.A couple of young hikers stumble upon a remote, abandoned government facility late at night and decide to take a dip in what they believe to be a swimming pool, which turns out to actually be a large holding tank housing hundreds of flesh-eating fish. Needless to say, neither of the teens make it back home that night. Skip tracer Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) is hired to find them and travels to the small town of Indian Springs to start her investigation. The first man she happens to meet is Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman); a gruff, sarcastic, unshaven, divorced single dad who's been wasting away at a cabin in the woods and drowning his sorrows in booze. Maggie insists he take her to the military installation and he begrudgingly agrees. After finding evidence that the teens had indeed been there, Maggie drains the pool to make sure they didn't drown. Instead, she inadvertently unleashes a slew of vicious, scientifically-altered, rapidly-multiplying freshwater piranha into the river, which were part of an abandoned Vietnam era army experiment called "Operation Razorteeth." From then on, it's a race down the river to try to reach a dam before they're released into more heavily-populated areas.PIRANHA is about as close as you can come to being a perfectly realized B horror flick. There's sharp dialogue (courtesy of the talented John Sayles), action, laughs, blood, enjoyable characters and even some effectively suspenseful and horrific moments. Best of all is perhaps the truly excellent cast; many of whom were chosen specifically to appeal to fans of these kind of films and each bringing their own special spark to the proceedings. Kevin McCarthy gets to channel some of his INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS hysteria as Dr. Hoak, a straggler who's still doing experiments at the closed installation. There are other memorable roles for horror queen Barbara Steele as a sultry (and corrupt) "fish geneticist," Paul Bartel as a drill sergeant-like summer camp owner and Dick Miller as a Texas businessman whose new family lake resort becomes an an all-you-can-eat buffet because of his refusal to shut down. Dillman (an under-appreciated actor if there ever was one) and Menzies have good on-screen chemistry and make for very likable leads.In addition to the fine cast, there's a good score from Pino Donaggio (which has obvious echoes of his earlier CARRIE score), a clip from THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD (1957) on a TV set, in joke references to everything from CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON to "Moby Dick" and they even briefly throw in a great little stop-motion critter inspired by the Ymir in 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH (1957), which was designed and animated by Phil Tippett. The piranha effects themselves, while not great, are fairly effective because they were smart enough not to dwell on them for too long and utilize rapid editing, lots of water thrashing and gallons of blood in the attack scenes. Fx wizards like Rob Bottin, Chris Walas and Robert Short (all of whom went on to win Oscars) were just a few of the names to, uh, cut their teeth, on this one.The film's success prompted the sequel PIRANHA II: THE SPAWNING (1981) a few years later, which featured the novelty of flying killer piranha but is best remembered these days as the directorial debut of James Cameron (who was fired before the film's completion). PIRANHA was also remade in 1995 for cable TV (Corman also produced that version) and was then loosely remade a second time into a sleazy / gory trash-fest by director Alexandre Aja as PIRANHA 3D (2010), which itself was followed by a sequel: John Gulager's PIRANHA 3DD (2012). The original is easily the best of all of these, though Aja's film is also surprisingly fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genetically Modified Piranha</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When two young adults go missing "Maggie McKeown" (Heather Menzies-Urich) is hired to travel to Texas and find them. Not familiar to the rugged outdoors she comes across a cabin in the woods to inquire whether a man named "Paul Grogan" (Bradford Dillman) can help her. They soon hike up to a top secret Army station which appears to be deserted and find some gear which belonged to their missing couple. Concerned that they may have drown in a large pool Maggie decides to drain it. When she does she unknowingly releases genetically modified piranha into a nearby river on the same day as a couple of popular events which are scheduled for numerous people. To make matters even worse, once Maggie and Paul realize the danger they are frustrated at every turn by the government which underestimates the potential death these piranhas can inflict upon those using the river for recreation. Now, rather than disclosing the rest of the movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a fun movie which combined some nice humor with some pretty good horror. While it certainly didn't have the budget to duplicate the effect of a movie like "Jaws" it still managed to entertain and because of that I rate it as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As if great whites were not enough to keep us out of the water, now we got Piranhas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 70's, we had a series of great horror films: a little real life terror with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a little bit of Hellish terror with The Exorcist and a little underwater terror with the first blockbuster called Jaws. Jaws was so huge that it spawned merchandise, several sequels and actually scarred people out of the water. I'm sure the one's who knew what sharks are really like were just rolling their eyes at the reaction Jaws got and I think that's where Roger Corman(a God amongst Hollywood with the protégés he brought up) got the idea for Piranha. Despite not being a direct spoof of Jaws, you can tell that he was just having fun with the new genre of undersea monsters. Having some goofy lead characters with what is actually one of the most harmless most scary looking fish in the sea, you got Piranha.Two teenagers exploring at night come upon an apparently abandoned military installation. They take advantage of what appears to be a swimming pool to skinny dip. The teenagers are attacked by an unseen force and disappear under the water. A light activates in the main building and a silhouetted figure investigates the screams, but is too late to help. A determined but somewhat absent-minded insurance investigator, Maggie is dispatched to find the missing teenagers near Lost River Lake. She hires surly backwoods drunkard Paul Grogan to serve as her guide. They come upon the abandoned compound, which functioned as a fish hatchery prior to being militarized. They discover bizarre specimens in jars and indications of an occupant. Maggie locates the drainage switch for the outside pool and decides to empty it to search the bottom. The two find a skeleton in the filtration trap of the empty pool, and learn it was filled with salt water. They realize that the piranhas are heading for the town and they must stop the evil fish.The film has this often campy and fun feeling to it. Having the silly characters, clichés, gore and nudity is honestly just a lot of fun. This is an over looked horror film I think, it's just a good time. I remember this movie as a kid, my parents were skimming around the channels on Christmas and for some reason this movie was playing. We always joked that it was our new Christmas movie. I think I'll keep that tradition alive, after all, what isn't more about Christmas than killer piranhas? The attack scene at the lake is very gruesome and cool to watch with plenty of prop arms, legs and heads being chewed up with that creepy piranha chomping sound. I have to admit, for a fish that doesn't really attack humans, this made me a little creeped out by piranhas.Piranha is a good horror/comedy that works and should be given a chance. I'm not sure why it's over looked, but it's a fun movie. I do warn, it's campy and the effects are not that special. The acting isn't anything to brag about either. But this is a horror movie that calls out all the silly clichés. Maybe it was the people who were afraid of Jaws that took this film too much to heart that they were being goofed on with their reactions. Though I think it would be funny if they were actually terrified of this movie and had a new fish to fear. Anyways, Piranha is a fun horror movie and my new Christmas tradition in light of my family.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining "Jaws" rip-off with plenty of blood and carnage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before he made the lovable "Gremlins" and "The Howling", Joe Dante directed the best "Jaws" rip-off out there, under the guidance of executive producer exploitation master Roger Corman. Universal studios even attempted to sue Dante and Corman for making this film, but dropped the lawsuit after Steven Spielberg watched it and said he loved it. And it is a very fun (but stomach-turning) film to watch, with about ten times more blood and guts than "Jaws". Apart from the blatant cover rip-off, the plot of "Piranha" is quite similar to that of it's shark predecessor - a naive couple backpacking up in the woods come across an abandoned military testing site and they decide to go for a late-night skinny dip in the pool there. They become the first victims of the flesh-eating, genetically modified military experiment piranha that are in the pool. A young woman named Maggie McKeown who specialises in tracing missing people is assigned the case of finding the couple, and on her search, she enlists the help of the alcoholic hermit Paul Grogan who reluctantly agrees to travel up to the abandoned military testing centre with her. While there, they drain the pool, and unintentionally release the piranha into the river. What follows is absolute carnage and mayhem, as a few fishermen become the starters for the piranha, followed by a kids summer camp for the main course, and then for dessert - a holiday resort, as Grogan and Mckeown desperately try and warn everyone, but no one believes them or in the military's case, wants to shut them up. "Piranha" is often labelled as a comedy/horror or parody but to be perfectly honest I've never detected any comedy elements in the film. It clearly does not take itself seriously, which is a good thing, but in terms of comedy, unless you find watching people being chewed from the toes up in a matter of seconds by a horde of flesh-eating fish or a summer camp of children being eaten alive funny well then sir, you have your comedy. It's a very bloody film and the incentive attack sequences are shot with very quick editing which makes the carnage seem like it's happening very quick and this was a very good technique employed by Dante. The acting is fine; Bradford Dillman's laid back performance has often generated a lot of criticism, however, I believed that it worked better this way because otherwise it may have ran the risk of being over-done. Likewise, Heather Menzies-Urich's performance as Maggie was good. This is clearly a Roger Corman production as the exploitation traits are all here; there's a bit of sporadic nudity, a lot of fake looking blood and crazy driving. While it's a blatant cash-in on "Jaws" in terms of how it steals (or borrows) many of the suspense and story techniques from it, I still believe that "Piranha" just about has enough to stand on it's own two feet. It's deserving of it's cult classic status, and is at times very graphic and tense with the filmmakers even refusing to shy away from a load of kids being eaten alive in the movies most intense and horrifying scene. Far from a comedy as it's often labeled as; this is pure horror!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen first the new movie "Piranha 3D" directed by Alexandre Aja, it was fun, and i also have seen "Mega Piranha" but it was pretty bad. I decided to watch the original one after these two movies.I was surprised of some scenes of the movie because it's pretty bloody for it's time. It came out in 1978 like the first "Halloween" and "Zombie", but it was few months before these ones. "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" for example, which came out four years before, didn't have blood at all but was pretty shocking.The movie is pretty funny because there are some good quotes like "There are nobody for work, but for drink beers everybody are here!" said a boss to his employees. There is also an improbable scene where one of the protagonist hold his breath for one hundred seconds.It was pretty good and i recommend you this movie if you like to laugh when watching a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, albeit being probably very inspired by the successful "Jaws", this film is kinda original. A scientist make some changes in a group of piranha in order to release in an enemy's river during the second world war, but the war ends before he finishes his job. So, a man and a woman accidentally release these monsters to an American river and you can guess what happens next. The plot is well developed, never leaving the spectator tired, bored or confused. You're always hoping that people stop jumping in the river, but unfortunately, only few people are aware of it's danger-- because, like in "Jaws", the rulers hide it to not 'panic' the population. Also, it has plenty of unintentional funny scenes, such as one girl in the boat scene thinks something is wrong with the surfing guy, and the other chick goes like "Yes, something is wrong, he hasn't felt yet".The camping thing is undoubtedly an inspiration for the 1980's "Friday the 13th", which I considered 100% original until I saw this picture. I still haven't seen 2010's version for "Piranha", but I already hardly doubt that it's gonna be as good as this one. Watch this horror classic and you won't regret!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simple premise, two kids get eaten after jumping in a lake. Woman gets hired to find them, meets up with some boozy bloke with a beard, drain the pool, release the fish, get attacked by the bloke who is mad in every horror film about body snatchers, and the town becomes a feeding ground for the titular fishes.Homaging Jaws was a ballsy move, especially after such a short time, but Dante has more or less pulled out all the stops, and delivered a funny, if sometimes disturbing little gem.Forget about plausibility and plot here, we just follow the trail of the fish and watch people jump in the lake like they have just received a little electric shock.As always, there is a little twist, this being one of the leads daughters is on camp where the fish are heading, so it adds a little urgency. there a few good characters (Dick Miller is the best thing here), but the script isn't the best, and sometimes the dialogue is plain laughable, even for this.It's ninety minutes of fun, that will do no harm to anyone, and is on par with the far more gorier remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one(s) that got away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever films hit big with the public, Hollywood is quick to smell the success in the air. In the case of Roger Corman, the man was a virtual bloodhound. When Jaws became the monster hit of 1975, its success was something the likes of which even Hollywood had never seen before. It was the film that begun the Summer blockbuster. Something Corman was quick to pick up on.Roger Corman was infamous for producing movies that were veiled imitations of more successful films. Jaws inspired several imitators. And Piranha is probably one of the most blatant. It has a very similar plot. Instead of a shark, mutant piranha fish escape into the river and head for a crowded tourist resort. The owners refuse to shut down because its Summer season, and it isn't long before all hell breaks loose. Piranha is at least to be commended for not trying to hide that its a ripoff. One of the opening sequences even has the heroine playing a Jaws arcade game!Piranha was the sole directing debut of genre regular Joe Dante. Dante is a hardcore horror/SF fan, and every one of his films is jam-packed with affectionate references and cameos from the era. After enjoying some success with Piranha and then The Howling, Dante fell into the company of Steven Spielberg (luckily he saw the funny side of Piranha), who produced for him the runaway success of Gremlins. (Piranha is in many ways a warm-up to that film.) Sadly time has not been kind to Joe Dante. Since the big hit of Gremlins, none of his other films have attracted the same attention. With an increasingly sporadic career, Dante has almost disappeared completely as a key genre figure.Dante was brought on as a hired gun for Piranha, but many of his trademarks are there. Occasional cutaways to horror movies in the background. Horror icons Kevin McCarthy and Barbara Steele make up part of the cast, and Dante regular Dick Miller makes his customary appearance. But first and foremost, Piranha is exploitation cinema. That demands a certain amount of killings, suspense and lots and lots of blood and gore. So it doesn't have the same personal imprint Dante has on his subsequent films.For what was intended as a quickie rip-off of a far more successful monster movie, Piranha emerges far better than one expects. Its no classic (a surprising number of people say it is) but as B-movies go, its better than most. Joe Dante knows his stuff and handles things like an old pro. And he's working from a decent script too, courtesy of John Sayles. Sayles writes two amusing heroes for the film, Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) and Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies).Paul is a cynical misanthrope with a drinking problem and a daughter he hardly sees. Maggie is a sunny skip-tracer, looking for two teenagers lost on the mountain where Paul lives a hermetic existence. The two teens stumbled across an abandoned military base and went for a midnight swim in a pool. They had no way to know it was filled with mutant piranha. When Maggie forces a reluctant Paul to lead her there she drains the pool, unknowingly throwing out the piranhas with the bath water. Now its a race against time to stop the piranha before they reach the resort and the summer camp where Paul's daughter is.Although working from one of Roger Corman's typical cheapskate production budgets, Joe Dante economises it as much as he can and produces a taut, suspenseful chase/chomp adventure. They can't really show us the piranhas (except for fleeting glimpses) because they just didn't have the money for that. But compared to a lot of the other ripoffs of Jaws, Dante uses the same thinking that Spielberg did. Make the budget restrictions work for you. If you can't show the monster, imply one. Most of the time, all Dante has to do is show people paddling in the lake and that's enough to imply the piranhas as a presence.Dante proves he's capable of generating fine suspense when he wants to. Like when Paul and Maggie are on a raft heading for dry land and the piranhas start chewing away at the lashings. Or the end sequence when Paul tries to kill the piranhas with pollution from a submerged smelting tank (with some excellent underwater photography) and they start attacking him from all sides.Like any Dante film, even when making a horror movie, Piranha has a constant sense of humour. The film never takes itself too seriously, and John Sayles' script comes with lots of snarky one-liners. When Maggie asks Paul for a cigarette, he grumbles "I had to quit that. It interfered with my drinking." Or the blackly funny scene when Paul and Maggie are arrested and Maggie stages a jail break. She knocks out the guard with a piece of the toilet lid but the keys are chained to his pants. So she has to take them off! When she moves too slowly for Paul's liking he whines "I would have thought you could get a man's pants off quicker than that!"All the cast give good performances. The grumpy Paul and the cheery Maggie are a fun double act. The kiddie scenes come with a tolerable degree of sentiment. And Barbara Steele outshines everyone with her icy stare. Piranha manages to deliver the goods on all counts. It isn't quite the classic creature feature some people like to call it. That is putting it on too high a pedestal. But its a fun, breezy B-movie with a delightfully dark twist in the tale. And who couldn't love a film with lines like "The piranhas are eating the guests Sir!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great success of Jaws lead to a bunch of others "nature is out to kill you" films. And no one could say, "Cheap Rip Off To make A quick Buck" better than Roger Corman! The plot line here is that a government testing lab is making piranhas to put in North Vietnam's rivers. Special Pirahnas that can withstand the cold, and actually act like cartoon piranhas and strip the flesh from people in seconds.Of course, the Pirahnas escape, and reach havoc and bad special effects down a mountain river in Texas.What all these ripoffs failed to realize is that the monster and the carnage aren't the good part of the movie, it's the characters. If you don't care if the Shark or the Pirahna or the Grizzley eats the lead character, it's just not a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You pulled the plug, and you're holding me responsible?"I thought the recent Piranha 3-D remake was a fun, entertaining movie. So, why not give the original a shot?This earlier version is a much more serious, conventional horror flick. The gore is more limited, and the focus on T&amp;A that the remake reveled in is mostly gone. Instead of Spring Break at a lake full of teens and piranhas from the prehistoric era, released by an earthquake, we get a river of girl scouts and fishermen and a vacation resort that's accidentally infested with genetically engineered killer fish, bred for use in war.&nbsp;The two movies have little in common, other than the title, the carnage, and the ravenous fish (though they're a lot more cunning in this version). I found the remake to be more entertaining, as the extra violence, gore, humor, and eye candy made it more appealing to me. But, as a straight-forward creature flick, the original movie is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The carnage! The glorious carnage!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Dante's pre Gremlins eco horror epic is about multitudes of genetically enhanced piranhas that feast on the flesh of tourists in a small Texas resort, and is as thrilling and deliciously violent as it sounds. The movie is not a direct parody of Jaws, but has the right amount of humor and horror to keep any eco horror fan on the edge of their seat. The carnage in the last third of the film is savagely entertaining, and makes up for a slow second part. Not to be taken too seriously, but not to be taken too lightly either, "Piranha" is a film worth watching multiple times just to make sure you caught every last meat chewing bit. I'm not, however, so sure about the sequel, though. If it was directed by James Cameron, I'm sure it'll be a stink bomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a Bite out of the Government</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people say the original 1978 Piranha is a spoof off of Jaws. Perhaps. But, it seems like more of a rip-off than any sort of spoof or homage. (On a side and funny note, it is reported that Universal was going to sue (Piranha's production company) New World for the "spoof" but Steven Spielberg saw the movie in advance and loved it, in effect, Universal dropped the suit. Ocra, anyone?) All around B-movie, this campy, sometimes funny, sometimes actually suspenseful ? will they, or will they not eat the kids?!?, is an absolute must for 1970/80s "When Animals Attack" lovers. It has absolutely everything: genetically engineered piranha, a new resort going up (and of course, about to go down), gay jokes, government conspiracies, blood, people screaming, horrible back stories, longwinded environmental/humanity speeches, bad puns, semi-romantic couple out to stop the fish!, men with beards, women in bikinis and boobs, of course. Seriously, for those of us that grew up on these types (Empire of the Ants, Frogs, Food of the Gods and Kingdom of the Spiders just to name a few) this will (ahhh) whet your appetite for destruction.Two campers out for a midnight swim in a restricted and somewhat deserted swimming pool ? is there any other kind?, discover pretty fast why it's restricted. Enter in "skip-tracer" Maggie (Menzies) to find the lost pair with her new bearded friend, Paul the Drunk (Dillman), but inadvertently sets government tested (and apparently approved) little 'Nam-warrior piranhas, cleverly named (Operation) "Razor Teeth" free into the lake for the rest of the townies to enjoy.Well, aside from some dangling feet (and if you see him, they could only be tasty to genetically engineered fish) and wandering father/son fishers, the dynamic duo must (and I use this term very lightly) "race" down the river, Huckleberry style, to stop the mean razor teeth from reaching either the dam, the kids at the camp (including Paul the Drunk's own daughter, oh no!) or the new resort with a bunch of extras-cum-bait swimmers.This has drinking game written all over it and I highly doubt anyone responsible for this thought any less. So you have to respect them for making just a light hearted "when animals attack" horror/comedy. That said, of course it's a bad movie, hence B-Movie and it's very, VERY slow at parts. This is probably due to the fact that the title baddies are only in, say, 10 minutes of all 94 total and the majority of the film is watching our favorite couple get from point A to point B that has to be a grand total of 5 miles. With the dozens of obstacles the movie gives them, it's no wonder they can't ever stop anyone as they always arrive after the fish start their feeding. (That, by the way, was always hilarious and every time they're late ? I think I counted 4 times, that calls for a double shot.)It's recommended for the selected audience ? and after reading this far, you know who you are, despite the lack of actual Piranha shots. Sure it must've been a budget thing, or "what you don't see, scares you more," blah, blah, blah. I just want to see more piranha in the 2010 update!!Side Note: The cop in the movie played by Barry Brown took his life by shooting himself, literally 5 weeks before this movie was released. I'm not one to make fun of someone that commits suicide (apparently, both him and his sister both killed themselves ? her's more tragic by jumping off a bridge into an empty concrete river bed) so you do it and apologize later because you must've been drunk when you're watching this. Alright, I will, the movie wasn't that bad!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Piranha.Oh boy... I knew from the start that I was in for some aquatic terror! And I'm glad I got what I expected, because most aquatic creature attack movies end up in failure.Pirahna is a nice, effective little gem. I got an uneasy feeling in some scenes. The piranha's don't look fake and by making clever use of camera angles, you get the idea that there's a whole bunch of them.Getting ahead of myself; story time first! A special breed of piranha's escape from a research facility (how can it be else?) and end up in the mountain river. Eating people wherever they go, it's clear that these pests must be stopped at all costs! Especially since a summer camp is nearby...I really liked the acting in this movie too! The two leads have wonderful chemistry together. Lost of enjoying dialog and funny scenes. You'd almost forget that this is a horror movie. I'd say it's a horror movie with a nice touch of humor. So it's really a coin with two different sides.Oh yeah! I forgot to mention that the music in this movie is also pretty nice.What more can you ask for? I say go watch Pirahna right now! Unless you can't stand killer fish chewing on people.8 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Remake of This Better Not Happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this off by saying that I think this movie is very underrated and deserves much more recognition than it's gotten so far. It truly is a very fun and exciting horror film and a great parody of Jaws. This has already been remade once but thankfully, that version didn't do well at all and only made it to TV. However, there is supposedly a remake in the works for 2009 and I pray that it is canceled soon. I'm so sick of every horror film being remade and this would be one that would upset me. Hopefully they end production.The acting is pretty good but not great. I really liked seeing Kevin McCarthy in it. The story is a lot of fun; a tank holding genetically mutated piranhas is drained, setting the fish loose to feed on the innocent! Sounds good, doesn't it? The effects are also amazing and blew away. This one will stay on my shelf until the day that I die!Check this one out if you love B-Horror and you'll love it. I can almost guarantee it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only good Jaws Spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Piranha was a Jaws spoof directed by Joe Dante and produced by Roger Corman in 1978. Universal Studios tried to stop the film from being released (because of its satirising of Universal's Jaws films), but Steven Spielberg saw the film in advance and liked it. There was a sequel - Piranha II: The Spawning which was the directorial debut of James Cameron. Which was a huge let down to the first film.If you watch Piranah II then it immediately puts you off from seeing Piranah 1 so any one who hasn't seen Piranah but has seen Piranah 2 the first one is ten times better.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Joe Dante ("Gremlins") got really famous, he directed this "Jaws" send-up, in which man-eating fishes accidentally get released into a river and swim downstream, looking for people who dared to stick their feet in the water.What makes "Piranha" so neat is how it knows that it's a pretty corny movie, so it just lets the cast be as calm as they want. It elicits some true fun. And the most surprising part is: John Sayles wrote it! But the point is, you gotta love this movie. If Roger Corman executive produces, then you know that it's good. Among the cast are Dante regulars Kevin McCarthy (happy birthday, Kevin!) and Dick Miller, and also Barbara Steele and Bradford Dillman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious little shocker. Classic JAWS spoof.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Cheesy enough to be called a bad movie, but just too fun (and funny) to be one. This is a really enjoyable Roger Corman production. Many critics mutter that this is a rip-off of 'Jaws", but that's simply not true, it's actually a spoof. Yes, it's some sort of comedy, with a lot of gruesome scenes. The film is directed by Joe Dante (of "Gremlins", "Innerspace" and "The Howling" fame), so expect it to be filled with gasps and laugh-filled.This film has mutant Piranha (pronounced "Piranya" in the film.)run (or is that swim) amok on a lake resort. A country guy and an investigator must team up and stop them before its too late. Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies are good, lets not say great. There characters are quite shallow, but it is a Roger Corman production, it's supposed to be that way.I consider "Piranha" as a B-movie classic, lots of scares and a couple of laughs. I would recommend this to any horror/schlock fan who still believe that even with a low-budget at hand, a filmmaker, especially Roger Corman, can still make a good film.Rating: *** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piranhacidal Mania!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene is South Texas. Two backpackers come upon abandoned property protected by a "No Trespassing" sign.Once inside, the two enter a large room with swimming pool and jump in. The boy shrieks, disappearing beneath the surface, as does the screaming girl.A private investigator, Maggie McGowan, travels to the remote area in a rented jeep,searching for the missing teens.The jeep breaks down,and Maggie confronts Paul Grogan (an unsociable alcoholic)in his cabin,whom she dragoons into accompanying her to a deserted Army test site - the same place where the teenagers disappeared.They break in, and finding the pool, Maggie hits a switch to drain it, but is attacked by a maniac who attempts to throttle Grogan. Maggie knocks the man unconscious.Skeletal remains are in the pool's trap.The crazed man steals Maggie's jeep, but still dazed, crashes.Back at Grogan's, the man raves about about piranhas loose in the local waters.Grogan who worked at a refinery) tells Maggie the land was sold to the Army, who resold it to a resort developer. He worries about his daughter at a nearby camp,insisting upon rafting down the river to warn others.Jack, an old hermit, is the next casualty. The rafters find Jack's corpse, missing its lower legs.These piranhas were a secret Government plan to destroy the North Vietnamese fishing industry by developing a strain of mutant tropical fish. Hoak continued the project because Government money is easier to obtain than grants. Dr. Hoak, guilt-stricken, jumps in the water but is eaten by the deadly creatures.The survivors barely make it to shore before the piranha-gnawed raft disintegrates. Grogan hurries to prevent the dam opening into Lost River Lake.The Army, alerted, sends a convoy with poison. Colonel Waxman and his assistant (a sinister woman, Dr. Mengers) try to silence Maggie and Paul. Paul balks, and Waxman has them detained.Grogan and Maggie escape, stealing an Army staff car. Their speeding alerts a local "redneck" lawman, "Trooper" - superficially genial, but whose eyes don't smile. He doesn't believe their story and arrests them. The smile disappears, and Trooper's eyes harden as he brandishes his gun; he means business.At the jail Trooper takes Colonel Waxman's phone call and is smarmy until the Colonel abruptly hangs up. Stung, Trooper goes into the jail. Grogan becomes emotional; Trooper turns on his heel, refusing to allow the screaming Grogan a phone call.The conniving Colonel Waxman (a silent partner in the resort project, Aquarena Springs)calls his colleague "Buck" Gardner and informs him of the developments.Maggie escapes by flooding her cell. When the jail guard investigates, she brains him, then pulls off his pants to get both cell keys, as well as cruiser keys.Grogan and Maggie steal the police car. Trooper is exiting a diner with a cup of coffee, As he opens the lid to drink, the patrol car rockets past. Suddenly, a pair of uniform pants flies out the window, draping itself over Trooper's head, and into his coffee. Trooper looks befuddled...The next day is the opening of the resort and the big day of the camp's swim.Grogan races toward the camp. His daughter, Suzie hides under an overturned canoe during the tube race. A school of piranhas enter the camp waters.The fish attack the campers. Suzie Grogan pushes an inflatable raft into the water to rescue two camp counselors; one dies.Grogan arrives, checks on Suzie, then calls the resort. Buck Gardner hangs up on Grogan.The resort opens. A speedboat with water skier are on the lake, but the invading piranhas kill an underwater scuba diver. the water skier sees the diver's corpse and tries to alert the speedboat's driver. Confusion occurs, the boat rams another - causing an explosion.The piranhas now attack the swimmers - with horrific results. Colonel Waxman (on a pleasure boat) shoves an injured man back into the water, but also falls in, and is killed.Grogan and McGowan take a speedboat to the smelting plant. If Grogan opens a valve, the toxic waste will kill the piranhas. The building is flooded; the control room, under water. Grogan swims inside, turns the valve to debouch waste into the water, but is attacked by piranhas.The waste spews, and Maggie takes off. Grogan signals success, raising his hand from the water.Lost River Lake is a scene of death and destruction. Buck Gardner, wandering dazedly, takes a swing at a cameraman filming the debacle.The movie ends with Dr. Mengers, staring hypnotically and crooning: "There is nothing left to fear..."Bradford Dillman (Paul Grogan) turned in a fine performance as the neurotic Paul Grogan who proved capable of selfless heroism.Heather Menzies (Maggie McGowan) - the resourceful private investigator perfectly balanced her petulant partner, Paul Grogan.Kevin McCarthy (Dr. Robert Hoak) was riveting as the "mad scientist" who chose self-interest over the well-being of others.Keenan Wynn (Jack) had only a cameo role as the luckless hermit, Jack.Bruce Gordan (Colonel Waxman) excelled as the cynical opportunist, ultimately hoist by his own petard.Dick Miller (Buck Gardner) brought to the ersatz "Texan's" role the right balance of grifter and goofus.Barbara Steele (Dr. Mengers) - seductive vixen of British horror films radiated a dangerous sexiness.Barry Brown's appearance as Trooper was most poignant; it was his swan song.Brown's excellent performance as the "good-ol-boy" lawman conveyed the archetypal undercurrent of menace, countervailed by his final, comedic scene - the best way to remember this talented actor who died tragically, shortly after the film was completed. Although nearly 30 years old, "Piranha" is not dated. You won't be horror-stricken (maybe a little queasy), but you will be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chasing Killer Fish Down the River</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's see...what movie about a killer fish was one of the biggest movies of the seventies? Oh, yes, "Jaws" in '75. Enter...Roger Corman - producing rip-off artist extraordinaire. Only..he, writer Sayles and director Dante don't just throw in another shark into this tale; no, there're a whole bunch of killer fish in this one. This picture has an easygoing charm absent from most other 'eco-terror' movies of the '70s ("Night of the Lepus", "Empire of the Ants", etc.), which always took themselves way too seriously. The two main characters here (played by Dillman &amp; Menzies) seem to understand they're trapped in the middle of an absurd scenario. Their verbal banter is like a low-rent horror version of Tracy &amp; Hepburn (or Bogart &amp; Hepburn from "The African Queen"). There's even the dark silly irony that these two heroes actually cause the problem of the movie, by letting loose the lethal fish into the river, despite crazed Kevin McCarthy's best efforts to stop them. And check out the brief stop-motion animation of a little creature, reminding me of Harryhausen's Ymir, for no other reason than as a bit of a tribute.The other reason for the picture's success is the editing, which stresses suspense, quick cuts of the nasty fish and a clever use of the unknown under the water. Some of the victims should, by rights, be able to pull their legs or arm out of the water before the attack is fatal, but the little monsters seem so effective, the victim is paralyzed by their attack for a few crucial seconds, and it's all over. Well, that's my take on it, anyway. Some of the characters are outright parodies of the usual stock horror film clichés: the creep general (yes, it's the army's fault), the odd female scientist (Steele), and the rich opportunist (Corman/Dante regular Miller). There's also the outright goon, Bartel as a camp counselor. This is also guerrilla-style film-making - you know, no permits, paying a local to expose her breasts (the reason I saw this twice in the '70s). But it's this method which sometimes gets the best results. I think Jim Cameron had to use it for some scenes in his "The Terminator" in '84. There was another movie called "Killer Fish" about a year later with the same threat, but it was much less effective. Then, of course, "Piranha 2:the Spawning" - a weak semi-sequel, by, waitaminnit - Jim Cameron!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PIRANHA (3 outta 5 stars) If you are in the mood for a stupid movie but don't want to waste your time with total crap... then Piranha may be the movie for you. It is an early collaboration between director Joe Dante and writer John Sayles (who went on to much bigger and better movies) and, in spite of the obviously low budget, their talents shine through. The dialogue is much better than you tend to get in movies like this... even though the actual plot (government-bred fresh water piranha mistakenly get fed into the US river system) is quite silly. Bradford Dillman makes a good leading man... this is probably one of the best roles he ever had... a drunken recluse who rises to the challenge when his young daughter's life is threatened. The movie was obviously made to capitalize on the success of "Jaws" (just check out the original poster artwork) but it is by far the most entertaining of the countless rip-offs that came out after Spielberg's blockbuster. Even though the fish puppets are far from convincing there are some very gruesome special effects... it's very unnerving to see young children screaming in terror as the bloody water starts churning... you'd never see anything like this in a mainstream horror movie nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Jaws spoof ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Piranha" is one of the best creature features of all time.**SPOILERS**Two friends go missing, and private investigator Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) is assigned to track them down. After searching with no luck, her trail leads her to Paul Grogan, (Bradford Dillman) a recluse living up in the mountains. He tells her that the only way people would be up there is if they were swept away to a nearby damn. They pack up and head over to the damn, which also houses a secret military base. Breaking and entering, the two discover that the supposed closed facility is still operational. After getting away from a guard, they accidentally throw a switch, draining a pool in the middle of the facility into the river. Later, they discover that the pool housed a giant swarm of mutated piranha, which the military created for use in Vietnam and kept in the facility when the war ended. Now drained into the river system, Maggie and Paul work together with their creator, Dr. Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) and local hotel owner Buck Gardner (Dick Miller) to keep the voracious predators from devouring everything in their path.The Good News: I think this is Roger Corman's best movie he ever made. Sure, he's done others that are more famous, including his Poe films from the early 60s, but few can match the sheer fun that this movie is. This is pure campy fun, and the actors know that and don't try to get too serious. The situations that they get into even further the cheese along. Seriously, how can you take a film with mutant killer piranha without a grain of salt? It has to be like that, because then it wouldn't be so much fun. Off course, it wouldn't be that way without the generous gore. It was obvious that they wanted to up the stakes of gore that "Jaws" had, and this film blows it out of the water (no pun intended) in that respect. In here, we get slowly munched limbs, a lot of very gory bite marks on faces, skin seen visibly eaten away, and an infamous scene where a piranha takes flight and latches onto a person's eyeball. At the end, there are plenty of wounds seen inflicted on survivors as well, and with tons of blood spilt in between, this will not disappoint the gore hounds out there. That ending, wow, what can I say. It has it all: plenty of action, tons of gore, deaths, survivors, and the bad guy gets what's coming to him. To have the kind of coordination and creativity to make that whole sequence a success is astonishing. It is the kind of scene that newer Hollywood action directors needed to watch because this scene gets it right. The action is shot in plain view for you to see what's going on, not that hyper-stylized jump cuts that so plague those films. You want to be able to see the action, not be confused by it, and that scene is a great example. It is a fast paced scene, but you know exactly what's going on all the time. That's the hallmark of a great director. He lets you see his set-pieces in great detail and care. This is also true of the special effects. I have to say it; the miniature piranhas are very well done. They look exactly like the pictures of piranha I've seen in pictures and on the National Geographic Channel. Back at that time, to actually make a believable animal in these kinds of films was so rare that it was embarrassing. Hardly any film from 74 to 80 had believable animals in these films, but this is one of the rare exceptions. The piranhas are believable and look evil, just like they should be.The Bad News: About the only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the film might be a bit too "70s" for some people to handle. It has that "We're spoofing Jaws and having fun doing it" feel to it ruins several of the other films that came out at the same time, and this is one of them. Luckily, this is one of the better ones.The Final Verdict: I really love this film, and it is one of the best of its kind of films. The spoof works for it, mainly because there isn't a lot of seriousness in it. Give it a shot if you like those kinds of films, or if you simply like to see killer sea creatures on the loose films.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Brief Nudity, and prolonged scenes with children in jeopardy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good times... good times....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember in the 1980's, horror films were violent and gory and every one seemed to be trying to out-nasty, out-shock, and out-do any film that came before it? Remember those times? The era of the slasher film? The world of "gore movies?" Those cheesy, bizarre, gross, weird and needlessly violent little films? Oh, I sure do. And I love to go back down memory lane to visit that shlock every now and then. And here's one I think I'll be revisiting several times.Basically, some mutant piranha that can live in cold mountain environments, salt and fresh water, and have a mild ability to think get loose in a normally quiet and happy mountain river lake. And they begin eating people and no one believes they're there. Of course. At any rate, it's pretty damn entertaining?and apparently: Pro-pollution!Here's the breakdown:The Good:--For the most part, the acting is pretty good. Not great, mind you.--Actually pretty funny at times without being God-awful annoying (like the "comic relief" in the remake of "13 Ghosts"?some of the worst comic relief I've ever witnessed).--Entertaining violence and gore.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The piranhas don't look too bad, and yet, you can't help but laugh when people are being eaten. There's something funny about it. So the horror is killed, but at least it's still damn amusing.--Average late 70's to mid-80's atmosphere. The same as "Sleepaway Camp" (the first one), and "C.H.U.D."--Some cheesy writing.--Average Cinematography for the time and genre.The Bad:--Not for everyone, to be sure. It's a Roger Corman film. Either you're gonna like it or you're gonna hate it. Awfully cheesy, not that that's entirely a bad thing.--Some acting.--Occasionally, the special effects are pretty crappy, but who cares? At least they're funny.The Ugly:--The obvious "homage-to-Jaws" flavor of this movie will really kill it for some people.Memorable Scene:--This movie actually had the balls to have a bunch of children attacked by piranha.Acting: 6/10 Story: 6/10 Atmosphere: 6/10 Cinematography: 6/10 Character Development: 5/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 7/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 1/10 Violence/Gore: 7/10 (pretty decent gore) Dialogue: 8/10 Music: 7/10 (average for the time) Writing: 7/10 Direction: 8/10Cheesiness: 4/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 7/10This is a fun classic horror flick. If you like stuff like "C.H.U.D." and wacky stuff like that from the late 70's and 80's, then hey, man, you'll love this one, too.

		<shortDescription>One of the best from Dante/Sayles &amp; Corman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PIRANHA is a fun &amp; funny science fiction horror tale, about mutated fish developed during the war to use against the Viet Cong, that are set free &amp; flow down river, munching on the flesh of summer camp kids, people at a new resort &amp; those unlucky enough to be in the water unaware of these guys, The only ones that are able to stop them is a grumpy backwoodsman &amp; a pretty reporter. The best thing one can say about JOE DANTE'S fun &amp; funny political science fiction &amp; horror comedy allegory is that the film ever once takes itself too seriously &amp; as a result, PIRANHA makes for one heck of a fun viewing experience! The special effects are pretty cool, especially for a film shot for around $600,000 dollars! In fact it's amazing the film turned out even half as well as it did considering all the trouble the filmmakers had behind the scenes with low budget &amp; several mishaps. The fish attack scenes are very suspenseful, gory &amp; very well executed for maximum suspense. The other chunk of the story that had nothing to do with the fish is equally as interesting &amp; fun, with a great troupe of actors able to give the film a little added something that might not have been in the film, had the project been handed over to less talented filmmakers. Highly recommended to fans of the genre PIRANHA is a delight! Remade in 1995 (that sadly played the story straight &amp; was nowhere near as good as this one!) &amp; two sequels starting with a much more serious &amp; less interesting PIRANHA II: THE SPAWNING.**** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad to be able to talk about this movie. It is for anyone who loved Jaws and wanted more. There is more humor in this gem, than in the aforementioned blockbuster, but it is all intentional. The script is witty and biting (pardon the pun) and it is written by John Sayles, who went on to write and direct some great films. When you see a camera closing in on a group of summer camp children, swimming, it's hard to turn away. Sick? Well, yes. That's what director Joe Dante wants you to think, as you become the voyeur in an all-out banquet of razor sharped teeth gnawing at some of the most sensitive body parts you can think of.I hope watchers of IFC will check this one out when it is shown. They are showing the Paramount release of the film, as it was shown in theaters. You can't even get THIS print on American DVD (why the hell not?). The Roger Corman Classics presentation is in full frame?????????????????????????????????please, enjoy this if you like this kind of movie (and forgive Heather Menzies acting).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not great but not bad. After Spielberg set the standard w/ Jaws this entry in the water killer genre is pretty weak but does have a couple of readable qualities mostly found in the alcoholic antics of Bradford Dillman @ the beginning of the film and some hardcore piranha munching that happens later in this hungry little fish story. Why Dillman didn't keep his cantine of liquid courage for when he was battling the blood thirty beasts is beyond me. Even his daughter was walking around w/ it briefly; she knew that such moments of terror required some of Daddy's little helper. I guess that Jack Daniels can't even help you escape the Piranha.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Dante's 'Piranha' is a humorous, fun take on a classic horror movie theme - nature's revenge. While some have called it a 'Jaws' rip-off, I found it to be an original story since one doesn't think of finding piranha in a North American river. ***WARNING! SPOILERS FOLLOW!***'Piranha' begins with a young couple hiking up to an abandoned U.S. Army test site above a dam. They break into the site to find out what it is, and they find a large pool. Thinking it's safe, they jump in and start swimming. The pool - of course - is home to the piranha, and the two are killed within minutes.A young woman P.I., Maggie McKeown, is recruited by the father of one of the missing kids to find them, and she starts up the mountain where she runs into an alcoholic outdoorsman, Paul Grogan. The two of them head up the mountain and find the test site. To see what's in the pool, they drain it and are accosted by the sole occupant of the site, Dr. Hoak. From him they learn of 'Operation Razorteeth', a gene-splicing experiment that could produce cold-water piranha for use as a weapon in the Vietnam War. Realizing there is a summer camp and resort down river, the three of them head down on Grogan's raft to try and warn them. On the way down, the piranha attack and kill two people, and then attack the raft and kill Hoak. When Grogan attempts to notify the sheriff, the two of them are arrested. Through Maggie's quick thinking they manage to escape and start toward the resort again, this time in a sheriff's car. The piranha, meanwhile, have struck the summer camp, killing and injuring several people, including the camp leader who had ignored an earlier warning from Grogan. While Grogan helps the injured kids, Maggie tries to telephone the owner of the resort. He, too, ignores their warning, and within minutes the piranha have struck the resort, causing several deaths. Grogan figures that the only way to stop the killer fish is to pollute them by releasing contaminants from an old mill into the river. He succeeds, narrowly escaping with his life. But there is a genuine fear, despite the denials of the Army scientist - that some piranha may have reached the open sea...***SPOILERS END***While this movie has the usual cheesy acting of horror films of its time, it was great fun to watch. And although the theme is popular the portrayal of it has some originality here. Some of the roles, such as Paul Bartel's portrayal as the camp director from Hell, are a little stereotyped but were amusing. There is enough gore to make me happy and the effects weren't bad for a film of its time. As funny as it is creepy. **** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>70s funfest involving mutant piranha that escape into a river that just happens to feed into a large mountain resort. Oops! Time for some freshwater carnage!Chances are if you like "Piranha", you're already a horror genre fan. It isn't exactly a great movie, but the tone is that of a spoof, not a serious horror film. However, the spoofy parts are probably only funny if you recognize people like Kevin McCarthy, Barbara Steele, Dick Miller, Paul Bartel, Bradford Dillman (from "Bug") and Heather Menzies (from "Ssssssss"). The gory "piranha bite" special effects look good, but the actual piranha effects are limited to shots of model fish being pulled through the water...well, that and a few fast-moving bubble streams.Heather Menzies and Bradford Dillman are particularly appealing in this film, with a goofy chemistry between them that keep the movie afloat when it's land-locked. Highlights include a stop-motion lizard creature that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, a boat explosion that seems to be in the film just so there would be an explosion, a piranha leaping out of the water to latch onto Paul Bartel's nose, and a tragic "heroic camp counselor gets the bite" scene. Babs Steele is rather unconvincing as a scientist, but has a deliciously villainous role nonetheless. If you like a well-done silly horror film then you could do far worse than "Piranha".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Piranha is a classic example of what can be done with a small budget, an autocratic money man, and loads of talent. Produced by legendary cheapie(and generally entertaining)producer/director Roger Corman, Piranha stays afloat because of all the talent that begins with this film. It is director Joe Dante's first major feature prior to him making big budget films like Gremlins. It is produced by Jon Davidson. It has John Sayles at the writing helm. These talents were all young but concerned about their craft. They just didn't throw some slapdash work together to cash in on the Jaws hysteria. Instead they made a scary, fun film with loads of film allusions, witty dialogue, intended preposterous situations, one-dimensional characters, and some common taboo rules of film-making broken. Dante has a good sense of humour and helps us like his characters in the film. Bradford Dillman never seemed better. I must confess I never particularly liked his brand of acting, but his professionalism shines in this movie and he easily gives the film's best performance. The other actors are good. Heather Menzies is lovely if not talented. The thing to look for is all the great second tier stars from yesterday in the film with the likes of Kevin McCarthy, Keenan Wynn, Dick Miller, Richard Deacon and Barbara Steele. Paul Bartel has the best bit part as the head of a campground. He is just too funny! When Dante unleashes the fish on the children in the lake, you will just shake your head at his audaciousness. The film has a liberal dose of gore and death, but nothing seems to be taken too seriously. And that really is the charm of this film. The people that made it wanted it too be a bit of a spoof. Dante even has Menzies play a Jaws video game before leaving for the campground. Now if that is not cheeky I don't know what is. The special effects are dated but effective. Do yourself a big favor and buy the DVD. It has loads of extras from theatrical trailers, radio spots, booklets, a documentary and outtakes from the film, and a audio commentary by Dante and Davidson telling you what they thought and intended when they made the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Piranha" is a fast-paced, funny horror film that's really a spoof of "Jaws". Just think of it as a comedy version of "Jaws". While "Piranha" is nowhere as good as Steven Spielberg's first blockbuster hit, it's still a fun movie. Plus it's nice to see someone inject lots of humor into the middle of it. The humor works perfectly in "Piranha". It's also scary too. The movie is about the deadliest little fish of the world which stream up a river threatening to take a bite out of everyone who decides to go for a swim. Joe Dante directed the film, a couple of years before directing "Gremlins". Roger Corman executive produced the film which turned out to be one of the best movies to come from Corman's New World Pictures. One word of warning: stay far away from the awful sequel, which (oddly enough) was directed by (in his directing debut) none other than "Titanic" helmer James Cameron. "Piranha" is the one to see.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Dante's wicked sense of humor has rarely been better put to use than in this Roger Corman-produced "Jaws" imitation which, after 20 (!) years, holds up surprisingly well. Although stuffed with movie references/jokes in the typical Dante manner, "Piranha" is nonetheless well-made enough to offer fast-paced suspense and thrills between the gags. Certainly John Sayles' clever script considerably elevates what should have been a mere rip-off to cult status, with a fairly strong plot and some hilarious dialogue exchanges. Dante helps move his cast of pros (Bradford Dillman, Keenan Wynn, Barbara Steele and, most amusingly, Dick Miller) through their paces with remarkable skill for such a low budget project. Sadly, the film's reputation over the years seems to have deflated quite a bit, presumably due to the stench caused by James Cameron's pathetic sequel, "Piranha II: The Spawning," and the even worse made-for-cable remake of Dante's film. Forget those abominations; the original "Piranha" is a truly funny horror movie (intentionally so) filled with moments of almost-classic campy chills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Any Lovecraft Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1998, six years after a nuclear war has leveled the earth, a band of two women and three men, all army deserters, find a strange bunker laboratory where an experiment gone awry waits to pick them off one by one... if you have chills from this plot description, turn down your air conditioner. This same exact plot has been done to death in so many films, I am sick of mentioning it, although I just did. What is wrong with this film? Where do I begin? The budget is so low, when characters run down the main laboratory hallway, you can tell it is obviously a self storage locker building someplace. The band of deserters have deserted the army, even though the long prologue tells us the earth is a burnt out shell. Who is the army fighting if everyone was killed by the nuclear fallout and acid rain? The army must also be desperate for recruits. Count how many times Better than Any Lovecraft Fantasy or giant rat attacks someone while another cast members just stands there and watches, "frozen in fear." Piranha, looking like a giant dung beetle (how appropriate, he should have started eating the script first), is never explained, except for some talk about amino acids. There is a scene that rips off "Alien"'s dinner time/chest explosion scene, except the budget was so low, the guy has a hissy fit and spits black goo. After most of the cast is killed, the lone survivor kills Piranha. Piranha then regenerates a Piranha baby through its head, and the survivor must fight the baby, eventually killing it by strangling it with its own umbilical cord... nice, huh? How did the baby regenerate? I do not know, and the film makers decided it was not important enough to explain.Linnea Quigley finds time with all the hullabaloo and goings-on to have a shower quickie with one of the hunky deserters. The other female also tries to take a shower, but she forgot her death was scheduled at the same time, and prior commitments should be honored.Piranha lives in a room only accessed through ventilation shafts that lead to a desk where the compound's only computer rests. Everyone stares at the computer, then crawls under the desk to find some answers. The film is less than eighty minutes long, and is padded with cast members crawling around the ventilations shafts with flashlights...and crawling...and finding some goo...and crawling...and crawling some more. Watch for the end credits, perhaps the slowest credits scroll ever committed to celluloid.So, what is a "Piranha," anyway? I do not know, no one in the film ever says that word. This "Piranha," on the other hand, is a cheap gory mess that seems to have been written around Quigley's two nude scenes. Do not bother exerting any effort to see this, the film makers sure did not exert any effort to make this.This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, strong gore, profanity, female nudity, brief male nudity, some sexual content, and adult situations.</fullReview>

The Piranha's look okay, the film is written by John Sayles who went on to wright the classic killer creature movie Alligator and the werewolf classic The Howling.The film sees the rivers being infested with a new breed of Piranha after two teenagers are killed at a research base and two people searching for them accidentally release the Piranha, the Piranha then swarm the rivers attacking anyone in there way, a young women is sent to investigate and with the help of a doctor they try to uncover what's going on. They soon learn that these Piranha's are genetically enhanced so they can survive any type of area, the project was called Razorteeth and these Piranha's was meant to be used in the Vietnam war as a secret weapon. Soon the two must stop the Piranha's before more innocent people are killed by them.Piranha is a 70's horror classic by great director Joe Dante that should be seen for some scares and laughs.

		<fullReview>Joe Dante is an extraordinary ironic man, with a cartoonist temperament. I met him a week ago and gave an embalmed piranha to him. He chuckled. "Piranha", the movie, undoubtedly hands trace of his personality. It's like a prawn cocktail, a river and nihilist drama, a sort of nonstop run from top to valley while everything dissolves in a slow underwater immersion. There aren't float, life belt or dike able to embank tourist ambitions and insane, scientific expectations: a swarm of furious and mutant fishes is going to delete unwitting. Fomented by the uneasy music that Pino Donaggio cleverly composed, the tail depicts its Vietnam's squabble and apocalyptic facet only shyly, wrapping it all in a toy box: dialogues are bright, humor never gets dull, photography shimmers as shines upon the water, references to other movies fit perfectly as dolls in a "matrioska" do; water tempers blood and plays hide and seek with creatures, among silent tangles of legs. "Aquarena resort" (Texas) it's sort of a petite Disneyland, crowded by swimmers: confluence and terminal of all the fears fed up during the preceding steps. Paul's afraid for his little daughter's safety and Maggie's full of shame for having unintentionally released the carnivores from a tube; so they trip toward that direction, jumping into a progressive slope to Hades whose circles are populated by foolish, involved military hierarchies, idealist and inhuman scientists and even more mephistophelian businessmen: unaware people's vulnerability is their main entrée, not the fishes'one. Several claims for help pass through the holes of an invisible net that doesn't even save children: as in a bad fairytale the wolf in sheep's clothing will eat their naivety. Not to mention the evanescent mapping of the whereabouts - from the lurking laboratory to the pretty unknown shores - and the folk's total blindness to the launched alert, both give to this race a nightmarish dimension. Bradford Dillmann's already known for his troubled experiences in ecological "Swarm" and "Bug" before: here he comes as a two-slices character, undergoing an inexplicable changeover that resembles the fishes' shift as if ancestral fears for the danger surrounding him could accelerate his primary instinct by transfiguring it. Obviously, "Piranha" it's a "Jaws" rip-off but, in my humble opinion, is far than a simple copy and it's more "? la carte". Taste it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) Tongue and cheek "Jaws" like horror movie that has thousands of genetically altered piranhas stream into the Lost River, and it's tributaries, cannonballing their way into the newly opened Aquarena Springs Resort eating everything, man woman and child, that's in their way. Paul Grogan ,Bradford Dillman, who was helping insurance investigator Maggie McKeown, Heather Menzies,try to locate a couple who were earlier eaten by the killer fish finds out that the restricted area that the piranha's were being kept was a top-secret military base by the Army. It was used to create cold and salt water piranha's for use in the Vietnam War against the Communist North Vietnamese.Getting the low down about the super piranha's from the man who was responsible for creating them Dr. Robert Hoak, Kevin McCarthy, Paul and Maggie have to work against the clock as well as the local police who are working in concert with the military. Col. Waxman, Bruce Gordon,tries to keep the truth from coming out in order not to embarrass the top brass in both the Pentagon and CIA. Col. Waxman also has a secret financial arrangement with sleazy and big-mouth promoter Buck Gardner, Dick Miller, in his mega amusement park and resort which is situated on the Lost River where the piranhas are now on the rampage.Trying to get the people around the Lost River to stay out of the water has both Paul and Maggie arrested by the police, who are under the control of Col. Maxwell, but eventually escape. Not after the piranhas attack the Lost River Camp where Paul's daughter Suzie, Shannon Collins,is spending the summer. The killer piranhas also eat half the campers as well as savaging the camp's drill sergeant-like counselor Mr. Dumont, Paul Bartel.With what seems like there's nothing left too stop the fish from reaching the sea and multiplying by the millions and then swimming back into and infecting every river lake and stream in the USA Paul with the help of Maggie has only one, slim as it is, chance to stop them. To open up the valves at the local water-treatment plant and let out all the pollutions that would kill the killer fish before they make it to the ocean.Scenes of piranhas looking like a cross between humming birds, when their attacking people, and kindergarten cardboard cutout, when their in formation in the water, don't exactly lift the movie to special effects Acadamy Award winning heights. The acting by a number of high profiled horror actors and actresses like Kevin McCarthy Barbara Steel, is as the cold as a frozen fish. Dr. Mengers and the always reliable Bradford Dillman Dick Miller and Buce Gordon does lift "Pirahna" well above the average run-of-the-mill 1970's and 1980's horror flick, or "Jaws" imitation,that you were used to seeing back in those days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a near-brilliant spoof of "Jaws" which owes as much to the witty script by John Sayles as it does to the artful direction of Joe Dante, with lines of the caliber, "The piranhas are eating the guests, Sir." There is actually not as much blood and gore as the viewer might expect, coming from the crypt of Roger Corman. The attacks of the piranhas are shown close up and even seen in wide screen, water with splashes of red intermingled with the carnivorous fish is about all that is shown. There is one scary part when suddenly a piranha comes at the screen in an almost subliminal manner. If watched on TV, be sure and see the unedited version without commercial interference.It's fun to see actors of the old school of horror and sci-fi such as Kevin McCarthy ("Invasion of the Body Snatchers"), Barbara Steele ("Pit and the Pendulum"), Keenan Wynn (TV's "Twilight Zone"), and Dick Miller ("It Conquered the World"). Veteran actor Bradford Dillman plays the lead character Paul Grogan with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek to give the entire film a feel of lightheartedness, even amid the horror of a lake full of kids being attacked and some killed by deadly mutant piranhas.</fullReview>

I really liked the small humanoid fish creature near the beginning. It really looked real! That creature was so neat that it itself could have been the monster of a movie!

If you are a horror fan then I recommend that you watch Piranha!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:If you like director Joe Dante then I strongly recommend that you see Gremlins, Explorers, Innerspace, The Burbs (one of the greatest films ever in My opinion!), Gremlins 2: The New Batch, Matinée, Small Soldiers, and Looney Tunes: Back in Action!If you like sea monster movies then I recommend that you see Jaws, DeepStar Six, The Abyss, Leviathan, Deep Rising, Sphere, Lake Placid and Deep Blue Sea!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, in most cases; fish don't eat people, people eat fish; but the auteur of that quote clearly forgot about man eating fish, such as piranha; and that reflects even worse on his brain power when you consider that, at the time of speaking, he was actually in a film called "Piranha", which also happens to be about man eating fish! Lots of 'em! It's little delights like the one just mentioned that make Piranha what is - the script doesn't take itself seriously, and that blends with the shameless ripping off of many a creature feature, and both of those in turn provide the audience with a very camp movie experience indeed. Creature features have a long history of being camp, and Joe Dante's film will no doubt be a highlight for fans of the classic movies in this field. Joe Dante has made a lot of cheap, but good films, and while The Howling remains the best of his oeuvre and the 'best director' awards certainly won't be winging his way soon, he's an underrated talent in the horror film industry and Piranha is certainly one of his better films.Joe Dante has put a good cast together for this movie, which equally weighs out the camp and action sequences in the movie in the same proportions that the movie itself gives out. Bradford Dillman takes the lead role, and while he clearly knows that he's appearing in a camp and very much 'B' standard horror; he still gives it his all and makes for a fine protagonist. The highlights among the ensemble are Barbara Steele, a regular in horror films, with performances in the likes of 'The Pit and the Pendulum' and 'Black Sunday', and Dick Miller; a cult star that Dante would go on to use regularly, but found his cult stardom in the Corman classic 'A Bucket of Blood'. The pace of the film is good, and while the script shows some holes, the plot usually lasts out. It gets a bit hectic towards the end and Dante would have been better served with less carnage and more tension to give the movie a better finale. The effects are pretty much non-existent, as the movie just uses cuts of fish swimming and a bit of fake blood for most of it's shocks. Still, this is a very fun movie and one that people who enjoy a good time will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joe Dante's masterwork...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure it's a rip-off of JAWS but so what...PIRANHA is a lot of fun. It's chock full of terrific scenes and features a great cast including Bradford Dillman (the poor man's Paul Newman), Heather Menzies, Keenan Wynn, Barbara Steele and Paul Bartel. The special effects are really just a bunch of splashing and creepy noises, but director Joe Dante and screenwriter John Sayles keep things moving at a brisk clip, leaving little time for explication and getting to the blood and guts quickly. Dillman and Menzies save the day, Steele plays a creepy scientist and Kevin McCarthy does his wild man routine. And any film that features Richard Deacon in a prominent supporting role must be seen! Dante never directed anything nearly as clever (and that includes GREMLINS). One of the last of the real grind-house features to come out of Roger Corman's factory!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daft but very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Piranha may be very daft with a silly plot, and some parts may have dated now, but what we have is an entertaining and quite delightful movie. Joe Dante's direction hits all the right buttons, Pino Donaggio's music is good, the piranhas do bring a fair amount of menace, the script is sly and witty and some of the death scenes are both hilarious and shocking.I was surprised by the acting too, it's more than adequate. Bradford Dillman is appropriately straight-faced, while Kevin McCarthy, Keenan Wynn, Dick Miller and Barbara Steele give very neat supporting turns.Overall, Piranha is a very daft film but it is also a very entertaining one. Shame the sequel was so awful, albeit that is another story. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame and annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine putting dozens of children into a swimming area and asking them to scream as if they are scared and being bitten by fish. This is what the director of Piranha does, and the result is chaotic, shrill screaming, children moving around without purpose - sort of like a day care out of control. Tension-creating or fear-invoking? No. Just annoying.The movie never scared me. Perhaps some graphic scenes that showed partially devoured people would have created a sense of danger. The underwater shots of little fish swimming around looked like an aquarium scene - but were a total failure as a tension-creating effect. Just lame. The lead actor and actress play the movie straight and work hard at their roles, but their acting is wooden.Not the worst "animals attack!" movie ever made (see Barracuda, The Swarm, or Beaks: The Movie! for worse) but light years from Jaws, or The Birds or even Anaconda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scarecrow reviews "Piranha"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want anyone reading this to know that my review is full of spoilers for to explain my opinions on why Dante's film so good depends on many plot points being exploited to make my point. One of the most important aspects of the film that I feel made Dante's film better than many of the horror pictures that would splatter on screens in the 80's, 90's, &amp; even today is his depiction of the characters in the film. Unlike many horror films where the characters are so one sided(most of the time simply unlikable)where we just don't really care if they live or die thanks to the writers and direction, it's quite clear that Dante does. The children at the camp and their female counselors who are attacked are not bad people. One camp counselor who perishes is a good, warm hearted person who doesn't deserve to die. That specific scene is built unrelentingly by Dante. Throughout the film, Dante builds in our eyes the fact that piranha fish a heading to munch on unsuspected people who venture into waters they have no right believing are dangerous. That tension that Dante builds works because we know that if no one warns them in time, people will die quite horribly. I can only speak with the heart of a parent when I say that the moment the piranha fish begin to attack the children my heart beat 90 miles an hour. The film had been up to that point one of those very funny spoofs which uses clever humorous wit within it's shots at government's hidden secrets at developing war weaponry(in this case piranha to "poison" the waters of Vietnam, but the project was halted when the conflict was deemed over)that could have an aftereffect on Americans. But, once sweet innocent children(just simply having water competitions)are beginning to be attacked, the film carries a much more serious tone. The build up to a feeding is hauntingly done with a few actually paying the price for what their government(who was suppose to protect not destroy)did to them. But, things are even more grim when tourists are viciously attacked during a water festival. We see an explosion of horror as innocents out in the water are being torn to shreds. Body parts are shown throughout and much blood. The fun from the opening turns grisly as we see what can happen when a government goes to far, and in their ineptitude don't finish a clean-up job eradicating something they created in a lab. But, in returning to my position above, Dante's treatment of his characters is essential, I believe, to how I was impacted. Dante cloaks his female camp counselors with sweet music. We hear them talk and see how good they are to the children. They aren't like the sex-crazed counselors you might see in other films. Their language isn't obscene. They never gesture that dislike their jobs or those kids they are assigned to. When we see one of them trying to escape into a raft during the attack on the children, there was a realization that this woman was in trouble of dying. We see her helplessly try to grab hold to her friend's hand, but the vicious attack from those monsters in the water just won't release her. In a moment that just won't leave me, Dante shows the piranha carry her into the darkened emptiness of the water and she's lost to us all. It's a scene that devastates me because she's not a stupid ingrate that we often see in horror films, but a very likable human being who is taken away to be slaughtered. The final closing scene shows the aftermath of many dead because the man in charge of the festival wouldn't heed the warning of a woman who knew that the piranha were heading their way. The film shows that in not at least taking a warning seriously could lead to such horror. Dante won't let the viewer off the hook. He lets us see the piranha swimming in a pack heading for people who do not know what is coming. Dante could let our heroes get to the children in time and the tourists in time, but many will meet their doom. Dante delivers on the gore. He achieves both levels. The impact of the building up of the attack and subsequent violence that will certainly occur. We see heads eating, legs bitten off, blood soaking with shards of meat in the water, and the aftermath. In the final scene, the festival owner(as the camp head looks over the sheeted body of a child he'd been warned to protect ahead of time)looks over the sheet-covered bodies of victims, those who simply came to the beach to swim and have a good time. Sure, perhaps our heroes were able(?)to poison the piranha with waste, but the aftermath is what leaves the viewer knowing that it is little too late to save those who weren't warned that it was quite possible that they could've been attacked. Yet, even then Dante gives them reason. They hear a call(both the head of the camp and the festival head)from a person that tells them deadly piranha fish are heading their direction. It would perhaps elicit laughter(or disbelief)from you to, wouldn't it? You see Dante and writer John Sayles cover all bases. The film, I feel, is really good because it builds up and then delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason this movie isn't a piece of c**p is because it is unintentionally funny!!! There are some very hilarious scenes. Such as when one of the boss's right hand men runs up to his boss and tells him, "Sir, The Piranhas", and the boss turns saying, "What about them?" in an annoyed voice because he's on the phone. The right hand man replies in a panicky tone, "They're eating our guests!!". I could not stop laughing at that scene. The gore effects weren't that bad, but the piranhas looked pretty lame, and so did the sounds they made. They sounded like they were drunk and making little burps that were rising!! The plot was a total disaster. But like I said, it is unintentionally funny, you won't find any suspense in it. If you are adament on watching this I suggest you do the following, get a buncha friends together, get drunk like crazy, and watch it really really late before you fall asleep, you will be surprised how much you'll be laughing at it!! But that's all it's good for mind you, laughs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifying and Horrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws came out in 1975 and was a blockbuster. This rip-off came out three years later and is, in part, a deliberate and self-conscious copy. Viewers are supposed to recognize it for what it is and enjoy it on that level. Okay. I get it. Even the cover is a rip-off.What I don't get is why someone would want to watch this. If you want something horrifying, go back and watch Jaws again. A parody is one thing; it has comedy. But this isn't funny. The acting is nothing, the budget is low, the story dull except for when people are being (implausibly) eaten alive, and the special effects are infra dig. When a horde (or a gaggle or a pod or a school, whatever) of piranhas are hurrying towards a victim, they dart past the camera in a blur, not even waving their fins, like cardboard cutouts. A parody takes a certain amount of talent to write. The allusions must be there, but they must be twisted, or exaggerated just enough to become ridiculous. But "Piranha" has none of that kind of wit. It looks like exactly what it is -- an attempt to cash in on the success of Jaws. Otherwise, it's a straight monster movie.Except -- I may have missed something. Maybe it IS more funny than I'd thought. Maybe there is a certain amusement quotient to be found in scenes in which an over-the-hill actor like Keenan Wynn or Kevin McCarthy are nibbled to death from the feet up. That still leaves me with an unanswered question though. What kind of people would find such a scene funny?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The government hires a scientist (Kevin McCarthy) to develop man-eating piranhas to use in combat (????). Unfortunately they escape into a public stream...which runs into a summer camp, a resort and then the ocean. Can Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies stop the creatures?This is a Roger Corman production with all his trademarks--stupid script, bad acting, pointless nudity, bad dialogue and some truly pathetic special effects (the piranhas themselves are obviously cardboard cutouts in a few shots). Purportedly a spoof on "Jaws" but (aside from a few lines) I didn't find this funny. It does move quickly but the plot is just too ridiculous (and not funny) to be taken seriously. Also the piranha attacks are VERY vicious and bloody and they show them attacking (and killing) children. I draw the line when any horror movie needlessly throws in children being killed for "entertainment". I also fail to see how that is funny. Also it has a very downbeat ending.It is well directed by Joe Dante and some reasonably OK acting helps. Dillman is pretty good but Menzies just basically says her lines with a blank face. Corman regulars Paul Bartel and Dick Miller pops up but they're not even remotely funny. However Barbara Steele appears as Dr. Mengers and she's having a whale of a time with her role. She plays it with just perfectly--smiling at the audience while acting seriously.I found this too violent to enjoy and too stupid to take seriously but this does have an audience. There is one exchange that made me laugh out loud: "Sir the piranhas..." "What about the piranhas?" "They're eating the guests sir".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful product of the rancid 70's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who else than Roger Corman could have been responsible for a Jaws rip-off that widely surpasses the original when it comes to brutality, shamelessness and exploitative gore? "Piranha" is a very engaging and often gross film, filled with tongue-in-cheek humor and very rich on cult aspects. Joe Dante's directing is sublime and John Sayles' screenplay ("Alligator", "The Howling") terrifically blends black parody with genuine chills and exciting action. The story is well set in a remote Texas area where the mad scientist Robert Hoak (good supportive role by Kevin McCarthy) is still working on a new secret weapon to use in the Vietnam War, even though it's already over. 'Operation Razorteeth' revolves on artificially bred piranhas that are able to survive in cold saltwater and they reproduce at a dazzling speed. When the perky investigator Maggie and the estranged drunk Paul accidentally allow these finned flesh-eaters to escape in the local river, it's up to themselves again to save the nearby tourist attractions from the ravenous little monsters. That's certainly not an easy thing to achieve, considering the fact there are many corrupt politicians, businessmen and army commanders who attempt to cover the whole thing up."Piranha" is yet another fine example to demonstrate that the 70's were the most outrageous years for horror cinema. The witty script generally steals wholesale from Spielberg's Jaws but it's unscrupulous enough to add social mockery and even clean images of innocent children getting slaughtered. I said it before and I'll say it again: they simply don't make movies like this anymore!!! Throw in some extra sleaze, camp, absurd characters and stylish music and you've got yourself one of the very rare true American exploitation movies! Like it's pretty much the trademark of director Dante, he stuffs his film with cinematic in-jokes and endless references towards other genre classics. Keep your eyes open for all the winks at titles like "Moby Dick", "Creature from the Black Lagoon" etc... Although the tone of the film is overall light-headed, I do wish to stress that "Piranha" simultaneously is an authentic horror film with loads of shlock and aggressive gore! The nasty little fishes devour their human victims in gruesome ways and what's left over isn't exactly pretty to look at. Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies do well as the leads but it's supporting cast in particular that is worth naming. The Roger Corman regulars Dick Miller, Kevin McCarthy and Paul Bartel shine as the hypocrite and greedy Texans, but the casting choice that personally pleased me the most is Barbara Steele as the female scientist Dr. Menders. This legendary Gothic horror actress finally received some recognition outside Italy where she was forced to flee to in the late 50's after fruitless attempts to make it as an actress. This was Steele's third (more or less) prestigious 70's horror film, after Jonathan Demme's "Caged Heat" and David Cronenberg's "Shivers". In this "Piranha", Barbara still looks very attractive (in her own shrewish way). This film is great entertainment and I'm not in the least embarrassed to say that I appreciate it even more than the almighty "Jaws".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hey, I'm not The Creature From the Black Lagoon." OK Jaws rip off/creature feature, generally overrated though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Piranha starts late one night with two young backpackers Barbara (Janie Squire) &amp; David (Roger Richman) breaking into a 'secret' Army test site deep in wooded land. They come across a swimming pool &amp; decide to have a midnight dip, unfortunately for them the pool is full of experimental genetically altered ultra aggressive piranha fish that eat both of them, hey they didn't put those 'no trespassing' signs up for fun did they? Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) works for a company that traces missing people &amp; is hired by Earl Lyon (Richard Deacon) to find the two now obviously missing backpackers. Maggie heads for Indian Springs &amp; comes across a cabin owned by Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) whom says he has not seen them &amp; that there isn't anything around here except the old Army test site, Maggie makes Paul show her where it is. Once there they discover the pool &amp; a necklace belonging to Barbara &amp; fear they both might have drowned. They decide to drain the pool &amp; see what they can see. However draining the pool turns out to be a big mistake as it lets the mutant killer piranha out into a nearby river. The scientist responsible for the piranha Dr. Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) warns of the danger but at first neither Maggie or Paul believe him, that is until they discover Paul's friend Jack (Keenan Wynn) lying by the side of the river dead with both feet eaten to the bone. Maggie &amp; Paul quickly surmise that the piranha are headed down river towards a summer camp for children &amp; a soon to be opened holiday resort called 'Aquarena'. Maggie &amp; Paul face a race against time to warn of the impending danger especially when the Army turn up &amp; both the corrupt Colonel Waxman (Bruce Gordon) &amp; evil scientist Dr. Mengers (Barbara Steele) appear to want to cover the situation up &amp; seem reluctant to acknowledge the risk the piranha pose to the general population...Co-edited &amp; directed by Joe Dante who also has a small uncredited cameo in it as a scuba diver &amp; executive produced by the infamous penny pinching Roger Corman I understand that Piranha is held in high regard amongst many, personally I can't see why. Piranha is not a bad film, far from it in fact but the script by John Sayles who also has a small uncredited cameo as an Army sentry obviously takes every decent idea from Jaws (1975) &amp; uses piranha instead of a shark. Despite what you may have heard &amp; what the IMDb says Piranha has no comedy elements in it that I could detect, there are no slapstick visual gags &amp; no attempt at laugh out loud jokes. It does however feel quite jokey in a relaxed light hearted way as it never takes itself too seriously &amp; has a few dry mildly amusing one-liners. I don't care what anyone says you cannot hold your breath for that long underwater, anyone who has seen the stupid ending will know what I'm talking about. I also thought Pirahna was a little on the slow side &amp; had no variety at all, it really is very linear &amp; I found it became a bit repetitive towards the end. The characters are likable, the interplay between Dillman's dry alcoholic bitter divorcée &amp; Menzie's chirpy witty attractive blonde is entertaining &amp; quite fun as the film develops. You never see any piranha's just quick cuts &amp; they still look terrible, the blood &amp; gore levels were extremely disappointing. Most of the attacks are depicted by simply showing victims splashing &amp; screaming in red water &amp; for a bit of variety sometimes we are lucky enough to get red bubbling water, oh joy. Director Dante fails to create much tension or excitement with the attacks which all end up looking identical. There is a brief shot of someone with their feet eaten to the bone, a bitten chewed up face, a bloody back &amp; various blink &amp; you'll miss them bite shots. Very disappointing &amp; I personally think Jaws is the much gorier &amp; violent film with more blood &amp; body parts. There is also a bizarre unconvincing stop-motion fish creature which has nothing to do with anything &amp; is seen a few times then completely forgotten about. The acting is good throughout, nothing spectacular but not bad. Piranha looks OK &amp; is well made considering the supposed $660,000 budget which really doesn't sound like a lot even back in '78. I liked Piranha, I don't think it deserves some of the rave reviews it gets &amp; is in no way comparable to Jaws as the two films are simply not on the same planet in terms of quality. A perfectly acceptable &amp; enjoyable way to pass 90 odd minutes but don't expect anything brilliant or life changing. Definitely worth a watch especially if it turns up on TV &amp; you can catch it for free, like I did in fact!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Piranha (1978) *** (out of 4)Of all the JAWS rips this one here from director Dante is clearly the best as it has a good sense of humor as well as great creatures and some rather nasty effects. The story itself is rather simple as the U.S. government had created some special piranha that they planned to dump into Vietnamese rivers so that they'd pretty much eat everything up. The war ended and the piranha were basically just sitting around until a couple folks (Bradford Dillman, Heather Menzies) release them into a local river and it becomes chow time. The screenplay by John Sayles is smart enough to realize that killer piranha in a river is a pretty far-fetched idea and thankfully it never takes itself too serious. While there are some jabs at the government the film also manages to be entertaining because it's director is a fan of the genre and drops in several references to other horror movies including CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and JAWS itself. Overall this is a pretty entertaining "B" film that takes its low-budget and does something with it. Instead of getting bogged down by the lack of money Dante spices the film up with some rather inventive attack scenes. The scenes mainly use quick editing to give the impact of being attack and I thought for the most part they worked quite well. Most of the early attacks are just hinted at but the real gore happens at the end when the killers strike a summer camp for kids and eventually a resort, which is having its grand opening. Both sequences are full of people being attacks and plenty of flesh is ripped and red stuff pours. Another plus is that we get some rather campy, high-speed racing, which by 1978 was a staple to many of the Roger Corman produced movies. Many people have attacked the performance of Dillman saying he's not heroic or strong enough as the outdoors man but I'd have to disagree because I thought he played the part extremely well. I liked the more laid back approach and that it went well against the more fast-paced and violent killers. Menzies was also pretty good in her role and the two certainly have a nice chemistry together. Kevin McCarthy, Keenan Wynn, Barbara Steele and Dick Miller are some of the veterans who appear and certainly add a lot of fun. Since this film was originally released we've had two different remakes but neither one has been able to capture the charm or imagination as this one. This is certainly far from a perfect film due to various pacing issues but overall fans of "B" movies are going to be kept entertained as there's plenty of fun and gore.</fullReview>
