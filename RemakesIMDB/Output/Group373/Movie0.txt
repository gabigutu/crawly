		<shortDescription>Taken out of the headlines----</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was more or less taken from a famous midwest case of a boy kidnapped from a rich auto dealer's family in K. C., Mo. He was taken from a private school by a woman in a nurses uniform and the press in K. C. did hold off on the story until the ransom had been paid. The kidnappers were caught within 4 days, and the little boys body was found soon after. He had been killed the day he was kidnapped.Now to the film. The point of the story is that it is 50-50 whether you get the victim back or not. Glenn Ford as the father who makes his decision to not pay but offer the whole ransom as a bounty on the kidnappers head, was very pertinent in 1956. There had been other cases like this, but the K.C. case was so brutal that it made headlines all over America for months. As a woman who is old enough to have read about the case, and seen it on the new medium of TV for months, while it was going on, this film is heartbreaking and to me, almost perfect.The mother and father and their anguish, the servants, who love the family, and the police and other people who interact with the family, and the company people, all are first rate. It is a slice of life as lived in an affluent mid-American family crisis, and all the principle actors are fine. The criticism I have read here does not stand up because the film is a thoughtful and serious look at a dilemma and not a flashy showcase for action fans. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and thought provoking drama based purely on the characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Restrained performances and confined locations make this a powerful thriller. Glenn Ford is superb in the role, Leslie Neilson however is a tad over the top. Where this film succeeds is in sticking with the main character and never straying from his confinement or his pain, and when it comes to the hardest decision of his life, you're battered by the argueing group. Gritty and thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the mediocre remake of Ransom, starring Mel Gibson, I was intrigued when I came across the original from 1956 that featured the always great Glen Ford. I'm glad I did, because now I know how the film was supposed to be made.Ransom! is the story of the wealthy Mr. Stannard (Ford) and his wife (Donna Reed) who are devastated to find out that their son has been kidnapped. Stannard immediately agrees to the kidnapper's terms, but at the last minute turns the tables when he goes on television and announces that the 500,000 ransom is now a price on the kidnapper's head, a decision which shocks the local townspeople and especially his wife. I have a feeling this film was innovative using television as a platform, it had to have been based on the year the film was made - 1956. Although I had seen it played out before in the more recent version of Ransom, with a mild effect, the use of the medium in this manner was extremely powerful, even slightly shocking. Ford made his career playing fairly tough characters; even his roles in comedies had a slightly rough edge. I have to say that this was the best I have ever seen him. He was steely, yet desperate in his resolution that he was making the wisest decision, no matter what the consequences - and when his vulnerability finally cracked through the surface, you cannot help but absorb some of his pain. Donna Reed was a fairly minor character as the mother - she helped set the tone in the beginning, but was basically used later in the film as fuel for Ford's guilt. Leslie Nielsen was also featured as a newspaper reporter who becomes a kind of sounding board for Ford's character, and did a decent dramatic turn at it. It's still interesting to see him as a dramatic actor when we are so used to seeing him only in comedies for the last twenty years. While Akira Kurosawa's "High and Low" still remains my favorite film in the "kidnapped" genre, this is definitely a close second. The kidnapping of a loved one has been a pretty common plot device in the first century of cinema, but when a film adds to or even transcends the genre it becomes distinct. Ransom! does just that, and I highly recommend it. --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ransom" makes an interesting point about a kidnapping. Usually, desperate parents will do whatever to pay for the safe release of their children. In this story, the father, opts to do something entirely different by not paying the ransom demand. He is taking a gamble that pays off in the end.This 1956 movie directed by Alex Segal reflected the times when it was made. Nowadays who knows what would happen if the bandits were provoked by a man that is calling them to use their common sense and set a young boy free. Probably the victim would not ever see another day! The film, shown on cable recently, presents a compelling story in which the well to do family is thrown into turmoil as their son is taken away from school. In spite of the fact there is basically one set, it doesn't feel constrained as perhaps some other pictures of the genre. We feel the emotions the parents are going through, and how it even affects the servants, as the police and the media descends on the Stannard household to report on the sensational news.Glenn Ford made an excellent Dave Stannard. He is a man torn between what he must do and what he challenges the kidnappers to do with his young son. Donna Reed is perfect as Edith, the mother who goes to pieces when she learns about her son's disappearance. Leslie Nielsen is seen as the newspaper reporter who changes his views after seeing first hand what the kidnapping is doing to the family. Juano Hernandez and Juanita Moore play the servants with dignity and loyalty."Ransom" without displaying any violence at all is a film that packs a lot of action with successful results thanks to Alex Segal's sure hand behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A relatively forgotten film, both now and apparently in 1956, the year of it's release. The Academy continues to receive black mark after black mark for recognizing crap like The King And I and not powerful films like Ransom. For noticing embarrasing performances by Yul Brenner and Deborah Kerr and not the performances of Glenn Ford and Donna Reed.The early to mid fifties saw the films of Hollywood attempting to become more and more realistic, with films like Ransom, The Blackboard Jungle and The Desperate Hours. These stories were grittier than they would have been if they had been made 5-10 years earlier, as are the performances. Glenn Ford and Donna Reed have the chance to play everyday American parents (albeit rich) who have their son kidnapped, and the results are not pretty or glamorized. Ford does not play the sappy or insane father who will do (sterotypically) anything to get his son back. As important as it is to get his son back, it's just as important to take a stand against the kidnappers. Reed is not the beautiful rock of stability you might expect during the goings-on. She becomes manic, and LOOKS like the train wreck that she would be in real life.Juano Hernandez and Leslie Nielsen are supporting players who provide the same depth and unexpected realism that Reed and Ford do. Early on, I liked neither character, and expected these two to give standard cardboard butler and reporter performances, but they both show real heart.Ransom is a great film. The Ransom that was made with Mel Gibson really isn't even the same story, so it's pointless to compare them. It is a performance driven film, one that would have faltered in the hands of actors not willing to play on the same level as the screenplay. Great entertainment, and one of the 50s best.SPOILERS AHEADRansom could easily have made my greatest films of all time list, were it not for the ending. I found myself praying that the boy would not come back. That the film would just end with Ford walking back into his den, or him standing over the unfinished fort. That would have been much more synonomous with the rest of the realistic story and would have made a much more powerful statement. But then, almost as an afterthought, the kid is just there again and a tearful reunion ensues with his parents. While I don't think it's a bad ending (I got a little choked up), the other way would have been better. Bringing the kid back not only defies the symettry of the rest of the film, it opens a whole can of questions. Questions that we the audience had put aside earlier, like "What happened to the kid?", "Who are the kidnappers?", and "Why and How did they let him go?". I had realized earlier in the film that the film isn't about the kidapping of the boy as much as it is the reaction of his parents, particularly his father.So it was almost a disappointment that the kid came back and made me think about those questions again. A slightly unsatisfied feeling is left with the viewer. While the end was good and finely acted, it wasn't the right ending for this particular film. Regardless, it's still a great film with brilliant performances by Reed, Hernandez, and one of the all time most underrated actors, Glenn Ford.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good on its own, and interesting to compare with remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* This original version compares very tellingly with the Mel Gibson remake (which is also exciting). The most relevant difference is that the original is not a cathartic action movie because there is no info whatever on the kidnappers or their fate. They are not characters in their own subplot, and we never have the vicarious satisfaction of hunting them down with the vengeful father. They are just a mysterious, frightening, unknown force of fate. That arbitrary element of the kidnappers, and the depiction of the world around Glenn Ford as a grim and unsupportive place, almost tips this suspense film into the territory of film noir. Instead of the dilemma of the criminals, it shows the reactions of the rest of society--press, friends, hangers-on, police, the mob. Ford can only operate by what he thinks is right without any guarantees. (His name is Stannard, sounding like Standard.) It might have been written to illustrate the idea that one shouldn't pay ransom, and also to present the existential crisis of the man who rapidly loses everything--son, wife, brother, business, social position. True, it comes rushing back after he tastes what it's like to hit bottom, but it seems arbitrary, as in the story of Job. (The butler compares it ominously with the story of Absalom.)While the Gibson version has him fearing that he brought it on himself by illegal dealings, this version avoids that explicitly but has one speech that links Ford's success as a businessman with the business success of kidnappers: "The profit motive!" He's a vacuum-cleaner maven--which you can interpret as cleaning up the world or sucking up money from other people's dirt, like the reporter played by Leslie Nielsen. When we first see the family, the couple sit on their beds which collapse because the son has stolen the planks for a treehouse; this resonates with later talk about pulling the rug from under people. He tells the son he'll buy some wood, but the boy thinks it would be "unethical" unless the wood is stolen. Wife criticizes hubby for humoring the boy because kids don't know the difference between big and little things. So there's some vague implication about how their lifestyle in "the biggest house on the block" invites this trespass and exploitation. Again, that's not pressed as deeply as in the remake, but the original seems darker by concentrating on Ford's sense of helplessness. He can do nothing but make his decision and wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Patriarchy and crackling suspense, 50's-style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vacuum-cleaner heir and magnate David G. Stannard (Glenn Ford) is accustomed to getting his way. He will do anything to hold sway over his stuffed-shirt brother under the boardroom-portrait gaze of their late father, the family patriarch. David's marriage to Edith Stannard (Donna Reed) is surface-solid but fissured deep. Will it come apart when their only child, Andy, is kidnapped for ransom?For son Andy doesn't return home as expected from school one day. By the time the day is over, David has mobilized all the men who count: the police chief, the family doctor (to watch over the potentially hysterical Edith), his brother and business associates (to assemble the ransom), the technicians who operate the switches at the phone company (to trace the kidnapper's call when it comes). The kidnapper, belatedly by phone, has demanded $500,000. And Edith, helpless woman, has already cracked under the strain and been put to bed, sedated.Now David alone must decide what to do. The host of a TV program which David's company sponsors is standing by to go on the air in a white dinner jacket, a pre-arranged signal to the kidnapper that the ransom is ready. But here's a twist--the police chief and even an insouciant reporter who has invaded the Stannard residence (a young Leslie Nielsen) inform David that paying a kidnapper in no way improves the odds for getting the victim back unharmed!It just shows potential future kidnappers that crime in fact pays. Criminologically, like begets like. David can strike a blow for fathers everywhere by standing up to the son-stealers of this world and refusing to pay. After a bedside visit to Edith in which he tells her nothing, and after much solitary agony, he appears on the TV show himself with the ransom money spread before him. He says to the kidnapper: Nothing doing. You get not one penny. If you don't free my son, all this will bankroll my unceasing efforts to hunt you down. Will your accomplices be able to resist its lure as bribe or reward for turning you in?Now the wait is on. Which way will the kidnapper jump? Will Andy come home to his father or go home to his Maker? Meanwhile, just about everyone around David turns against him. The public. David's brother, with his yes-men. The sheriff. Most of the media. And especially Edith, who wakes up and twigs to what David has chosen to do. Even the police chief, who as much as egged him on, begins to play cover-his-arse. David's only stalwarts turn out to be his Negro (this is the 50's) butler, played by Juano Hernandez, and Charlie Telfer, the reporter, who has found his mettle. And, beyond Chapman's prayerful faith which likens this situation to that of the Biblical David and Absalom, they can't help.David Stannard, a master of men, a veritable king, is completely isolated. He is making the gamble of a lifetime. If it pays off, patriarchy will be restored, in the form of a living male heir and possibly a reunited family. If it doesn't ... what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Close-knit family is torn apart after young boy is kidnapped. Glenn Ford does his usual first-class work as the boy's distraught father, though the supporting performances fail to match up or make any impact of their own. Director Alex Segal shows no imagination behind the camera, and his film is workman-like in the manner of TV dramas. Donna Reed's hysterical mom becomes tiresome before too long, and there isn't much detail on the kidnappers themselves (whom we never see). By giving us some inkling of their plans or intrinsic motives, the movie might have felt more fully played out. Still, Ford is almost always worth watching, and his thoughtful work should certainly please his fans. Remade in 1996 with Mel Gibson. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new respect for Glenn Ford...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen him in the Big Heat and while it was an admirable performance, seemed a bit wooden. Not so in this film. Ford gives many dimensions to a man in conflict and trauma, he is multi-faceted and really the focus of the film.The film was based on a true crime committed in the 1950's. Ford's son is kidnapped by someone posing as a nurse, removing his child from school. A wealthy man, Ford questions the efficacy of paying a ransom- why pay? he asks.Donna Reed as his wife is acceptable but at the start of the film a bit too perky and perfect. There is a nice sub-plot with Juano Hernanadez, the family butler, who looks after Ford and prays for him; trying to help him survive the horrific events.I had seen the new version with Rene Russo and Mel Gibson. It is a pale version; the new version is all glitz and no substance. Ford draws the audience into his despair, and we truly care about the outcome of these characters. There is no mindless action, violence as there is in the Gibson movie.Highly recommended. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, well-designed script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing the film and reflecting on what made the film tick, my kudos do not go to the actors, who appear to be the backbone of the film, but to a solid script and screenplay.For the first half hour the movie seems to be making inane statements about bringing up children. But those early conversations become meaningful after the movie is over as the choices the father makes have much to do with the parallels in teaching the son early lessons in life--"stealing" planks from your parents' bed to make a toyhouse is to be viewed in comparison to "stealing" stockholder wealth to regain personal property.At another level, the story is a mirror of Job's dilemma--standing steadfast on principles when all his earthly possessions (including his wife) are being taken away. It is to the credit of the script and the director that the tormentors (the kidnapers) remain unseen and the battle is merely relegated to one man's internal moral turmoil.Was Glenn Ford's performance creditable? Yes and no. At the end of the film you tend to think it was a memorable performance. But think of replacing Ford with any good star of the day and the effect could have been much the same, thanks to the script. I feel this was a good film because it did not lapse into trivial confrontation with the kidnapers as most contemporary movies do. It was good because the film avoided pitfalls, while adding color to fringe characters by providing them with short punchy lines such as the lines of the school headmistress, the journalists, the ice-cream vendor, the pedestrian who wonders how speeding police cars don't get tickets, and last but not least the Afro-american butler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Big Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ransom!" is an unpretentious film that comes out as an excellent thriller. It is also one of the few movies made by director Alex Segal (who did most of his work for television) and he does a prolix and correct job with the story of a wealthy man whose little boy is kidnapped for ransom and decides not to take the easy way; instead o paying the money demanded by the kidnappers he offers it all for their capture dead of alive.What is interesting and "catching" here is that all you see of the villains is one hand that holds a cigarette, but there is no need for more to keep tension and thrill high all along.There's a very good performance from Glenn Ford and Donna Reed as the parents of the abducted kid for whom their happy life turns into hell in a matter of hours. Ford has to deal not only with the kidnappers but also with his wife, family, friends and neighbors who are against the man's decision considered as a risky one for his son's life.Although probably youngsters will prefer the more recent Mel Gibson/Rene Russo version -more an action film than a real thriller- I think this one is superior with his mysterious villains and truly dark atmosphere all along with not one single gun shot is fired. In any case this version is a more difficult product to achieve since it focuses more on dialogues, desperation and characters psychology.Not a classic film perhaps but a very good one indeed, most watchable and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glenn Ford's finest hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolutely riveting film. Glenn Ford's performance is engrossing and the tension is electric throughout. Whilst some of the dialogue may seem a little corny (witness Leslie Nielsen refer to the kidnappers as 'babies'), it is quite typical of the times (Twelve Angry Men, perhaps one of the corniest films ever, as well as being one of the greatest, was made in 1957). The whole film focuses on the character David Stannard and his feeling of helplesness as his life disintegrates around him. There is a poignant moment towards the end of the film where Stannard is alone in his house, having (he believes)lost all he holds dear. He is still a rich man in monetary terms, but destitute emotionally. Glenn Ford's performance is majestic. I am not particularly a Glenn Ford fan, although I appreciate he was a fine actor, but this seems me to be his finest hour. The fear, helplesness, exhaustion, determination, despair and the general gamut of emotions are expressed superbly in this magnificent performance. The scene where he collapses on the stairs and cries like a baby, whilst being hugged by his manservant, is truly harrowing.I do agree that it may have been better for the boy not to have returned, although it is necessary to the plotline in order to bear out the wisdom of Stannard's decision. It also gives us another chance to reach for the kleenex when he is reunited with his parents, as the manservant quotes from 'The Prodigal Son.' Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's too bad life can't imitate art more often</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I enjoyed the Mel Gibson remake of this picture and was pleased to see him in a serious role where he could display his acting chops, I thought the whole idea was a little divorced from reality, although it made perfect sense at that time as it must have seemed forty years earlier. The notion of a kidnapping victim's family refusing to pay any ransom and using it instead as a tool to convince the perpetrators to turn the boy loose sounds logical enough, but in real life such an act would bring such universal condemnation upon the father in a real-life scenario that no one has ever considered doing it for real. Part of the reason is that so few children are snatched for money, but usually for other more nefarious reasons by mentally warped individuals who generally work alone and don't confide their plans to friends and associates, making such threats to kidnappers at best useless or at worst counterproductive. Because the villain was evident in the Ron Howard remake, the story had to take a turn whereby the father would have to confront the kidnapper one on one. In this original, the snatchers are virtually unseen, so all the drama rests with the victimized family and how they interact with those who come to their aid or to view the spectacle. As such, it gives the principals, Ford and Reed, the chance to emote and they perform very well. Donna Reed was an unusually gifted actress as her Oscar win and Emmy nominations attest and Glenn Ford was an underrated actor in his day, probably best known by younger generations as Superman's adopting father in the final stages of his career. Sad to say, there's very little suspense in the narrative, and one wonders how great directors like Hitchcock, Zinneman or Kazan might have turned this into a great film. If you've only seen the newer version of the two films, take the time to watch the original. Some of the acting is exceptionally good, and it's mostly a well-crafted film. If nothing else, it's interesting to see how different generations of filmmakers can put totally differing spins on essentially the same story. Dale Roloff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing for the wrong reasons, but still entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There certainly seem to be very mixed perceptions of this film posted here by the various reviewers. It is perhaps the film's greatest strength that it does manage to entertain despite some serious flaws. Indeed, my family and I enjoy this film very much, perhaps because there is so much wrong with it that generates discussion.For starters, I'll address "realism". The depiction of the Stannard family is no more realistic than the Cleavers, the Nelsons, or any other exceedingly unbelievably perfect white upper-middle-class family that would be depicted on 1950's television; that is to say, there is no such animal as this, then or now. At the beginning of the story, the Stannard's grade-school age boy has been going about the house destroying the furniture to salvage wood for his backyard clubhouse, and for this he receives nothing more than a lighthearted and very amused reprimand from his father. This is realism? Had the story continued on dealing only with the perfect family life of the perfect Stannards, it would have been intolerable.But, as you know, their boy is kidnapped. Unlike Ron Howard's rather inferior remake, this original screenplay never attempts to tell us who kidnapped the child or what their motivation might have been. Rather than a plot hole, this serves to increase the anxiety we share with the family, as these are questions they have no answers to either. And it's really rather irrelevant. The Stannard's live quite well, even by unrealistic 1950's white TV family standards, the potential money alone is all the motivation required for a kidnapping.It is at this point in the film that we crash headlong into its biggest flaw. The treatment of Donna Reed's character, Mrs. Stannard, is deplorable, even in a time period when women were routinely portrayed as little more than drooling idiots. Seemingly greater than the concern for the kidnapped child is the concern that his mother might suffer an unchecked display of emotion. Indeed, the doctor has been summoned with his narcotics and she is promptly doped up even before the police have arrived! The only excuse offered for this disturbingly abusive misogynistic behavior is that "she carried that child in her body" and the father did not. Good Lord! As Mrs. Stannard remains in a drugged stupor for the remainder of the film, from this point on her character becomes little more than an annoying distraction. This portrayal of women as childish morons who cannot handle their own emotions is both shockingly sexist and insulting. Why is it that almost no one would pass up an opportunity to denigrate the portrayal of African Americans or Hispanics in old films, yet this treatment of women rarely rates a mention? I certainly hope this is not realism, as I should hope the family's seeming inability to bar unwanted tabloid vultures from the privacy of their own home is not considered "realism" either. The police were on hand, they could have handily ejected such unwelcome nuisances at any time with a mere request from the one remaining coherent parent.Once we get past some of this freakishly surrealistic activity, the meat of the story does tackle some intriguing questions, and does make some attempt to deal with the family's anguish as well as the father's bold decision not to cave into the fear inflicted upon them by the kidnappers. Ultimately, it is these thought provoking larger issues that give the film it's value, as the Stannard's particular kidnapping seems to be suddenly resolved with no explanation whatsoever.This is an entertaining film, relatively safe family viewing (if you don't mind explaining to your kids why they shot mommy full of dope at the drop of a hat), and should certainly generate some lively discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story was based on a real life crime. First seen on Live T.V during 'The U.S. Steel Hour,' in 1954, as 'Fatefull Decision.' It was eventually re-staged in 1955 for the small screen, then further replicated in 1956 and lastly in 1996 by Ron Howard for the Big screen with Mel Gibson. Watching it for the first time, then comparing it with the newest version, I found, I enjoyed the older version better. Don't get me wrong, I am a great fan of Mel Gibson, but I believe Glenn Ford was better fitted for the role. The Movie was in Black and White and called simply " Ransom. " The early imagery, stark shadowy profiles and Fords immense skills as a bone-fide actor made for an intense situation and the heavy dramatic part of Donna Reed assured it would become a Classic. Indeed, with the added exceptional talents of Leslie Nielsen, Robert Keith, Bobby Clark and Alexander Scourby, this movie was crafted with real movie magic. Easily Recommended. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why "little" films can be superior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom is emblematic of the little, B&amp;W films of the 50s that made up for their low budgets with high mindedness. In a similar context, it reminds me of Twelve Angry Men, made the following year. Both films expanded a profound human dilemma (how to resolve a kidnapping in one case, how to judge the guilt or innocence of a man regardless of popular consensus in another) into a cinematic drama that leaves a greater imprint on your mind than the slam-boom special-effect films of today can possibly accomplish. You leave the theater (or your home TV) thinking over and over, "What would I have done if I were in that situation?" Because of the kiddie-market mentality of modern film producers and the international demand for plots that are high in action and low in thought content, we will never see films of this kind being produced again (at least not by the majors). Savor this film and others like it.</fullReview>

Even though the premise and much of the plot and dialog are reworked into the Mel Gibson remake, this is a very different movie. As has been pointed out by others, this version focuses almost exclusively on an internal torment of one man. Most of the activity is tension within the protagonist and, to a far lesser degree, between the parents. The dramatic release is the son's return. In the remake, the protagonist has plenty of internal conflict but it is played out in the context of conflict with others, particularly the chief kidnapper (who has his own subset of conflicts with the members of his gang, particularly his female partner). One doesn't have to rank the two versions. They are different and, in my view, equally excellent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say this is a particularly fine film that I stumbled upon and now watch whenever its on. That is very rare for a drama. Comedies, even bad ones, and sometimes musicals or sci-fi easily catch me and make me watch, A drama has a harder row to hoe.Glenn Ford is rock steady and complex. Donna Reed has equal depth and has a mother's passion that is missing from many portrayals of mothers in the 50's. Her reaction the school principal worried about bad press for her school is deeply satisfying on a gut level. You feel that you wanted to do the same thing. Other movies have shown uncharacteristic restraint by its cast. People, even mothers, get angry and lash out at morons. Ford shows the same anger bubbling much deeper in his televised "discussion" with the kidnappers/terrorists.A special mention must be paid to Juano Hernandez who is excellent as the butler who loves the family in his own way with quiet loyalty and respect which they share for him. Be sure to catch him in "Intruder in the Dust". Weird title that makes it sound like western but is far more interesting and unusual than an oater.One strange thing that I don't hear mentioned is the bother's (Ainslie Pryor) reaction to the whole thing. To me, he seems to have far more vested in paying the ransom than a loving uncle. I get the feeling he helped plan the kidnapping and wants his brother to pay off. When that doesn't happen, he is not supportive but still tries to get him to change his mind. Strange. Maybe he gave the mother the newspaper so she would turn against Ford, then takes her in when she leaves him. His whole role in this movie seems to be in getting money paid. Maybe I'm too suspicious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut Thriller That Should Be On DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw trailers for the Mel Gibson film "Ransom" in 1996, I had no idea that it was a remake of a 1956 movie of the same name. Thank God for TCM or else I never would have caught this elusive gem. I have no desire to see the remake, because the original is just tops with me. Yes, it was produced in the 1950s, so there are some very dated elements, but that does not deter from the suspense or involving premise.Glenn Ford, as Dave Stannard, gives one of his finest performances, compellingly realistic, while Donna Reed matches him with her warmth as his wife, Edith. They are a wealthy couple whose only child, Andy (Bobby Clark) is abducted from school one day and they later receive a ransom demand. The desperate parents want to do anything for the safe return of their son, but there is little they can do until the kidnappers make contact. While he can very well give into the demand, Stannard instead appears on television (the new and big medium of the 50s) to show that he does have money, but it will not be given to the abductors, rather it is the price on their heads if any harm befalls Andy.Donna Reed always likable, is outstanding, even if she does fall into the typical sexist "hysterical mother" so predominate of this era, crumbling to the floor, but she still gets you. So does Ford, for behind his steely determination is a distraught father who fears the worst for his son, wondering if there was any other way - the "what ifs" always plague parents when the suffering is not knowing. The ending, which is not something we would expect in this jaded world of today (nor in the case it was based on, Bobby Greenlease). This film is also a curiosity piece as an early appearance of Leslie Neilson, and there is the Hispanic butler, again playing in the confines of "understanding servant".But "Ransom!" is every bit a nail-biting thriller, one that will have the viewer on the edge of their seat, and no doubt resonate with any parent because of the issue that it addresses.And now I will ask the burning question - where is the DVD?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the two wickedest crimes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been suggested, over the years, that only blackmail/extortion approaches kidnapping as the most evil crime in the book. Not that this excuses murderers for their crimes, but there is an additional twist of the knife when the victim is missing or taken from the midst of their loved ones, or when the victim is fighting a smear that may be based on truth, but that demolishes whatever good or decent changes the person has tried to make since the original act happened.Today we are too used to kidnapping because of it's use by terrorist groups, usually middle eastern ones (but some were in Latin America and Asia as well). The high sounding self-defense whining of the kidnappers in these political cases, where they claim that they are acting for some noble cause, does not deflect from the hideous helplessness they place the families of the victim in. It is just a little better when it is a "business" kidnapping - that is a kidnapping for financial gain.The oldest known kidnapping in the U.S. was in 1874 - a boy named Charlie Ross was stolen with his older brother Walter (who was later released) by two men in Germantown, Pennsylvania. They subsequently tormented their father and mother and family with a deluge of telegrams and letters that made huge financial demands, and put the potential blame on the father, Christian Ross, if Charlie was never returned - for loving money more than his son. Ross would have paid the ransom but the police and many wealthy men put pressure on him not to - it would set a bad example. As a result the kidnappers stopped communicating. Then, both kidnappers were shot and killed performing a burglary in Brooklyn, New York. One of their accomplices was tried and sentenced to eight years in prison, but Charlie Ross was never found. His fate remains a mystery.Over the years kidnappings would take place - Pat Crowe, a strange, dapper bank robber, kidnapped the son of the founder of the Cudahy meat packing fortune, got the ransom, and subsequently released the boy (Crowe was eventually captured) in 1900. Leopold and Loeb's murder of Bobby Franks was disguised as a kidnapping (it was always planned to be a perfect crime - payment of the kidnap money would have added to the "pleasure" of the killers). In 1927 a particularly vicious, hard hearted kidnap murder occurred in Los Angeles when William Hickman got a ransom for Marion Parker, but returned her mangled corpse to her father (Hickman would subsequently get hanged).The kidnap/murder of Charles Lindbergh Jr. caused the creation of numerous "Lindbergh" laws in America about the crime (as well as the national one that made kidnapping a potential federal crime if across a state border. What is frequently forgotten is the large number of kidnappings in the 1932 - 1935 period, such as that of Brooke Hart by Holmes and Thurmond (the source of the story in the movie FURY), and that of Mr. Urschell, the Oklahoma oil millionaire, by Machine Gun Kelly and his gang. That a national hero's son got kidnapped and murdered spurred on the number of laws, but the laws were headed for a change anyway.The murder of poor Bobbie Greenlease in 1955 is the germ of RANSOM. Bobbie's father was a wealthy car dealer. A pair of drug addicts stole the boy and murdered him, but sent a demand for a ransom that Mr. Greenlease paid. The case was complicated by two problems for the police. Mr. Greenlease had underworld connections, which affected his full cooperation with the authorities. The other issue was dishonest cops. While the couple who murdered Bobbie were captured, tried, and executed, a huge portion of the ransom was never recovered. It is believed two crooked cops shaved off a large portion of the ransom for themselves before they handed the bulk over to the other criminals.As in the Mel Gibson remake, Glenn Ford is the father of the boy (Bobbie Clark), who is held for ransom. His mother, Donna Reed, and the authorities advise cooperating, but everything Ford does brings criticism onto him, not on the criminals. He is also advised that the chances of his son being returned are slim at best. In a combination of anger and desperation, he turns the tables and offers the ransom money for payment to anyone who will 1) return his son, and 2) betray, kill, or turn in the kidnapper. It is a clever twist (in actual life it's never been tried - at least officially). It only seems to be the final nail in the coffin of Ford as to his public reputation.I give the film high marks, for Ford, Reed, Clark, Robert Keith, Juano Hernandez, and Leslie Nielsen do first rate work in this film. But I do agree that the return of Clark at the end (no matter how emotionally satisfying) ruins a potentially great film. So I can grant it a "9", but it missed the "10" it should have had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My notes from introducing the film on the big screen in 2009...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RANSOM! Premiered August 27th of 1956, it was both produced and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio. The screenplay was written by Cyril Hume and Richard Maibaum and was based on their teleplay "Fearful Decision" for the ABC network television show The U.S. Steel Hour (1954). I like that original title better, FEARFUL DECISION. Of the director Alex Segal little is known other than he mostly worked in television and aside from tonight's film he is best remembered for making NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS, ALL THE WAY HOME, JOY IN THE MORNING and winning an Emmy for his 1966 version of DEATH OF A SALESMAN. During the 1950's -- Hollywood's originality was on a decline and often filled with remakes of sequels. (not like today!) On the fast growing medium of television more risks were being taking and better stories were then sold to Hollywood to make feature films. Other examples of original TV productions becoming major motion pictures are MARTY, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, 12 ANGRY MEN, DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES, etc. Among tonight's character actors to look for are: Juanita Moore the sweet round faced African-American actress who plays Shirley. Juanita Moore would be Oscar nominated three years after this for her amazing performance in the 1959 version of IMITATION OF LIFE.Next look for Alexander Scourby who plays Dr. Paul Gorman. He was famous for his rich British accent that he used in voiceovers and narration, seldom did he mention the fact that he was really from Brooklyn, New York. Most of you will recognize the balding actor playing Chief Jim Brackett but you may not know his name, that's Robert Keith who in real life was the father of Brian Keith of TV's FAMILY AFFAIR fame. Juano Herandez plays Uncle Jesse Chapman that's always quoting the bible. Hernandez was one of the first "new style" black screen actors, who neither sang nor danced but played characters just as white actors did. He's amazing in a little southern drama called INTRUDER IN THE DUST. How many of you are fans of the 1980 comedy AIRPLANE? Well AIRPLANE made a major star out of Leslie Nielsen who has appeared in over 100 movies? RANSOM was his very first movie! Leslie plays Charlie Telfer is still working today at the age of 83! Nielsen was born in remote Saskatchewan, Canada the son of a Canadian Mountie. He studied acting at a school run by future Bonanza TV star Lorne Greene and studied dance under no less than Martha Graham! After RANSOM he appeared in the sci-fi classic FORBIDDEN PLANET, the romantic comedy TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR with Debbie Reynolds, then later the disaster epic POSEIDON ADVENTURE. After returning to television in POLICE SQUAD he found even more success making THE NAKED GUN films and there many spin offs. Wholesome Donna Reed was discovered to no surprise in a beauty pageant and with rare exceptions, she mostly portrayed sincere, wholesome types, loving wives and girlfriends. Her most famous role was playing Jimmy Stewart's sweetheart in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE but when she played a prostitute in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress of the year! Soon after this film she retired from the big screen and was a great success starring in her own TV series, THE DONNA REED SHOW which ran from 1958 through 1966. But the real star of tonight's film is the under rated Glenn Ford who was so good at drama, comedy and westerns? he made it look easy. Gwyllyn Samuel Newton Ford was also Canadian and didn't go on stage until the ripe old age of 4 in Tom Thumb's Wedding. After his family moved to California he excelled in theater and was put under contract by Columbia studios who kept him busy in lower budget B films until WWII came along and he joined the Marines. After the war he jump-starting his career in 1946 with the film noir classic GILDA, co-starring Rita Hayworth (they would become life long friends, neighbors and when she passed in 1987 he was one of her pallbearers.) While he insisted that he "never played anyone but himself on screen," Ford's range was quite extensive. He was equally effective as a tormented film noir hero (THE BIG HEAT &amp; HUMAN DESIRE) as he was in light comedy (TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON &amp; THE GAZEBO). Nearly half of his films were Westerns, many of which ? THE DESPERADOES, THE FASTEST GUN ALIVE, 3:10 TO YUMA, COWBOY ? were among the best and most successful examples of that highly specialized genre. He was also quite effective at conveying courage under pressure: While it was clear that his characters in such films as THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE and RANSOM were terrified by the circumstances surrounding them, it was also obvious that they weren't about to let that terror get the better of them. In 1958, Ford was voted the number one male box-office attraction. He would go on to make more films and appear in several TV series but illness forced him to finally retire in the 1990s and he never got that Oscar for lifetime achievement that many, like myself believe he deserved. He passed away in 2006 but fortunately we still have most of his 106 titles preserved so that we can enjoy spending a little more time with this fine actor. In 1996 director Ron Howard remade this film with stars Mel Gibson and Rene Russo and it's a fine film, but the writers added several subplots, car chases and explosions. I think they just wanted to sell more tickets but this earlier version wanted to a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bog-Stannard Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glenn Ford has always struck me as having a lot in common with his (unrelated) modern-day namesake Harrison Ford. Both were good at playing calm, unflappable heroes and at conveying a sense of solidity and inner decency which made them valuable as the heroes of thrillers, especially crime thrillers. In "Ransom!", as in the classic film noir "The Big Heat" which he made three years earlier, Glenn Ford plays an ordinary man whose life is suddenly turned upside down by the activities of a criminal gang. His character in "Ransom!" is Dave Stannard, a wealthy businessman. The Christian name may be a reference to the earlier film, in which his character was also named Dave, and the surname may be a play on the word "standard". (The pronunciation of the two words would be closer in American English than in Britain, where the first "d" in "standard" would be fully voiced). The Stannard family are very much the standard well-to-do white all-American family as portrayed in the media during the fifties- hard-working, caring dad, attractive mom, cheeky but lovable young son and faithful old black servant. The crisis in the family's life comes when their son Andy is kidnapped and the kidnappers demand a ransom of $500,000. In response, Dave takes an unexpected step. He is informed by the local police chief that, statistically, it will make no difference to his son's chances of survival whether he pays the ransom or not. He therefore decides that it is his duty not to pay the ransom, as to do so will only encourage other criminals to carry out kidnappings. He therefore makes a live television broadcast in which he offers the $500,000 as a reward for the capture of the kidnappers. The film was remade by Ron Howard in the 1990s with Mel Gibson in the leading role. Although Howard keeps the basic premise of the original film, the treatment of the subject is so different that a direct comparison would probably be unfair. The 1956 film has its strengths, particularly Ford's performance, but it also has three main weaknesses. The first of these is the portrayal of Dave's wife Edith as weak and hysterical, although the fault here lies with the scriptwriters rather than with Donna Reed. The second major weakness in the film is that it is too static. It contains surprisingly little in the way of physical action for a crime drama, even by the standards of the fifties. (There was, for example, considerably more action in "The Big Heat"). In some ways it is a rather old- fashioned film, looking back to the studio-bound "filmed theatre" style of the thirties and forties, in which most scenes took place indoors and dialogue was more important than physical action. Here, most of the action takes place in the Stannards' living room as Dave debates what action he should take with the local police chief, his brother Al, Charlie Telfer, a journalist covering the story, and even his butler "Uncle Jesse". (As Edith spends most of the film unconscious, having been sedated by the family doctor, she misses out on a lot of these discussions). The film's third main flaw is that we never see the kidnappers or even learn their identities. We therefore never know why, at the end of the film, they release Andy unharmed. (The main reason is presumably that studio bosses wanted a happy ending). This means that, essentially, we miss out on half the story. The psychological pressures on Dave and Edith, and the ethical considerations which lead him to offer a reward rather than paying a ransom, are only the first half. We also want to know the second half of the story- the psychological pressures on the criminals themselves, and how those pressures are increased by the fact that Dave has put a bounty on their heads. The film also avoids some of the ethical issues raised by Dave's decision. It seems, for example, unlikely that his bounty will ever be claimed unless one or more members of the gang turn State's evidence and inform on the others- which means that at least one of the kidnappers will end up being rewarded for the crime. "Ransom!" raises some potentially interesting issues, but does not treat them fully, and ends up as no more than a bog-standard (or bog-Stannard) crime drama. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another reviewer mentioned that the film Ransom was based on the Bobby Greenlease kidnapping where a woman in a nurse's uniform took the six year old out of school and her accomplices sent the ransom note to his wealthy parents. It was a case that made big headlines in the USA in the fifties.Glenn Ford and Donna Reed are Bobby Clark's wealthy parents and young Clark is kidnapped in the same way the Greenlease child was. And they've received a ransom demand for half a million dollars. To pay or not to pay, they're told that experience shows the child might well be already dead and it won't make a difference. What Ford decides to do brings a whole lot of criticism down upon him, including from Reed. The responsibility is his and his alone and the agony shows in his face. Reed is near driven to the brink of insanity. Both their performances are stunning.The film is about the effects of a child's kidnapping on his family and the people around him. We never see the mastermind behind the kidnapping as well we shouldn't because it would distract from the film. That was the mistake made in the remake of Ransom done in 1996 by Ron Howard and starring Mel Gibson. A whole lot of extraneous issues were dragged in needlessly to make it an action flick for the young audiences of 10 years ago.Three other good performances to note here are Robert Keith as the police chief, Leslie Nielsen making his feature film debut as a reporter who gets wind of the story early on, and Juano Hernandez especially as the family butler. Hernandez turns out to be a real tower of strength for Ford.Ransom is both thought provoking and gripping, asking a whole lot of questions as to what anyone might do if God forbid they were in that situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Released in 1956 Ransom is a realistic display of acting at its finest, a must see film even now!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom is the story of a family torn apart by the kidnapping of their son. Loosely based on a real-life kidnapping gone wrong, the movie is about a father torn between two opinions. With his wife, Edith Stannard, played brilliantly by Donna Reed, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, David Stannard played by Glenn Ford, must consider his options. After consulting with the experts, he learns that he has a 50/50 chance of getting his son back even if he pays the ransom. Ford turns in a powerful and thoughtful performance as a man who makes a decision that will either seal his son's fate or bring him home. He offers the money that was to be a ransom as a bounty for the heads of the kidnappers. Filled with poignant moments, this film is riveting. Emotions run high as his wife and public opinion turn against him. Anguished as he waits to hear from the kidnappers, Stannard wins support from a most unlikely source--a reporter (Leslie Nielsen), and he draws strength form his longtime butler, Uncle Jesse (Juano Hernandez).The magic of this film is that there is no violence, no profanity and the entire movie takes place, for the most part, inside the Stannard's home. It is the raw and intensely real acting that sets it apart. The success of this movie can also be attributed to the fact that the director (Alex Segal) relies on the talent of the actors and trusts the intelligence of its audience. Even the remake of 1996 some forty years later, with violence added, cannot dim the light of the performances turned in by this stellar cast. Not the least of which are Ford and Reed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ransom" is based on a true story and was remade in 1996 starring Mel Gibson, but with somewhat different scripts.This 1956 film stars Glenn Ford, Donna Reed, Leslie Nielsen, and Juano Hernandez - one of my favorite actors, who has given my fine performances in many films.As in the true story, Ford plays Dave Stannard, a wealthy businessman whose child is taken from school by a nurse in uniform for reasons having to do with lab tests. This dates the film immediately, as no such thing would ever be permitted today.The parents (Ford and Reed) realize the boy has been kidnapped when he doesn't come home from school. Then they get a call from the school, and then they verify that the doctor didn't send a nurse for their son. They involve the police and eventually, they receive a ransom demand.After discussing the situation with the police, Stannard appears on his company-sponsored television show with a message from the kidnappers.This is such a powerful film - suspenseful, heart-wrenching, and one that brought me to tears, particularly in the scene where Stannard breaks down and Jesse (Hernandez) prays with him. I also found the end extremely moving.Glenn Ford and Donna Reed both gave tremendous, sympathetic performances, with Ford probably giving the best performance of his career as the anguished father. I've always liked him but I never think of him as having much range. He certainly is out of his comfort zone here.I remember liking the Mel Gibson film -- the father had the same toughness, though it was more overt. Ford displayed an inner strength rather than out and out aggression.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting performance by Glenn Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that made me feel good about the IMDb reviews of this film is that people do recognize what a top notch actor Glenn Ford was, though he was not in the upper echelons of the Cary Grants and the Laurence Oliviers. But, Ford was a steady, dependable actor, and this may well be his best performance.His co-star here was Donna Reed, and unfortunately she succumbed to the world of television sitcoms. Although this film was made concurrently with her sitcom, we often forget that, like Ford, Reed was a dependable actor in almost any type of role, whether it be Jimmy Stewart's wife in "It's A Wonderful Life" or Dean Martin's girlfriend in "The Caddy", or one of the four leads in "From Here To Eternity".I think one of the things that made this film so riveting, is that it looked at a kidnapping from multiple perspectives, more so than many films on the topic. And, it was actually better for the FBI not being called into the case.The supporting actors here do an excellent job, as well. In particular, Leslie Neilsen as the newspaper reporter, back before he had turned to comedy. Also of note was Robert Keith as the police chief. And, while the role was not particularly outstanding, Juano Hernandez was a welcome addition as the servant.In terms of what to criticize here? I can't think of a thing. Some of our reviewers felt it would have been more logical for the little boy who had been kidnapped to be killed. But that would have subjected the kidnappers to a federal felony likely resulting in the death penalty. While not illogical, it would be just as likely that they would not kill the boy when they realized they would not be getting the money.Highly recommended! And this is one of those films I never forgot after seeing it on one of the network movie nights of the early 1960s. You won't forget it either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not My Baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glenn Ford and Donna Reed star in this story of a prominent rich family, because the father's in the vacuum cleaner business, making them, not selling. Because he's in the public eye and rich, his son is ripe for the taking, anyone might think. And, they can get quite a big ransom for the boy. Think again. Glenn Ford's just a little smarter than your average dad, or maybe crazier. He decides not only to not pay the ransom, half a million dollars, but instead is putting it on the head of the abductor and in effect turns the tables on him. The film starts out well and is at best a very emotional roller-coaster ride, as both Donna and Glenn break down. Donna Reed is especially good, and gives a memorable performance in one scene in particular, as she is remembering the day her baby was born. But the climax of the film is seeing Glenn Ford, live on a television broadcast, vowing to get his enemy no matter the cost. From there, the film, quite frankly, drags. The film's main attribute is the acting, as some of the dialogue throughout is awkward and unrealistic. The fact that he doesn't pay the ransom and his speech are the most distinctive things about the picture. In fact, I'm surprised they made a full film about it, because essentially there was no story to really tell. Leslie Nielsen makes his screen debut as a nosy and pushy reporter who wants a scoop. The Mel Gibson remake had a stronger ending, but at the same time makes the viewer feel as if, is this really appropriate? All in all, if you are curious about the original "Ransom," I would recommend it to see the stars in some strong acting performances, but this film is really a one-time deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film appears based on the 1953 Greenlease kidnapping in Kansas City. The young son of the wealthy car dealer was found dead, the culprits caught and executed, while in a twist worthy of Hollywood, the ransom money was stolen by two of the cops! Needless to say, the press had a field day. Turned out the boy was killed before the ransom money was paid, a fact that the movie picks up on.The movie itself is very much a product of the 50's penchant for strained seriousness. It reminds me of old Playhouse 90 high-drama since most of the action is confined to a single set. The movie is nothing if not earnest in its portrayal of family anguish over young son Andy's kidnapping. And except for the opening scenes of a happy family and the "miracle" close, the remaining 90-minutes come across as unrelentingly grim.With one exception, it's a shrewdly done screenplay. Note how Dave's (Ford) tough-minded decision not to pay the ransom is prepared by his tough-minded business dealings. By refusing in public to pay, he does the unpopular thing; at the same time, the movie's strength lies in discussing these larger repercussions. For example, the cops don't really want him to pay since that encourages potential kidnappers, but then it's not their son. Thus a private "good" comes into conflict with a public "good". Then too, it seems from the discussion that paying really doesn't improve the odds of getting the child back alive, which, if you take at face value, seems surprising. Also, the aspect of where the ransom money comes from and who might be hurt by the forfeiture is discussed?in this case, the stockholders in Dave's company. It's this attention to detail, usually skipped over by other kidnapping films, that distinguishes this one. In fact, it's not the crime that's focused on here, rather it's the family's reaction.My one real complaint is with what can only be described as the "miraculous" ending. Deep in night-time anguish, Dave visits his son's half-finished backyard fort. In the bottom right of the frame, he lowers himself. Is he kneeling or praying?the camera fudges. But in the upper left corner, a wooden cross from the jury-rigged fort appears. There's a long silence, then we hear a whispering voice. Yes, it's Andy, fully composed and apparently waiting in the backyard for someone to appear despite a grueling period of captivity. Whatever, supplications Dad has offered, they've been answered. Apparently Mom (Reed) has bionically heard the whisper since she comes running from a neighbor's house where she's otherwise been in a state of nervous collapse. Happily, the little family is together again, while the faithful family servant (Hernandez) gazes gratefully heavenward.I've gone into detail here because this hokey contrivance utterly betrays the rest of the film's attempt at gritty realism. Now, whatever one thinks of religion in general, Hollywood during this period managed to reduce the whole profound question to a mere matter of stage craft, thus cheapening the idea itself. It may comfort some to see a good God in all this. Nonetheless, I just wonder what little Bobby Greenlease's dad would see.Ford does a good job with low-key anguish without going over the top. As Dave, he's clearly displacing his emotions with business-like attention to detail, such as sorting through the company's assets for ransom money. Reed is also persuasive as the grief-stricken mother, allowing her maternal emotions to spiral out of control. However, the imposing Nielsen appears miscast as a reporter, even if he does pop gum at one regrettable point.Interestingly, one reviewer sees typical 50's stereotypes in the parents?a forceful, patriarchal father, a weak, emotionally dependent mother. Now, I'm not sure whether to call Mom's reactions "weak" since stereotypes usually emerge from social conditioning, and it was clearly more acceptable for a woman to break down than it was for a man. Nonetheless, Dad does finally collapse on the staircase, even though it does take awhile. Such reactions may play into stereotypes of the time, but they're not contrived in an obvious way.Anyway, it's a suspenseful, if over-long 100-minutes, willing to raise some difficult issues not usually raised around kidnapping. Still, all things considered, it's also very much a product of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tough decision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the young son of the wealthy owner of a vacuum cleaner company is kidnapped, the decision is made not to pay the ransom money. The film focuses on this decision and the tortured thought process behind it. The boy's eerie disappearance is portrayed quite well. You don't see it, but hear about it through two phone conversations that take place in the afternoon between the mother (Donna Reed) and the office of the exclusive private school that the boy attends, and then between the father(Glenn Ford) and the doctor's office where the boy was supposed to have been sent. Day gives way to night, the police chief arrives, then the doctor, later followed by the school's principal (in a stunning role) trying to wiggle out of any responsibility for the boy. Finally comes Leslie Nielson as the reporter for the local daily. Through it all is Juano Hernandez as the long time butler who tries his best to protect the family from a growing media frenzy. Glenn Ford's sturdy persona fits right into the part, mix of a father's emotional trauma and a business man's calculations of the odds. The speech he conveys to the public and the kidnappers via television is beautiful. As the situation unfolds important people try to influence Ford's decisions and, like the school principal, find ways out of any blame that could conceivably come there way. Rarely will one see a chief of police portrayed as such a wimp as this one is, much like the some of the cops in another really good Glenn Ford film, The Big Heat. Like other posters for this film have noted, this is an ingenious film getting excitement without the usual action. We see a man in a dark room in an armchair puffing away on a cigarette, the kidnapper, as he watches Ford's televised speech. It's quite exciting and yet is all lighting and mood. Where the boy is, no one knows, which is another part of the strategy behind this film that does a lot to make it at least more than a little disturbing. The film's major flaw, the 50's stereotyping of the characters, the house, the lifestyle, and just about everything else, doesn't doom it to the waste bin. Donna Reed is quite good in the film, much better than her part is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, "Ransom!" with an exclamation point (1956), is the original from which Ron Howard's "Ransom" wth no exclamation point (1996), was derived forty years later. It's not very common for a remake to equal the original -- hell, it's rare! But in some ways the more recent version beats this one.The recent version is really quite different. (The exclamation points should be transposed.) "Ransom!" focuses exclusively on Glenn Ford, who underacts as the father of the kidnapped boy, and Donna Reed plays the overwrought mother. We never even see the kidnappers, who decide to play ball with Ford after he decides that his son will be killed whether he pays the ransom or not, and so threatens to offer the full amount as a reward to whoever drops the dime on the criminals if they don't return his son. It gets a little dull. Ford has no idea that his son may be dead already until the police and a friendly reporter clue him in to the very real possibility. Ford suffers a lot and sweats through his decision while Donna Reed goes to pieces on him.The remake gives us equal time with the gang of kidnappers, a varied group, some mean, some with consciences and loyalties. The remake is an edgier film with far more action and blood and the kind of shoot out at the climax that producers, writers, and directors seem to believe a modern audience demands. The chief heavy in the remake, Gary Sinese, not only has his face pounded into a substance with the texture and specific gravity of guacamole but is finally plugged multiple times, first by the vengeful father. The director of the remake, Ron Howard, is given to producing smooth, uplifting family films with neat happy endings. This one is a little rougher than his usual fare, but Richard Price contributed to the screenplay and he has a flair for dialog that is unexpected and catchy. Maybe that helped.The plots in both versions are very similar of course. Dad decides not to pay ransom and threatens to give it away as a reward to any squealer, regardless of what happens (or has already happened) to his son. The kidnappers have a choice of turning the kid over alive or else constantly wondering which of their friends is going to turn them in for a million bucks.This is a variant of a game called "the prisoner's dilemma," which I won't describe for two reasons. One is that it would take too long. The other is that I've forgotten which variant of the game is embodied in this plot. Interested parties can look up "the prisoner's dilemma" on the internet. I think Wikipedia.com has an entry on it. Maybe not.This original isn't a bad film. The difference between the two is that this one concentrates on Ford's moral quandary, while the remake shifts more towards the action side of the spectrum, giving it somewhat richer visuals. This isn't seen on TV very often, but if it's on it would be worth watching. The question hanging over the father's head is a heavy one. Should he pay the million bucks for his son or not? If I had it, I would certainly have gone ahead and paid it for my son, even though the little tyke hasn't yet shown me the proper respect or indicated any interest in a career in medicine. Come to think of it, I'd have to wrestle with the decision -- but in the end I'd have paid. Probably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kidnapper holds the kid, the smokes, and all the cards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to be confused with Jay McInerny's Japan-set follow-up to his seminal 80's novel, "Bright Lights, Big City," or Mel Gibson and Ron Howard's stab at the same material, Glen Ford and company tackle the "title" and the kidnapping tale-of-woe with a heavy splash of sweat and hysteria. Sans modern pyrotechnics, the straight-forward narrative and sharp, clean black and white photography are welcome additions to any film library. Ford is a mass of twisted piano wire. Intense. Brooding. Furious. He rages against everyone in sight. Donna Reed spins from cool, detached resolve to loopy mush. The family doctor sends her to her bedroom loaded with tranquilizers. The kidnapper is never on screen--except for a burning cigarette. And maybe a shadow or two. The black actors are given more to do than usual. The butler has the run of the house and is a deacon. He wears his religion in full view of all the others. Fatherly, he hugs Ford in his hour of need. Could this be the first interracial embrace in movie history? Ford is a very affluent man and has a television anchored in his bookcase. I could see why Gibson was drawn to this material. Ford, jumping all over the place during a "live" broadcast, slaps his hand down over the Bible with such fervor, he almost flattens the tome into a leather pancake. Ouch. Finally, if the ransom gets payed, what are the odds the boy will be returned alive? Two to one. I know this because the police chief and the good book tells Ford so. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, this was the original, before Mel did it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing a portion the version of this with Mel Gibson, and it happened to be the corresponding scene from this version where Glenn Ford confronts the kidnappers of his son on TV. Mel had given fundamentally the same speech Glenn Ford gives, almost verbatim. So, of course, my curiosity was piqued when I saw the original scene in the original film.Now that I have seen this original version, I understand the story much better. This movie was made in an age when Newspapers, TV, and other media devices controlled public viewpoint. This plays a big part of the decision of Glenn Ford to go on TV and give his ultimatum to the kidnappers. And what we see, and most impressive, is Leslie Nielson, playing a Newspaper Reporter "Leech" - Looking for an exclusive story, and he enters the film in a pretty heartless manner, and we see this character change before our very eyes... To the point where, when other reporters try to bribe him with 25 bucks apiece for some info (a thing which Nielson had tried with the butler of Glenn Ford's family, but was shamed in the attempt) - He declines, telling his fellow muckrakers that he would be insulted to consider it.Glenn Ford performs a good job here, but most of the cast do not convince me, especially Donna Reed, and I normally like her performances. Leslie Nielson as the reporter, is in fact the best supporting cast, along with Juano Hernandez (Uncle Possum from The Reivers), who plays a manservant with a lot of Faith.I do not want to say much about the plot, except that this is about a kidnapping and the effect the incident has on a whole community, not just on the father and the mother, although those are important roles.The action Ford's character takes and the ultimate conclusion of the film which came out of that action, affected me on an emotional level.And so, I rate this movie highly, because not only was I kept interested in the film as I was watching it by the rising tension of the situation, but the conclusion is satisfactory, if not ideal. But we believe, by watching this, that the decision made by Ford's character was not only a hard decision but also the correct one, and even without the ideal ending, we were left with the conviction of the Father and the belief that he acted in the best way possible. So now if I happen to view the remake of 1996, I can watch for these things and see if the tale survived in a modern day telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom! (1956) *** (out of 4) Glenn Ford plays a tycoon who must decide whether to pay a ransom for his kidnapped son. I had seen the Ron Howard/Mel Gibson remake before but this one here manages to be pretty good even though there are a couple horrible things. The biggest difference between the two versions is that in this one we never see who is doing the kidnapping or why. The bad guys are never shown and instead we center on Ford and his wife (Donna Reed). Ford delivers a pretty strong and intense performance, although I felt he went over the top a couple times. Reed on the other hand delivers an incredibly bad performance. I wouldn't say she can't act but she certainly doesn't do it here. Her performance is downright laughable at times and I think she really brings the film down in her shock and fear moments. I was actually happy when the doctor drugged her up to make her sleep because that meant we wouldn't have to put up with her. Leslie Nielsen and Robert Keith add nice support. The first thirty minutes drag along but once the ransom situation starts then the film becomes quite entertaining. The ending doesn't work at all and comes out of no where but even so this is a slightly enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ransom!" is a thriller that will bring you to the edge of your seat thanks to some realistic character played by some most excellent actors and some strong dialog.The movie only focuses on the family and we never get to know the kidnapper(s). Because of this we the audience will be able to feel related to the family with all their sorrows, emotions and uncertainties. The movie has a realistic feel, also thanks to some very good actors (Glenn Ford and Leslie Nielsen in particular)Fun fact: This was Leslie Nielsen's first movie role and what a debut it was! Too bad he wasted his own career...It is a very recommendable thriller to watch that is tense from start to finish and filled with uncertainties. In my opinion far more superior then the better known Mel Gibson remake.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tense and riveting drama that focuses completely on the family of the kidnapped victim. You never see the kidnapper or kidnappers during the entire film. Eight year-old Andy Stannard, Bobby Clark, is abducted on his way to school and his parents David &amp; Edith,Glenn Ford &amp; Donna Reed, later get the shocking news that he's missing from the school principle.Getting a phone call from the kidnapper to pay a ransom of $500,000.00 in cash for Andy's release David,the president and owner of the Stannard Vacuum Cleaner Company,comes up with the cash and is more then ready to pay it to save his son Andy. Then something deep in his gut, as well as the towns police chief Jim Backett (Robert Keith), tells him that the chances of him getting Andy back safe and sound are the same if he pays the ransom or if he doesn't. The story of the infamous Lindberg kidnapping back in 1932 came up where even when the ransom was paid the Lindberg baby was still found murdered months later. David on a calculating and dangerous hunch going to publicly plead for and pay the ransom to save Andy goes instead on the on TV station and gives the abductor of his son, as well as everyone watching, the shock of their life. Powerful performances by both Glenn Ford and Donna Reed as the distraught parents trying to save their son but going in two different directions to do it, which led to Andy's mom losing control and ending up bedridden and on sedatives. David himself later felt that he made a wrong and fatal decision on his part but had to live with it. David's speech on TV addressing the kidnapper, or kidnappers, of his son was so gripping and stunning that for a moment I forgot that I was watching a movie but a real news broadcast, of a parent asking for his son to be returned to him from his abductor. Heart wrenching and absorbing with unbearable suspense and being on the razors edge that has your on the verge of,like what happened to Andy's mom, emotionally breaking down. The film switches from the public in total sympathy and support with the Stannard's to turning against the father for not wanting to give into the kidnappers demands. David plays his hunch that as long as Andy is alive their safe from him, who a pretty rough and tough guy on his own, and the electric chair when their caught and convicted. The ending of the movie has you, a well as David and Edith, unable to hold back your emotion and keep the tears from flowing. One of the best films about a child, or any other kind of, abduction with an ending that you'll never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwrought melodrama overdoes the pathos.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the pre-teenaged son of millionaire Glenn Ford is kidnapped, all of society seems to get involved, intruding on the family's privacy during their time of worry. The authorities are of little help either, telling papa Ford of how he should handle it. Ford melodramatically explodes throughout the film and is joined in this by on-screen wife, Donna Reed, who is of course sunny and sweet at the beginning but overwrought as the plot develops. Toss in a wise preacher who comes in out of nowhere halfway throughout the film and an unbelievable out of left field conclusion and what you end up with is a film where the tension is way too much. This results in an overly uncomfortable feeling that creates a morbid viewing experience.Intended to obviously rip a seemingly vital front page news story off the headlines, the good intentions are sadly vacant. Manipulative and on occasion nasty, the film never succeeds in its goal. Supporting actors all seem intrusive, including Mabel Albertson as a self-serving school mistress, Leslie Nielsen as one of the agents on the case, and Juano Hernandez as the intrusive preacher. If the film had tried to be more subtle, it would have come off more successfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing anticlimax.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom is a classic example of a promising plotline that hits a brick wall in midstream and is doomed to end in an anticlimax. When Glenn Ford's son is kidnapped, he chooses not to pay the ransom. He prefers to play the waiting game in the hope that the kidnapper will realize that he has no hope of financial gain and return the child. This is where we hit the wall. All that is left is to watch the anguish and near breakdown of the mother and the misery of the father as he passively waits for his son to be returned. There are only two likely outcomes from here - the child is killed or he is returned. Either way, Glenn Ford as the star of this, has no real role in the events. Inevitably, the end will be an anticlimax. When the son miraculously appears in the closing stages, there has been no real suspense or proactive action - just a series of images of Glenn Ford looking distraught and Donna Reed on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The premise of a father refusing to pay the ransom will only have a chance of working in film if he had taken a more active role in locating his son. In the case of Ransom, the writers and director clearly took the wrong fork in the road.</fullReview>

Even though there are some big stars in this film, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. Glenn Ford, normally a laid-back kind of guy, hams it up with forced emotion. Donna Reed is so over-the-top as to prove laughable. Leslie Nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible. The son is such a repulsive little brat, I found myself rooting for the kidnappers. The only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively minor role of the butler. Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the actors, after all, all they did were to read the lines given them in the script. Ah, the script, that turgid piece of contrived dreck that would like to tug on your heart strings but merely turns your stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPLATTERED AMERICAN DREAM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You get it right, this is the original movie from Ron Howard's version starring Mel Gibson. The subject is all about kidnapping and do you have to pay the ransom or not, and this theory is so economically explained that it comes close to the laughable. I guess you have read everywhere that the original is better (I don't know, haven't seen the remake) but believe me, this movie stinks! It opens with seeing a so called perfect family. So perfect it makes you sick and you just hope that something might happen to their luck. Papa Glenn Ford is the creator of a vacuum cleaner which made him a millionaire, mama Donna Reed seems only to care about drinking her orange juice and the perfect son Andy already is a technical genius in his young days. And so you must face 30 minutes of American Dreams that are crap, racist (of course all their housekeepers are black who obey what they're told to do, having that eternal smile) and totally useless (unless you wanna know why the latest created vacuum cleaner can't make its place in the market). Already 30 minutes of boredom and then the second part...heheh...the kid is kidnapped and never is there any interaction with the viewer. We only know the kidnapper wants a ransom, but never do we see who he or she is, not the motives...and never one moment of suspense! Glenn Ford is the so called man who does it his way by deciding he doesn't want to pay the ransom and the explanation for that decision is both based on economic principles (sadly enough I am not kidding!) and the morality (from the moment one person pays ransom then you are opening the road for other kidnappers). The mother played by Donna Reed does nothing but fainting, and the whole movie they decide to give her some injection at the moment she has something "interesting" to say.... The plot is laughable as well, it just comes over as the director Alex Segal has had enough of it. Oh the best performance comes from Leslie Nielsen who plays a journalist who can enter the house from some victims without any form of warning. Nielsen being the best player? Says more than enough about this bad picture, not?</fullReview>
