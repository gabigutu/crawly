			<paragraph>A medium-sized candybar with a lot of nerves, Nokia 6233 is one of the current Nokia handsets that might interest you in case you are looking for non-smartphone 3G solution. What is more, the classic styled mobile offers a great TFT display, great stereo speakers, microSD card slot, and a 2 megapixel camera capable of capturing video in the exciting VGA resolution, just to name a few. Exciting is not the word to use when describing the phone itself, but as you would see if you read further on, it surely packs in some nice features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6233</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main advantages:<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of design and form factor the phone resembles a lot the budget mobiles Nokia 6020, 6030, 6070 and 6080. In technological aspect though, it most certainly outperforms all of those. Feature-wise the phone is almost identical to Nokia 6280.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more version of the phone ? the Nokia 6234. It has a different design but the same hardware ? essentially, it is in fact a Vodafone branded version of Nokia 6233.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to some, 6233 is meant to be the successor of the highly successful business mobiles 6230 and its enhanced version 6230i. They earned their fans with rock solid functionality, rich features, advanced yet conservative design and last but not least impressive battery life. Starting this review, we saw our task as to decide whether it?s a successful continuation of the Nokia 62-series. And when we talk 62-series, we mean business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6233 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233?s interface is identical to the interface used in several other recent Nokia phones - the user interface is the last generation of the Series 40 platform. That is why we are going to use several paragraphs from other reviews. A nice thing about this phone is that although it is the same ?latest version? of the S40 UI, it features some innovations when compared to other ?latest? S40 phones such as Nokia 6270, Nokia 6280, and Nokia 6131. We would not necessarily point those out as we go along, but you may be sure that they are there in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As regards the retail package, besides the ordinary things, the box should include also a stereo headset HS-23 and a 64MB microSD card, but as we have always said ? the contents of the retail package are country and market dependant. The phone itself is offered in black or silver. The test unit we got was black.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Classic build<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 has a plastic body with a shiny metallic frame and a matt surface. It has dimensions of 108 x 46 x 18 mm and a weight 110 g. That surely doesn?t necessarily make it the lightest device, but when held in hand it feels very comfortable and you hardly notice the weight. The plastic looks give it a bit of a cheap look but once you get used to it you start to realize that it?s the small details that make it look classy. There is also a silver version which also might appeal to some of the consumers. The classic shape and construction do not make the phone dull in any case ? the more appropriate word to describe it would be ? discrete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6233 front view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a very solid build and didn?t give out any creaks during the testing. The display takes up the central part of the phone?s front body. Above it we see the silvery speaker aperture. A strange solution used by Nokia engineers is the lack of a frontal video camera while the phone itself supports video calls. The video image during such call is captured by the main 2 megapixel camera which effectively means that the video call feature is rather limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6233 display and speaker aperture</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right below the display is the 6233?s keypad. It features a central navigation D-pad which is rather comfortable to use and provides precise navigation. Our opinion is that it?s much more user-friendly than the rival Sony Ericsson solution used in some of their K-series mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing with the keypad is exceptionally easy. The keys are very well spaced allowing for fast typing even with big fingers right from the very start. It takes you no time to get used to it and generally speaking, it?s one of the most user-friendly keyboards we have used. A longer press on the zero key activates the phone Web browser. In the dark the keypad glows in blue color and all the keys are evenly lit except for the navigation D-pad which doesn?t have any backlighting at all. That is not necessarily a bad solution, we must add, and doesn?t hinder the work with the phone in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6233 keypad </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features the usual Push-to-Talk shortcut key and the microSD memory card slot cover. Unfortunately, the Push-to-talk feature doesn?t have a wide operator support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the PTT key is the left stereo speaker. Each of the speakers has dimensions of 15 mm x 11mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 6233 left side: PTT key, left speaker, memory card slot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side incorporates the swing volume button and the camera shortcut key. The Voice Dial and Voice Commands are entered after a longer press of the DOWN volume key. The commands are speaker independent and need not to be recorded in advance. Next to the volume key is the left stereo speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6233 right side: camera key, right speaker, swing volume key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone around we see the camera lens and the self-portrait mirror next to it. The bare design back of the phone looks cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6233 back view: camera lens and self-portrait mirror</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover takes up half of the back surface and comes off readily with a slide. The battery used here is the Li-Polymer Nokia BP-6M with a capacity of 1100 mAh. According to the manufacturer, the battery should provide up to 4 hours of talk time in GSM-only networks and up to 3.1 hours in 3G networks. The expected stand-by time is up to 340 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we couldn?t test the phone?s battery life since we used the phone heavily during our tests and thus the battery life we experienced is not indicative for the real-life performance of the phone. Looking at the official figures however, we may conclude that Nokia has set on continuing the tradition of long battery cycles in the 62-series phones. Usually the previous models managed to provide recharging cycles of up to a week when used in normal urban conditions. Removing the battery allows access to the SIM card bed which has a traditional hinged cover which holds the card in place. We must admit that it?s a very convenient solution.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The top part of the phone incorporates only the On/Off key which is traditionally used for invoking a menu for changing the current ringing profile. The bottom part of the mobile houses the proprietary Nokia Pop-port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6233 on/off key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6233 has a nice TFT display with a QVGA (320x240 pixels) resolution which proved great under direct sunlight. The legibility outperforms most of the displays of the other manufacturers in that price range.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Impressive sounds<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were very pleased with the reception quality of the handset. The voice of the other party was always clear and loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Dexter calling</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Listening to the sound of the stereo loudspeakers was a very pleasant experience since they are one of the best that we?ve seen in a mobile phone. They really sound in stereo and there are several tones in the phone that take advantage of the 3D effect technology to full extent allowing for truly enjoyable spatial stereo positioning. Comparing them to the stereo speakers of the Nokia 6270 is not really in their favor but we think that the ?stereo?-ness of the sound of Nokia 6270 is complemented by the bigger body which allows for a greater spacing between the two speakers. And after all, the spacing between two stereo speakers is one of the crucial factors for the achieving of the stereo effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having said all that, we are more than happy with the way 6233 sounds ? there is a certain presence of a bass element in it which is rarely the case with mobile phone speakers and the sound itself is clear and has no audible distortion whatsoever even at the highest volume level.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Series 40 UI is pretty customizable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard standby screen shows the signal strength, the battery capacity, the date and the clock (digital or analogue), the carrier name, and the active profile (if different than Normal). The two soft keys can be assigned a function according to the user?s preference. A wise choice would be to assign the Go To menu to one of the keys ? this menu includes frequently used functions and is totally user configurable. The four ways of the navigation D-pad can also be assigned some functions. You may also want to place a cross with the icons of the assigned functions in the middle of the display ? at least in the beginning while you remember them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface can be customized through graphic themes but they don?t really change much ? the only things that change are the wallpaper, the menu background and the color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Standby screen with digital and analog clock ? Go To menu ? shortcut indication</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   List of available graphic themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant fact is that you can choose the colors of the text on the standby screen from a wide array of available colors. Unfortunately, changing the font color is not available throughout the whole menu and when using some graphic themes legibility is not perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Available font colors</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting option as regards the standby screen is the Active stand-by mode, where all favorite applications? icons, music functions, upcoming events from the calendar, and notes appear on the display ? much like the one seen on Symbian phones with the third edition of the S60 Nokia user interface. When you have the Active stand-by mode switched on, pressing UP on the D-pad gives you access to the icon bar and your favorite functions such as the MP3 player, the FM radio or the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Shortcut bar can be placed where you want it ? the active standby screen is totally customizable </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu features a fixed set of items but they can be freely organized in four different ways: as a list, as a 3 x 4 grid matrix, as a 3 x 3 grid matrix with labels, and as horizontal tabs. The second option, a plain table without legends, permits the visualization of 12 icons en bloc and is probably the most space-saving one. Icons can additionally be reordered according to the user?s preference. The icons themselves are well elaborated except that their graphics suffer a hard case of jagged outlines. It must be noted that they resemble a lot the icons used in the third edition of the S60 Nokia user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Main menu different views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Font size is again subject of configuration. Inside the phonebook there are two font options, while in the message application and the Internet browser you can choose out of three. The largest font is truly large; on the other hand the smallest one permits you to see an entire SMS en bloc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Font size options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, Nokia 6233 allows a great deal of user-configurable options and the interface may be greatly suited to the user?s own taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ringing profiles include settings such as type of incoming call alert, ringtone, ringing volume and vibration alert, sounds serving Push to talk, messages, notifications and warning tones and the keypad sounds. A great thing about the profiles is that they offer timed expiration so you won?t forget to turn the sounds of your phone back on after that all-important meeting. You can even set a profile to be turned automatically on once plug in an accessory as the charger, for example. Now the phone offers a dedicated Airplane profile that switches off all active network connections in order to use the phone as a multimedia/radio player only in environments that do not allow cell phones. When the Airplane mode is switched on a large Airplane icon appears on the top of the screen. There is even an option to make the phone ask you every time you turn it on whether you would like the phone started directly into the Airplane profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Some of the Profile settings ? profile expiration time ? Airplane profile icon</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice innovation to the S40 interface is the possibility to use video recordings as incoming call alert. We got to point out though, that video files do not have the best quality of sound.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Your dearest contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 offers 500 contact positions which is a step backwards in comparison to Nokia 6230 and Nokia 6230i which had a phonebook with a capacity of 1000 contacts. According to some, the decreased capacity of the phonebook should be considered a serious drawback, but according to us not many people store more than 500 contacts in their phone. As usual with any Nokia?s phonebook, it can be organized in three different views: as a standard list, as a list of names with numbers, or as a list of names with pictures. Searching is performed by typing the first letters of the respective name. The phonebook can be ordered and searched either by first or last name. You can choose a default contact list ? the one on the SIM card, the one in the phone?s memory or both simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Phonebook: different contacts list views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact details can include five types of phone numbers, addresses, notes, a picture, a ringtone, etc. There is a field for entering a contacts birth date but there is no option to transfer it directly to the calendar. A nice feature though is the possibility to use video files as personalized ringing tones for contacts of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contact details fields</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer not to customize each individual contact, you could organize some contacts into groups and assign ringtones and pictures to the individual groups. When setting the ringing profiles you can select which groups will be able to reach you on the phone ? in this way the groups serve as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can freely use the voice dial feature of Nokia 6233 for all the contacts since it needs no voice tag recording. If the required contact has more than one number, Nokia 6233 uses the default one after letting you choose for a couple of seconds. It is quite a pity that the number type cannot be selected with an additional voice order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is that besides Voice dial, you can use the Voice commands option which is again speaker independent and can be used for voice control of a total of 16 preset phone functions like turning on or stopping the FM radio, the Infrared port reception, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Various voice commands</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Someone?s logging your calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The number of missed calls appears in a window on the main display. From here you can get to the corresponding log, where calls from the same number are grouped in one item accompanied by the date and the time of the last executed call. The same principle is applied for dialed and received calls as well. Each folder can fit in up to 20 items. And that is not everything. Nokia 6233 also offers a cumulative Calls Log, in which all call types, including multiple tries are organized in chronological order. You will also find a list of the recent Message recipients, as well as a counter for all sent and received messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Call log menu ? dialled numbers list ? call log list ? message log</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Message me!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 works with SMS, MMS, emails, and Push-to-talk. In addition, it offers two special types: sound MMS and instant SMS. The instant messages appear directly on the main screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start a new message, first you are offered the opportunity to enter the recipient?s number and then you can start typing your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison to previous S40 Nokia phones where the message is started on a single line which get extended further down on the whole display as the message gets longer, this time the place for typing is already stretched onto the whole screen. Messages are sent in the background which is really nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Messaging menu ? new SMS message ? available graphic emoticons </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When asked to type the recipient, you may type their phone number straight away, select it from the phonebook, browse groups, or look it up into the list of people, whom you have recently sent a SMS. The last option is particularly useful as people tend to write messages frequently to a limited group of contacts, which is in this case directly accessible. The editor counts down written characters and informs about the number messages that will be sent. T9 dictionary is also there to assist you and offers an extensive vocabulary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications about SMS delivery can be activated both individually for separate messages and generally for all outgoing ones. They appear on the display for a while and then get saved into the phone memory. The Delivery reports are stored in a dedicated folder which makes their deleting quite easy when their time has come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 features the new version of the MMS editor, which shows you the exact content of the message that the recipient is going to receive. So making previews as in older Series 40 Nokia models is no more necessary. MMS can contain text, a picture, a sound clip, a video record, a business card, and a note from the calendar. Multiple-page MMS are available as well. The email client in Nokia 6233 is a java application and thus takes longer to start; it is generally slower and it is not perfectly compatible with the rest of the applications in the phone. Nevertheless, the email client cannot be considered bad. It has POP3 and IMAP4 support. The email client copies email addresses from the phonebook and works with attachments. At the same time messages cannot be sent from the email field in the phonebook. Automatic download of email message is not available either. The email client offers automatic account configuration for the most popular email services providers but as it turned out with the Gmail it?s far than perfect and needs further fine adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Email account wizard ? detailed account settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no limitation in the size of the attachments to be sent. There is, however, a limitation of the size of the attachments that are going to be downloaded from the server. This limitation is user configurable but only up to 300KB. There is also a Spam filter which works by blacklisting the email addresses that you no longer want to receive mail from.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music in your ears<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though music files can be directly played either from the memory, or from the memory card (respective folder is selected in the music player application), it is more convenient to transfer music into the phone using the Nokia Audio Manager, which is a part of the PC Suite. Here you can create playlists and transfer music straight into the mobile device through a USB cable. The MP3 or AAC player integrated in Nokia 6233 is rather simple. The available controls are start/stop, fast forward, rewind, previous track and next track. If you minimize the player, the name of the currently running track appears on the active stand-by display. From active stand-by you can even choose to play the next track or fast forward or rewind the current without opening the player back. Repeating and shuffle options are available, too. If you stop the player in the middle of a song, the next time you turn it on, it would continue playing from the place it has stopped on. The music sounds very nice from the stereo speakers, there is a certain bass element, and you can hear virtually no cracks or creaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Music Player: main interface &amp; playing in the background on the active standby screen </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video in Nokia 6233 is played within an application called Media Player, which also supports streaming and can open pictures and play individual music files. The previous S40 Nokia phones had no option to fast forward videos but now you can set a user defined time jump with a minimum of 10 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Media player: playing in portrait and landscape modes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with the music/media player, switch on the FM radio. Here you can save up to 20 broadcasting stations. In general, however, it does not offer any special functions, not to mention RDS. The radio can be turned on only when the headset is plugged in since its cable serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The FM radio: storing a station &amp; playing in the background on the active standby screen </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Managing your multimedia files<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file manager is on a very good functional level. You can create folders, mark several or all files and then move them. Previous Series 40 models such as Nokia 6270 or 6280 do not allow to mark several files and then mass send them through Bluetooth or Infrared. We personally think that this is a great improvement. You can sort the file list either by name, by date, by format, or by size. The phone has a limited integrated memory of 6MB but the retail package should include a 64MB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Checking free space</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the picture files list either as a list with small thumbnails, as a list with details and larger thumbnails, or as a 4 x 3 grid matrix which offers the largest thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the pictures themselves in normal mode or in fullscreen landscape mode and move through the files with the help of the D-pad at a pace of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phone Gallery ? different thumbnail views </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone allows you to either zoom in the pictures to their original size or set their contrast. You can even print the images through direct USB connection using the Pictbridge standard. There is even a simple image editor which allows for basic functions such as inserting text, frame, clip art or another image to an already existing one. You can also crop the existing image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Viewing a picture in portrait and landscape mode ? Zooming in a picture to its original size</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera not bad at all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera. The maximum resolution is 1600 x 1200 pixels. Lower resolution as well as three types of compression quality is available, too. Furthermore the camera offers 8x digital zoom, which only makes digital crops of the original large image, so when you take pictures with the zoom used, you actually get a smaller resolution picture output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone takes pictures in landscape mode using the camera right side button as a shutter release key or the central OK button of the D-pad. Now we ended using mainly the central OK button since as we already mentioned the side keys among which is the Camera shortcut key are rather hard to press. The camera has a nice shooting speed. When taking pictures at the maximum resolution and maximum level of quality it takes around 3 seconds from pressing the shutter key to actually saving the picture on the memory card. When shooting in poor lighting conditions, the same exercise takes up to 4 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera viewfinder: still image and video mode ? camera interface against a dark background</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 offers a night mode, a self-release timer, and an image sequence shoot mode. In the image sequence shoot mode the camera takes up to four photos in quick succession. The higher the resolution, the fewer photos you can take sequentially. At the maximum resolution the phone takes a total of two pictures. There are several white balance presets you can choose from, along with an automatic mode. A good thing is the option to turn off the camera shutter sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides all that, the camera offers several image effects such as Sepia, Grey scale, Negative, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera options ? white balance settings ? camera effects</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the pictures taken is average. It shows good resolution, but the photos have a preprocessed look - just take a look at the foliage at the sample pictures and you will see what we mean. To make the pictures visually sharper some of the edges are oversharpened, even jaggy. It is strange that Nokia takes exactly the opposite approach in the cameras of their Symbian phones ? for example Nokia N71 takes a lot cleaner pictures, which respond better to editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>            Sample pictures in full resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Nokia 6233 photos in 1024 x 768 resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  There is no macro mode - the subject should be at least 80 cm from the lens</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An exciting feature of the camera is the option to record video clips at VGA (640 x 480 pixels) resolution. Video clips are recorded in the .3gp format at a speed of 15 frames per second. In video recording mode you can again apply color effects and adjust the white balance manually or automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the videos taken by a mobile phone the VGA resolution alone is an impressive feature. There aren?t many other available phones that can shoot videos in this resolution ? Nokia 6280 and some XCute models. Just for comparison, we can say that for each frame Nokia 6233 records 12 times more pixels than for example Sony Ericsson K800, which shoots in QCIF resolution. In the examples you can see the amount of detail the phone captures. It?s interesting that in low light conditions the video doesn?t lose as much of the picture quality as the still pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality it turns out that for such high resolution the 15 frames per seconds are not enough. When panning, for example, the videos look jerkier than the lower resolution videos with the same frame rate. If you want to shoot in VGA resolution with 30 frames per second you have to wait for the upcoming Nokia N93.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sample videos in VGA resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to save some memory space, you can use lower resolution for video capture. Here is a sample video shot in CIF resolution (352x 288 pixels).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Not that much of a browser?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 has a tri-band GSM support (900MHz, 1800MHz, and 1900MHz) plus CSD, HSCSD, GPRS Class 10, EDGE Class 10 and UMTS for fast data transfers and streaming 3gpp content. It?s got to be pointed out that the use of HSCSD services consumes the phone battery faster than normal voice or data calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a XHTML browser with WAP 2.0 support. The browser is simple, with three types of font size available. That said, we must point out that we are far from satisfied with the way it deals with general HTML sites. The best that it?s capable of is just simply converting those to ones similar to WML wap sites. Most of the sites are plainly unusable with some small exceptions. Searching with Google is a true nightmare too. Furthermore, you cannot use the browser in a horizontal mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 6233 web browser: visiting GSMArena.com and Google.com</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 can also serve as a modem for establishing Internet connection from PC. The phone gets connected to a PC through Bluetooth, via the Infrared port, or by USB cable. Connection parameters can be configured manually, but you will save time if you use the Internet connection program from PC Suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great feature is that you can now directly download updates of the phone firmware when newer versions become available. Other than that, the handset has an Infrared port and Bluetooth 2.0 connectivity for close communication with other devices. The phone supports the following Bluetooth profiles: hands-free, headset, object push profile, file transfer profile, dial-up networking profile, SIM access profile, and serial port profile.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organize yourself!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6233 has a separate Organizer menu which includes applications to help you stay on schedule. The Alarm clock allows for only one alarm to be set but it can be repeated on given days of the week. Nokia 6233 will wake you up with a standard peep sound, with any sound saved in the phone, or with radio signal, provided earphones are plugged in. The snooze time of the alarm is also configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar application is nicely developed. The monthly view includes details like the weeks and the week days, while the Weekly view includes details like the days and the hourly schedule for those days. The week begins according to the wish of the user - on Saturday, Sunday or Monday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers 5 types of events: meeting, call, birth date, memo, and reminder. The last one, the reminder, is used for fast inserting something that has to be reminded of soon. It is quite useful since in other mobiles you often need to use the ?meeting? option as a reminder one, which unnecessarily complicates things. The Reminder in Nokia 6233 includes the following details: subject, place, starting date and time, end date and time, reminder date and time, reminder type, repetition (never, daily, weekly, every two weeks, monthly, and annually). The phone offers synchronization of notes and calendar events with both a PC and a remote server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Organizer menu ? alarm clock options ? calendar: monthly &amp; weekly views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list is simple enough. Here you can only add a subject, a priority, a term, and a reminder type. Accomplished tasks can be marked off. List items can be ordered in alphabetic order or by deadline. Tasks are very easy to transfer into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are quite handy, because they get synchronized with PC, which allows for longer texts to be downloaded into the phone. Font size is not configurable. Yet, in my opinion it is the text notes where three font size options would have been really helpful (just like in the SMS application).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Setting up a To-do event ? putting down a note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 offers a voice recorder and as in all Series 40 Nokia models, the voice record duration depends on the available free memory only. The recorder cannot be used when a data call or GPRS connection is active but can freely be turned on during voice calls. It?s up to your will whether the recordings will be stored onto the internal memory or onto the memory card. Nokia 6233 uses the .amr format and a one-minute recording uses approximately 100 KB of the memory. Here Nokia engineers could have designed the side button on the left side of the phone to start the voice record instead the Push to talk function or at least it should have been made user configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu also has a countdown timer and a stopwatch. The Java applications include a unit &amp; currency converter, a world time clock, and a calculator. The latter is quite detailed, offering not only standard mathematic operations, but also work with powers, square roots, reciprocals, functions and memory functions. Yet, the calculator ignores common operator priority. There is even a translation application which doesn?t have a large vocabulary but does what it can in 7 languages.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>One of the things we missed is an application for viewing MS Office and Adobe Acrobat PDF files. Yet the phone allows you to read .txt files and we find that quite handy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Game controller<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 supports Java 2.0. The test phone we got featured 2 pre-installed games: Sudoku and Snake III. The Snake III game is a nicely elaborated 3D variant of the legendary Snake game and features interesting graphics, but disappoints when it comes to amusement. The controls are rather complicated and you can hardly get the apple you are after since the snake doesn?t turn in the right moment you want it to turn. There are two in-game views available ? one where the camera follows the snake?s head and another one that watches the game sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sudoku game is in fact a .swf game and it portrays really nice the support of the phone for that platform. The game itself is rather popular, so if you are one of those who enjoy it, you would surely have some great times with it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6233 impressed us from the very beginning. During the tests we were convinced that it is user-configurable in almost every possible way. The menu is organized logically; functions are detailed, offering high control comfort and brilliant work efficiency. When compared to other Series 40 phones, this one has taken care of a lot of their drawbacks. We can say for sure that it?s a trustworthy successor of the famous 6230 and 6230i business phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a very nice design, although a bit on the conservative side, we must admit. It doesn?t have the looks of a very expensive device and on the other hand it?s not expected to be one. There is always a possibility to go for the cheaper Nokia 6234 which has the same functionality and is the Vodafone-branded version of this mobile. While being cheaper in price, we must say that it also has cheaper looks ? but that?s our personal taste of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Summing it up, the feature-rich package would undoubtedly turn this handset into a market hit. Just wait and see.</paragraph>
