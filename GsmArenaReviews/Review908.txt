			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From the makers of the Nexus 7, which pretty much got Android back in the tablet game, a convertible 10.1" slate is ready to step out of the living room and shake off the stay-at-home, only-good-for-media-consumption image of ten-inchers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fourth generation into it, the Transformer Pad lineup aims to offer a solution for both home and office. ASUS is unafraid to see Android as an environment where actual work can be done, and challenge the likes of the Microsoft Surface and the Lumia 2520.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meet the ASUS Transformer Pad TF701T, the Android tablet that's not afraid to take anything you throw at it. Don't be afraid to come closer, it won't bite. But make no mistake about it, the Transformer Pad is one tough tablet and we're not just saying that because of its aluminum build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>See what we're on about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mouthwatering specs and premium build quality are just a part of the story. Remember, this is a Transformer, so its mobile dock is a major element of the experience. Happily, ASUS have paid due attention to this part of the equation. It does not have the aluminum finish of the actual tablet, but we don't mind as it certainly helps keep both weight and price in check.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ASUS has partnered with Sharp to catch up with Samsung and Apple and put forward a high-resolution display of its own. The 2560 x 1600 IPS screen of the Transformer Pad is going after the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition and the Apple iPad 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Tegra 4 chipset featuring a quad-core Cortex-A15 CPU, the Transformer Pad has the processing power and future-proofing covered. The latest and greatest from Nvidia is eager to make up for lost time and this latest Transformer is its perfect playground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more than meets the eye with the ASUS Transformer Pad and we've yet to delve into what this slate is really capable of. Not before a proper warm-up though - follow us on our usual hardware tour.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ASUS Transformer Pad TF701T comes in a single box (unlike some other hybrid devices of the company) and only has the essential accessories. The wonderful news is the dock/keyboard is part of the standard bundle. You'll find an AC adapter as well, and a detachable cable ending on a proprietary 36-pin connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual documentation is there too but no headphones to speak of, or any other accessories like a carrying sleeve for example. Now, we're pushing it really, about that last bit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ASUS Transformer Pad itself doesn't seem to have been changed at all compared to its predecessor - the Transformer Pad Infinity 700 - at least visually. Internally, it's a whole different story, which we're going to deal with later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 263 x 180.8 x 8.9 mm, the Transformer Pad is 0.5mm thicker than the model it replaces. Not that this is a deal breaker, in fact it's not even noticeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ASUS has managed to make the Transformer Pad lighter than the outgoing model by 13 grams (585 vs. 598g), which is hardly a difference you can feel in real life. And since the competition hasn't been sitting still, the Transformer Pad is notably heavier and thicker than the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition and the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, not to mention the iPad Air.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus went for Gorilla Glass 2 as their protection of choice for the gorgeous 10.1" IGZO IPS display. It's not as tough as the latest generation Gorilla Glass 3, but it's nice to know that scratches and light damage aren't not on the Transformer Pad's list of fears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen bezels are fairly generous, which isn't such a bad thing after all, considering you'll need as good a grip as possible on a slate of 10-inch diagonal. However, we found that the front gets really messy after some usage, as there's no oleophobic coating to prevent this from happening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the tablet is immune to this as it is made of aluminum and is really nice to both hold and look at. It's a brushed aluminum finish which is further accented by the company's trademark spun metal finish and the ASUS logo sitting proudly in the middle. Aluminum at the back allows for even heat dissipation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another benefit of using aluminum is that the Transformer Pad feels extremely solid. There's no squeaking, bending or twisting even when using the tablet with one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the ASUS Transformer Pad isn't picture perfect. It's the bottom of the device that gets most of our gripes. There, we find holes for docking with the keyboard station, which are fairly large and easily collect dust. Not to mention the ASUS 36-pin proprietary port used for charging and data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are small caveats though that can't take away from the Transformer Pad being a handsome tablet with plenty of personality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the big 10.1" screen of the slate is a 1.2MP front-facing camera that can record 1080p video @ 30 fps, just like the main camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All physical controls and ports of the Transformer Pad are located on its sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock is in the top left corner, in landscape. It has a tiny LED, which gets lit when the tablet is being charged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is located on the short side, just off the power key. Below it is the microSD card slot, as well as the microHDMI port and the 3.5mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features a 36-pin proprietary ASUS connector in the middle, a hinge hole on either side to attach the keyboard dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side you'll also find the mic that picks up the audio when recording video. Other than this, the right side is blank.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mobile dock<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ASUS Transformer Pad's mobile dock accessory is an integral part of the Transformer line experience. It's been around since the inception of the slate and turns the 10.1" tablet into an Android-powered ultrabook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It sports a full-size QWERTY keyboard, additional connectivity ports and its own power source. The dock itself is made entirely out of plastic, which may not feel as premium as the slate, but it's still solidly made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard itself is of the Chiclet variety and is quite comfortable to type on, albeit a bit cramped. That's understandable, though, considering the little space ASUS had to work with. The keys are square, with reasonable spacing. Keys have low stroke but more than decent feedback. The only thing that might be a problem is the keyboard size (in laptop terms), but given the available space Asus actually did an excellent job here. And once you get used to it, you'll enjoy very decent typing speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, as we found out, the dock does give in a bit in the center when you apply pressure. It's not the end of the world by any means, but it takes away some of the high-end vibe of the whole package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, below the keyboard, there's a not too-small trackpad with no mouse buttons. It's slightly recessed from the surrounding surface, to provide proper touch orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A two-finger tap acts as a right-click. Other gestures include two finger top and side scrolling as well as pinch-to-zoom. Those are more comfortable on the large 10.1" touchscreen, but it's nice of ASUS to double them on the trackpad as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The docking latch protrudes a tiny bit at the back of the dock. It's very strong; closing and opening it feels sturdy and solidly put together. The latch has two hooks that hold the tablet into place quite firmly. In fact, they hold the Transformer Pad so securely, that even turning it upside down isn't a problem as it almost feels glued to the docking station. It's actually locked and you need to undo the clamp to release the tablet from the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the Mobile dock there are four tiny rubber feet to make sure it doesn't slip. On the right hand side we find a full-size USB 3.0 port and an SD Card reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side holds only the ASUS proprietary 36-pin connector port used for charging and data transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ASUS Transformer Pad TF701T flaunts an excellent 10.1" IGZO IPS LCD display. The company has partnered with Sharp who supply their IGZO panel for the Transformer Pad. Thanks to the IGZO technology, the slate boasts a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels resulting in a pixel density of 300ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's very little color and contrast loss when the slate is viewed from extreme angles. However, it's quite bright at 400 nits, which shows when you get the tablet outside the comfort of the living room. On a bright and sunny day you won't experience any issues working with the Transformer Pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the Transformer Pad's display matrix up close:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ASUS Transformer Pad TF701T is equipped with a 7820mAh Li-Po battery. By ASUS estimates, the tablet is expected to last up to 13 hours of continuous usage. Add the dock to the equation and ASUS reckons a total of 17 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional battery tests on the Transformer Pad and we got a total of 10:07 hours of movie watching and 9:43 hours of web browsing. That's pretty impressive compared to the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition, which got 9:02 hours of movie playing and just 7:39 hours of web browsing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean runs the show<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Transformer Pad comes equipped with Android 4.2 Jelly Bean out of box. Right after we booted the tablet up we got prompted to update to Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, which was a nice surprise. Whether ASUS is planning an update to Android 4.3 or the soon-to-be-announced Android 4.4 KitKat is too early to tell, but history shows the company is taking good care of its flagship devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jelly Bean means the Transformer Pad enjoys the benefits of Project Butter, which keeps the framerate of animations at a constant 60 fps and delivers buttery smooth visuals. Combining the power of the four Cortex-A15 cores and the Nvidia mobile GPU, the Transformer Pad offers a virtually lag-free user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we've prepared a video tour of tablet's user interface, including a video demo of the mobile dock. Check it out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus continues to rely on a nearly stock Android look and feel, keeping the launcher and most of the user interface untouched. Nevertheless, the company has provided some customizations here and there that enhance the experience, which we'll point out to you as we go along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a standard stock Android 4.2 Jelly Bean affair. There's a large dotted circle around the right-positioned unlock button. Dragging around the unlock icon in any direction unlock the tablet. There's no camera shortcut anywhere to be found, but we won't say that's a big deal on a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you need it you can take advantage of the option to add up to eight custom app shortcuts. They take the top half of the circle and are easy to select.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As this is Jelly Bean, the left side next to the unlock button gets treated with lockscreen widgets (one widget per a pane). You can view multiple of them by sliding the widget to the left. To add a new one, tap the plus icon to unveil all of the available widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Transformer Pad also rocks multi-user support. If you have more than one user set for the tablet, you'll see their images as circles at the bottom of the screen. This is a great way to share a tablet at home as everyone will get to use the Transformer Pad as they like - as long as you don't want to use it at the same time, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap a circle to switch to that user, which will also change everything from settings through what installed apps are installed to what files are accessible. So, if you snap a photo while signed into your account, it will only be accessible from that account. That works even when you hook up the tablet to a computer - you can't access files from another account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the default Jelly Bean homescreen has hardly changed from stock Android. There are still the usual five homescreen panes, with no option for added more, or removing unneeded ones. For that you'll need a custom launcher (many good ones are available for free on the Play Store).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A portion along the bottom of the display has been reserved for three on-screen buttons - Back, Home, Recent apps and Floating widgets (more on that later). These buttons, safe for the latter, are placed in the center, which on a 10.1" tablet in landscape orientation can be hard to reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above them are eight customizable app shortcuts divided into two groups of four. In the middle, there's the app drawer icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus has been kind enough to include some custom widgets of their own including a task manager, number of unread emails, along with Weather and Battery widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification center has been slightly revamped and looks a bit different from stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick toggles have been added , plus shortcuts to the settings menu and Wi-Fi networks. ASUS has included shortcuts to its special Asus Audio Wizard feature, screen and sharing settings. Below the quick toggles, there's a Brightness slider with an Auto option for quick screen adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick toggle buttons themselves allow you to toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile data (more can be added from the Settings menu). Notifications can be expanded and collapsed with a two-finger swipe, and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders in Jelly Bean haven't been changed since Ice Cream Sandwich. A folder is created by dropping a shortcut on top of another and can be renamed by tapping on the "Unnamed folder" label. Opening a folder expands it only by as much as is needed to fit the icons inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer on the Transformer Pad consists of five rows of icons and the usual Apps and Widgets tab at the bottom. ASUS has tweaked the drawer to allow for highly adjustable view modes. There are three tabs at the bottom that give you the option to see All apps or only the Downloaded or most Frequently used ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top right, there's an additional alphabetical sorting option. A cool addition is the App Lock feature, which allows you to lock an app and hide it from the app drawer. You can get access to it after you set a password, which you later use to gain access to the app "locker".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a Jelly Bean-style vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. A sideways swipe removes the app from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most prominent ASUS customizations to the user interface is the semi-circle menu that's revealed with a swipe up of the Home button. It's separated into two parts: the inner circle holds 5 predefined shortcuts - Voice search, Lockscreen, Google Now, App drawer and System settings. The outer part has up to 8 user-defined app shortcuts - they are the same ones as the lock-screen app shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned, Asus has added a fourth onscreen button - Floating widgets. Floating widgets are small, independent windows that are overlaid over anything else - the homescreen, regular full-screen apps, anything. You can fit two or three of those on the large 10.1" screen and they really improve the multitasking capabilities of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Available Floating widgets include a calculator, calendar, email, dictionary, Asus' BuddyBuzz and the AudioWizard. If you don't intend to use any of those apps, you can always hide them. Additionally, you can specify a custom Floating widget by selecting any of the available regular widgets. Then, it gets automatically made into a floating one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now is awesome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now was first introduced in Jelly Bean 4.1 and is definitely one of the most interesting additions to the OS. Simply put, it's Google's version of a personal assistant. Google Now is in the same neck of the woods as Apple's Siri, but it learns constantly from your use patterns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's accessed by swiping up on any of the three on-screen controls and gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work the same route every morning? Google Now will let you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office and will offer to re-route you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you with score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google constantly updates Google Now and in its latest version has become even smarter. If you allow it, the service can scan your email for upcoming flights, deliveries or restaurant reservations and let you know when they are due. There are also numerous kinds of cards like birthdays (yours and those of your contacts and friends in the Google+ social network) and what distance you've walked in a particular month. The last one could definitely feel creepy for some users, but it's easy to turn off from the Google Now settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made things faster as it's not dependent on the speed of your data connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in regards to accuracy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Transformer Pad TF701T is powered by a very rare beast. It's the Nvidia Tegra 4 T40X and is Nvidia's hope of tackling the big guns on the market, namely the Snapdragon 800. The chip packs a 1.9GHz quad-core Cortex-A15 CPU with 2GB of RAM. The GPU is Nvidia's own 72-core Ultra-Low Voltage GeForce.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may be uncommon, but it promises to be a beast of a performer. At least in theory. The Tegra 4 was big news back in February, but now as we're gearing towards the end of the year, it's got a lot to prove if it wants to play with the big boys in the chip arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up in our battery of benchmark tests was BenchmarkPi, which tests the calculative performance of the individual processor cores. Here, the Transformer Pad comes in third in the list with the LG G Pad 8.3 and Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition beating it, but not by much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our compound benchmarks, the Transformer Pad did well once again, but not as well as the Note 10.1 competitor. The difference is small - 32991 vs. 33198, but it's enough to put the Nvidia 4 rocking Transformer Pad behind. The story repeats itself in the Quadrant and Geekbench 3 tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GFXBench (formerly GLBenchmark) tests off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution and getting numbers for raw GPU power. The Transformer Pad didn't perform too well here, scoring a bit lower than its main rivals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But video benchmarks running at native resolution will give the most accurate portrayal of real world performance, which is why we've included the Unreal Engine 3-powered Epic Citadel benchmark. Unreal Engine is popular with mobile game makers, so it's a pretty important test. The ULV GeForce GPU couldn't rank at the top of the cart here, but the good news is it managed to outperform the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition by 5fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our browser benchmarks show some great numbers from the Transformer Pad, with the tablet toping the category in the SunSpider web benchmark. With HTML 5 thrown into the mix in Browsermark and Vellamo, the Transformer Pad continues its great performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>

			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the ASUS Transformer Pad and its Nvidia Tegra 4 chip perform as well as you would expect it. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset outperformed Nvidia Tegra 4 in a large portion of the tests, but in real life the two perform equally great, delivering smooth lag-free performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook is the stock Android app, which has undergone a cosmetic surgery from ASUS to look the part on a 10.1" tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's made up of three tabs that you can switch between with side-swipes. The first tab is the default one, listing all of your contacts. Contacts are listed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name, and viewed as first name or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's regular search as you type too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the landscape view of the Transformer Pad offers a lot of space, the quick contacts feature is kind of redundant. Tapping on a contact displays its details on the right pane, that takes 2/3 of the screen. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers or addresses. These tabs can be navigated with sideways swipes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view displays the contact's name along with a star to favorite a contact and a Settings button that lets you edit, share or delete a contact, as well assign custom ringtones to them or set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under that is a list of all contact info sorted by category - phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts that the phonebook displays can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even group (so you can hide all contacts that don't belong in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two major tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is readily thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Speakerphone loudness<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We put the Transformer Pad through our traditional loudspeaker test and it earned a Below average score. Despite ASUS boasting its SonicMaster technology that it feature in its single speaker on the Transformer Pad, it's not the loudest around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out more about the test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email and messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app offers a split-screen interface similar to that of the People app. You can add multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the top, there're shortcuts to compose, search or refresh, along with a contextual menu. The top menu changes when you have multiple emails selected, allowing you to perform batch operations such as archive, delete, create labels, or mark as read/unread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android 4.2 Jelly Bean on the Transformer Pad tablet comes with a ASUS customized looking Android keyboard. It's quite wide in landscape mode, so you might want to switch to portrait. This makes it much more manageable as you can actually reach the middle buttons with your thumbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is to enable the so-called gesture typing and use only one hand for input. Gesture typing is similar to Swype and other third party keyboards in that you don't tap individual keys but swipe over instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's very good at guessing what it is you're trying to type and a feature can be enabled that keeps a floating label above your finger with the current guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But you can go further and "type" hands-free too - Google has baked the voice recognition algorithms needed to run it into Android itself. Not only does this make Voice typing faster, but also eliminates the need for an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, you can download up to 15 localized language packs for offline voice typing, although we imagine that Google are working on adding more. The language packs are quite small in size (the default English (US) pack comes in at just 22 MB), so you don't need to worry about them using up your precious storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Jelly Bean, the Android keyboard's nuts and bolts got updated as well. It now features smarter dictionary and learning algorithms, so the more you type, the better it can predict what you're trying to say. It resembles Swiftkey's smart dictionary system, but only time will tell if it performs as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, since this is the Transformer Pad, most of the typing is probably going to happen using the Mobile dock. As we mentioned earlier, it rocks a Chclet-style keyboard and is comfortable to type on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because of its small footprint, it can feel a bit difficult to type on at first, but ASUS has provided good spacing between the keys to make it less confusing and more natural to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are specific Android keys, which we found helped with productivity. On the top row, there are quick Android function keys (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Touchpad on/off, brightness toggle, camera switch, Browser and setting shortcuts. On the left side of the space key there's a Search key, while on the right side sits a Menu key.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ASUS Transformer Pad Gallery app bears little change from its smartphone counterparts. The Default view of the gallery is Albums, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is the 'Make available offline' feature - it lets you easily select multiple online albums and download them for offline viewing. The Gallery app supports online albums like Picasa (but not Facebook) and you can set it to sync photos only over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside an album, the photos are displayed in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to let you know you can't get further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single photo view is updated too - above the photo there are several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with even more options. The editor can be accessed via a small icon in the bottom left-hand corner and offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app called Movie Studio handles video editing and it's quite feature-rich. You can add multiple videos to the timeline and trim their start and end points. You can also include titles and effects (including transitions), add music, and there are multiple options available when you decide to export the video (resolution, quality, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a great app that can completely eliminates the need for a more powerful computer-based video editor for most people. The same goes for the image editor too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ASUS relies on Google's own Play Music player on the Transformer Pad TF701T. It features the Listen Now feature, which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen uses the song album art and gives you a quick shortcut to the rest of the artist's songs along with the play controls. You can also create playlists and Google will offer you to make a playlist of the most popular songs you play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface features the album art with the track info and playback controls beside it. You can tap it to reveal more options - upvote/downvote the song, a scrubber and shuffle and repeat toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock video player with choppy DivX playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player hasn't got any attention from ASUS, albeit there being a dedicated videos app). The Asus Transformer Pads default video player offers very buggy support for either DivX codecs with playback being choppy. XviD is totally not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player is quite limited in what it can do - you get play/pause and a slider to scrub through the video but that's it. Support for subtitles and .WMV files is also still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Asus Transformer Pad plays very well, however, are .MP4 files. It didn't think twice about playing either 720p or 1080p full HD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ideally, you will be better off with one of the many alternative video players on the Google Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ASUS has also implemented wireless video sharing to a Wi-Fi-enabled TV. The feature relies on good ol' DLNA technology to connect and the Miracast protocol for streaming. It's another feature ASUS competitors have offered for a while and is nice to see ASUS offer similar functionality as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Transformer Pad TF701T didn't do particularly well in our audio output test. Its volume levels were pretty high, but so was distortion and frequency response left something to be desired.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones was also fairly high as even more distortion crept in and stereo quality worsened by more than the average amount. We would have certainly expected better overall performance from a high-end device, let alone a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Transformer Pad features a 5MP auto-focus camera, which shoots stills of up to 2592x1944 pixels in 4:3 mode. There's also a 16:9 mode available, which produces shots of 4MP with a resolution of up to 2592x1456. It's also capable of shooting 1080p videos at 30fps, as well as 720p at both 30fps and 60fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ASUS has remade the camera interface to fit nicely on the 10.1" display. It's divided into two parts. The left holds three large buttons - front/rear camera switch, camera effects and settings menu. The right part houses a zoom slider, and four shortucts. The first one of them gets you to the gallery, while below it are the shutter and camcorder keys. The last one is the shooting modes, which we'll take a look at in a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The module sitting behind the camera protection glass deatures a Sony-made BSI sensor with a 5-element lens and f/2.4 aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the Transformer Pad 2 also offers an array of features and modes including Panorama, portrait and HDR. Asus has added an additional mode dubbed Beautification. Besides face detection, it's an advanced sort of facial recognition and lets you have some fun with eye enlargement effects as well as ski shine and post-process cheek blushing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Smart Remove, which removes objects from photos. In our testing it did a half-good job at it, as more complex compositions confuse the software. Still, it's a nice touch for more simple photos, where you want to remove unwanted objects that walked into your frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos that the Transformer Pad's camera outputs have an about average amount of detail for the 5MP league. The overly cold color reproduction, is another gripe we have with the samples and noise levels are fairly high, too. Certainly not a spectacular performance here, but then again we wouldn't recommend using a tablet as you main snapper anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the Transformer Pad offers a built-in HDR mode. Here's a comparison of a scene with HDR off and on. The Transofrmer Pad does a decent job of the challenging scene, adding lots of extra detail in both the shadows and highlights. Contrast suffers a bit, but it's certainly not too bad.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera of the ASUS Transformer Pad is capable of shooting 1080p videos at 24fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored as .mp4 using the h.264 (Baseline Level 3 for 720p, Baseline Level 4 for 1080p) and records mono audio at 96kbps, 44KHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous auto-focus is available here as well, but you can switch to Smart-AF, allowing you to set a single point using the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the quality of the actual videos recorded with the camera isn't spectacular. Metering is too enthusiastic and clips end up overexposed more often than not, while the level of detail isn't anything worth writing home about. White balance isn't too great either and while noise is kept neatly under control it's not enough to save the day here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the untouched 1080p video sample (0:09s, 16.1MB) video sample taken directly from the Asus Transformer Pad.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the top dog in the Asus' tablet lineup, the Transformer Pad features a wide array of connectivity options. In fact, the only thing it's missing is GSM network connectivity. Some of its rivals, such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition) have a SIM card slot for extra versatility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. We would have liked to see the latest ac standard be present, as it would've fitted the slate rather well. Still, Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA are part of the package. Wi-Fi Direct is a technology, which enables devices to connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology, two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to an eventual Bluetooth demise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some reason, ASUS has opted out of packing the Transformer Pad with NFC capabilities. However, the Transformer Pad also comes with a built-in A-GPS receiver that can rely on a digital compass and a barometer too (this helps get faster GPS locks).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For wired connections, the Transformer Pad utilizes its special, 32-pin USB port. Sadly, it doesn't come with support for mass storage, but it does support MTP, which is second best. Thankfully, the slate comes with USB on-the-go too, so You can hook up a USB flash drive and browse its contents. Pairing with a keyboard and a mouse isn't a problem, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a microHDMI connector on the side, allowing you to hook it up to an HDTV and is perfect for playing movies on the big screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there's Mobile Dock, which features a full-sized USB 3.0 port that you can hook up to external storage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The stock ICS browser has a streamlined interface, incognito browsing and other cool features. Since the Transformer Pad runs Jelly Bean, you can't sideload Flash support onto it. We weren't able to get YouTube videos to play in-page, and Flash games were a no-go as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser UI is quite minimalistic; all you get is the URL bar with a tabs shortcut. Hitting the Menu key you get more options - Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading. There's also a scrollbar on the right, which makes for going up and down easy, as well as quickly zooming to the top or bottom of the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search engine to Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser borrows several features from its desktop counterpart. For example, when searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result, it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it. You can set this feature to work over Wi-Fi only to preserve data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like the Recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls (available from the Labs settings) reveal five controls (New tab, Tabs, URL, Bookmarks, More) when you slide your finger in from the left or right. Another cool feature from Labs is Full screen, which squeezes in a little more screen real estate by hiding the status bar.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Transformer Pad has the full version of the Polaris Office 5.0 suite for viewing and editing documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Polaris Office has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable and panning is blazing fast. You can edit a wide variety of settings and documents, and there's also cloud storage integration (Dropbox, Box and Google Drive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info about upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries but you can't edit them on the phone - they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch-optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can enable advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms) in either portrait or landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, as well as weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player. There's no world clock, stopwatch or timer though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather app utilizes the 10.1" perfectly and shows the current weather condition on the left third of the display. The forecast for the next six days are displayed on the right of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Recorder app lets you create voice memos that you can save and listen to later.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You are in good hands with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Transformer Pad comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute and a half to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can enable the A-GPS to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage the cache of that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to fit New York and parts of the surroundings before Maps told us the area is too big. Another things is, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Transformer Pad runs Jelly Bean, so it has no problems accessing all of the latest apps. The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There are usually several screenshots of the app in action, and oftentimes a demo video as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Google Play Store and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.), so if you wish you could do something more with your phone, odds are it's in the app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Transformer Pads are a rare breed but that's hardly a surprise given it's almost exclusively tablets that make a name for ASUS as an Android manufacturer. The Nexus line obviously, the Transformers, the Memo pads and the PadFone Infinity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latter is the closest they have to a phone but it too is a convertible tablet more than anything else. So, ASUS may've given up smartphones for good but that's not stopping it from leaving a profound mark with clever hybrid devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Transformer Pad TF701T is one and it's the fourth generation tablet/ultrabook, a concept ASUS was exploring before the Windows 8-powered devices arrived at the scene. And the latest transformer certainly does well to upgrade the predecessor in terms of screen resolution and processing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 10.1" IGZO IPS display is not only power-efficient, but very color-accurate and sufficiently bright. The resolution is as high as it gets on a tablet, at 2560 x 1600, and is a pleasure to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news keep on coming on the hardware front with Nvidia's top Tegra 4 chipset boasting 1.9GHz quad-core Cortex-A15 CPU and a whopping 72-core ultra-low-power GeForce GPU. As we found out it manages to keep up with the powerhouse that the rivaling Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard dock hasn't changed significantly - the full-size USB 3.0 port is the most notable difference. But it does add a quite comfortable QWERTY keyboard and an extra pack of juice, for several hours of extra use on top of the tablet's own battery. There's a full-size SDXC memory card slot too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the only thing that got downgraded is the camera, which has lost the LED flash too. But that's never going to be a huge loss in a tablet, let alone one that converts into an ultrabook. The more serious issue to consider is the lack of an LTE or 3G-enabled version - but if the original Transformer Pad lineup is anything to go by, these should be in the pipeline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even such a well-equipped and properly powered gadget isn't going to be an easy sell for ASUS, as the competition isn't having a break either. And the fact that some of the most likely contenders are not even droids doesn't make it any easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's first ever tablet, the Lumia 2520, is rocking a potent Snapdragon 800 chipset and running Windows 8.1 RT, touted as the mobile OS that's best at getting things done. Make no mistake, though - this is isn't a proper Windows slate and the lack of RT apps is certainly limiting the capabilities of the first Nokia slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 2520 is offered with a detachable keyboard too, which also comes with an extra battery that provides up to 5 hours of additional power. The problem is the combo will cost about ?100 more than the Transformer Pad and you will be getting a lower resolution screen. The LTE support will probably help make up for that for many of you, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Surface 2 is another formidable rival, in its second generation too. It now has an improved touch keyboard and the power (or lack thereof) of Windows RT 8.1 OS. It's not a full-blown Windows experience, but you'll still get a plethora of unrivalled productivity tools such as MS Office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Microsoft Surface 2 ? Nokia Lumia 2520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On home Android turf, the Galaxy Note 3 10.1 2014 Edition packs a similarly high-resolution display, but in a lighter and slimmer body. Granted, it's a plastic one, but the leather finish looks even better on a larger scale than on the Galaxy Note 3 phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is of course on board and in its latest iteration, it has learned a lot of new tricks and has become even better at multi-tasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet Z is light, beautifully crafted and isn't afraid of the elements thanks to its cleverly designed glass body. It costs about the same as the Asus tablet but for the price ASUS throws in the Mobile dock, which the Japanese, just like Samsung, have no meaningful response to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Tablet Z Wi-Fi</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we're talking tablets, there's no we can do without Apple, especially with the new iPad Air just unveiled. The slimmest and lightest full-sized slate around, the Apple flagship also has the richest selection of tailor made apps in the tablet space. However its lack of expandable storage means you will need to go for the 32GB version at least and if you need the extra productivity coming with a keyboard dock that's a premium of at least ?200 you have to pay. It may as well be worth it, but with this kind of price difference the two slates aren't exactly direct rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad Air</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The competition in the tablet market has never been more fierce, but this Transformer seems to have found its own niche. The Windows-RT-powered hybrids will be the real test, with both Surface and Lumia devices bound to heap pressure on droids with a thing for productivity. Yet, Android seems to have a great defense line prepared with Asus and the Transformer Pad.</paragraph>
