			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's quite a lot to the LG V10 - a flagship, a phablet, a camera phone, a rugged phone, a Hi-Fi phone and the first of the new V-series. It's a feature-packed device and its signature feature is the secondary always-on display and a dual selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until recently, the LG G4 and the G Flex2 ruled LG's lineup as co-flagships, but now there is only one king. In our preview we described it as "G4 on steroids" and the longer we spend with the LG V10, the more we are convinced this is an apt description.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary display is essentially one line above the main screen that can be left on 24/7 and serves for notifications and shortcuts. This is to the notification light as email is to Morse code - a much richer way to give you at-a-glance info of what happened since you last checked your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen secondary screens like this one before, but this is our first dual selfie camera. LG solved the problem of group selfies ('groufies') by adding a super-wide 120° camera, in addition to the standard 80° one. Many more of your friends can now fit into the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main camera is very impressive too, it features the most comprehensive set of manual controls we've ever seen on a mobile device. Even PureView Lumias and Samsung's smartphone/camera hybrids didn't have some of the settings available on the LG V10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then there's the fingerprint reader, the 32-bit Hi-Fi DAC and the premium headphones. Here's the short version of it, we'll do a deep dive into the top features of the V10 as soon as we're done with the intro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 provides a nice antithesis of the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+. Their sealed back compartments and glass backs (which double the chance of cracks when dropped) make them seem more vain than practical. Also, the Galaxy S6 edge+ does not use its dual-curved screen as a separate control like last year's Note edge did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG issues a serious challenge to other makers on the camera and audio battlefields with the V10. The phone is also LG's first to feature a fingerprint reader since 2009's GW820 eXpo (not counting the Google-designed Nexus 5X).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to get started since there's a lot of ground to cover. The bodywork on the LG V10 is quite complex, the software section has to explain why you need a secondary screen and the camera section has a couple of new terms to introduce to the world of smartphone photography.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail box with premium headphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 comes with a box suitable for its flagship status. It looks ordinary, but when you take out the inner box, it opens like a book - one half holds the V10, the other contains the accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with a Quick Charge 2.0 charger, which will rejuvenate your battery from flat to 50% in 40 minutes. There's a microUSB cable to go with that. Also, our unit came with a pre-applied screen protector that has no visible markings and you can just leave on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quad Beat 3 headset provided with the LG V10 looks pretty great. The cables are hidden in fabric sleeves while the ear plugs, the remote control, and the 3.5mm jack have a brushed metal highlights (it's actually plastic). This particular color combo is white fabric and golden faux metal, other Quad Beats are usually Black or Red.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This seems to be exclusive to the LG V10 for now and better yet, this headset has been tuned by AKG, a company known for high-quality headphones. The V10 also has a high-quality DAC to drive these headphones, but we'll get to that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG V10 360° spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 is bigger than other devices in its class at 159.6 x 79.3 x 8.6mm. A good point of comparison is the iPhone 6s Plus, which shaves off a few millimeters (but it also has a smaller screen, 5.5" vs. 5.7"). The V10 weighs as much as the Apple phablet too, 192g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you were hoping for some LG bezel magic, the V10 doesn't deliver. It fits well enough in the hand for its screen size and given its size the weight doesn't feel overwhelming. Still, it could have been more compact and a lot lighter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 is an exercise in rugged design and premium engineering. The chassis, which LG has dubbed Dura Guard, is built out of 316L stainless steel (which is harder and heavier than aluminum). Stainless steel is covered with chromium oxide and when scratched, the chromium underneath reacts with oxygen from the air and heals the scratch, preventing further damage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second part of the equation is Dura Skin, an elastic, silicone-like material that is twice as resistant to scratches as plastic and 10x better than aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 is shock-resistant, living up to this particular part of the MIL-STD-810G standard. Analysis of real life drops showed LG that nearly half of all phones land on their corners. There are silicone bumpers to absorb the shock. Furthermore, the rigid steel frame does not flex, which prevents the glass from cracking. On other phones, the frame can flex more than the glass, causing it to crack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This leaves direct hits to the glass - LG calculated that 26% of the phones will land on their faces and the Gorilla Glass 4 panel is their last line of defense in these cases. LG has provided the V10 with a dual-layer Gorilla Glass 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen below that GG4 is a 5.7" Quantum display. It has a fairly unique configuration, though - the secondary line display is actually part of the same panel, but LG cut off the top right corner to make the two selfie cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not as simple as that, though, the line display actually features its own display controller and backlight. This keeps power usage low, enough to leave the secondary display on 24/7. We can't help but think this would have been simpler with an AMOLED display, but still kudos to LG for not shying away from an engineering challenge to bring us cool functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-cameras on the front are a unique feature too. One is used for relatively tight selfie shots (80°) and one for group shots (120°). Samsung does it another way - Wide selfie is similar to panorama mode and much slower than a single shot. Again, LG could have used a single high-res, wide-angle camera and cropped for the narrow shot, but went with the more challenging solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't enough room here for the traditional proximity and ambient light sensors, they are moved up next to the earpiece (the little black window that's more visible on the White V10 than on the Black one). Below the screen there's nothing but the LG logo, the keys are on-screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's trademark back button arrangement is back, but with a new member joining the team. The Power button (that splits the volume buttons) is now also a fingerprint reader. This solution is similar to Sony's, but it's easier to with the left hand (the Xperia Z5 fingerprint reader is mounted on the right and this asymmetry makes it easy to use with the right thumb, not so much with the left hand).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main camera is surrounded by a textured metal ring, which is an attractive design element, but doesn't do much to protect the glass. To the right of the camera is the Laser autofocus module, to the left the LED flash and the color spectrum sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a microUSB 2.0 port on the bottom, which supports Quick Charge 2.0. There's also a 3.5mm audio jack here, connected to a 32-bit Hi-Fi DAC and the sole loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 features a total of three mics, which are put to good use in a unique feature - control directionality. You can manually adjust whether the phone captures sounds ahead of it and ignoring sounds from behind (if you're playing the role of a quiet videographer), the other way around (to capture your narration and mute the noise from the scene) or any balance between the two. There's wind noise reduction too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dura Skin back cover is removable, giving you access to the 3,000mAh battery, which can easily be swapped out. While you're here, you can pop in a microSD card for extra storage (you get 64GB built-in to start you off).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 is an engineering tour de force, the company built what it envisioned rather than what was possible. Pushing the technology limit is certainly impressive to us geeks, but the features enabled by this complex solution will impress everyone else too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the hand the V10 feels big, though manageable. As we saw earlier, it's on the higher end of the size spectrum for a device with a 5.7" screen and the stainless steel frame contributes adds extra width, which does have an effect on handling. Adding in the weight, it's not the most effortless phone for one-handed use, but you quickly adapt to it (especially if you have experience with large phones).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 has a screen unlike anything we've seen. Yes, we've seen second screens before, however, this one is one display panel one corner of which has been cut off. And it has a second display driver and backlight, specifically for that upper portion of the panel that works as a second screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This allows it to show an image and track touch input with minimal power draw, which in turn enables some helpful controls you can access without having to wake the phone (like muting the sound or turning on a flashlight). It also keeps you abreast with any new notifications - instead of color coded messages from a notification light you get to see the app's icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper the screen of the LG V10 seems to be powered by the same technology as the one on the LG G4, but it actually has a higher contrast ratio (1490:1). The maximum brightness level is somewhat lower (432nits vs 532nits) but the black levels are much lower resulting in the improved ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of color accuracy, both screens are pretty much identical with overall good scores (Avg deltaE 4.9 and Max deltaE of 10.7 for the primary colors plus black and white). LG hasn't provided any ways for you to adjust the screen color temperature to their liking otherwise we could have achieved a more color accurate result with a slightly warmer setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 screen shares the amazingly low minimum brightness level of only 3.9nits that we first saw on the LG G4, which means it will go quite easy on the eyes when you use the phone in pitch dark settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going outside of such murky areas, the LG V10 screen offers above average legibility at max brightness. Since the brightness slider is all too eager to reduce the nits you'll want to keep it in the upper half.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 has all the connectivity goodies save for a dual-SIM option. It comes in GSM and CDMA flavors (the latter will happily work on GSM networks if the bands match up). The fastest mobile data option is 300Mbps LTE Cat. 6 and you get 42Mbps on 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Locally, the situation is pretty familiar with Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac bearing most of the load with Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA add-ons. For low-power connectivity there's Bluetooth 4.1 LE with the apt-X audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is on-board so the V10 is compatible with Android Pay (LG is rumored to be working on its own system too). You get the benefit of fingerprint security too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, our unit came with DMB-T TV tuner, though this is a regional thing. All regions will get the IR blaster for TV control though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wired microUSB 2.0 port handles USB storage and TV out (SlimPort, but it seems that not all regional versions support it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side you get a DLNA server support and Miracast, plus a number of LG-specific features. One is SmartShare Beam (transferring files between LG devices) and LG AirDrive, which does the same but with a computer (you need an LG account).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 with its 5.2" screen had a 3,000mAh battery, then the G3 with a 5.5" screen, the G4 and now the LG V10. The V10 is slightly thinner than the G2 (8.6mm vs. 8.9mm), but not by much. What we're getting at is that the internal volume has gone up while the battery capacity hasn't changed in over two years now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG rates the V10's talk time at 18 hours and about as much, close to 17 hours. Even the G2 did better than this. The web browsing and video playback times are average. Nothing spectacular when you consider the screen was at a modest 100 nits (well below average).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result the endurance rating works out to 56 hours, just over two full days. The standby power draw is fairly low, but that's with the second screen off. Turning it on brings the LG V10 down to 46 hours endurance rating. The impact is fairly small, with or without the second screen you'll get two days of moderate usage and one day of heavier usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we're testing a Korean unit, LG says that international units units will perform better in Europe and the US as they should be better optimized for the local networks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two-screen user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Interaction with the LG V10 starts before you even unlock the phone. The secondary screen - a 160 x 1,040px line of shortcuts and notifications in the top right - is always on. It shows time and date plus notifications, while quick toggles for Volume, Wi-Fi, Flashlight and Camera are a swipe away. This works thanks to the separate controller for this part of the screen, which keeps the capacitive touch sensor active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music controls work great too, a fast way to change tracks. The final option is to show a message, a "signature." This can be an inspirational message or just "Steve's phone." Several font options are available, which look better than the plain sans-serif font.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlocking the phone expands the second screen's functionality. It can show recent apps to aid multitasking (think clicking an icon in Windows' taskbar instead of alt-tabbing) and a selection of tools (including capture screenshot and annotate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that using the second screen is exclusively a two hand affair - unless you are Shaquille O'Neal you can't possibly reach all the way up to the top of the screen with your thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To unlock the phone you can use double tap or LG's more secure Knock Code. For those unfamiliar, it is essentially a secret knock shared between you and your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint reader is the more secure option. Since it's on the Power key, all you have to do is press it. The unlocking takes under a second (a secondary lock method like PIN is used as a failsafe). You index finger (on either hand) naturally rests on the Power button, making this ambidextrous and comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification are is LG's usual overcrowded affair. One row shows the time, the next one the quick toggles, then optionally a row of Qslide shortucts, then a row each for the brightness and volume sliders. With all that, you get about 1/3 of the screen left for notifications. Luckily, you can hide all that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool change for incoming notifications leverages the second screen. New popup notifications that normally show up at the top row have been moved to the second screen, above the main UI. This way they don't cover up the app you're using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking is handled in three ways. The first is the Recent apps list on the second screen. Then there are Qslide apps, a selection of floating, resizable apps that stay above the main app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third is Dual window, which divides the screen between two apps. You can resize them, swap them, expand them to the full screen or close them. You can launch this mode from the Dual window button in the App switcher of by tapping the dedicated button on each app card in the switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is a pin - a way for people who compulsively clear the running apps to keep the most important apps in memory. Neither the X button nor the Clear all button will close those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switcher itself is the standard 3D rolodex of app screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen holds no surprises either. The Smart Bulletin on the leftmost pane should be familiar to Optimus UI users. It's a sort of mission control that gives you one look access to LG Health, your Calendar, the music player, QRemote, Smart tips and Smart settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen Android buttons are customizable. It starts off with a good default - Back, Home, App switcher, drawn in white on a black background. You can add Notification, Capture+, Qslide or Dual Window buttons and invert the color combo.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 is an upgrade over the LG G4, though even with recent revisions to the Snapdragon 810 chipset, which promise to reduce the heat, LG still went with the Snapdragon 808. It did load it with 4GB of RAM, though we worry about the GPU - it's not up to the QHD task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processor does fairly well - two Cortex-A57 cores at 1.82GHz and four A53s at 1.44GHz come close to the Snapdragon 810 setup (which has two extra A57s). Both single and dual-core performance stays close to the S810-powered G Flex 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Full system performance is very competitive too, at least according to AnTuTu 5. Basemark OS II 2.0 found it lacking, though we never experienced any slowdowns.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For 3D, things are much less impressive though. The Adreno 418 GPU just doesn't have a lot of oomph and the Adreno 430 in S810 smokes it with a nearly 50% lead. The Mali-T760 in Samsung's top Exynos is even further in front.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you don't use the full QHD resolution of the screen and settle for 1080p, the frame rate is still well below the 30fps threshold. If you use the new Open GL ES 3.1, the frame rate drops even further. For a flagship, the LG V10 just isn't great at playing premium 3D games.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Web browsing also puts a strain on the chipset, but it handles it much better. We used Chrome for testing and the LG V10 easily beat the S808-powered Moto X Pure Edition (aka Style) and even staid close to the more powerful Galaxy S6 edge+ for JavaScript performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung showed a bigger advantage is general web browsing, but a S810 doesn't do much better than the S808 either.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>LG had plenty of time to work out heating issues since the LG G4 and Qualcomm has revised its troubled chipset to turn down the heat. Even then, Microsoft managed to create a liquid cooling solution for its Lumia 950 phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapdragon 808 is fine for general use, the processor in handles the loss of two of its big cores particularly well. It's the GPU that doesn't quite work at the flagship level. Maybe if Qualcomm had a version of the S808 with Adreno 430 things would be different.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The telephony features are combined into a single app that uses tabs to separate features (you can hide the tabs you don't need).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 supports HD Voice and can show a notification so you can be sure it's active. You can also adjust the voice quality to Default, Clean and Soft and separately enable noise reduction (the V10 has three mics).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other tabs are pretty self-explanatory: Call logs, Contacts, Favorites and Groups. The Contacts tab places handy Call and Message shortcuts by each contact (the ones with phone numbers anyway). The default sorting method puts the contacts you contact most often on top. Standard alphabetical ordering is available should you prefer it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the phone app can be set up to accept incoming calls into the second screen or as a popup while using the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's Ringtone ID is on board. This feature composes a unique ringtone for each of your contacts, turning phone number digits into notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker proved average and with certain ringtones it is downright quiet. You'll need to pick a loud, distinctive ringtone. The middling loudspeaker isn't great for listening to music either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging app is fairly standard in terms of features. One unique option allows it to show notifications of incoming messages and preview the messages on the second screen. Other than that the screen doesn't take part in texting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up different themes for each conversation with both custom bubble styles and backgrounds images (including photos you've taken). You can attach various multimedia files, including a quick sketch you drew.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app has built-in spam filtering that works on numbers and the content of messages. You can also disable making URLs into clickable links (because as the app warns, spam messages can contain phishing links).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the AOSP-based Email app with a VIP list. Senders on that list get a custom notification sound, which can sound even if you muted notifications. Gmail is on board as well and will also handle third-party email providers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 uses the LG keyboard, which comes with a number of customization features. You can move around or remove the Settings key, the period key and the symbol key. The top number row is also optional. Then the customization wizard will let you change the vertical height - going from covering over half the screen to about a third. You can chose between Black and White themes too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For writing, you can do old-school tap input or path input (think Swype), as well as handwriting recognition (requires a download) and voice dictation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In landscape you can opt for a keyboard that spans the whole width of the display or a more compact one. A split keyboard is very handy too. For portrait use you might want to enable the one-handed mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery needs RAW editing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 brings a capable Gallery app, which compliments its serious camera department. The Memories feature automatically organizes photos by location and time, or you can view the images by Album or as a Timeline (by Day, Moth, Year and with pinch zoom to help you navigate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA is built into the app, so you can send photos to a compatible TV or pull them from a storage device or computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the cloud connectivity - Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive and T cloud are supported, though not Facebook or Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For photo editing you get an Auto enhance button, basic color correction and cropping. Photos you shot in RAW format will get a DNG icon, unfortunately there are no advanced tools to edit those files on the phone itself, so you'll have to resort to your desktop computer for those or get a separate app from the Play store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video editing got more love, the Auto edit feature can take an unwieldly 16 minute/2GB video and trim it down to the 15 most exciting seconds. It will recognize people's faces and keep those parts of the footage, while discarding duplicate or blurry shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do manual video editing too. Predefined styles quickly add background music and a color theme or you can select those manually. Also, you can slow down or speed up parts of the video to create a dramatic effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the gallery, the music player features DLNA and cloud integration making it easy to sync your music collection. And the LG V10 will take anything you throw at it - lossless FLAC and ALAC files as well as MP3s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, MP3 offers lower quality than the lossless formats, but LG's software and 32-bit Hi-Fi DAC from ESS Technology promises to upsample your 16-bit/44.1kHz files to 24-bit/192kHz. This works for streaming audio too (which is usually worse than offline MP3s). Keep in mind this is more of a placebo effect - upsampling raises the bitrate but there's no way for it to add extra data and thus improve the quality. If you do have high-quality tracks the V10 will play them trouble-free though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have you ever been annoyed at your music player because you can't get the volume right? You'll feel like Goldilocks with the V10, which offers 75 levels of volume so you can find one that's just right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app comes with a number of equalizer presets, including one dedicated to the Quad Beats headset you receive in the retail box. Hitting the Custom option gives you a manual 7-band equalizer to play with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first time you plug in a pair of headphones, the phone will tell you about the 32-bit DAC. Enabling it gives you the precise volume control as well as dials to change the left/right balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 has built-in FM radio, though in some regions it has been disabled (it's not available on our unit, for example), so be sure to double-check.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player on the LG V10, you have to go through the gallery. The good news is that its DLNA capabilities come in handy if you have your videos stored on a compatible device. You can also manually load subtitles and customize their look (size and style).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Qslide shortcut moves the video into a small, floating window so you can keep watching as you use the phone. It's a handy way to reply to a message without hitting pause or keeping music videos going.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is nicely clean, but not very loud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 produced perfectly clear output when connected to an active external amplifier - there wasn't a single one of its readings to be anything other than excellent. The volume wasn't particularly impressive, but it was still just above average so we certainly liked what we saw here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones and you get some extra stereo crosstalk and a bit of intermodulation distortion. Both readings remain very good for the case though so the overall clarity is rather pleasing. Volume levels do drop a bit though and that means the V10 wouldn't be particularly comfortable handling high-impedance headphones. Those aside however, the LG flagship did a very good job here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 camera uses the same basic hardware as the G4. This means a 1/2.6" sensor with 16MP resolution (widescreen aspect ratio). It's behind a bright f/1.8 lens, which lets in 80% more light than G3's f/2.2 lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's optically stabilized with optional digital stabilization when you're expecting a lot shaking. OIS will further help it in the dark, but the V10 has more tricks - Laser autofocus for fast, accurate focus locks and a color spectrum sensor that promises accurate color rendering even in tricky lighting situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual selfie cameras are quite interesting too, but let's focus on the main camera for now as there's plenty of ground to cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 brings with it polished, advanced camera software that sets it apart from the G4. The Manual mode has extended to videos while the still photo mode learned new tricks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It starts off with a manual White balance slider (with an Auto option), a Manual focus slider (with an Auto option), exposure compensation, ISO (50-2,700) and shutter speed (1/6,000s-30s). Along the top of the screen you get a histogram, along with other readings (very reminiscent of a DSLR screen) to guide you as you set up the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable RAW shooting with the JPG+RAW mode (there's no RAW only mode). This takes a bit longer to save the shot and it takes up more storage - it's about 7.5MB for JPG and 19MB for RAW. Good thing that the V10 comes with plenty of storage and you can expand it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera flash has a neat trick too - front and rear curtain sync. You may not have heard of those, but in capable hands they make a world of difference for low light shots. Basically, this setting controls whether the flash fires at the start or at the end of the exposure (important for multi-second exposures).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using a tripod, we managed to drop the ISO to 50 and get a great shot of the city at night, while the close-by subject was illuminated by the flash. Rear curtain sync made quite a difference, it really helped to capture close-by subjects without overexposing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rear curtain sync also makes a difference if you're trying your hand at light writing. With it, the light trails will follow the light, while the default mode shows light trails going ahead of the light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manual video mode is hands-down the most flexible, advanced video shooting mode we've seen on a smartphone. You get to adjust the framerate - going from 1fps to 60fps - and the bitrate (High, Medium, Low).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Directivity setting is unique. It puts you in control of what sounds the LG V10 will capture - ones ahead (in front of the main camera), your voice (in the direction of the selfie cams) or any balance of the two. This is great for narration in a noisy environment or the opposite - capture sound from the scene and ignore noise from your group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also adjust the mic level. The Left and Right meters show the levels so you can immediately spot peaking. There's a wind noise filter you can toggle in windy environments too. You can even use a wireless Bluetooth mic to record sound like a pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera manual settings are almost the same as those for photos, you don't get to adjust the exposure compensation though. The great news is that you can adjust the settings during video recording - this way you can, say, slowly bring something into focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we get to the selfie cameras. One (the right one) has a fairly standard 80° lens, while the other one has a wide 120° lens. This makes a great difference in how much you can fit in the shot - LG says you'll never need a selfie stick again (which is just a crude way to capture more of the scene around you).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a 120° Wide selfie mode on its phones, but they stitch three photos, kind of like a panorama and is much trickier to use. The LG V10 takes a 120° shot in one go, which makes it much better for group shots (you don't want people moving between multiple photos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selfie cameras don't do manual mode, but you are unlikely to need that either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One fun mode to try is Multi-shot. It splits the frame into several segments and you capture separate photos for each one. The four-way split takes one 80° selfie, one 120° selfie and two shots with the main camera. There are other layouts, the simplest one is just main camera and selfie. We do wish we had a way to resize the segments or, say, take four selfie shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snap mode does pretty much the same thing, except for video and the cameras work simultaneously. This can create a video with a narrow and wide views of you, plus one or two views of the scene ahead (since there is just one camera on the back, for it just copies the footage for the two by two mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snaps also work great with just one camera at a time. Hitting the record button takes a short 3-second clip or you can hold the button for up to 60-seconds. Multiple clips add up on the timeline and you can switch the camera between takes. So you can do a narrow selfie to introduce the scene, then flip to the main camera, then a wide selfie and so on. When you have filled up the 60 second timeline (or even before), hit save to send that video to the gallery and start a new one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you can use the Quick share button to immediately send out the last photo or video you too. Just tap the button that shows up with the share with last used app or tap the down arrow to pick an app from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if all that is too confusing, the Auto mode or even the Simple mode are great ways to quickly snap a photo without worrying much about settings or multi-camera angles.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>That was a longwinded description of features, but the LG V10 is actually very easy to work with. In Simple mode you pretty much point and shoot, there are no options. You can't record video in this mode though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You need to move to Auto for that, which gives you the basics - flash mode, front/back camera toggle, HDR, panorama and time lapse. You also get to adjust the resolution of photos and videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stabilization settings changes from OIS to Steady. Optical image stabilization is always on, but you can trade some field of view for extra smoothness with the digital stabilization of Steady mode (note that this is available in 1080p only, not 4K).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are three videos showing the stabilization prowess of the LG V10 at 4K and 1080p resolutions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera uses the second screen to place the mode toggles and during video capture it turns into a zoom dial (1x-8x). 120fps slow motion is available at 720p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are two manual modes - Photo and Video - and the Snap mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G4 camera was among the best and the V10 uses basically the same hardware. It's driven by a revamped camera software though. We'll include a few DNG RAW files so you can try processing them yourself, but be warned - even just matching the JPG quality takes a skilled hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is highly impressive, basically identical to the great LG G4. Photos are rich in detail, with little noise to get in the way and strong, artificial sharpening. The noise reduction can be too aggressive on foliage though. Colors are fairly accurate, though the red channel is off and we noticed a slight yellow tint on a few occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic range is good, it sacrifices the highlights if it isn't wide enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR can be a great help, it rescues the highlights and also brings in additional detail to the shadows. It boosts the sharpening, however, creating a small halo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama mode stitches images perfectly and creates an image just over 5,000px tall (just under 3,000px if you shoot horizontally). The final image is as sharp as a single photo, though an Apple-like HDR mode for the panorama would have been nice. Even without it, the dynamic range should be good enough for most shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP selfie duo doesn't quite live up to the quality standard set by the main camera. There's a bit more noise, but the amount of detail is great for the resolution. Note that the wider 120° lens create a noticeable barrel distortion. On the upside it captures a great deal more of the scene behind you, both horizontally and vertically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We played around with the Multi-shot mode and were a little disappointed to find out the results are saved at under 4MP. That's less than the resolution of the selfie cam and greatly sacrifices the quality offered by the main camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the dark, the single LED flash proves powerful enough to capture great shots of near-by subjects. The wide f/1.8 aperture gets part of the credit too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We brought out a tripod and tried some multi-second exposures. With the ISO set at 50 and the shutter speed at 2s and 4s, the LG V10 managed a beautiful, noise-free view of the cityscape as background, while the flash helped render near-by objects perfectly. Note that we used rear curtain sync to get this shot, the regular mode tended to overexpose things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of DNG files you can download to try in your favorite RAW editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the LG V10 in our Photo quality comparison tool:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG V10</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 camera tops out at 4K @ 30fps video. There's no 1080p @ 60fps in Auto mode, you have to go to the Manual camera for that. For slow motion you get 720p @ 120fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4K videos have 48Mbps total bitrate. They are as smooth as 30fps videos can be and the image quality is excellent - plenty of detail, little noise. The colors are identical to the still photo camera, accurate save for the red channel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've included videos shot with the LG G4 for comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos are shot at 17Mbps and the quality is great. At this resolution you get the option to enable digital image stabilization, the Steady mode. However, this will shrink the field of view noticeably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera quickly locks focus and is fairly good at holding it steady. There are a few occasions where its focus started hunting unnecessarily though, which is rather annoying. It's not a first for an LG handset either and we think it's about time the Koreans do something about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG V10: 2160p</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG V10: 1080p</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless of resolution, the audio is recorded in stereo at 156Kbps. While we would have appreciated a higher bitrate, the mics are very good and you can listen to minute details in the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical image stabilization does an okay job of smoothing out camera shake, but it can't correct the stronger jerks. The digital stabilization may well be worth it as it produces much smoother videos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG kept the app package of the V10 trim and tidy. Evernote comes preinstalled to help you sync and organize your notes or you could just use QMemo+. That one also does syncing (memos go into Google Drive). QMemo+ gives you basic text formatting, the ability to create checkbox lists and draw on top of the text. While drawing with your finger, you can use two fingers to scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app features Event pocket. It simplifies the event creation process down to drag and drop. You can drag anything from Facebook events through nearby locations to To-Do lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Health counts your steps and shows your progress towards your daily goal. It will even rank you against other users to motivate you to push further. While the LG V10 doesn't have health-oriented sensors in itself, you can connect accessories to measure blood pressure and your weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QRemote app works with TVs, set top boxes and air conditioners. What we love about LG's app is that it lets you build a universal remote by picking buttons from various remotes for individual devices and assembling a super-remote. This lets you easily have buttons to control the TV and AV receiver from the same screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In some regions the LG V10 will come with DMB-T receiver (you need headphones plugged in as an antenna). You can even record broadcasts, though there's no DVR-like scheduling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder app lets you tag recording with location info and attach them to an event. However, the advanced audio recording features we saw in the camera are not present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a capable File manager that can easily move files between local memory (internal storage, microSD or USB storage) and the cloud. You can ZIP-up files, which will make them easier to send.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG backup serves double duty. It can copy your stuff off your old phone or push things from the V10 to another phone. It also does backup and restore. You can store the backup file locally or upload it to the LG Cloud. For extra privacy you can lock the file with a password.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG V10 key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A great design with excellent build quality; the weight is on the upper end of the scale though; the back cover, while rugged, is not particularly premium (not after the G4 gave us genuine leather)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has above average contrast and sunlight legibility</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery life is average; the second screen doesn't have a big impact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The premium headphones (tuned by AKG) and fast charger make up a rich retail box</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's Optimus skin adds much needed multitasking features to Android, but keeps the app suit lean</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second screen is great for multitasking and quick functions from a locked screen, though it feels underutilized elsewhere</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset is almost as fast as S810 for general use, but lags behind in games</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio output is nicely clear, not very loud</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera offers great image quality, essentially the same as the LG G4; the software adds more fun and flexibility though; The wide selfie cam is made for big parties</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera is great, with one of a kind manual controls</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG found its voice with the LG G3. It would be the company that leads the push for extra-large screens for the everyday flagship. Phablets were already quite popular at the time, but LG threw away the distinction and it hasn't looked back since.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would also beat everyone on sharpness by going QHD when most of its competition was still at 1080p. Since then it has lost ground. As great as the LG G4 was, it didn't have much new to say - it was curved like the G Flex a year before it, sometimes with a leather back like the Moto X (from 2013).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung got burned when it attempted an element-defiant flagship and this year over-corrected with a phone that's both more fragile and missing some features. The Galaxy Note Edge's second screen functionality was mostly dropped and dual-curved screen on the S6 edge couple brings more aesthetics than functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A perfect time to strike then. The LG V10 brings fresh energy and starts a new family line. The V series stands for practicality, durability and innovation. It's shock proof to a military standard. It's not waterproof like the Xperias, but it's a difference as small as the difference between 'every day' and 'vacation time.'</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's as practical as ever too, battery and storage are easy to refresh and if the back cover does get damaged it can be swapped out in under a minute. LG has done its best to make that unnecessary though. The tough stainless steel frame features silicone bumpers to absorb shocks, a scratch-resistant Dura Skin back cover and double-paned glass on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's not making the design suffer too much too like most rugged phones do. The only giveaway on the LG V10 is the extra grippy back texture, though we welcome that on phones from all walks of life. From the front it looks like a phone designed for beauty, especially the versions with bronze-colored sides (the all-black one looks a bit plain).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While QHD displays are now commonplace, the V10 brings a second screen, which smooths out the interaction with the phone. Everything from simply checking the time to switching between multiple apps is more seamless thanks to the second screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has been pushing its camera division hard. The G2 was an early entrant into the OIS field and G3 brought Laser autofocus. We were a bit harsh on the G4 earlier, but only because its camera was a massive improvement and we know it can do better. The new sensor and faster lens brought in image quality to match the advanced features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the LG V10 improves on the camera software with features ranging from fun to ones requiring semi-pro experience. These days a popular YouTube channel can get more views than a top TV show and the V10 allows budding stars to drop their bulky DSLR setups (which cost many times what the V10 does).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, the quality won't be quite the same, but the phone that's always with you promotes spontaneity. And you're not completely locked out of a choice of lens thanks to the two selfie cams. Also, the mic directionality control give you a choice between narration and observation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint sensor is overdue (the G4 should have had one), but a welcome addition to improve security. The G4 skated by with a Snapdragon 808 chipset, but for a late-2015 flagship it's a sub-par pick and our only major complaint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ does not have a second screen like the Galaxy Edge before it. Still, the curved sides of its 5.7" QHD Super AMOLED are used effectively for notifications. The 16MP OIS prefers to stay in control, but the quality is great. As for the chipset, the Exynos is just clearly better. The Galaxy S6 edge+ is one of the most fragile smartphones on the market, though, given the amount of glass it employs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Curvy screen gimmicks aside, the Samsung Galaxy Note5 and its S Pen stylus are an Android powerhouse. LG has come around and tried a few stylus-packing phones, but the V10 knew better and tried to differentiate with cool camera features and a second screen instead of entering a battle it cannot win.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While LG was ahead of the curve with QHD on the G3, Sony won the 4K race with the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. The full resolution is used only in certain situations and it's questionable if you even need it, but you'll certainly brag about it. Many don't even have 4K TVs yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, Sony found a way to use Snapdragon 810, it waterproofed the phone (just don't use it under water) and its new camera performs great during the day. The hybrid stabilization setup was impressive too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Nexus 6P gets its 5.7" QHD AMOLED screen from Samsung and with the right app you can have power-efficient on-screen notifications too. This one is enveloped in a premium aluminum body (a first for a Nexus) and packs a 12MP camera with large pixels. Huawei also found a way to incorporate S810.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having a pure Android experience from Google is a relief for all those scorned by delayed or cancelled update plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do like your software directly from the source, the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL is another great 5.7" QHD AMOLED option. It has a heavy focus on camera too with Zeiss lens, PureView sensor and OIS. The software lacks some of V10's more advanced features, but the Lumia team has been leading smartphone camera innovation for a long time now (it introduced manual controls for one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the Snapdragon 810 chipset is water-cooled (see, LG, there's a way) and with the right dock (given away for free in some regions) you can turn the Lumia 950 XL almost into a full-fledged desktop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the next couple of weeks (until November 15) US LG V10 units come with great gifts - a 200GB microSD card and an extra battery with a charging cradle. What about after the promo runs its course? Well, for one it's $100 below the 32GB Galaxy S6 edge+ in the US and it comes with double the storage (much more if you score the 200GB card).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 is an attractive, durable phone with great specs (save for the chipset), it comes with useful feature you can't find anywhere else and LG didn't overprice the phone (like Sony and HTC often do). We feel that the company will move many units, though some murmurs from South Korea suggest the market's reaction is different. Regardless, LG made a great phone and deserves a win.</paragraph>
