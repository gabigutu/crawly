			<paragraph>There's a lot to fall for in Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1. Possibly the hottest looker of a PocketPC is also heavy on skill. Heavy enough to not just scratch out a living as a one-hit-wonder but aim for the WinMo top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra solid metal looks, gorgeous screen and the right pinch of novelty called XPERIA panels look to us as good enough reasons for the X1 to be hyped and romanticized. By the way, romance or not, Sony Ericsson and HTC have hit their perfect shape with that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X1 is surely the most eagerly anticipated device in the world of Windows Mobile. Getting our review out was surely quite a wait too, we know. Better late than ever, as some folks say. We'll still have our say 'cause for the XPERIA it's a load of high expectations to live up to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X1 is one of the best-equipped Windows Mobile devices to ever set foot on the market. But hey, is it not the most elaborate and charismatic PocketPC too? As to skills, the high-res 3" screen and the full QWERTY keyboard seem the most important parts of its magnificent ammo though its processing power is not to be neglected either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many devices find their identity in standing up to a rival. The XPERIA though is fatefully bound to always have one foot on alien ground. The haunting name for the X1 is HTC - manufacturer and main competitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably guessed by yourselves the main alternative to the XPERIA X1 is HTC Touch Pro. It has a smaller screen than the XPERIA X1 and features a slightly lower resolution. In addition it is heavier and, if we were to be asked, not nearly as hot as the XPERIA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the QWERTY keyboard of the Touch Pro is well ahead of what the X1 has to offer. The Touch Pro accelerometer and active magnetic stylus are small but nice touches that add to its allure. There are other advantages too, but we'll try to list them in the dedicated chapter of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch Pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the Touch Pro had a nice two-month advantage since it hit the shelves back in August and this could be quite decisive for the sales. After all two months is quite a long time in the world of mobile phones, isn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not waste any more time now and get rolling with the actual review of Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1. Unboxing is this little jump ahead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Big box - modest packing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's nothing inside the Sony Ericsson XPERIA retail box to bring huge cheers. Apart from the shining beast that is, which is the first thing to notice as you lift the lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath you'll find the charger/data cable combo, an extra stylus, two-piece headset - 3.5mm on either end, CD with sync software and a bunch of manuals and leaflets. There is also a microSD card provided, but its capacity - and even actual availability - is market dependent. Unluckily there was no screen protector or carrying case.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA measures 110.5 x 52.6 x 17 mm, and two major differences emerge upon an inevitable comparison with HTC Touch Pro. Notably taller, the XPERIA does get a more elegant stance and the effect is reinforced by the friendlier weight. While both are hefty gadgets, the 145g of XPERIA do sound - and feel - a whole lot more welcoming.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The metallic finish also does its bit to give Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 a more sophisticated look and feel compared to the stepbrother HTC Touch Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We happen to be quite fond of the XPERIA looks. The phone looks pretty good in both color versions (Solid Black and Steel Silver) though we still tend to slightly favor the black one for its commanding charisma.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the front of Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 is taken by the large 3" touch screen. The front frame and the battery cover are made from stainless steel and don't attract finger prints at all. The rest of the body is made of solid looking plastic, chrome finish on the edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right above the display we find the slim earpiece, symmetrically accommodating the ambient light sensor and secondary videocall camera on each side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the screen, the X-styled navigation deck catches the eye. Not only are the keys molded accordingly, but the borders between them backlight in solid white to form two prominent X patterns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual suspects are all there - two dedicated call keys and a pair of soft keys and, of course, a D-pad with a confirming center that doubles as an optical trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last two controls here are the X-PANEL key and OK knob. What may seem as inadequate real estate for a crowded navigation deck actually works quite fine. Most of the controls offering pleasing ergonomics and functionality. We would've liked a more distinct press in the Call and End keys but it isn't such a big deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our biggest concern is the Up key on the D-pad. It is the least projecting bit of the 5-way key, a proper press unpleasantly obstructed by the upper end of the black plastic panel. Its rigidity and low stroke are utterly inconsistent with the rest of the D-pad sides, which are ample and tactile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The confirming center is also quite friendly - pleasingly soft to the touch but still offering a remarkably distinct press. The optical trackpad is pretty responsive and 5 sensitivity levels make sure everyone will find their favorite setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard is one of the most notable differences between the XPERIA and the Touch Pro. The giant Space and Enter keys on the XPERIA may initially impress you but it takes only a couple of minutes to conclude that the 5-row QWERTY keypad on the Touch Pro is the more typing-friendly solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys on the XPERIA are aligned diagonally, as opposed to the straight layout in the Touch Pro. The size, shape and tactility of the XPERIA keys are quite alright but the shorter slider run has taken its toll and the four QWERTY rows are no match for the Touch Pro keypad. The insufficient headroom for the upper row of keys puts the XPERIA to a definite disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the better viewing angle of the screen - when typing on the QWERTY keyboard - sure is an asset, which XPERIA owes to the arc slider form factor. Plus, the actual sliding action is smoother than the Touch Pro. Upon opening the keypad, the screen of course automatically rotates to landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side hosts the volume rocker at the top and the shutter key all the way down. They are quite comfortable and well integrated with the overall design. Though quite slim, the camera key is pleasingly responsive, with a distinct half press. The volume rocker doubles as zoom lever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For your convenience, the shutter key is symmetrically replicated by a small recess on the left side, which in shooting mode serves as a comfortable thumb rest. All the way up on that left side is the miniUSB port that is also used for charging the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>XPERIA X1 has a very elegant eyelet on its bottom for attaching different accessories or a wrist strap. It makes attaching stuff very easy, and is discrete enough if you decide not to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 features the power button, 3.5 mm standard audio jack and the stylus compartment. Unlike the HTC Touch Pro, there is no magnetic action with the XPERIA X1 - you have to push or pull it out manually - and the stylus isn't active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally there are four status LEDs along the sides of the handset. The upper pair twinkles in red for errors and empty battery while the purple blinks of the lower ones are triggered by a number of applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the rear cover of the XPERIA X1 lies an impressive 1500mAh Li-Ion battery that powers the Sony Ericsson PocketPC. We pushed the phone to its limits and it held for two days of severe torture on a single charge. Not bad, and a point scored against the Touch Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing under the rear cover is the microSD card slot. This surely isn't the most comfortable place since you need to remove the cover every time you need to replace your memory card. At least the memory card is still fully hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.2 megapixel snapper and the LED flash are at the top of the rear, placed within a black nest of hexagonal shape.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>High-res display is spectacular<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Someone might ask how come Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 gets the better treatment than the Touch Pro in terms of screen size as they have one and the same manufacturer, but let's not forget HTC have the Touch HD already and can afford to show some generosity to the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3-inch diagonal accommodating 800 x 480 pixels (yep, Touch HD again) is at this point the ultimate in full-QWERTY PocketPCs. The 2.8" VGA display of HTC Touch Pro should feel quite threatened as the XPERIA outdoes it in both size and resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is great although someone would make a case of the XPERIA's 65K-color support "only". But really, there aren't that many cases when the difference between 65K and 16M colors is visible to the naked eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X1 is a pleasure to look at and handle in the dark, with its strong and even backlighting and bright display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, going outside on a bright sunny day you're in for a serious problem. The X1 has the same weakness as most other WinMo phones out there - poor sunlight legibility. The fingerprint smudges on the screen don't help things either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3" display is sunk a millimeter from the surrounding surface and this solution has both its pros and cons. Not only does it offer some degree of protection, it also facilitates operating with the stylus around the edges - exiting applications, hitting the battery indicator, wireless network icon or the sideways scrolls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However if you prefer to use your fingers you are in for quite a hard time. Icons, start menu and scroll bars are tiny and stylus skeptics (like us) will need either long nails or strong nerves to get to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This of course also has much to do with the high screen resolution. We've got to say, that HTC have done a far better job of scaling the UI of the Touch HD to make it thumb-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen responsiveness is better than the Samsung Omnia's but nowhere near the iPhone standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While HTC will be getting well deserved credit for the XPERIA, the Sony Ericsson design team efforts at setting their PocketPC apart are commendable. The XPERIA is a definite looker and handling is on par with the solid elegance the handset projects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touchscreen size and resolution, the arc slider and the turn-head exterior are XPERIA's undoubted advantages over the subdued and to-the-point Touch Pro. The Touch Pro is keen to respond with a superior QWERTY keypad, accelerometer and active magnetic stylus. Plus, its market head start is definitely in the picture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally you also shouldn't forget that the price of the XPERIA X1 is currently about 40 euro (60 US dollars) higher.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>XPERIA X1 panels - your phone, your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What sets the XPERIA X1 apart from any other PocketPC is the approach to the user interface. We've seen different manufacturers' attempts to pep up and touch-optimize the underlying WinMo UI. That said, the XPERIA panels are not so different - from a usability point of view - from the full-screen tabs of the TouchFLO 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The packaging counts though, and the XPERIA does make it look like the interface blends several different UI's in one. Or, if you look at it from the TouchFLO perspective, instead of having one homescreen plug-in with multiple tabs, the XPERIA offers a selection of homescreens. Plus, switching between them is quite user-friendly and fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panels let you change the way the home screen looks, get one touch media and mobile access to various web services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 7 preloaded panels that you can spin right out of the box and the X Panel hardware button gives you one-click access to viewing and managing the assortment. The left soft key lets you toggle between 3 x 3 grid and card view. The right soft key takes you to the X-Panels setup where you can change alignment within the grid or add newly downloaded panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view a total of 9 panels only however you can have more than those installed. The X-Panels setup allows you to choose which ones should be visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, each panel comes with its own pair of context keys. What's more, the panel grid view is nicely animated and the currently selected panel appears as a larger thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen rotation is enabled with panels of course, and they work in both portrait and landscape mode, depending on whether the keyboard is slid open.There is no accelerometer to allow auto screen rotation, but if you want, you can rotate the UI with the flick of a system setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first panel is basically an XPERIA-branded Microsoft Today screen. That said, it might be your first choice if you're used to the standard Windows Mobile looks and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ones to follow are a couple of Sony Ericsson panels. They are very much alike in terms of features. Both of them offer quick access to contacts, calendar, messaging, web, clock, etc, in a layout that looks a mixture of Microsoft Today, Widgets and a dash of the Symbian S60 active standby screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A row of connectivity buttons grants you one-touch access to flight mode, WLAN manager, Bluetooth, dialer and ringing profiles. There is also a list of recently used apps at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly, one of the most amusing offers is the 3D Fish panel (though not the most practical one), for which you'll definitely need to refer to the manual. To begin with, right there you'll find the names of the fish swimming on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four of them, but one is usually absent - that's until you have a missed call. And the fish alerts don't end there. When the black one changes color you're low on battery, while another fish turns grey when you've set sounds off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fish will flock to the lure of your finger and react to taps on the screen along the lines of LG Prada or Viewty. This panel sure is fun!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the name itself suggests, the Media Xperience panel is the launch pad to the picture gallery, music files, videos and games stored in the phone memory or on the microSD card. Its styling is consistent with the looks of the Media Center known from a number of recent Sony Ericsson feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only this time your phonebook is also included and can be viewed through the same fluid interface as your multimedia files.The Phonebook implementation is excellent, scrolling is as enjoyable as on the Apple iPhone and you can search your contacts using the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting fact about the Media Xperience panel is that you can choose from three different font sizes and three different animated backgrounds. An attractive feature is that the background changes its color in accordance to the time of day - from green to blue and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA FM Radio panel is the most convenient way to operate the built-in FM radio. The interface is quite simple and easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last preinstalled item is the Google panel, which gives you direct access to the popular search engine, as well as to some of the most popular services - maps, mail, calendar and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>More panels<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A number of extra panels are available at the Sony Ericsson Fun &amp; Downloads web site. At the time of writing, there are 6 additional panels up for grabs. Those extra panels are installed or removed just like ordinary Windows Mobile applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you will not be able to download and install those on any other PocketPC, but there are some unofficial third-party projects for porting the X-Panels interface to other touchscreen WinMo devices (as well as porting the TouchFLO 3D to XPERIA, but more on that later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, the Slideshow panel allows you to run a slideshow of your images. The XPERIA high resolution display is just great for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A number of panels redirect to some of the most popular networking services - Windows Live and the well-known Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dashwire is another service deemed worthy of a panel. It lets you to upload your contacts, messages, photos and videos, or to transfer contacts and settings from your old phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cool Hunting web page is a meeting point of ideas and products showing today's trends in art, design, culture and technology. This is where the next panel will take you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, we've been on and on about how inevitable it is to compare XPERIA X1 and HTC Touch Pro. And even if the panels are the most straightforward distinction, one particular download seems to bring the XPERIA closer to the Touch Pro than you would've thought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Spb Mobile Shell is a well known - and quite capable - UI plug-in for the WinMo platform. It's been around as a regular WinMo Today plugin for quite some time but the novelty is Sony Ericsson are offering it free of charge to XPERIA users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way it works is quite similar to the tabbed TouchFLO 3D - it's extensively touch-optimized and you can flip through its menus with finger sweeps. The much-acclaimed interface integrates tightly with the operating system and makes WinMo notably more thumbable and user friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may as well be the best - in terms of the range of usability it offers - among the currently available XPERIA panels. And that brings us back where we started. Some users may of course prefer the TouchFLO 3D, which we deservedly praised on many occasions: it's thumbable, it's responsive and offers an integrated, all-inclusive control of the device's features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA panels are more like several solutions in one. The important thing is they offer pretty much the same functionality as the TouchFLO 3D, topped with the novelty, fun and ease of use. Plus they are open to third-party developers, so there will be many more to choose from in the future.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Back to Windows<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OK folks, panels or whatnot, sooner or later WinMo pushes through - familiar, somber, inevitable. The interface is sadly not scaled up and, on the XPERIA high-resolution screen, things are very tiny, certainly not thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have still put a few personal touches to Windows Mobile. A task manager has been added - courtesy of HTC actually, and the same as in the Touch Pro - but it's only accessible from the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contact management supreme<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is usually considered one of the strongest assets of Windows Mobile. You have an unlimited contact list, unlimited info fields for each contact and brilliant synchronization options. However, the small font and tiny fields make the stylus a must when you are searching a contact or editing its details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson - or is it HTC again - have added thumb scrolling to the default WinMo contacts list (a short sweep scrolls them gradually, while a fast single sweep scrolls the whole list from top to bottom). You can also pick a letter of the alphabet by using the letter column placed on the right. Searching by gradual typing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you have a great variety of fields at hand and, if you ever fall short, you can always rename some of the default ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the large number of fields, only those that are being used are actually shown when viewing the contact's details. Another useful feature is the last call details that are available for each entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We heartily recommend to try the Phonebook from the Media panel. Although it doesn't allow editing the contacts, we really liked its smooth performance and eye candy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management is just fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even if the numerous fields in the address book may sound too complicated, the most important ones - the actual phone numbers - are always at hand thanks to the smart dial feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's native to the WinMo Phone Dialer application, which this time sports a Sony Ericsson brushed metal skin to nicely blend with the handset's exterior. Gradual typing of both letters and numbers will do, and that makes up for the lack of a dedicated number row on the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call the usual options are at hand of muting the microphone or using the loudspeaker. You can also browse the contact book or bring up the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the HTC Touch Pro, the XPERIA doesn't have a proximity sensor to automatically turn the touchscreen off during a call. The absence is causing no trouble though, probably thanks to the slightly projecting metal frame around the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another notable difference is the stylus: it's not magnet-assisted as in the Touch Pro, nor will it launch the Notes application when pulled out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking notes during a call is still an option though. When you're in a call, a button to launch the Notes app appears on screen. As in the Touch Pro, the phone will automatically add the name of the caller, as well as the time and date to the note. The arguably useful feature of rejecting a call with a text message is also present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Touch Pro, the XPERIA doesn't support the turn-to-mute "gimmick" since there is no accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is a skinned version of the Windows Mobile application. As usual, it offers practically unlimited entries. You can choose to view only outgoing, incoming or missed calls or you could view them all at once (distinguished by the icon next to each entry).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed calls are indicated by an on-screen message and the status LEDs on the sides of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we conducted our traditional speakerphone test to conclude the phone part of the XPERIA review. You aren't likely to miss many calls with it, as it scored a Very good mark, ranking well above the HTC Touch Pro. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 handles SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a message editor. Thumb scrolling is enabled in the inboxes and longer messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of Windows 6.1, users enjoy threaded SMS, so you can be sure you get that feature on the X1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email inbox holds no surprises to experienced WinMo users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to input options, the XPERIA boasts a full QWERTY keyboard, which is covered in the hardware section of this review. The standard WinMo on-screen keyboard is at hand too. And we do mean standard. You can switch between small and large keys but even "large" keys are not big enough (stylus, anyone?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely when you switch to landscape mode the keyboard stays the same. Instead of being stretched accordingly, it just sits in between two large chunks of unused space. This however is not such a big deal when you have a hardware keyboard that is easier to use anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X1 also supports handwriting recognition if that is how you prefer to type your messages. Anyway we cannot see any of those input methods (or any other 3rd party solutions for that matter) beating the hardware keyboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image galleries benefit from the high-res screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson X1 comes with the Pictures &amp; Videos application, which is the standard WinMo issue and is a real let down in terms of user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an image you can zoom in and a mini-map appears so you can use it to navigate around the image. There are also basic image-editing options, such as rotate, crop and auto-correct.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Image gallery falls quite short of the Sony Ericsson own application, which is launched from the Media Xperience panel. The panel itself takes after the Media Center we've seen and appreciated across a range of Sony Ericsson feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high-res display is also more than welcome when browsing pictures on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1. Thanks to the WVGA resolution you can see more detail on the screen than any other handset out there (except for the HTC Touch HD of course).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music and Videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X1 comes with the standard Windows Media Player, which clearly underperforms. It only manages mp4 and 3gp and for DivX/XviD you will need a third party application. The arc slider does give the display a bit of tilt, but hardly enough to make a great difference for watching videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Media player doesn't do too well in the music playing department either. The interface is stylus oriented. Tracks and videos are handled much like in the desktop version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, the Media Xperience panel is the way to go. It launches an interface identical to the Media center found on the Sony Ericsson feature phones with a pinch of touch optimization. And as you probably know if you have been keeping track of our recent reviews we really do like this media gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For DivX and XviD palyback we resorted to the well-known Core player. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 pleasantly surprised us here by being able to seamlessly play videos at a bit rate of up to 1.46Mb/s. While going any further than this is sure to result in skipped frames, this is a more than good achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison, the HTC Touch HD, which has the same display resolution, was only able to handle up to 1.2 Mb/s. The XPERIA result is in fact quite close to the HTC Touch Pro but the latter has a smaller screen with 25% less pixels. So, watching videos is surely another point won for XPERIA X1 over the HTC Touch Pro.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Only since recently are Windows Mobile devices considered serious music handsets. Before that their business orientation has served them as a pretty good excuse for the poor audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the latest HTC devices were a clear sign that this is about to change. Therefore we were quite eager to understand if the XPERIA is the next step forward on this way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turned out the handset has the best frequency response we have ever seen on a mobile handset. In addition it also achieved superb noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings. In fact its results on those are even better than the dedicated Apple iPod music player - how is that for a change?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately a price had to be paid and that is the rather high total harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion levels. Nonetheless it seems that there is not too much left before the WinMo devices start to directly compete music-oriented ones.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camera is disappointing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 is equipped with a 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera with a maximum image resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. It also has a LED flash that is supposed to assist night photography but as usually its power is inadequate for producing a decent photo. On the positive side it can also be used as a video light unlike its xenon siblings. Having already checked out the camera performance our advice for you is not to set your expectations about it too high.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main aim of the camera interface appears to be simplicity and it achieves it. Upon startup it displays a large icon (camera or filmstrip) to indicate the selected mode .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two groups of overlaying controls. In the upper left corner there are indicators for "remaining" images/minutes of video, resolution and the location of saved photos. In video mode there is also an indication of whether the microphone is on. The other group is a vertical toolbar on the right side that allows you to switch between modes - photo, video and playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When holding the phone in your right hand (as you will most likely do since the shutter is on the right) you can single-handedly toggle camera modes with your thumb. To work with the settings menu though you would need both hands but the layout of touchscreen controls is quite ergonomic. Navigating with the track pad is almost as easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom is the Settings button. Pressing it reveals another vertical bar, this time on the left. It has four buttons - Scenes, Focus, Flash and Shoot mode. The appearance of each of those four buttons changes any time you select a specific setting, so you know which one is being used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These however are the basic settings. Another press on the settings button will bring up the advanced options. You can change resolution, color effects etc. This menu is not so thumb-friendly but you don't necessarily need the stylus, the track pad does just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Focusing is done by half pressing the shutter key. If touch focus is enabled you can move the focus point by touching any part of the screen with your bare finger.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The image quality of Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 isn't quite as impressive as we hoped. The phone fails to resolve enough detail in photos and dynamic range seems too low even in phone terms. As a result, highlight clipping is quite a common sight on the photos produced by the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Noise levels are also quite high and probably you should've got the idea by now that this isn't the best camera on a mobile phone we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the colors are rather precise on most occasions and if you steer clear of scenes that are too challenging for the dynamic range, things could look pretty decent.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At least the video recording capabilities of the XPERIA X1 seem more promising than the still camera. VGA resolution at 30 fps sounds really sweet and is quite adequate for almost any purpose you can think of. In fact, this may as well be the first PocketPC to offer that kind of video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the image quality is not as pleasing as it sounds - the XPERIA X1 video falls short of what some other VGA recording phones can offer. Most surprisingly our retail XPERIA X1 records in the inferior 3gp format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick comparison between it and the Nokia N82 so you can best see the difference.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to is PocketPC nature, the XPERIA X1 offers excellent connectivity options - HSDPA 7.2Mpbs, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP + EDR are all on board. The handset features quad-band GSM and tri-band HSDPA support, as well as USB 2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for connecting the USB cable in ActiveSync or mass-storage modes. There isn't however a convenient connection type prompt upon every connection like we saw on the HTC Touch Pro. Instead you have to find the setting in the settings menu and do that again every time you need to change the connection mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, the memory card slot often proves quite comfortable for quickly transferring large amounts of data. Unfortunately, the memory card slot is under the battery cover so getting access to it is not a breeze.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 is equipped with the latest version of the Opera browser, which makes the Internet Explorer Mobile redundant. The Opera 9.5 browser is extensively touch-optimized and seems heavily inspired by the iPhone Safari browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WVGA display snatches a point again in the web browsing department. When the browser loads the full website preview, the minute text still remains recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it fails to deliver the same level of usability as the Safari browser, the Opera 9.5 makes up for it by throwing in a few features that totally lack on the iPhone, such as text copy/paste and a download manager. There is also limited Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And a few words about the Opera 9.5 interface. By default web pages are opened fullscreen free of any overlaying controls. A tap on the bottom right corner however brings up the available controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, you've got the address bar at the very top. At the bottom of the screen there is a row of icons that can take you back, take you to bookmarks, bring up the tab switcher, the home page or the browser settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you cannot enjoy YouTube videos (or any other flash video) straight from the web browser, since it lacks Flash Lite 3 support. There are fixes of course, but they involve installing third-party solutions (you can check the tweaks and modding section of this review).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizing is what Windows likes to do<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are a breeze to synchronize with MS Outlook. As of Windows Mobile 6.0, the Calendar allows browsing the events to come. It offers daily, weekly and monthly view. You can have the week start on either Monday or Sunday. Weekends can be hidden from the Calendar if you use it for business strictly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list allows you to add tasks and assign them priority. The Notes also come in handy, as you can either type or directly write the text down on the screen. The Voice recorder and Calculator go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has three alarm slots. Each Alarm can have its own repeat pattern. Unfortunately, due to the little customization options in the default Alarms application, we suggest you check out some free third-party alternatives.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A mobile office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of the Office Mobile, you also get the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, the WVGA display of the X1 proves superior in fitting documents contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Adobe Reader LE, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. We are pleased with the performance of the X1 in this area, as opening and handling PDF documents is usually rather slow on handhelds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application is the rather handy Search software, capable of searching throughout the whole file system and applications. You can set filters, so that the application searches only in the places you need.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 also features a built-in GPS receiver - it's the same Qualcomm gpsOne chipset, which we found on the competing HTC models. This of course is hardly a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X1 supports the Assisted-GPS technology, commonly known as A-GPS. It means you can download current satellite data over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network for a much faster satellite lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately much like the HTC Touch Pro, the XPERIA X1 doesn't have a GPS navigation application pre-installed, so you have to purchase one separately. Just to get you started, there is Google Maps pre-installed. With a dedicated GPS app installed, it performed admirably as an in-car navigation unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to displaying maps on screen, the WVGA display is undoubtedly a great advantage. It offers much more detail than the iPhone for example at relatively the same level of magnification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we are pretty happy with the GPS sensitivity of the Qualcomm gpsOne chipset, the same doesn't go to its energy efficiency. The competing SiRF Star III chipset is much better at that. Coupled with the high-res display, the XPERIA X1 simply cannot offer as much power autonomy with the GPS switched on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks and modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We now come to one of our favorite parts of the review - the Tweaks and Modding chapter. PocketPCs have long been enjoying custom modding, patching and tweaking. Luckily for the XPERIA X1 it quickly earned itself a large number of fans that are constantly on the lookout for a new twist to their gear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first and probably most significant change you can make to your XPERIA X1's user interface is borrowing the HTC TouchFLO 3D. Yeah - you can have a fully functional TouchFLO 3D UI on your XPERIA X1 in a matter of minutes. All you have to do is install a cab file - simple as that. You can find more information on the topic right here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over at the XDA-Developers forum you can also find a dedicated chapter for the modifications of the TouchFLO 3D that the XPERIA users have done. You can download custom fonts, icons, and themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchFLO 3D can even be added as a separate panel on the X-panel interface etc. How cool is that - you can now have both interfaces on a single device and alternate them as easy as switching the panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While this next one won't count as a big tweak, but still we think it's a must-have. Changing the small and dull virtual QWERTY keypad for a more thumb-optimized version is high on our priority list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either use the version ported from the HTC Touch HD or any other of the thumb optimized keyboards out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a wide range of additional tweaks for the XPERIA X1 - from the customizing the LED illuminations through enabling YouTube and adding haptic touch feedback to changing the hardware keyboard layout and creating your own HTML panels. But instead of copying text over, we can just point you to the most popular tweaks gathered all in one place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking back at Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 we think there's one major question to answer. Now, no need to get defensive - the X1 sure is impressive. It goes even further to outperform its main rival - the HTC Touch Pro - in a number of areas and even offers slightly larger display and higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However since the QWERTY keyboard is one of the key selling point and the Touch Pro has such great advantage there the choice between the two is really hard. And with the two month advantage that the HTC had we are quite confident that most users have already sealed a deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 is a really good device, the purchase of which you are unlikely to regret. It is unable to solve all the usability issues of the underlying Windows OS but if modding and tweaking is your thing, you can achieve quite good results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the thumb-optimized X-Panels are quite a treat adding the essential fun element to the XPERIA user experience. We wouldn't by any means strongly recommend the X1 to non-Windows fans but they might still check it out - steps in the right direction are being taken.</paragraph>
