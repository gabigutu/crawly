			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Big is in with Android phones but the Xperia ray is eager to prove that petite smartphones have a charm of their own. All the horsepower of the Arc in a body that's a centimeter shorter both ways - think a premium saloon turned into a roadster. The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray has plenty to offer, not the least of which is an 8MP camera with HD video recording and a Bravia Mobile engine powered screen with eye-popping pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The combo Sony Ericsson have put together includes a 1GHz single core processor, 8MP camera with 720p video and screen expertise borrowed from Sony's TV department. It's the same concoction behind the Arc, the Neo, and the new Mini - now the Xperia ray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the face of it, the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray looks like a widescreen version of the Mini, but whereas the Mini is rather chubby at 16mm, the Xperia ray clocks in at 9.4mm (despite the bigger, 1500mAh battery). The camera is an 8MP unit to keep in line with the current crop of high-end droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.3" screen of FWVGA resolution has nearly 300ppi pixel density (the Retina display has 326ppi) and we appreciate the mobile incarnation of Bravia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray has to offer to those who have been on a lookout for a compact smartphone with high-end specs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Xperia ray at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having already seen the technology inside the Xperia ray in other Sony Ericsson handsets, we know what to expect: smooth Android handling with Sony Ericsson's unique take on the user interface, great 8MP stills and 720p video along with audiophile-grade sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the design and build of the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray that is the big unknown in this preview. Usually phones are thin and big (e.g. Xperia arc), or small but chubby (Xperia mini). The ray goes all in with a modern twist on a timeless classic look. It's a tough act to pull off, considering touchscreen bars don't allow much creativity. But when it works, the result is usually one excellent device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bar is set at 10mm and the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray is getting ready to limbo right under that on the next page - let's cheer it on and see if it will do the 360-degree spin for us.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Xperia ray 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Sony Ericsson Xperia ray stands at 111 x 53 x 9.4 mm and tips the scales at 100 grams sharp.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designwise, there seem to be two schools of thought in the Sony Ericsson Xperia family. The Xperia Arc, the Neo and the Play are based on the same concept, while the Xperia ray belongs with the new Mini and Mini pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the ray isn't modeled after the flagship Arc, we have to say we like the sleek sharp lines and the minimalist intensity of the styling. The big hardware Home key plus capacitive Back and Menu keys has its advantages over a strip of three buttons, for both looks and usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray will be available in standard Black and White colors plus Gold and Pink. We're dealing with the Black version here and it's quite the looker. It's not a retail-ready unit so there's a chance the look might change slightly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray is almost completely covered by scratch resistant glass that will protect the 3.3" Reality display and the rest of the phone's face. The rear surface is matte plastic, which is good to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the display, it has FWVGA resolution (480 x 854 pixels), for a 16:9 aspect ratio. It's smaller than you would expect of a 3.3" screen due to the wider aspect. Still, the high resolution gives it 297ppi pixel density. Numbers aside, the graphics look really smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mobile Bravia engine promises enhanced contrast and colors and from what we've seen so far on previous models, we're inclined to agree. Still, the display is not too bright overall, which reduces sunlight legibility, and also suffers from some contrast and color loss when viewed at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the usual lineup of an earpiece, proximity and ambient light sensors and the front-facing camera. Below the screen is the hardware Home key flanked by capacitive Back and Menu keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home key is a bit stiff but it got our attention with the illuminated strip around it. It can glow in different colors - white, red, green and blue. This has great potential - if the software puts it to proper use. So far what we've noticed is during charging it glows orange and it turns to green once ready.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left and right sides of the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray are not terribly busy. The left houses the microUSB port (uncovered), which doubles as a charger plug and on the right we have the volume rocker. It's small, thin and not very comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top there's the Power/Lock key in the middle, which is small, rounded and comfortable to press (though not prone to accidental presses), and the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom there's the mic pinhole and the lanyard eyelet, plus a small groove to put a fingernail under and pull the back cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray is flat and the battery cover is made of soft matte plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star of the show here is, of course, the 8MP camera lens with its trusty friend, the LED flash, right next to it. The flat rear surface however gives the lens virtually no protection against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is at the bottom side of the back and there's the Sony Ericsson logo just next to it. The logo protrudes ever so slightly so the loudspeaker doesn?t lay on the table directly, but it still gets muffled when you place the phone flat. The secondary microphone is near the camera/flash duo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the battery cover and it's obstructed by the battery, so you have to switch the phone off every time you want to swap the microSD card. It's the same story with the SIM card but that's not such a big issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the battery, Sony Ericsson have managed to fit a massive 1500mAh battery in the slender frame of the Xperia ray. This should give the phone enough juice for up to nearly 18 days of standby (in 2G, a bit more in 3G) and almost 7 hours of talk time (in 2G, exactly 7 hours in 3G). The battery is also good for 36 hours of non-stop music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having handled so many 4+ inch phones, they were starting to feel normal but the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray surly reminds us of what regular-sized handsets feel like. While the 16:9 3.3" is a tad on the small side, it's beautiful to look at and makes for great ergonomics and pocketability. The build feels pretty solid, even the plastic back cover is not too thin or flimsy (which is a common problem with thin phones).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia-nced user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray makes no changes to the software borrowed from the Arc and the Neo. What it means is you get Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread with a very polished custom skin and a nice package of apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a video of the user interface in action, which is a good starting point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray has a five pane homescreen (you can't add or delete panes), with four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut). Those are visible on all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen also does a neat trick called Overview mode. You pinch zoom out of any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All your widgets gather there and you can click the one you want and go to its screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of functionality, it?s similar to the HTC Leap view or what Samsung do in TouchWiz. However widgets here are not crammed in small hard-to-read screens. They?re all shuffled instead on a single screen, so they can use the space more efficiently and remain as big as possible and thus more thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray has some custom-made Sony Ericsson widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the app is no more however, the standard gallery is back).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>More of the Xperia Neo UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The app launcher puts shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort your icons within the grid. You can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually move the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is simple, using the logic (and the visual layout) of iOS devices. You drag one icon over another and a pop-up appears, prompting you to select an icon and a name for the folder you?re about to set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were expecting the home key backlight to have some function beyond charging - maybe turn a different color in different types of menus or maybe change its color when you change the skin of the interface, so that it matches the wallpaper. Well, it didn?t do any of those things - not with this version of the software anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon chipset has been around for a while and we know what to expect from it in terms of performance. Sony Ericsson already used this setup in several of their phones and unsurprisingly, the Xperia ray performed on par with the Arc and the Neo. The results are virtually identical, within the margin of error of the benchmarks. Looking back at some of our other benchmarks, the Xperia ray even manages to outperform old high-enders like the Samsung Galaxy S.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray boasts an 8 megapixel camera, that comes with a single LED flash. Much like the Arc, the ray uses an Exmor R backlit sensor which, in theory, improves the low-light performance. In reality the advantage of the backlit technology is marginal at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface of the Xperia ray consists of two taskbars with options on either side of the screen. The left one holds five shortcuts to various settings, while the right one shows thumbnails of the five most recent photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can slide those with your finger - either to hide them or expand them. It?s a clever solution that lets you pick how much of the camera controls are seen in the viewfinder. The shortcuts in the left column can be rearranged and you can replace some of them with others from the extended menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Settings include capturing mode (Normal, Scene recognition or Smile detection), Scenes, the resolution setting, front/back camera toggle, photo light, geo-tagging, image stabilization and focus mode. Also at your disposal are self timer, shutter sound, exposure, white balance and metering settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray handles the lack of a physical shutter key by making the entire viewfinder a virtual shutter key. You can press and hold to engage the autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is good - comparable to that of the Neo but not quite like the Arc. Noise levels are kept relatively low and photos have good contrast and colors. The amount of captured detail isn't among the best 8MP snappers however. Purple fringing and oversharpening are evident in high-contrast areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind though that unit we're testing is a pre-production one, so it doesn?t represent the final image quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray to our Photo Compare database. The tool?s page has a quick how to guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ray performs very well on the black on white lines of the first chart though the oversharpening is still easy to spot. The mostly flat grey of the second chart however brings out the noise - the grass and gravel squares fared quite well though, with okay amounts of detail left in them. The final chart shows good color rendering.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>720p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray captures 720p video at 30 frames per second and does a good job at it. Frame rate hovers at just under the 30fps mark and there are no duplicated frames. The amount of captured detail is on the low side however and there are jaggies on diagonal lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 format with an overall bitrate of about 6.2Mbps. The audio accounts for about 130Kbps of that and it's recorded in stereo 48KHz format, which is quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera has similar settings to the still camera - focus mode, metering, exposure value and image stabilization are available for adjusting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ray?s camcorder joins the select few with continuous autofocus. It may take a few seconds to refocus after you re-frame but that's better than fast but constant focus hunting that may ruin a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p samples that we captured with the Xperia ray:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively you can download this untouched sample 720p@30fps (13s, 10.2MB), taken straight off the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 720p mobile camcorders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The relatively low bitrate doesn?t allow the Xperia ray to keep much detail in the videos - but the difference is less than we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exposure adjustment is gradual too so it's not sudden or pulsating (and annoying) as in some other phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A looker of a music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Xperia ray is the same app you get in the Arc and the Neo. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get a search shortcut, as well as send and delete options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key. The latter lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the equalizer: it?s a rich selection of presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ray has an FM radio, you just need to connect the headset to serve as the radio antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flash-capable web browser on a small screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is simple, with almost no visible chrome by default. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way you have the entire 3.3? screen to fill with actual content, but the relatively small space still doesn?t fit all that much. The ray?s browser supports three ways to zoom: double tap, dedicated virtual controls and the multitouch pinch-zooming. There's text reflow, which reformats text so that it best fits on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the important new features in the web browser is the full Flash support. YouTube videos didn?t play quite smoothly (even 360p) but we expect this to be sorted out in the retail-ready software. After all, there?s a Snapdragon under the hood. Flash games however played trouble free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our time with the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray was short but it was a neat ride.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, the hardware. There isn?t really anything to complain about. Yes, the screen is small but if you want a bigger one, you should check out the Neo or the Arc instead. Fine handsets both of them, but lacking that sharp sporty feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Size aside, the screen is among the better LCD units we've seen. The sleek user interface and some of that Bravia magic really help sell it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side of things, the ray is up to standard. Flash videos are something the Sony Ericsson team needs to have a look at, even though Flash overall worked fine (games too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Neo and the Arc do well in their roles, there is a shortage of premium compacts in Android, which even other manufacturers fail to address. And no, the Xperia mini doesn?t fit that bill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray does. It?s small, as in a sexy little sports car, rather than small to keep the costs down. The Xperia ray is hot and it knows it. That puts a lot of pressure on it to do well in the upcoming review. But as far as we?re concerned, the Xperia ray is off to a roaring start.</paragraph>
