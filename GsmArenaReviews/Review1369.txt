			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You must remember this one ? maybe not by face but certainly by name. The Samsung S5260 Star II has some big shoes to fill: over 10 million units sold propelled the predecessor to Stardom. The original Samsung Star was one of the most popular handsets in the early days of affordable touch phones. For the sequel, the count-up to 10 million has begun but this time around customers are harder to please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes aren?t too many but they should be significant enough for an entry-level handset. Does anyone really expect miracles from a ?100 phone ? 1080p video recording and big AMOLED screens are reserved for the expensive devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Samsung S5260 Star II should try and deliver is decent telephony, sleek design, long-lasting battery and the occasional bonus feature. A game or two would also be nice, but probably not mandatory ? gaming has long since become a smartphone territory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let?s see how the new Star fits the bill. Join us after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5260 Star II 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 107.5 x 54.0 x 12.4 mm the Samsung S5260 Star II is a pretty compact device that you can easily slip into any pocket. It has grown a bit on its S5230 predecessor, but you won?t notice the difference unless you have the two devices side by side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 94g is also perfectly acceptable. We can hardly think of too many occasions that it might become a burden. Then again it doesn?t make the most solid impression when you hold the phone in hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of design alone, the Samsung S5260 Star II is not essentially different from its predecessor. The overall styling is familiar and the controls have mostly remained unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the finish of the Star II is undeniably superior. The lacquered surfaces give the new Star the right measure of sophistication that makes all the difference in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all, feature phones are having a hard time competing against affordable smartphones nowadays and design is becoming increasingly important.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3? WQVGA capacitive touchscreen is the centerpiece of the front panel. Its brightness, contrast and color rendering are acceptable. The viewing angles are good though and the capacitive sensor is well calibrated. It responds to very light presses but it?s not overly eager to register a touch, reducing the number of accidental taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility isn't among the strong points of the display, mainly because of the highly reflective coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there's just the earpiece ? no ambient light sensor to automatically control the brightness or a proximity sensor to lock the touchscreen during calls. Below the screen there are three hardware keys: receiver keys on the left and right and the menu button in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three hardware controls are prominent and thumb-friendly, causing no usability issues whatsoever. On the white version of the phone, the buttons are made of transparent plastic. They look like glass on the creamy white surface of the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side of the S5260 Star II features the Power/Lock key and the microSD card slot, which is covered by a plastic flap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching to the left side we come upon the volume rocker and the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port are found on top of the Star II. The microUSB port is sealed with a sliding cover, while the audio jack is exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone features nothing but the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our test Star II unit is white and it has a white lacquer back cover ? it looks pretty good and it hides fingerprints quite well. The Samsung Star II will also come in black in case you find white too extravagant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover reveals the 1000mAh battery and the SIM compartment. Samsung still hasn?t announced the official battery stats of the Star II, but we can only commend its real life performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a full charge, it took almost 10 days to drain the battery. During that time, we made 50 minutes of calls, Wi-Fi was off but there was the occasional connection to a Bluetooth headset and we also browsed several web pages over the mobile internet connection. Granted, that isn?t the most intensive usage, but we doubt most owners will treat the Star II much differently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II is tall and narrow, making it comfortable to use in calls and the slightly rounded back and sides improve the feel of the phone in the hand. The controls are easy to reach and press, leaving us with very little complaints. A side-mounted memory card slot and a standard 3.5 mm jack are nice to have in an affordable phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface ? feature phone TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz really has grown over the years ? in its dumbphone incarnation it offers features and flexibility to match much of what smartphones can do. In fact, inexperienced users will be hard pressed to tell the difference between this and Bada.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here it is on video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smartphones have much bigger catalogs of apps but the choice of Java apps for feature phones is quite good: Opera Mini Google Maps, and so on ? there?s even games. Samsung Apps will come in handy here, but we?ll cover that later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz homescreen is widget-based and you can place as many widgets as you can fit without overlapping. When you run out of space, you can Tilt the phone sideways while in edit mode, and you can add (or remove) homescreens and rearrange existing ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Widget button lets you pull out more widgets (or stash some away) from the tray at the bottom. If there isn't enough room on the current screen, it will automatically scroll to an empty one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 14 widgets preinstalled but you can download more from Samsung Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the homescreen there are three virtual buttons ? Keypad, Contacts and Messages. They are visible in the main menu too, and can?t be reassigned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu stretches over several different screens (up to ten), which are sweep-scrollable sideways. Only native apps can be put in the menu, though ? being able to put shortcuts to Java apps would have been better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each page in the main menu consists of a 3x4 shortcuts. The shortcuts are big and easily thumbable. Tilting the phone sideways in edit mode lets you add/remove and rearrange menu pages (just like with the homescreen panes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5260 Star II features multitasking complete with a task manager. As usual, you press and hold the menu key to bring up the task manager and you can switch between and terminate apps (both native and Java).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To minimize an app, you hit the menu key. The End key is a little inconsistent ? it will exit some apps straight away, while in others it will bring up a dialog prompting you to exit, resume or minimize.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An Android-inspired feature is the panel on the top of the screen ? you open and close it with taps (no pulling) to check missed events or toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and silent mode on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player and radio controls also appear there when the respective app is active. This way you can control playback from almost anywhere (the panel is accessible throughout the phone interface except Java apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen is the typical Samsung ?sweep to unlock? variety. In the event of a missed call, a puzzle piece is displayed. Dragging it on the appropriate place will unlock the phone and open up the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing you?re likely to see on the lock screen is the CD icon on top. It appears when the music player (or radio) is playing or paused and shows the track info along with the previous, next and play/pause buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some main menu entries also show a number in their top right corner ? like the number of missed calls, unread emails and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II packs an accelerometer, which does the two usual tricks ? screen rotation and turn to mute ? but there?s a handy shortcut with it too. A double tap can launch one of the phone apps ? browser, contacts, music player, or anything else from the main menu really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speed and responsiveness of the software is far from stellar and we also saw ?Insufficient memory? errors more often than we would have liked. A restart would typically fix the problem, for it to only to re-appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After so many iterations Samsung should have ironed out such issues.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can show contacts from the SIM card, phone memory or both. For each contact you can store a variety of information including multiple phone numbers, contact photo, personal ringtones and so on. There?s an option to copy contacts to and from the SIM card too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is tabbed, the first tab showing the contact list and the other two handling Groups and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is alphabet scroll to help you find contacts easier and search by gradual typing (which doesn?t support text prediction, so you have to use regular multitap).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool TouchWiz feature is enabled on the Star II whereby a right swipe on a contacts name will call the person, while a left swipe will bring up the SMS composer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook also features social network integration: Facebook, Twitter, MySpace. Once you add your account (one for each network) you can link contacts. Merging phone and Facebook details is a feature we?re used to seeing mostly on smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The info for each contact is organized into four tabs. The first, called Info, shows all phone numbers, emails and other details of the contact with shortcuts for SMS and social networking messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second one, History, is basically a call log for that contact. After that is Activities, which lists recent SNS updates from the contact, and finally there?s the media tab, which shows the contact?s online albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An important note here is that you can?t edit the SNS details of a contact, just the contact info that is stored on the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good, but smart dialing is limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II is very good at its main job ? making calls. We tested it in a location with very poor coverage and even though there were drops in the audio, the Star II is good at holding onto signal. The in-call sound is clear but not as loud as we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about the dialer. You dial just like you would on any touch phone. There are both hardware and on-screen buttons to handle calls. Annoyingly, the on-screen End call button requires a press and hold to work. The Hash key can mute the call sound and can also activate the Silent profile upon a long press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S5260 Star II supports Smart dialing ? type in the first few digits of the number and a suggested contact will pop up. It will look only at the numbers and won?t try to match contact names, which in our opinion would have been the better option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for loudspeaker performance, the S5260 Star II scored an Average mark, doing slightly worse than our preview unit. You can find more details about the test itself as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email ward off spam<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II can handle all common message types. The handset has a shared editor for SMS and MMS and a separate one for emails. Text messages are viewed in conversation mode, which uses contact photos and speech bubbles in an IM chat layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting feature is the scheduled message ? you can set a time and date for the message to be sent automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature is the Spambox ? spam has crept into SMS too, it?s no longer limited to email. You can create rules to filter certain messages ? based on the sender?s number or subject (if it?s an MMS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rules can either match the field exactly or parts of the number (e.g. block numbers which start with a common prefix, like country codes or special operator numbers that send automatic messages).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native email client automatically retrieved the correct settings for our test Gmail account. The email client also supports push messaging and you can add multiple accounts too (but there?s no combined inbox).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The attachment limit for sending is 10MB, which is enough for most file types. If you receive an office document as an attachment, you will be able to view it as well thanks to the integrated office document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input is handled by a portrait phone keypad (with T9 prediction) and a landscape QWERTY keyboard (activated automatically, thanks to the accelerometer). The phone keypad is OK for punching in a word or two but the keys are too small for anything longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys on the landscape keyboard are not much bigger so you might want to enable the predictive input here too ? it will reduce the number of thumbos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Gallery is built into the file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S5260 Star II gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images. You?ll want to switch to Thumbnail view though (it aligns the thumbnails to a grid).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you?ve opened a picture to view, you can browse the complete collection by finger sweeps across the screen without having to return to the image list. The accelerometer-based tilt browsing is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the images is fast and responsive and zooming into 3MP images is no problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no pinch zooming despite the fact the Star II has a capacitive display. Instead, you have the one-finger zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing images in landscape mode is also available and the rotation is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player has what it takes, DNSe too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II is a very capable music player. You can filter tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated but you can create your own playlists too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background and you can control it from the notification area or the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5260 Star II offers the standard equalizer presets: pop, jazz, classic, as well as stereo widening, dynamic and surround effects. You can?t create custom equalizers, but with such a wide selection of presets you really won?t need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DNSe sound enhancing technology offers Externalization, Music clarity, Bass enhancement, Mega bass, Wide and Concert hall presets. There?s also a virtual 5.1 channel mode too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find music service is a tap away and can be used to identify tracks playing around you by sampling chunks and looking them up online. The Find similar option looks for songs similar to the one you?re currently listening to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Radio has RDS, can record your favorite tracks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star features an FM radio with RDS. There's an option to record radio broadcasts as well, which can be a cheap way to get individual tracks or whole music sets off the radio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality isn't too bad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of course we also subjected the Star II to our traditional audio quality test. It turned out a decent performer, which is probably more than you would expect from a handset in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is on the quiet side when plugged into an active external amplifier, but its output is pretty clean. There is a little stereocrostalk, but we guess most of you will be able to live with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things look a bit worse with headphones attached as volume levels drop even further and stereo crosstalk rises significantly. Frequency response and intermodulation distortion also worsen a bit, but still remain acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player with mosaic search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is very limited in terms of codec support ? only MP4 and 3GP are supported. It has some cool features like the 5.1 channel audio (simulated of course and works with headphones only) and mosaic search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an option to stretch the video so that it fills the whole screen, which is mostly useless since it distorts the picture. At least there?s brightness control in the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mosaic search takes a number of screenshots, about 30 seconds apart, to help you find the scene you?re looking for ? tap on the thumbnail and playback will resume from that point on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bare-bone 3MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II imaging department is pretty basic ? the 3 megapixel camera snaps photos with a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. There?s no autofocus, no shutter key, not even flash or lens protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and has a number of nice built-in features like smile shot, preset scenes, viewfinder gridlines and panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a 3MP snapper, the camera on the Samsung S5260 is actually pretty good. The photos usually turn out with pleasing colors and contrast. The noise levels are low and there?s a decent amount of detail in the photos (though the work of noise reduction is visible in the trees and foliage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several photo samples, so you can judge for yourself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the 3MP lineup. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung S5260 Star II in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>MMS-quality video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera on the Samsung S5260 Star II can record video too, but QVGA only at 15fps. OK for MMS, unusable for just about everything else. Here?s a QVGA video sample at 15fps from the Star II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity hinges on Wi-Fi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The key point in the Star II connectivity is the Wi-Fi b/g/n support. Other than that, you fall back to quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for mobile Internet. The Samsung S5260 also packs Bluetooth 3.0 but that?s good only for future compatibility rather than speedy data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a microUSB port too ? it defaults to Samsung Kies connectivity and, annoyingly, if you want Mass storage, you?ll have to manually select it from the Settings menu every time. You can only access the microSD card in Mass storage mode and not the internal memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 web browser looks very much like its Bada OS sibling but it doesn?t offer as much functionality. The browser supports kinetic scrolling and one-finger zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is autosuggestion for the URL field, which means you won?t have to type much on the uncomfortable keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are bookmarks too along with history list and a list of most visited sites (displayed as thumbnails). You can also subscribe to RSS feeds, which is a great way to keep up to date with multiple sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser is reasonably fast most of the time but it will occasionally pause to redraw the web page. We also got several out of memory errors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking apps and widgets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Aside from the phonebook integration, the Samsung S5260 Star II packs dedicated Facebook and Twitter apps and a couple of widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Feeds and Updates widget combines the streams from Facebook, MySpace and Twitter and lets you post updates to those networks too (you can even post an update simultaneously to all networks you?re signed on to).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a LinkedIn widget too, but there?s no app to go with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Social hub displays the number of unread message (SMS, MMS), SNS updates and unread emails too. There?s a convenient Compose button as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook app shows your newsfeeds, the wall and photos for you and your friends, messages, notifications and requests ? basically it supports it all. It can compose new messages too and upload photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Twitter app is pretty straightforward. It has three tabs ? the first shows all tweets from people you follow, the next tab shows only tweets that mention you and the third holds direct messages. You can send out new tweets but there?s no option to automatically attach a photo to the message.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Document viewer handles Office 2007 docs too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II comes with the Picsel Office document viewer, which supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and also PDF files. The viewer supports one finger zoom like the gallery and there?s a handy search feature to help you navigate longer documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewers work fast enough for a feature phone. There?s no option to edit documents though (even a paid option).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-stocked organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II has a number of useful time-management applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views organized as tabs - daily, monthly and agenda view. Events can either be appointments or anniversaries and you can tag each event with a location and add participants.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is quite customizable. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with the following configurable options - custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name. You have world clock, timer and stopwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II also offers a basic calculator, a voice recorder and To-Do and Memo apps. There?s a dictionary app too, which comes preloaded with an English dictionary, but you can download more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Star II comes with the Palringo and Yahoo! instant messenger preinstalled. Palringo supports various protocols (Facebook Chat, G-Talk, ICQ, AIM and XMPP) and can handle multiple chats at once. There?s an option to share your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s Google Maps, which has all the usual features, but without a GPS receiver you?ll have to rely on the rather inaccurate Cell-ID positioning.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have long been trying to recapture the best-selling magic of the original Star. A sequel is now official but we?d be wrong to call two of a kind. Samsung have a full house of Star clones already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, when we heard the Star II was coming we were excited to see how Samsung was planning to live up to expectations. After we saw the specs the excitement waned and we started looking for differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clearly, the biggest advantage of the Samsung Star II is the Wi-Fi b/g/n support. The capacitive display and Bluetooth 3.0 sound good but don?t offer much in reality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new software does have a big impact though ? it doesn?t have a spotless performance but it really improves the user experience. The deep social networking integration will appeal to the Star II?s target audience too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a lot of competition, both old and new, and the Star II will struggle to gain an edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Samsung S5230 Star still features in carrier portfolios (even in shiny white). The Star Wi-Fi has nearly the same features as the Star II but being older, it should cost a lot less. The Samsung S5560 Marvel is an option too if you?re looking for a better camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung S5230 Star ? Samsung S5230W Star WiFi ? Samsung S5560 Marvel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But you don?t have to limit yourself to feature phones ? smartphones have only been getting cheaper lately and the introductory price of Star II is rather high. Here?s a collection of smartphones that have similar (or better) specs as the S5260 Star II and won?t break the bank as some of those cost less than Star II current price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two droids ? the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 and the old but gold LG GT540 Optimus. The Samsung S5250 Wave525 runs Samsung?s own smartphone OS, Bada, and there?s the Nokia C5-03 in the Symbian corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 ? LG GT540 Optimus ? Samsung S5250 Wave525 ? Nokia C5-03</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first Star sold its way into Samsung?s hall of fame. But that was the dawn of affordable touch phones. The better spec?d and better looking sequel will find it hard to emulate the original. It?s a fine device on its own, but it will inevitably feel the pressure of cheap smartphones. But that?s for Samsung to worry about. You can go ahead and give the Star II a try. It doesn?t charge a fortune and having any prior touch phone experience is not a must.</paragraph>
