			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In an attempt to LG recapture some of its old glory LG released the first phone with the next generation Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset. The Samsung Galaxy S III has been out for several months now, but is yet to beaten as the best Androids smartphone on the market. The Optimus G looks like the strongest challenger so far and it seems to have a very good chance of being pronounced the new king by the end of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Together, the two handsets represent the quad-core Android phone elite, so we just had to pit them against each other to decide who's the best. We kick off with the most prominent advantages that each of the contenders holds over its opponent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S III over Optimus G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having a next-generation chipset is a great advantage for the Optimus G, as it should give it both performance and power efficiency advantage over the Galaxy S III. On the flipside, the Galaxy S III and its Exynos 4 chipset have the optimizations of Jelly Bean on their side, so it might not be a walk in the park for the LG flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also brought the best that its display divisions had to offer - the Optimus G is betting on a True HD-IPS+ LCD. The Samsung Galaxy S III on the other hand didn't stay in the R&amp;D lab long enough to get a three-subpixel-per-pixel AMOLED like the Galaxy Note II, so it has to settle for a PenTile matrix. However, the AMOLED technology has some key advantages over LCD, so again we'll have to do some testing before we find out who comes on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera sensors on both smartphone beasts are Sony-made, but while LG thought ahead and secured 13MP unit, Samsung used 8MP sensor. And while LG does have a theoretical advantage here, lens and image processing might make a big difference, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In theory, the LG Optimus G should walk away with the win here. Having spend a few extra months in development and managing to snag newer components, the LG flagship is the clear favorite in this fight. However, the Galaxy S III won't give up the crown without a fight. After all, there's a reason why Samsung is the world's largest smartphone manufacturer with a near two-fold advantage over the second-placed Apple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strap on your seat belts, as it might get rough.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two phones share a lot of similarities in their designs but they also differ quite a bit. The Samsung Galaxy S III is "nature inspired", so it's smooth and rounded, while the LG Optimus G is more industrial, with a rectangular look and all-glass build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We say all-glass because the back is covered with the same Gorilla Glass 2 material as the front. We should note that "Gorilla glass" is not actual glass, but a toughened transparent plastic, so when you tap it with your finger, it sounds more like plastic than glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the back of the Optimus G is interesting for another reason too - the pattern underneath the protective layer is diamond-shaped, but it reflects the light in such a way that it creates an illusion of depth. It looks as if it covered in a some kind of pyramid-shaped pits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Galaxy S III looks similar because of the hyperglazed plastic (hyperglazed means there's a transparent layer over the opaque plastic), but Samsung has made no claims about it being extra tough. The plastic below the transparent layer has either a brushed aluminum pattern or no pattern at all (it depends on which color option you get).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, neither pattern will be everyone's cup of tea - the two materials are certainly not as cool as metal or polycarbonate. Still, we feel that the LG flagship is the slightly better looking of the and we are also willing to give it another point LG Optimus G for the scratch-resistant surface on the back. The Galaxy S III fights back with more color options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving to the front, we find two quite different displays - the Optimus G has a 4.7" screen with 15:9 aspect ratio, while the Galaxy S III has a 4.8" screen with 16:9 aspect ratio. However, as it turns out, the two screens have virtually the same surface area (it's within a percent).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll cover the screens in more detail in the next chapter, for now we'll focus on the rest of the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other items of interest on the front are the Android keys. Both LG and Samsung have decided against using on-screen keys only (and they use Back/Home/Menu, instead of Back/Home/Task switcher). Anyway, the Galaxy S III has a hardware Home key and two capacitive keys, while all three keys on the Optimus G are capacitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to buttons and ports, both phones are quite similar. They have the Power/Lock keys on their right and the volume rockers on their left. In terms of usability, we found no difference - buttons are easy to reach and comfortable to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker on the Optimus G is a bit unusual as it has a hump in the middle. That has a special purpose - it allows you to easily press both parts of the rocker simultaneously, which triggers the QMemo app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ports are similarly positioned as well - a 3.5mm audio jack on top and a microUSB port centered at the bottom. Both phones also have mic pinholes on top and bottom, which are used for noise-cancelling during calls and for stereo sound recording in videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cameras on the back of both phones protrude, exposing them to risk of scratching. The Galaxy S III camera is in the center and the phone is more stable when placed on a level surface, while the 13MP shooter no the Optimus G is off to the side and the phone is more wobbly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The designs of the two phones diverge when it comes to battery and card slot access. The Samsung Galaxy S III has a removable back cover, which gives you access to the battery, microSIM and microSD card slots. This means you can carry a spare battery, easily change the original one when it starts to show its age and easily swap SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G on the other hand has the back held into place by two screws. You could open it if you have the proper tools, but you can't do it on the go. The microSIM card slot also requires a tool to open, so swapping SIMs isn't quite as easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps most limiting of all is the lack of a microSD card slot - you do get 32GB of built-in memory with the LG Optimus G and that's it. With the Galaxy S III you can have 16/32/64GB of built in storage and up to a 64GB microSD card on top of that (you can even get more than one card and exchange them when neccessary if you wish).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Extending the longevity of the Samsung flagship is therefore easier with quick upgrades like a fresh battery or more storage. On the other hand, LG is promising an expanded lifespan (by more than 50%) on the Li-Po battery inside the Optimus G, so it will be longer before it needs a fresh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having mentioned the batteries, we have to say that both have 2100mAh capacity and we'll take a close look at the battery life just as soon as we're done with this chapter and the screen comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G is the more compact phone of the two shaving a few millimeters off the height and width and it's even 0.1mm thinner. Still, the LG flagship and the Galaxy S III are feel virtually identical when it comes to pocketability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G is 12g heavier though, which combined with the lower volume of its body is enough to affect the in-hand feel. People who like phones with some heft will appreciate the added solidness, while others probably won't care too much about the difference.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Screen comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned that the two screens have different aspect ratios, but we didn't cover what difference that makes. The 16:9 aspect ratio of the Samsung Galaxy S III is more media oriented, while watching videos on the Optimus G will entail either letterboxing or cropping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG chose to focus on text instead - the 15:9 screen is taller in landscape orientation, which is more accommodating to reading web pages, emails, documents and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there's an even more fundamental difference between the two screens - one is an LCD, while the other is an AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G has a True HD-IPS+ LCD screen with 768 x 1280 resolution. On a 4.7" diagonal, that means 318ppi pixel density, but the bigger advantage here is the full RGB matrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III uses a Super AMOLED screen with 720p resolution, which combined with the slightly bigger diagonal makes for a slightly lower pixel density of 306ppi. It's a PenTile matrix though, so pixel densities shouldn't be compared directly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We used a digital microscope to shoot the matrices of both screens up close. On the Optimus G, each RGB triplet is a pixel, while on the Galaxy S III pixels are composed of either an RG or a BG pair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The macro shot of tiny white text is very telling when it comes to sharpness - the Galaxy S III has to use sub-pixel rendering, so the 1px-wide lines on the font come out 1.5px thick (it needs two pixels to get all three primary colors).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For normal-size text, the effect isn't very visible, though if you look up close you'll see a telling cross-hatch pattern. Text on the Optimus G remains sharp even on very low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED screen may lose in sharpness, but it has some inherent advantages. The black levels are virtually 0, the contrast is superior and the colors are more saturated (though this might not appeal to everyone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD has a few tricks up its sleeves as well. For one, it's brighter (it scored 141 nits more than the Super AMOLED) and for another it's got a slightly more realistic colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, there is light leaking through black colors and it's noticeable even in a well-lit room, but with the extra brightness, the contrast ratio still works out to an impressive 1438:1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An issue of the IPS+ technology are the viewing angles - the LG smartphone exhibits both contrast degradation and color shift when you view it at an angle. The color shift is most visible when it's rotated (i.e. having one of the four edges pointing at you), which isn't the case most of the time, so it's not a major issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED screen shows a faint greenish tint at an angle, typical behavior for AMOLED screens, but it's no as bad to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What is a major issue, however, is screen reflectivity. LG has been touting their ZeroGap technology that is supposed to minimize reflections, but it doesn't work quite as advertised. The Optimus G screen is way too reflective, giving it below average sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED screen on the Galaxy S III, on the other hand, is one of the best we have tested in this regard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To summarize our findings, the Samsung Galaxy S III screen loses on sharpness and maximum brightness (some people find it too dim), but it has great saturation, contrast, angles and sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G screen is still among the best though - it offers great sharpness, higher brightness and very good colors (though not perfect). Disappointing sunlight legibility is quite an issue however.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We separate battery life into three important categories - talking on a 3G network, browsing the web over Wi-Fi and watching videos. Then we take those numbers, plus a standby reading and give each phone an endurance rating - how long last without needing a charge, if you do an hour of each activity per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's important to note that both phones have 2100mAh batteries, but the LG Optimus G uses a next-gen chipset, while the Samsung Galaxy S III has the best of the outgoing generation of Exynos 4 chipsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calling is generally a test of how efficient the modem of each phone is - the screen is off and the CPU has nothing to do. The LG Optimus G scores a major victory here, beating the Galaxy S III by 50%. While it's not the best score we have seen, the S4 Pro is certainly off to a good start.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly the Samsung Galaxy S III did a job at the web browsing part of the test, outlasting the Optimus G by about an hour and fifteen minutes. It did get a big boost from the Jelly Bean update (curiously, the boost is about an hour and fifteen minutes), so we suspect the LG phone might catch up when it gets the Android 4.1 update.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III rounds up the score in its favor with a two hour advantage in the video watching test. The Optimus G is three hours ahead of its Optimus 4X predecessor, so it's a good score too, just not good enough for the win here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the end, the LG Optimus G scores an endurance rating of 45 hours, while the Samsung Galaxy S III earned a score of 50 hours. You can read about more our testing methodology here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talkative people will get better battery life out of the Optimus G, but for tasks that require the screen to be on and the CPUs working, the Galaxy S III will generally last longer. We have to say that the Galaxy S III was performing virtually identical to the Optimus G before the Jelly Bean update, so we suspect the two will be on par when the LG flagship get treated to the latest Android version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interfaces evenly matched<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You'd think that coming from two different companies and running two different versions of Android, the LG Optimus G and the Samsung Galaxy S III will be quite different. Well, they are not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean with Samsung's latest TouchWiz customizations, which reach just about every corner of the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G is on Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich at the moment, but is waiting on an update to bring it to Jelly Bean. The Optimus UI tweaks are as far reaching as those of its competitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the lockscreens. Both phones offer more or less the same features, though Samsung offers two extra unlock methods (Face &amp; voice and Motion) and can have a news ticker and weather info on the screen. The LG gives you a choice of clock style instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the homescreen, both phones let you have up to 7 panes that you can rearrange and pick which one is the default. The shortcut docks on the bottom fit 4 customizable shortcuts on the Galaxy S III and 3 on the Optimus G, but both phones fit only 4 icons on a row outside this dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are resizable (this was introduced in ICS) and since it's running Jelly Bean, the Galaxy S III will move widgets out of the way when you re-order them. The Optimus G will do the same, despite running ICS, so LG has closed the gap here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification areas are similar and both feature connectivity toggles, but Samsung has picked the 5 it consider most useful and fixed them, while LG lets you pick which ones you want. A helpful trick on both phones is to long press a toggle, which brings out the Settings menu (e.g. GPS settings if you long-press the GPS toggle).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite offering fewer toggles, the Galaxy S III manages to even the score here as its notification area has a brightness slider and (again, thanks to Jelly Bean) you can expand its notifications with a two-finger swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something that both phones offer is a simpler launcher. Samsung calls it Easy mode and it's a preset with big, thumbable widgets. The cool thing about it is that Easy mode and the default (Basic mode) remember separate arrangements on the homescreen, so you can use one for work widgets and one for personal widgets and easily switch between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus G does something else - it has an alternative launcher called Easy Home. It features a single widget on the first homescreen that shows weather and news from Yahoo! And a list of five contacts. The other homescreens are filled with all your app shortcuts - there is no app drawer, which makes Easy Home feel quite iOS-like. There's a shortcut dock at the bottom, which has three fixed shortcuts - Phone, Contacts and Message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like LG's solution as it really is simple - the problem is few will buy a Snapdragon S4 Pro monster smartphone and feel the default launcher is too complicated? Samsung's solution adds no real simplicity, but you can use it as a makeshift way to keep work and personal screen setups (something like HTC's Scenes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An advanced feature that Samsung added to TouchWiz is Smart stay - it prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face. LG offers its own version of the feature, called Wise screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both companies tried to make use of the processing power of their quad-core smartphones in several interesting ways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG is quite proud of its QSlide feature - you activate it from the video player and it makes the video transparent, allowing you to use other apps, while watching them. You can adjust the transparency from a floating slider widget. We're not as excited about this feature as LG is, having two semi-transparent apps on the screen seems to make them both pretty hard to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's solution, Pop up play, is slightly more usable - it just moves the video to a floating, resizable window that covers only part of the screen and you can move out of the way. QSlide can have a small video window too, but you can't move or resize it and it is always at least a little bit transparent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we really would have liked to see here is the split-screen interface from the Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another show of strength by Samsung is that the Video player app shows animated thumbnails - it gives you a better look at the video than a static thumb and ups the eye-candy quota.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G does have Dual Screen Dual Play though - when you hook it up to an external monitor with an MHL adapter, you can use the phone separately from what's playing on the screen (a video or a presentation). This way, you can show slides while reading your notes on the phone, or watch a movie and check IMDb for the name of that actor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III has an MHL-enabled microUSB port too, but it just mirrors the phone's screen on the external monitor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We keep calling the Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset a monster, but how fast is it really? The Exynos 4 Quad chipset was the fastest on the market just five months ago, so how big a difference can a generation in CPU architectures make?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we turn to synthetic benchmarks to answer these questions. The Samsung Galaxy S III does have the advantage of running Jelly Bean (which offers a faster web browser and other optimizations, but consumes more GPU power). The LG Optimus G has an extra disadvantage (besides the older OS) in that the S4 Pro chipset is still new and the drivers for it aren't fully mature yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi and Linpack show that the Krait cores have an advantage in both single and multi-threaded performance. They are a special case as they measure raw CPU power.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench, AnTuTu and Quadrant try to give compound scores testing CPU, RAM, GPU and I/O. Geekbench and AnTuTu give the win to the Galaxy S III, while Quadrant prefers the Optimus G (it should be noted that the Quadrant benchmark is made by Qualcomm). We suspect the Optimus G performance will improve as the software matures, but at the moment, it's not a decisive victory.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Let's turn to GLBenchmark and see what those GPUs can do. NenaMark 2 can't stress them enough, so they run into the 60fps software-imposed limit.. GLBenchmark was tested using the offscreen mode, which sidesteps software fps limits and differences in hardware screen resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, going up to 1080p showed a clear difference. The Adreno 320 in the LG Optimus G offered nearly double the framerate (and it's a playable framerate too) compared to the Mali-400 in the Samsung Galaxy S III. Sure, neither phone has a 1080p screen, but this shows that the Optimus will offer more playable framerates with games are heavier than GLBenchmark.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Web browsing proved to be the Achilles heel of the LG Optimus G. It loses on all three benchmarks we ran, but more worryingly, it lost two rounds to the Tegra 3-powered Optimus 4X HD (which also runs ICS).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>See what we mean about software maturity? The LG Optimus G has the hardware to come out the undisputed winner in this chapter, but it only managed to comprehensively outdo its rival in graphics power and got tripped up by software elsewhere. Qualcomm's Mobile Developer Platform with Snapdragon S4 Pro (CPUs clocked at 1.5GHz) benchmarked better than what we're seeing from the Optimus G.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Comparing a 13MP camera and an 8MP camera might seem like comparing apples to oranges, but higher resolution doesn't necessarily mean better image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones use customized camera interfaces, but the look and functionality has converged to the point where there isn't much difference. Both UI feature a column of customizable shortcuts on the left, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the LG Optimus G and the Samsung Galaxy S III can shoot panoramas, HDR photos, burst shots, and take photos during video capture. They also offer face detection and voice-powered shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G has that humpback volume rocker that can be used as a hardware shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool option that LG has added is the so-called Time machine camera. It continuously snaps photos in the background, waiting for you to press the shutter. And when you do, it saves several of the photos captured before you pressed the shutter and several after. This way you can capture the moment even if you don't have cat-like reflexes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G may have an extra 5MP resolution, but in terms of image quality it doesn't really pull ahead. Photos are grainy (it's easy to spot it in the sky) and the noise reduction that tries to fight the effect takes away a good deal of the fine detail. So, while the Samsung Galaxy S III has fewer pixels to work with, it resolves about the same amount of detail (and even more on some occasions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of color accuracy, both phones are fairly good, but the Optimus G photos have a yellowish tint, while the Galaxy S III boosts the green channel, so neither is perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the crops below you can see just how much the noise reduction takes away from the Optimus G photos (most visible in the foliage) and you'll spot the subsequent sharpening to try and bring the detail back (the fence against the blue sky).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution camera samples if you want to take a look a better look and do some pixel peeping yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that both cameras have virtually the same field of view and that the macro shots were taken from the closest possible distance (The Galaxy S III was able to focus from slightly closer range). They were shot under artificial lighting, where the Optimus G continues to exhibit a yellowish tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pixel peepers can aslo head over to our Photo compare tool. Take a close look at the synthetic resolution chart (the first one), it tries to gauge the captured resolution for cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Optimus G vs. Samsung Galaxy S III in our Photo compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a crop of the relevant areas. The LG Optimus G has a slight advantage, but it's no nearly as great as the resolution difference suggests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video cameras of both phones have user interfaces identical to their still cameras and in turn, practically identical to each other. The Samsung Galaxy S III comes out slightly ahead in terms of features as it can pause video recording (so you can have multiple scenes in the same video file) and it features touch focus during recording (with a button to go back to continuous autofocus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have the option to capture photos during video recording. Although the Optimus G has the more powerful chipset, it only snaps 1080p photos (practically a frame of the video), while the Galaxy S III does 6MP shots (its maximum resolution in 16:9 mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the still cameras, the LG Optimus G camera is wider in video mode than the Samsung Galaxy S III, which is usually an advantage as it lets you fit more in the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones record video at up to 1080p@30fps in .MP4 files, but the Galaxy S III uses a higher bitrate (17Mbps) compared to the LG Optimus G (10Mbps). The Optimus, however, goes a bit higher with the audio bitrate (160Kbps vs. 120Kbps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the lower bitrate results in less detail in the Optimus G video as compression takes its toll. The Optimus G clips also have more limited dynamic range with highlights and shadows clipping quite a usual sight. The Galaxy S III is prone to over-exposure (as did the G for that matter), so you might want to use the exposure compensation setting to get the best results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can watch the video samples we captured, just don't forget to pick 1080p and view them in full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While watching the videos, you might have noticed that the Galaxy S III autofocus is a bit overzealous, so you might need to use tap to focus. The Optimus G autofocus is more restrained and is noticeably quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, you are welcome to take a trip to our Video compare tool and see how the two compare there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy S III and the LG Optimus G posted some excellent scores in our audio quality test. The Galaxy S III output is generally a bit cleaner, but the difference is a bit hard to detect with a naked ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two are also quite evenly matched, when it comes to volume levels too - sadly neither of them is particularly impressive in that aspect. If we had to pick we'd give the Galaxy S III the win here, but no matter which one you choose, you'd be getting pretty good audio output.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G and the Samsung Galaxy S III are the best Android can currently offer. Picking between a smartphone that came to the market five months ago and one that is just arriving might have seemed easy at first, but after the somewhat surprising finding in this review, things are less clear cut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Opttimus G chipset is so vastly powerful that we expected it to swim laps around the Galaxy S III Exynos, but the smartphone was obviously let down by its software support. The LG flagship managed to win on many occasions, but the differences were pretty minor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only place where the Optimus G was able to give its competitor a real trashing was GPU performance at 1080p resolution. On the other hand, the LG Optimus G lost the web browsing performance battle, which is one of the most common applications of smartphones these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13 megapixel camera came as another disappointment to us. LG made quite a big deal about it, but as we found out it's not able to offering any real life advantage over the Samsung Galaxy S III 8MP shooter. Even worse - the Optimus G video recording comes seriously short of the Galaxy S III footage. Don't get us wrong - the LG Optimus G does some pretty good photos and decent videos, but if we had to pick one of these two for its overall camera performance it would probably be the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the LG Optimus G comes out on top is design. It's all subjective, of course, and it might be that the Galaxy S III has been around longer so we are getting a bit bored with it, but we find the LG smartphone to be better looking than it. The extra gig of RAM is also a nice thing to have and makes the Optimus G more future-proof than its competitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So on which of those two should you spend your hard-earned cash? It depends what you are looking to get from the deal really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are going SIM-free and it's value for money you are after, then by all means go for the Galaxy S III. Judging by the current pre-order prices the Optimus G will cost notably more than its competitor when it launches. The Galaxy S III will let you save about 150 euro and still give you impressively solid smartphone experience and even treat you to a newer Android release. Not to mention that the microSD card slot allows for extremely cheap memory expansion.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>On the other hand, if money is no object for you (which is usually the case with those looking for high-en smartphones) or your carrier has helped even the field with its subsidies things are looking far more favorable for the LG flagship. It might not be able to assert its dominance over its competitor now, but once LG releases its Jelly Bean update, it should become a real beast.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There's just no way the Galaxy S III can fend off the attacks of the newer chipset forever. The LG Optimus G has a sharper screen of slightly higher resolution too, which while lacking the wow factor of the Galaxy S III AMOLED, is far better for productivity and can really help put those four Krait cores to good use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So it seems we are one software update away from the moment when the Galaxy S III finally gives up its throne and the LG Optimus G succeeds it. It up to LG to deliver that quickly and make its flagship the power user's dream device before the holiday shopping spree begins.</paragraph>
