			<paragraph>Stainless steel bodywork, smoked glass cover, and an agonizing price, Luna captivates with exterior, not purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The family of luxurious Nokia handsets gets bigger. Prepare for steel, glass and an exorbitant price. Near flawless performance when it comes to the mundane must-have features, and embarrassingly mediocre functionality. But then again, an 8-series Nokia would get away with just about anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8600 Luna is keen to disarm and seduce. The unconventional materials used, the creative design, the rather practical set of accessories are hard enough to resist. Plus, the Luna is so largely unaffordable that it's tempting. This pretty much sums up what the Nokia 8-series is really about. Maximum functionality has never been the issue. What counts is exclusivity and departure from the commonplace. The prodigal set of the Nokia 8800 and Nokia 8800 Sirocco has grown with the Nokia 8600 Luna expanding the premium segment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A solid handset<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Taste is very personal, so let everyone judge design for themselves. The Luna does look special though. The completely black body with two silver lines and the remarkable slider construction make the handset stand out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressive at first sight, the Luna is truly overwhelming when held in hand for the first time. With most contemporary handsets weighing less than 100 g (smartphones excluded), Nokia 8-series newbies will be surprised by the 140 g the Luna weighs. Is that too much? The Luna just can't help it, given the amount of steel on its body. Weight can turn many down, while others may appreciate a solid handset. The measures of 107 x 45 x 16 mm are perfectly acceptable, provided the size of the screen and the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone open is smooth and sweet. The quality construction and the materials used on the casing suggest that mechanical faults are very unlikely. The sliding mechanism works seamlessly and should remain unaffected by heavy duty usage. The handset feels solid and firm in both opened and closed position. Sliding requires a little more effort compared to other handsets of the same form factor. Steel makes itself noticed any time you snap the phone closed. The metal-hit-metal sound is an experience no other slider can give.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A chrome line runs along the sides of the black handset. Within that chrome line on the top left side is the volume rocker. Both keys are very tactile, every press is distinct and comfortable. The borderline dividing the handset into a glossy front and chromed steel back is unbroken even with the phone slid open. The front of the handset is dominated by the display and the smoked glass cover that encapsulates the alphanumeric keypad and goes way back to cover the camera lens. With the phone closed, the camera lens is sheltered from the environment. One thing to be careful about is the unruly forefinger, which tends to be irresistibly drawn by the lens, covering it with greasy smudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the Nokia 8600 Luna is closed, the battery compartment cover is the only thing to notice on the backplate. Made of steel too, it fits dead on, no nonsense creaks. Under it lays the 900mAh battery, good enough to last a couple of days of average talking and texting. The grills of the speakers are on both sides of the upper part of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the mouthpiece at the bottom, and the wrist strip eyelet at the top, there's only one other thing left to mention at the sides of the handset - the universal connector. It's at the bottom right side of the handset and serves as the sole cable connection point. microUSB debuts in a Nokia handset, but the miniUSB variety could've been more welcome. Right-handers are likely to be disappointed, as holding the phone with the charger or data cable plugged in, is fairly awkward. There's nothing else to spoil the elegant side view of the handset. Those keen on taking photos on the go will have to get to terms with the lack of a dedicated camera button and adapt to using the keypad when shooting..</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unparalleled display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front is all glossy, as opposed to the polished rear side of the phone. It's a contrast the display takes advantage of. The Luna of course has opaque glass, covering the keypad. All in all, the entire frontplate could well be a training prop for forensic enthusiasts in a fingerprint workshop. For purists, Nokia has added a cleaning cloth to the retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display takes the upper half of the front. This one offers a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels, totaling 16M colors on a 2" diagonal. The Luna display does make a point when compared to, say, the display in Nokia 6233. Black is truly black, fonts look great, readability is never an issue, even in bright light. The Luna display is a high flier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is a standard one. The D-pad is dominated by the chromium confirm-key, at each side are the two selection keys and the call-key and end-key. The control keys are exposed even when the rest of the keypad is covered by the glass casing. The phone slides open nice and easy, thanks to a tiny knob at the foot of the display. It lives up to its purpose fine, but the downside is it does stand in the way of the D-pad's up-key. All directions of the scroll key, and the two selection keys, can be assigned shortcuts to selected applications or functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keypad is comfortable, but the glass casing makes the bottom row of keys hard to use</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All rows of keys are declining at the top, tactility suffers only with neighboring keys within the row. Key symbols are white, so is the backlighting. Pity, the keypad backlighting turns off as soon as the phone is slid closed. It would've been nice to have the backlighting on for a while from beneath the glass. You can see that for yourself if you chose to turn on an option, which gets the keypad to emit pulsating light at certain intervals while the phone is in standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing response is good,a quiet click marks each press of the keys. The glass case impedes quick typing, the hash and asterisk keys are hard to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A load of accessories<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Premium Nokia handsets bundle up a nice stack of accessories. The boxset includes a charger, PC Suite CD, manual and data USB cable. Although Luna is all about standing out from the crowd, very few are likely to wear it on a neck strap. There is a wrist chain in the package instead. After all, the Luna is a pet worth keeping on a short leash. A cleaning cloth and leather case are also there, in line with the high-maintenance status of the Luna. We're not quite sure about the usability of the leather case; the handset doesn't get any lighter with it, to say the least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No memory card in the package, since the Luna has no slot for one, 128 MB of built-in memory is all the user gets. There's an integrated radio though, hence the headphones in the package. The headphones are plugged in by way of 10-centimeter-long adapter. No big deal, a little piece of extra cable, that we would've even welcomed, had it been possible to use with standard headphones. It seems the intelligent choice, but yours will be a fool's hope, the headphones in the package use a 2.5 mm jack. A little consolation is that the phone is OK to handle and use with the headphones plugged in. The headphones are mediocre, you'll need all the equalizer power you can get.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Same old same old<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Interface is typical Series 40. The Luna is pleasingly responsive. Browsing the fully-customizable menu is quick and intuitive. The standard status icons (network, battery, operator, time) and the functions assigned to the soft keys appear on the display, an active standby mode is also available. The main menu displays as a grid (with or without labels), or a list. There are four color themes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8600 offers seven ringing profiles. They're not single-click accessible, so you'll have to assign a shortcut to one of the selection keys, or add those to the Go To application, which is originally assigned to the left soft key. It contains a list of most frequently used features, which you can rearrange or change at any time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can be set to display entries from the phone memory or SIM or both, showing contacts as a plain list, name-and-number view, or name-and-photo view. Contacts are ordered by first or last name, font size is user-definable. The phonebook is searched by gradual typing. 14 different details can be saved for each contact. Keys 2 to 9 can be assigned speed dials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages of all types are stored in the shared memory. A T9 editor is there. An SMS can be up to 1000 symbols, copying and pasting chunks of text is enabled. There are three font sizes to choose from (only two in contacts). SMS typing is enhanced by preinstalled templates and embedded smilies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS size is limited to 300 KB, text, images, sound and video clips can be inserted. You can insert as you create your multimedia message, no need to prepare the objects in advance. The email client is a Java application, and handles multiple accounts. POP3 and IMAP4 are the receiving protocols, sending is SMTP. Setting up an email account is quite straightforward, using the preinstalled settings for some of the most popular free email services.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Getting organized<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers the standard trio of views: monthly, weekly, daily. Either of the first two can be set as default. Entries (call, meeting, anniversary, memo or to-do) can be set to auto-delete after a day, week or month. The Tasks feature is an enhancement to the Luna's planning capabilities. The alarm clock allows you to select the days you want the alarm to be active, as well as the repeat intervals. A Notes application lets you enter personal notes of up to 3000 symbols. A voice recorder is also available; recording length is limited to 5 minutes. The Luna also features a stopwatch and a countdown timer, as well as a Java calculator, capable of a number of scientific functions, but with no operator precedence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no 3G support, if anybody should ever need the Luna to transfer data, they will have to make do with Class 10 GPRS and EDGE. For short range transfers there's Bluetooth 2.0 (supporting A2DP). PC synchronization is offered via microUSB. Mass Storage mode isn't available. Java compatible third-party applications can be installed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Entertainment? Just an accessory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Luna has an integrated MP3 player, but it's hardly an entertainment-driven device, given the mediocre headphones and scarce memory. It still gives you a couple of albums to enjoy yourself at times of boredom. Random mode and repeat are available, sound is adjustable through a few preset and two user-defined equalizers. An integrated FM radio comes handy once you've run out of stored tracks, but there's no RDS regrettably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. When the camera turns on, the soft key shortcuts turn around to landscape mode. The Luna is held horizontally when taking pictures. There's a Zoom feature on the menu, but all you get is a detail in lower resolution. Other than a few white balance presets, there are six color effects available (normal, false colours, greyscale, sepia, negative, and solarise). The shutter sound is always there, even Silent mode won't turn it off. Video is captured in 176 x 144 or 128 x 96 resolution, only usable in mail or MMS. Picture quality is below average, too much noise and too pale colors. The camera fails when it comes to shooting text, and taking a quality picture is a tough job overall.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Forget about the features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Luna is impossible to compare to regular handsets. There's a lot lacking in terms of functionality: memory card, Mass Storage mode, miniUSB, 3G support, high-quality camera. Quite a few downsides, but all those seem exactly the functions people likely to buy a Luna will usually overlook. There are plenty of lifestyle gadgets to do all those jobs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then, the Luna has some aspects worth praising: the perfect display, fast user interface and exquisite bodywork. The handset is beautifully crafted and probably very durable. After all, the Luna excels at what it will be most likely used for: calling, messaging, and getting noticed. No doubt about that last one.</paragraph>
