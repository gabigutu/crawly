		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6720 classic ventures to send the 6220 classic into retirement. There's a year's gap between the two gadgets and a casual observer may as well conclude that a year is a mere eye-blink for midrange Symbian smartphones. Well, we guess it's part of what defines a classic too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We just need to take due note of the fact that Symbian comes in different Nokia flavors. Nseries, Eseries, classics and touchscreens (as of late) are jostling for the user's favor and securing the platform's market lead. Handsets like the 6720 classic are bottom of this in-house smartphone ladder, so jaw-dropping upgrades are probably not to be expected. Dressing up an old concept without breaking the bank feels quite right in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, only a few changes have been made since the Nokia 6220 classic. Some of them (faster processor, increased battery capacity, 3.5 mm jack and the free lifetime global pedestrian navigation) are duly noticed and appreciated. And the facelift (apologies, 6220 classic) is more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Nokia 6720 classic is good at the smartphone basics and looks quite the realistic and affordable handset it is. A dream gadget it sure isn't but a handy tool for mature budget-conscious users. 6720 classic is pleasingly compact and - thanks to the 600 MHz processor - very snappy. And the curve design makes it sufficiently distinct from the predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feature list above implies enough skill to make those contemplating an upgrade to stop thinking and start acting. In all honesty though, the 6720 classic is not to be construed as an upgrade of the 6220 classic. The xenon flash has turned LED, the screen estate hasn't grown a bit, video-recording framerate has dropped. So in the end, this entry-level Symbian smartphone feels more proper choice for those upgrading from S40.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 classic isn't the coolest piece of equipment to ever cross our threshold but will never frown at hard work. It claims to have the speed and power and probably enough identity for a basic smartphone package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't mean to sound condescending, it only feels fair to have the right expectations of a mid-range device. Users always have the final word but this entry-level Symbian looks quite focused on serving its target audience. No promise made is no promise broken. So, the Nokia 6720 classic is about to prove itself in action. As usual, we'll start by taking a close look at what's on the outside.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Economy class retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 classic carries quite little luggage, even in this price range. Other than the handset itself, there's a 1GB SD card and a ridiculously short microUSB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course you also get a charger and a stereo headset (the same unit as the E63 has). It looks just fine, but the sound is rather disappointing. The 6720 classic has a 3.5mm audio jack anyway, so you can use your favorite headphones no problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have also enclosed a booklet reminding you to activate your Ovi Maps device lifetime global walk navigation, which is completely free. You also get a 10-day drive navigation license.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6720 classic 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps one of the best things about the Nokia 6720 classic is its compact size. The dimensions of 110 x 45 x 14 mm add up to volume of the mere 64 cc, which is even more compact than its 6220 classic predecessor (66 cc). The handset will fit in every pocket or purse just like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What seems quite an advantage to us, the small Nokia 6720 classic weighs the quite respectable 110 grams. The solid hand feel is definitely an asset for the 6720 classic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Dressed to the nines is perhaps the last thing to say about the Nokia 6720 classic. But the handset's subdued styling is quite in line with its rank actually. While the Iron grey variety of the device is more mainstream, the Chestnut brown just isn't everyone's cup of tea. The very subtle bend at the bottom is supposed to improve handling and it kinda manages to. It also gives the phone a distinct outline, Androidish in a way, though a lot less prominent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.2" display of the Nokia 6720 classic supports QVGA resolution and up to 16 million colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen estate is among the first things to be held against the 6720 classic. Not only is it the same size as the year-old 6220 classic, the screen does look below par in terms of image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there is an ambient light sensor but brightness can be set manually too. In either case the maximum brightness setting feels inadequate (especially for a company with such a track record in displays).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering is also quite inaccurate and though the user interface themes look quite alright, viewing any images is quite a disappointing experience with a distinct bluish hues and overall washed colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is perfect though as usual - Nokia transflective displays don't rely on backlighting to ensure performance in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display we find the standard set of Symbian controls - three knobs on either side of a traditional D-pad. Those include the two context-dependent keys, Menu and Clear buttons, along with the Call and End keys. They are decently sized and tactile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the navigation deck is the standard 12-key numpad. The alphanumeric buttons are large enough to guarantee trouble-free typing. The keypad styling is quite reminiscent of the Nokia 6233, only even more comfortable now. Anyways, visually it's quite an improvement over the cheapo looking Nokia 6220 classic keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curve in the lower part of handset's body is supposed to enhance handling (especially the use of the bottom row of keys), but the improvement is less than marginal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other things to note up front are the ambient light sensor, the secondary QVGA video-call camera (capable of taking QVGA still-shots and QCIF videos) and the earpiece grill at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Nokia 6720 classic are slightly curved at the bottom and feature the standard controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a shutter key and a volume rocker on the right. The camera button has glossy finish, while the volume rocker uses the same matt plastic that covers the phone's edge. Both controls are quite comfortable and there isn't a thing to complain about. Just above the volume rocker is one of the two inbuilt speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side hosts the microUSB port and the microSD card slot, hidden under a shared protective lid. Lifting the lid sometimes can cause the whole side panel to wobble which feels terrible really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Nokia 6720 classic hosts the standard 3.5mm audio jack and the mouthpiece, as well as the proprietary charger plug. The latter has a status LED that glows when charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of Nokia 6720 is completely bereft of controls. As smooth as it gets, this certainly is the better looking side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover of the handset features the 5 megapixel camera lens with its LED flash. Around the lens and the flash, there is a fake gemstone patterned surface, which is quite a questionable ornament for a conservative handset such as the 6270c.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xenon is not the only difference from the preceding 6220 classic. The camera lens has virtually no protection against scratches. You'll need to be extra careful handling your phone if you don't want to compromise the image quality with a damaged lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The better part of the Nokia 6720 classic rear is the actual battery cover, which is made of steel. Removing it reveals the SIM card compartment and of course the Li-Ion battery. The 900 mAh unit in Nokia 6220 classic has been promoted to 1050 mAh. You can easily count on three (even up to four) days of light-to-moderate use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall build quality of the Nokia 6720 classic is quite adequate but just keep in mind that the phone side is quite wobbly once you've removed the battery cover - that was the only unpleasant surprise. Otherwise, the phone is well put together and a lot classier than the Nokia 6220 classic.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>New colors for the old engine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6720 classic runs on Symbian with Series60 3rd Edition user interface and Feature Pack 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen layout is quite familiar with status icons displayed at the top of the screen and the soft key labels taking the bottom. Quite naturally, the 6720 classic also supports Active standby with two optional layouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have any experience with Nokia S60 smartphones, you will notice the new look of the menu icons. That styling is no news since the touch-controlled 5800 XpressMusic, N86 8MP and N97 and the S60 3rd edition duly takes advantage as well. The standby theme and the main menu offer no changes in terms of handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active standby has the three familiar layouts to choose from - a vertical bar, a horizontal bar and basic view, in which you make do with D-pad shortcuts only. Talking theme is also available as an accessibility enhancer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active standby screen is a standard Symbian option and is a nice and convenient way of bringing the shortcuts to all favorite applications to your home screen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen can be organized in either vertical or horizontal tabs which are scrolled with the D-pad. If active standby is disabled the direction keys of the D-pad can also be assigned shortcuts of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby or not, you can always change the shortcuts assigned to the two soft keys to best suit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6720 classic can automatically rotate the user interface but there is some other accelerometer-based functionality too. You can silence calls and snooze the alarm by flipping your phone over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four themes to personalize the look of your handset: we quite liked the Blue Reef one. Anyways, you can download many other themes online - mostly for free..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6720 classic also features the new and improved task manager that comes with Feature Pack 2. It is also now somewhat better looking and is appearing on top of every pop-up menu. The shortcut used in previous versions of the OS by pressing and holding the menu key still works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 uses a single ARM 11 600 MHz CPU with no dedicated graphic accelerator. The handset still fares quite well as far as UI responsiveness is concerned. The phone reacts quickly, if not instantly, to most commands across menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 classic user-available memory extends to a little less than 50MB and the handset comes with a 1GB microSD card in the retail package. While the 1GB card will do the basic job, there are cases when the limited system storage of 50MB will get in your way. For example, when downloading files from the internet, the web browser always saves them to the system partition, meaning you may bump into the 50MB limit sooner than you may have thought.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Reception is great on the Nokia 6720 classic. The phone has commendable speaker quality and the sound during calls is clear and free of any interference. Vibration is also strong enough to make sure you never miss an incoming call or message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6720 classic passed our loudspeaker test with quite decent scores. Check out the table to see how it stacks up against some of the handsets we've measured. In case you want to find out more about the test itself or a complete list of tested devices, hit the link.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook with Ovi integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian handsets have an excellent phonebook with enviable capabilities. There is storage space for a practically unlimited number of contacts and fields with all the available memory potentially usable for the purpose. Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. We personally find it quite a challenge to think of something Nokia has missed here - there's everything from the contact's nickname to their assistant's name and phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Personal ringtones and videos can also be assigned to a contact. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization is also nice and easy although you do need the Nokia PC suite (or Ovi Suite as of lately) for things to go smoothly. Sending and receiving contacts via SMS or Bluetooth is also a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts come preinstalled on the Nokia 6720 classic but it's of course compatible with most other Nokia smartphones. Ovi contacts integrates tightly with the Contacts list as a new tab and offers an IM client with a twist. You can search for people already registered with Ovi or send an invitation to anybody using Gmail since Ovi contacts supports G-Talk, Google's own IM, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to this service you will be able to chat real time with all your Ovi/Google Talk-connected contacts, change your status messages and mood, and all that stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition you can even go as far as sharing your GPS location so your friends can instantly track you using Ovi Maps. Or, you can share the name and the artist of the track you are currently playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What can we say - it all works exactly as advertized. Your contacts need not have an Ovi-connected phone, they can chat with you just fine over Google Talk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Symbian messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Texting with Nokia 6720 is spot on. With a comfortable keypad and great software support your messaging is almost as good as it gets on a handheld. And we only say "almost" as there's no full QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 classic supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. The SMS and MMS share an editor. It is the well known intuitive application from previous Symbian S60 smartphones. It has a counter of characters left up to a limit of 160. There is also an indicator in brackets showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes without saying that you can activate a delivery report for messages. The reports pop up on the standby screen and are subsequently saved in a dedicated folder in the messaging sub-menu. If you exit the message editor without having sent the message, the editor prompts you to either save it to the Drafts folder or discard it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All it takes to convert a common SMS into an MMS is inserting some multimedia content. A nice feature allows resizing pictures automatically for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 also features a dedicated audio message editor. Although technically a type of MMS, the audio messages have their own separate editor. You can either record the message on the spot or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also very similar to what previous Symbian powered phones have offered. If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your email address and password to start sending and receiving emails. The Nokia 6720 takes care of downloading all the relevant settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. There is also support for attachments, signatures and basically most of the emailing functionality you're used to. Thanks to QuickOffice, viewing attached Microsoft Office files is a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the option to have the email read out to you - the Message reader app comes with one language and two voices preinstalled (one male and one female) and the option to download more. The application handles this quite nicely and while the voice didn't sound too natural, it didn't trip over difficult words and even managed to read URLs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The familiar music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is the same as the one you get on most of the Symbian devices out there and has a huge number of supported audio formats, including MP3, AAC, eAAC+ and WMA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. Then a new row appears on the stand-by screen just below the quick shortcuts to indicate the currently running track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sorting songs by artist, album, genre and composer is automatic and searching tracks by gradual typing of the desired name is also available. Tracks are transferred to Nokia 6720 classic via Bluetooth, USB or by simple download. You can also use a card reader for that purpose and transfer them directly to your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon completing a USB transfer, or inserting a card, the phone automatically prompts to scan for new music tracks and, if allowed to do so, adds the new ones to the music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets and, should they seem insufficient, you can edit them or create new ones in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Nokia 6720 classic is excellent with virtually no weak link. All the readings in our traditional test are great, rivaling music-oriented handsets and even dedicated music players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every aspect of the audio output is pretty close to even the Apples iPhone 3GS and that's basically as good as they get these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at the results and see for yourselves. Also as you can see from the graph below the Nokia 6720 classic also flaunts an almost flawless frequency response, remaining within 0.24 of the perfect line throughout the range.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Real player is not enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6720 features Real player for playing your video clips and the video player works in both normal and fullscreen mode. When in full screen, the softkey functions are hidden so that they don't get in the way and only pop up when a key is pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With such a small screen though, video playback is not this phone's strongest suit. And to confirm that, if you want DivX/XviD playback you'll need to install a third-party player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nseries gallery spreads down the ranks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery was a pleasant surprise - it's the same as in Nokia's N-Series phones and looks great. The speed of photo browsing increases if you press and hold the direction buttons on the D-pad. This allows quick skipping of tons of files if you're not in the habit of regularly sorting out your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming here is very speedy, thanks to the zippy 600MHz processor. It does slow down a bit when you get over 100% but it will go up to 400% zoom. Zooming is done in small increments (about 10%) and panning is quite fast too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also has a very good picture tagging system. In addition to geotagging, which is automatically handled by the camera, you can add as many tags as you like to each photo and then use them as filters. There's also the option to organize photos in Albums.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent camera, low-quality video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 classic is armed with a 5 megapixel autofocus camera for image resolutions of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels. The available settings include white balance, sharpness, exposure, brightness, ISO, three quality levels going from basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode, as well as panorama mode, are also at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED flash is only really usable in close range setups and it can only serve as a flash, video light is not an option. The shutter key can be comfortably half-pressed to focus before taking a shot, but that's about it - there aren't any metering settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is not the fastest in focusing and the time it takes to save a photo is pretty average too. The images it produces are about 1.5MB for a 5MP shot, so you can't email a full-res photo due to size limitations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 classic image quality is very good, easily ranking among the best 5 megapixel cameraphones on the market. The photos have pleasing colors and good contrast with noise levels still well under control. The amount of resolved detail is among the best we have seen on a 5 megapixel phone. In fact, the 6700 classic and 6720 classic probably use identical sensors and produce the same commendable image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples from a really capable shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia 6720 classic. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 classic has a slight edge over the multimedia flagship Nokia N97 in both resolved detail and noise reduction. That again goes to confirm that we're having the pleasure of one of the best 5 MP shooters out there along with the Nokia 6700 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording: low-framerate VGA</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording, the Nokia 6720 classic manages VGA resolution at 15 fps. The MP4 video clips length is only limited by the memory available. Unfortunately the video quality is far from stunning, with the low framerate taking of its toll on the otherwise reasonable VGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, color rendering in videos shot with the Nokia 6720 classic is pretty good. If you are willing to live with CIF resolution the handset can manage the more pleasing 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a Nokia 6720 classic sample video shot at VGA resolution (15 fps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all honesty, we can't really understand the downgrade from the last year's Nokia 6220 classic, which was able to capture VGA video at 30 fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mid-range connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfer options are numerous on the Nokia 6720. Every common network data transfer medium is supported and so are USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP. Data speeds go up to 10.2Mbps for download and 2Mbps for upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a memory card slot so if you have a card reader at hand you can transfer the data directly to your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of additional wired connectivity, the Nokia 6720 classic offers a 3.5mm audio jack, which also doubles as a TV-out port. The TV-out cable however is not supplied, so you should get one by yourself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser as it should be<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the internet with the Nokia 6720, like with all Nokia smartphones, is a pleasant experience. Even the most elaborate pages are rendered well and finding your way around them is a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser another point as it's easy to control and generally works great. A mini-map can be activated to help you find your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required. The zoom level is also easily adjustable and searching for text on a page is easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large amount of RAM is surely one of the best things that could happen to the browser, as it is clearly one of the most RAM-intensive applications. Now, even if you load very heavy web pages and have a few applications running in the background, you are extremely unlikely to run out of resources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser also has full support for Flash and Java content so you should have no problem accessing web content. If you're watching a video on YouTube for example you can click on the video and view it fullscreen. That doesn't always work as some sites use clicking on the video for play/pause but the option is available in the menu. That option is needed as videos generally are too big to fit the QVGA display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the resolution may be relevant in this price range, but display size is a real downer. The 2.2" diagonal means the smallest fonts aren't always readable and you have to go for larger ones. This in turn limits the amount of text that can fit on screen and forces the user to scroll even more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The time-management skills of Nokia 6720 classic, like most other Symbian handsets, are really wide-ranging. Just name the application and you can bet the handset has it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start exploring the rich application package with the calendar. It has three different types of view - monthly, weekly and daily, and four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Every event has its own unique fields, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mobile office is also very well geared with preinstalled applications able to view Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files seamlessly. Editing documents is not supported out of the box, but hey, we're not talking Eseries here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you would like editing enabled you will have to purchase the complete application at the Nokia Download center. The final ingredient here is the included ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other included PIM applications are a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. We are not going to go into detail with them, as their functionality and performance are familiar enough. The ActiveNotes application is also on board allowing multimedia content to be added to your notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the gallery file-management options (which even include sending multiple files at a time) is insufficient you can use the file manager. It lets you do almost anything you can think of with your files. Copying, moving, creating new folders - you name it and it's a safe bet that the file manager can do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The useful "Search" application is also aboard the Nokia 6720. The application itself finds almost every item in your handset containing a given keyword. From messages to landmarks, every bit of data is checked and then all results are displayed on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia 6720 features a dictionary with a very rich database. English comes pre-installed but you can also download dozens of other languages for free from the Nokia website.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games on N-Gage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The biggest surprise on the otherwise conservative and budget-minded Nokia 6720 classic is the N-gage support. Nokia usually reserve that for their multimedia-oriented handsets and even Nokia N97 didn;t have that out of the box but was only later added via a software upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The games available on the handset are trial versions only but you can of course download full featured ones if you're willing to pay for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, there are plenty of third-party games out there, so Nokia 6720 users can easily download both native and Java titles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two Java titles also come preinstalled into the Games section - Bounce tales and Brain champ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bounce tales is a fun, cartoony platformer that follows the adventures of a blob. Brain champ is a collection of simple puzzles - a variety of Simon Says, simple math questions (such as 2 + 4 = ?). Puzzles may be simple but since you're running against the clock, things can still get pretty competitive.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Maps and lifetime walk navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6720 classic has a built-in GPS receiver and comes with a ten-day complimentary voice guided drive navigation license and lifetime pedestrian navigation with Ovi Maps. By the way, the two-year pedestrian navigation license costs 9 (nine) euro. And yes, we know looking at the price tags of gifts is bad manners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Maps application on our 6720 classic is the latest 3.0 version. There are no other differences besides the name - it offers the same functionality and controls. As usual it does an excellent job - especially when you activate the voice guided navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It took the 6720 classic less than a minute to get satellite lock, which is comparable to Nokia N79 or N86 for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps offers four different view modes including satellite and hybrid maps. Those however always need an internet connection and cannot be preloaded on the phone in advance like you can do with the regular map data and the desktop Map loader application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3D view is also available in addition to the regular 2D mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6720 classic also features a digital compass. It's available in Ovi Maps but in order for it to work, you need the map zoomed on your current GPS position. And don't forget to check if the phone magnetometer is turned on from the Settings menu and activated by swinging your hand around for a minute or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If all these requirements are fulfilled you'll see the small compass icon lightning in green and the map will automatically rotate as you change directions - unless of course, you are in active routing mode. In this mode the compass doesn't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional features like traffic information and city guides can also be activated but they come for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in case you are still unhappy with Ovi Maps you can go for a third-party application and there are quite a lot of those available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the smallish screen on the 6720 classic can seriously questions the use of the phone as a full-featured in-car SatNav device. Still, it can fill in when you need an occasional location service and thanks to the electronic compass it will be especially handy when you're on foot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6720 classic is another Symbian powered smartphone in the standard 4-digit product line of the house. It has an orthodox candybar form factor, the homely and familiar Symbian S60 third edition, a wonderful 5 megapixel camera and GPS. If you can live without Wi-Fi or have a sound data plan, you may as well be sold on the Nokia 6720 classic - compact and convincing, hard-working and fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At about 220 euro and (hopefully) still dropping, the Nokia 6720 classic is a basic smartphone package, which will do the job for the typical value-for-money user who wants more from their phone. A decent looking entry-level all-rounder can very well be enjoying strong demand. It probably has little to no appeal for long-time Symbian customers but may as well motivate an upgrade from S40 or competing feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia and Symbian are tightening their grip on the midrange smartphone market to the extent it's near impossible to identify credible competition for the 6720 classic. So, let's look instead at the other viable Symbian offers in this price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A very timely and relevant reference is the Nokia 5630 XpressMusic. It has a full connectivity pack and we guess Wi-Fi is hard to say no to. The 5630 XpressMusic is a slim and compact package with the same screen size and the low-grade 3.2 megapixel camera is duly reflected in the price tag. It's 60 euro cheaper than the current 6720 classic, so if imaging is not a priority, the 5630 XpressMusic is a must-consider. By the way, the touch-controlled 5800 XpressMusic is very much in the picture too, with its price comfortably settling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5630 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An even older Symbian handset may also have enough left in it to steal some 6720 classic market. The Nokia N79 has looks and Nseries skill against the novelty. Xpress-on smart covers, bigger screen, Wi-Fi, Navi wheel and better video round off quite a bargain at the the 6720 classic's current asking price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N79</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6710 Navigator simply goes hand in hand with the 6720 classic. It's only fair to assume it will be more expensive but then, the feature set quite deserves it. It's the same platform and processor, but the slider form factor kindly increases screen size while navigation and WLAN do give it a real edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6710 Navigator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the 6720 classic predecessor - the Nokia 6220 classic has slashed its price in half and boasts pretty much the same specs with a xenon flash and 30 fps VGA video on top. Its looks and build quality are downright inferior, but the veteran is still quite capable in the imaging department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6220 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, such a plentiful supply of Symbian smartphones is more than good news for the user. Not so much for the 6720 classic really, but the phone looks well focused and aware of its rank. Nokia seem to have a credible entry-level smartphone, which will find both its spot in the company's Symbian lineage and its way to the users - once the launch price settles at a more sensible level.</paragraph>
