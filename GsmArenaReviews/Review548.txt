			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ZTE had a pretty strong presence at MWC 2015 and brought a few phones to the venue. Few among them were actually new. So we decided to go ahead and skip over models like the Nubia Z9, which we have already reviewed and instead focus on a select group of devices that piqued our interest and just so happen to be spread across different ZTE sub-brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is the Blade V6, which definitely sounded new, but turned out to be a different name for the Blade D6. Still, this doesn?t change the fact that we haven't had a chance to look into the model in the past and this was a perfect opportunity. The Blade family usually offers sensibly priced mid-rangers, like the Blade S6 that managed to surprise us pleasantly and got a lot of value for price points. So, here's hoping the V6/D6 can deliver a similar package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we took a look at the Nubia My Prague. It is yet another mid-range offer, but this time under the more premium Nubia brand. It does instantly impress with a slick design, premium materials and build quality and of course, the characteristic red color accents of the family. It could prove to be a perfect match for anybody captivated by ZTE's styling in the premium market segment, all inside a reasonable priced package that won't break the bank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An finally, we got our hands on the just announced ZTE Axon Elite, which seems to be the only model we haven't previously seen or heard about. However, it is not an entirely new phone, and it is in fact, very closely related to the ZTE Axon Pro and the Axon Lux. In fact it is something of a variant of the latter, intended for Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific. It does, however, have a few notable differences form its siblings that are worth looking into, like the FullHD display and the new security and authentication methods. But more on that in the following pages.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Blade V6 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ZTE Blade V6 was previously announced as Blade D6, so we guess the model name will depend on the market. Now that we've cleared this up, we are ready to show you one very beautiful phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tell right away the Blade V6 looks a lot like the iPhone 6 and it will most probably target people, who like the iPhone 6 design but are not fans of the restrictive iOS. And we can confirm the Blade V6 does not only look good, but it is of an excellent build!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frame is made of metal, the front glass has the 2.5D effect and improves the handling by creating this comfy rim just above the frame. Unfortunately we are not sure what most of the rear cover is made of. It looks like metal, but feels more like a plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blade V6 packs a 5" 720p IPS display with great contrast, but it's rather dim. Hopefully this is only an issue of this presentation unit, which might be preventing it of overheating issues during the IFA expo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone ticks on a MT6735 chip with a quad-core 1.3GHz Cortex-A53, Mali-T720MP2 and 2GB RAM. It offers 16GB expandable storage and dual-SIM option. The Android version in charge is Lollipop, skinned with a custom MiFavor launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blade V6 is a pure pleasure to handle. If priced right, this could be a very thoughtful mid-ranger.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Nubia My Prague hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like we already said, the ZTE Nubia My Prague isn?t a new offer, but it has proven quite elusive up until now, even for a ZTE. It is, undoubtedly, a mid-range offer, but with a premium design and fashionable exterior. It comes from the Nubia sub-brand and is thus designed and built according high-end standards. This Nubia approach really shines through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nubia My Prague looks stunning with a thin and sharp body, only 5.5mm thick and quite light at 140 grams. It simply looks good, which is typical for most Nubia devices, yet it is not quite like other recent offers from the family, like the Z9 and the scaled-down Z9 mini. The typical red color accents and round circular home button are all accounted for, so is the shape, although My Prague seems to have even sharper and more defined lines than the Z9, yet the black color is gone and instead replaced with a two-accent body in white and silver or gold and silver. This is actually quite similar to the Blade D6 and its dual-color approach, so design-wise the Nubia My Prague seems to have taken a lot of design cues from both the high-end Z models and the mid-range Blade ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, like we said, it is the phone's premium nature that seems to stick out. Not only does it feel nice and solid in the hand, but a quick look at its 5.2-inch display leaves no doubt about its high-born provenance. The sharp and vivid picture comes courtesy of a FullHD AMOLED display, which is definitely a step up from the typical 720p IPS in other ZTE mid-rangers, like the Blade D6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by nature, the Nubia My Prague is indeed a mid-range offer, proving yet again that budget doesn't have to equate to ugly. Under the hood, there is a Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615, which is currently the proverbial mid-range SoC to have. Other than that, however, ZTE has really tried hard to push the Prague as close as possible to flagship territory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the already mentioned stunning screen, the phone also comes with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage for the basic white/silver model and a quite respectable 3GB of RAM and 64GB of space for the premium white/gold one. A microSD card slot is also thrown in the mix. The camera setup is also quite impressive with a 13MP main shooter and an 8MP one on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for connectivity, the Nubia My Prague definitely has you covered. It offers two SIM slots with dual-standby, as well as LTE connectivity with Cat. 4 speeds of up to 150 Mbps. Local connectivity includes Wi-Fi N, which might not be a high-end a/c model, but is still dual-band. Also A-GPS, GLONASS and Bluetooth v4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side of things, the ZTE Nubia My Prague boots the OEM's own Nubia UI 3.0. It is actually the one based on Android 5.0 Lollipop, rather than 4.4, as both flavors do oddly exist. It is the same software that that the Nubia Z9 uses and it is quite feature-packed and pleasant to use. The UI is minimalist and definitely has a chard of its own, just like the phone itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the ZTE Nubia My Prague has a new and exciting place of its own in ZTE's current lineup. If you are looking for a style and premium quality, but the Z9 price tag doesn?t quite agree with you, nor does the Blade V6's exterior then the Nubia My Prague might be a perfect option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Axon Elite hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Axon Elite is the international flavor of the ZTE Axon Pro, which already received a very positive reception across the US. The Elite version looks a lot like the Pro, but it packs a 1080p display instead of a Quad HD one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily ZTE makes up for the display's downgrade by supporting all three types of biometric security - voice unlock, fingerprint scanner and EyePrint. We'll talk about those later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Axon Elite is built around a big 5.5" Sharp-made Continuous Grain Silicon display with 1080p resolution. The CGS screen allows faster electron rates when compared to conventional LCD panels, as well as fewer individual components. It's still an LCD though, but offers great viewing angles and excellent contrast as far as it can be achieved on this type of screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing we notice is the display isn't particularly bright even when set to maximum, but we'll be waiting for the retail unit for confirm this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the Axon Elite is a powerful Snapdragon 810 chip, with an octa-core processor, Adreno 430 GPU and 3GB RAM. We all know the S810 chip heats up pretty quickly, but ZTE says it has integrated a new heat dissipation system around the chassis that won't even allow the device to warm that much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't know if ZTE indeed put some effort on developing an innovative heat dissipation system around its all metal shell, or just used an improved (or downclocked) flavor of the chip. But it did an amazing job with the design, we are going to give it credit for that. The build quality of the device and also the choice of materials is excellent. The faux leather, which covers the antennas around the top and the bottom, is a welcome addition to the overall premium feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Axon Elite is lightweight, thin and yet - as solid as it can be. And while we are not big fans of those grilles around the display and the rear camera, we still find the Axon Elite very attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the Axon Elite's key features is the EyePrint ID (it uses the front 8MP snapper), which allows you to unlock the phone just by looking at it. We thought this seemed like something requiring lots of scanning, but in real life the eye unlock is very fast - you look at your Axon and it's unlocked in a flash. Nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint and the voice unlock worked like a charm, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear camera setup has a 13MP main camera and a 2MP secondary snapper, which comes in handy for advanced camera features like bokeh and focus shift. There is an excellent manual mode, but the automatic is great most of the times anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Axon Elite is a dual SIM device, it comes with 32GB storage and supports microSD cards up to 128GB. We always appreciate storage expansion options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZTE Axon Elite goes on sale on September 24 for ?420 or ?300 in Europe.</paragraph>
