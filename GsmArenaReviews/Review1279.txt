			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, Google didn't just unveil a new version of their mobile OS early this morning. They also unveiled their next Google phone, a new galaxy by the name of Nexus. And just a glance on that Super AMOLED screen in 720p HD resolution is enough to tell you it means business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, though, with the unveiling of the Galaxy Nexus Google steps out from the Nexus S shoes of mediocrity and skyrockets their new baby into a galaxy of its own with dual thrust. A galaxy where the latest Nexus shines the brightest with its groundbreaking HD Super AMOLED display, waiting for the other Droids to follow its path.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got our hands on Google's latest Nexus device and we are going to get on board, ready to explore the unfathomed nebulas of its hardware, as well as the Ice Cream Sandwich which its using for fuel. Yummy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting our appetite aside though, the Galaxy Nexus is pushing all the right smartphone buttons for a 2011-2012 device. Starting from its slightly curved Super AMOLED display, moving through the powerhouse residing under the hood and finishing off with the brand new Ice Cream Sandwich, the Galaxy Nexus is certainly in a league with the best out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, we do not need a telescope to explore the inner workings of the Galaxy Nexus as it's right here in our hands tonight. Here's a recap of its key features:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Nexus at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now the Galaxy Nexus may not wow everybody with its specs sheet, it only tells half the story. There's more to it and we're just beginning to unwrap this beauty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, follow us as we go exploring the hardware side of the Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Nexus measures 135.5 x 67.9 x 8.9 mm and weighs 135 grams, and although it's quite on the big side, it's not as intimidating as you might expect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fit and finish of the Galaxy Nexus just screams premium from wherever you look at it. The all plastic body caresses your hand and the tapered back edges don't make it awkward to the touch, unlike some other smartphones of this size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical Samsung fashion, the back of the device features a little hump on the bottom, which provides a comfy finger support when you're holding the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All around, the device is well screwed together and despite its all plastic body, it won't give you any worries someone would mistake it for a cheap phone. On the contrary, the Galaxy Nexus exudes premium.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A display in a class of its own<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly, the party piece of this newest Nexus is its display. Samsung are the first ever to put a display with HD resolution in a GSM phone. But they haven't stopped there, as they've also thrown their trademark Super AMOLED technology into the mix, making the Galaxy Nexus a real attention grabber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether you are in or outdoors, the display doesn't disappoint. Black are deep, colors are bright and the detail the ultra-high resolution provides is unparalleled. The front of the device joins the buttonless club the N9 has started and although it feels awkward at first, it's not cumbersome to get used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll cover the display in a greater detail in our full review of the device followed with comparisons and more later. Now it's time to take a look at the rest of the hardware features around the body of the Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you will find the earpiece bundled with the proximity and ambient light sensors above the display. Next to them is the 1.3MP fixed-focus camera, used for video calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the device, as we mentioned is buttonless. This doesn't mean however, there's nothing there. Remember that this phone was developed partly by Google and they love hardware notifications. That's why the Galaxy Nexus features an LED notification area just below the screen, which glows on a missed call, unread message or on low battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Galaxy Nexus is free of buttons and surprisingly of ports. The 3.5mm headphone jack is located at the bottom next to the microUSB port and the speaker microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side, the Galaxy Nexus houses a volume rocker and on the other side is where you'll find a lock screen button as well as a connector for a docking station. Samsung has taken quite a minimalistic design approach with the latest Nexus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the device we find the 5MP camera capable of shooting 1080p video accompanied by an LED flash. The grills for the loudspeaker are at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the back cover is a clone of the one of the Samsung Galaxy S II, which is made of a finely textured plastic. It's thin, light, flexible and extra strong. Samsung claim that it has special coating for extra grip, but we didn't notice any difference compared to the S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping the cover open reveals a 1,750mAh Li-Ion battery. Considering the massive display and adding the needs of the 1.2GHz dual-core processor and the gig of RAM, we doubt it'll break any battery life records.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the battery, there's a SIM card slot. Sadly, a microSD slot is missing. There's no way of expanding the in-built storage memory on the Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned earlier, the hardware of the Galaxy Nexus tells only half the story about this device. It's time to take a look at what makes a true Nexus - its operating system. It's quite an exciting ride.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Nexus is the pioneer of next iteration of Android - version 4 or Ice-Cream Sandwich as it's pet-named. Well, being a pre-release device, we didn't have the final version of the OS at hand, even not all system apps were present. Nevertheless, we did have some fun poking at what's available and we bet you will enjoy it as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Nexus is a fast device but Android 4.0 comes with various transition effects that seem to artificially slow down the perceivable speed at which the menus open and close. We did encounter a lot of hiccups but that's what you get for messing around with pre-release software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's our demo video that will give you a quick glance at the UI in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The lockscreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Nexus lockscreen is similar to those found on the Honeycomb tablets. Dragging the active circle to the left over the padlock unlocks the device, while dragging it to the right over the camera icon, starts the camera right there from the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, our pre-release unit didn't have the option for Face recognition as means for unlocking the phone. Plus, face recognition is anything but secure so we consider this one more of a gimmick than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting fact is that the drop-down notifications area is available on the lockscreen as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Homescreen comes with resizable widgets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once you unlock the device you get to the regular homescreen full of several panes. Sure, all kinds of widgets are available, but you don't add them just by holding your finger over the screen as it was before. Instead, the main menu has a dedicated tab, which stores all the available widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novel thing is that you can now resize widgets too, however this doesn't work with all of the available widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throughout the whole interface, you will notice the update typeface, which replaces the usual Arial font. In fact, the replacement is so automatic that it works even for websites that have their typeface set in Arial (such as ours). The web browser automatically converts all text to the new Roboto font.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall impression of the interface is of a more modern, high-tech version of what we've come to see from Android. In fact, strange as it sounds, it even has some Tron-like feel to it - the neon highlights add a lot to that, we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another new thing is the lack of navigational and contextual hardware keys, which is in line with what we're seeing on the Honeycomb tablets. Those are replaced by almost omni-present software on-screen keys. The Left serves as a Back button, while the center one opens and closes the main menu and the rightmost one activates the Task Switcher. That's a key dedicated on the Task Switcher - we like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, much like on Honeycomb, the Ice-Cream Sandwich edition of Android lacks an option key. In fact, the options menu is no longer present in the usual places that you may be used to seeing it - such as on the homescreen or the main menu. Instead, you get an options icon only in some apps where the available options cannot fit on the screen itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The task switcher<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the Task switcher is another thing that's been greatly redesigned. It's much more intuitive now, you can easily tell which app is which, thanks to the mini screenshots. Removing items from the list is an easy job too - either swipe one to the right or press and hold on it for an Options menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ice-cream Sandwich comes with a built-in screenshot utility. There aren't that many hardware buttons on the Galaxy Nexus but Google and Samsung have come up with a key combo which instantly snaps a shot of your screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we noticed is that the Galaxy Nexus didn't have the cool 3D boot animation that we saw making the rounds online some time ago. We're not really sure what's the case with it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The People app replaces Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook visuals have changed a lot as well. It's called People now, and it comes with a svelte, light-colored background. The contact pics are bigger and the Quick contacts feature (touch the thumbnail to get a menu for calling, texting and whatnot) has been upgraded to show the contact pic in a huge popup window.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Music player is nothing new<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music player app seems the same as before but that may as well change before release, since we've heard rumors about it getting a serious update. There's an option to set the currently playing track as a ringtone straight from the music player, but there are no equalizer presets and stuff.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camera has got some new nifty ninja skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera has been updated too. It comes with a new list of special shooting modes - such as sweep panorama and time-lapse videos. No, there's no HDR mode, but there's an app for that anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lacks any advanced options such as Metering or ISO and only the video camera has a choice of special effects. The good news is that the camera now has continuous focus and tap to focus as stock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera may be stuck at 5 megapixels but the camcorder is capable of shooting 1080p footage with lower-res modes available as well. You should also check out our video of the camera interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Here are some camera samples taken with the Galaxy Nexus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And here's a 1080p video sample uploaded to YouTube for easy viewing. To truly appreciate it, don't forget to turn on 1080p mode and open the video fullscreen. And in case, you'd like a real-life video sample for download, here's one (10 sec footage, about 24MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser has been updated too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser comes updated too with a reportedly faster performance and features such as Save for offline viewing and Ask for a desktop version of the webpage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calendar and Mail have got a facelift as well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar has been redesigned as well. The one on our test unit wasn't quite stable so we can't comment whether it's ot any extra features added but the new visuals are obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail client follows the same design cues. However it's no longer two separate apps - as in Gmail and your Other mail. Now, your email accounts are all combined in a common inbox. They are easy to access and sort and you can pick which folders you want to sync on your phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Nexus is an impressive device on its own. It's got an amazing display with the highest resolution on a GSM mobile phone yet, 1080p FullHD video recording, dual-core 1.2GHz CPU with powerful graphics chip but most importantly it's the first handset to make use of the latest and greatest from Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And Ice-Cream Sandwich is not some minor upgrade. Features like the updated typeface, the new lockscreen with a camera shortcut and notifications, the improved stock camera app, the hardware acceleration for the UI, the improved text and voice input, etc. will certainly go a long way in making the Android user experience richer. And best of all, it will put an end to Android fragmentation which has been making the lives of devs and users miserable for so long.</paragraph>
