			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 launches in time of crisis and will be looked upon as the savior, or end up as the one that witnessed the company's undoing. Market share has hit the fan, as RIM of old which stood for innovation and vision, has turned into the money-losing, job-cutting, CEO-swapping, rescue-deal-awaiting BlackBerry that we have now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, in the middle of all this, another flagship gets unleashed to hopefully help and turn around the shrinking market share and ease the pressure from all sorts of competition. The BB 10 OS was indeed a great comeback, especially from such a conservative company, but the Z10 failed to become the kick-starter many thought - hoped - it would be. It's now the BlackBerry Z30's turn but the company may have already lost the smartphone battle and now running in survival mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z30 isn't BlackBerry's first smartphone to entirely break up with the old ways and go after the multimedia powerhouses of the competition. In fact, a five-incher must've been on the cards ever since the 4.2" Z10 appeared early this year. This sure looks like a steep increase in screen size but Blackberry must've been aware of the fact that they needed to catch up and do it fast. It's a 720p Super AMOLED display too, a second for the company after the Q10, but the first full-scale touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z30 is powered by an upgraded Qualcomm chipset with a more recent GPU and has better battery backup than the preceding Z10. The latest version, 10.2, of the BB OS brings lockscreen notifications, a new instant preview and reply feature, new Priority Hub, updated system apps, USB host and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the BlackBerry Z30 complete feature list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry 10 is still a toddler compared to iOS and Android, but the others can certainly learn a trick or two. And you can't accuse BlackBerry of not trying either. Many popular apps missing at the premiere of the OS are now available in the BlackBerry World. Popular Android and iOS games are making their way to the platform too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ability to run Android apps isn't new to the BB 10 OS but the 10.2 version is finally beginning to make a difference. There's Jelly Bean compatibility now - and hardware acceleration is enabled, so the experience should be superior to simply running ICS apps through an emulator. BlackBerry has finally unleashed the BBM messenger on other platforms too and it's enjoying a good reception. Overall, the BlackBerry 10 OS looks fresh and compelling with innovative gestures and attractive design, but it will definitely get the job done too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But will the BlackBerry Z30 succeed where its BB10 siblings failed quite miserably - make money and bring fresh users to the platform? That's what we'll try to find out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us after the break, where we start with our traditional hardware checkup.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the BlackBerry Z30<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of BlackBerry Z30 covers just the basics. We found a microUSB cable for data connections and charging, an A/C adapter and a headset. There is no extra UK plug adapter, which is the only difference to the bundle of the Z10.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree view of BlackBerry Z30<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 stands at 140 x 72 x 9.4 mm, which makes is a centimeter taller and 6mm wider than the Z10. Honestly we expected a bigger difference, which isn't bad at all considering what you gain in terms of screen real estate. What we find strange though is that the Super AMOLED screen hasn't resulted in a slimmer profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 is in the sub-centimeter club but, admittedly, looks nowhere near as impressive as some competing flagships that are less than 8mm thick - and there're a select few handsets that are even less than 7mm. The Z30 not only looks somewhat chubby - it can be felt too. The phone weighs 33g more than the Z10 for a total of 170g. Now, that's massive compared to the iPhone - and while it's got a smaller screen, even a metal-clad five-incher like the HTC One weighs less than the Blackberry flagship.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the carbon fiber back cover looks all the more puzzling - to say the least, it will have you totally unprepared for the weight of the handset. We can see how Blackberry were after some continuity - the Bold Touch 9900 has the exact same pattern. But we cannot help the thought either that they went for it so the Z30 didn't look like a Samsung midranger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, we're not impressed with the looks of the BlackBerry Z30 - and not because the phone looks appalling - it's just short of the premium look that we've come to expect in a Blackberry, a flagship at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>How we feel about it aside, it's clearly a mixture of the Z10 and Q10 designs, which makes sense and handles fairly comfortably. The front of the Z30 is similar to Z10's, but while the latter was in a way a nod to the iPhone, the Z30 has an uncanny resemblance to the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It could be down to the accent at the bottom - a faux metal plate that's an extension of the silver frame that goes all around the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 is nonetheless a solidly built smartphone with a practical design and secure grip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now let's explore the BlackBerry Z30 controls. Above the screen, we find the earpiece flanked by the traditional status LED and the front facing camera. The latter has a 2MP sensor capable of 720p video recording. The hidden proximity and ambient light sensors are also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual there is nothing below the display, not even a Home key. The Power key being dead center at the top would've involved quite a bit of a stretch of the finger, but luckily you don't need it to turn the screen on. A swipe up from the bottom of the screen will unlock the phone instead - and it will do it straight from sleep - no need to wake up forts and then unlock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the BlackBerry Z30 has the volume keys, separated by the voice command button. The volume keys can be configured to double as music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're two pinholes below the volume keys, which may as well be for the extra couple of microphones the Blackberry Z30 is said to have. They just can't be the main mics to use in calls, though honestly we couldn't spot those anywhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB and microHDMI connectivity ports are on the left. There is no adapter in the retail package, you'll need to buy one if you want to use the TV-out functionality of the Z30. BB 10.2 has introduced USB host support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Blackberry Z30 features the 3.5mm audio jack and the Power key. As we already said, you don't need the Power button to wake the phone up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the BlackBerry Z30 has no controls: you'll only spot a slit to place a fingernail and pull the battery cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the device over, you'll spot the 8MP camera lens and single LED flash in the top left corner. The pair of stereo speakers, two grilles each, are placed at the top and bottom of the Z30's back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover of the Z30 is removable, but unfortunately the battery is not user accessible, so DIY replacement is a no go. You can find the microSD and microSIM slots on the right and the memory card is hot-swappable. Popping a SIM card in will prompt a reboot of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 managed an Endurance rating of 52 hours meaning it'll easily cope two days of 1 hour of web browsing, video watching and 3G talking each.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Z30 boasts a 5.0" Super AMOLED screen of 720p resolution (720 x 1280 pixels). It's only the second AMOLED unit on a Blackberry phone, after the Q10 messenger. The pixel density clocks in at 294 ppi, which is way below what this season's flagships offer - but, admittedly, crisp enough for comfortable reading and viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are punchy, blacks are the usual AMOLED deep and the screen is viewed comfortably at even wide angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is quite good too, as testified by the BlackBerry Z30's performance in our dedicated test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED display on the BlackBerry Z30 relies on a standard RGB matrix with the same pixel arrangement as the one Samsung used for the Galaxy Note II display. The pixels of the Z30 have one tall Blue sub-pixel on the left and smaller Green and Red pixels stacked one on top of the other. It's an odd arrangement, but it has three subpixels per pixel. The reason for the different Blue pixel size is that Blue AMOLEDs typically have a shorter life and making them bigger balances things out. Being bigger, the Blue pixel doesn't need to emit as much light to match the other two, which helps it last longer without affecting color balance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 10.2 is gesture-friendly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already met the new BlackBerry 10 OS when we reviewed the BlackBerry Z10 as well as the BlackBerry OS 10.1 running on the Q10. Now, the BlackBerry Z30 brings the latest BlackBerry OS 10.2, which builds on the experience the Canadians introduced this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 10.2 version brings along various optimizations, as well as a bunch of new features - lockscreen notification previews, a new Priority Hub and Attachment view, improved typing experience and toast notifications that allow quick view and reply. We'll cover the whole BlackBerry 10.2 OS ticking inside the Z30 smartphone completely, so don't worry if you still haven't caught up with the Canadians' OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of inspiration, the new BB OS feels like it has incorporated bits and pieces of both WebOS and Meego - swipes and backgrounding - but also Android (some contextual menus) and iPhone (the rich elaborate graphics). Only the icon design and some deeper system menus allow but a mere glimpse into the BlackBerry OS of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not rush it - check out the BB 10.2 in action running on the Z30.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the unlock screen, you can use the Power/Lock button to unlock the Z30 as well as a swipe up from the bottom of the screen (swipes should start off the screen). Interestingly, a single swipe will unlock the phone even if the screen is off. It's a unique feature - no need to wake up the device first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's up to you to decide whether you just want to check out notifications on the lockscreen, without unlocking the phone, or unlock the device and go straight to what you were doing. A short swipe would only wake the Z30. A longer swipe will unlock it - it's not too hard to get the hang of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 10.2 introduces Lockscreen notification previews. Tapping on a notification icon will unveil its contents on the right. If you have 20 new emails, for example, a tap on the email icon will show the new email list. Same goes for SMS, missed calls and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Onto the BlackBerry 10.2 homescreen, which hasn't changed from previous iterations of the OS and consists of multiple panes, two of which have a special purpose (more on that in a bit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer takes up most of the homescreen panes - it's a paged grid of icons for all installed apps. A long press on an icon starts edit mode, which lets you rearrange icons and uninstall apps with a single tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom, there's a bar holding a trio of app shortcuts: Dialer, Search and Camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in search feature is pretty awesome and will look through your apps, messages, contacts, music, pictures and even offer Extended search, which continues the search in a selected app (e.g. Google Maps, Bing, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you have at least one app running, a special pane appears to the left of the app drawer panes. It holds up to eight "active frames" (similar to the WebOS cards), each of which is (typically) a thumbnail of a running app. Not all frames are just a downsized screenshot of the app, some switch to something more informative. For example, the Phone app switches to a list of recent calls, which is big enough to read comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frames are arranged chronologically and have a small X button to remove them when you don't need them any longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between apps is done with the same swipe up gesture used for unlocking the phone. No matter where you are in the interface, it will bring you to the task switcher page. One thing to note here is that as you swipe up and the current app is pushed into the background, a message counter appear on the left of the screen, showing unread message count for the various messaging services you have setup on the Q5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is Peek - named that because it lets you check new incoming messages with minimum interruption. If the message doesn't seem important, you can bring your finger back down and you will return to the current app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If just the message source isn't enough to tell whether it is important enough, you can continue swiping to the right. This continuous inverted L-shaped swipe (up, then right) will push the current screen off to the side, revealing BlackBerry Hub. This is BlackBerry 10 new unified inbox, which contains all your messages from all email and social network accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing your finger will drop you into the Hub to read the message, or you can just reverse the gesture and go back to working within the current app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Hub is always the leftmost pane on the homescreen and can be accessed either by the swipe-up-then-right gesture or by tapping the small indicators at the bottom of the screen. Those immediately take you to the respective pane. You can swipe your finger over them to quickly scroll through all homescreen panes if you're not sure where to find the thing you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get back to Hub in a moment - it's the heart of BlackBerry 10 and perhaps the strongest weapon against competing OSes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one more important swipe gesture that will come in use often - a swipe from the top. This has two functions. On the homescreen it brings out a dropdown, hosting all sorts of quick toggles (Settings, Rotation lock, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Alarm and Notifications). When you are in an app, it brings out an app-specific list of options (think Menu key in Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a handy way to replace a dedicated Menu button, though things are a bit inconsistent and some apps do have a menu button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Another issue is that quick toggles are only accessible on the homescreen, so you have to exit the current app if you want to switch Wi-Fi on, for example. This defeats the purpose of quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry 10.1 update brought the option to customize the notifications for each app - you can set the tone, switch vibration and the LED alerts on/off based on the account. With BlackBerry 10.2, the company introduces the BlackBerry Priority Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a new section in the BlackBerry Hub, which holds conversations and contacts that are marked with a higher priority than the rest. BlackBerry has made conversations with people that have the same last name as yours (thus deducing you may be related) be by default prioritized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can manually mark which messages should be sent to the Priority Hub and also unmark those that don't belong there. It's a pretty neat way to quickly glance if you have any important emails or messages waiting for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also customize the notifications for each app - you can set the tone, switch vibration and the LED alerts on/off based on the account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 packs Qualcomm MSM8960T Snapdragon Pro chipset with a 1.7GHz dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM. The BB 10.2 OS has been tailor-made for this hardware and everything is fast and fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get used to all the swipe gestures, BB 10.2 OS can be fast to operate, but the problem is getting there in the first place. It's a problem we think Windows 8 has too - without an obvious UI element (e.g. a button), a user will have to interact with invisible things that only come to the fore when you do the right gesture. BlackBerry will have a hard task of educating its users about these not-so-obvious gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the swipe down for quick toggles -or- app options (which may be elsewhere) wasn't confusing enough, the Hub makes it even more confusing. But we'll get to that later on in the Messaging section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, once we got used to those, the gestures get pretty intuitive. So much so in fact that we found ourselves swiping up on other phones, too, once we got used to the Z30.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Balance for corporate users<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Balance requires BlackBerry Enterprise Services to run, but once enabled it will split the apps on the phone into two - personal and work apps. Files created within work apps are secured by AES256 encryption and are not accessible from personal apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between work and personal apps is done by swiping down in the app drawer and picking one of the two. The separation between work and personal files however means that you might have to download apps twice if you want to use them both for work and play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're using your own personal BlackBerry Z30 for work, the IT department can set up what apps will install automatically on the device and what email accounts will be added. They can remotely wipe the work data in Balance too (when you quit or lose your phone), but personal data would remain intact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice commands are all the rage these days - everybody's doing them as best as they can, so BlackBerry is on this bandwagon, too. It's not a character like Siri or smart like Google Voice Search, but the Voice Command app on the BlackBerry Z30 is still fairly usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can ask it to call someone, send them and email or text or BBM, schedule an appointment or leave yourself a note. Other options include searching the phone or the Internet and you can update your social networking accounts too - tweet, post a new Facebook status or LinkedIn status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app cannot answer questions and it can't tell jokes, which are two of the most commonly used extra features of voice assistants. More importantly, it can't change settings (like toggling Wi-Fi on/off) or launch apps (there isn't even any integration with the native BB10 maps application).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Hub is a messaging power house<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerries were the phone of choice for business users and they have to deal with tons of messages - so the interface has to be very efficient. And the BlackBerry Z30 saddled with the new Hub is as efficient as they come. Perhaps only Windows Phone is close when it comes to unified messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hub is pretty simple at first glance - a list of messages with an icon that indicates the service (SMS, BBM, email, Twitter or Facebook, but also calls and voicemails) and also flags messages read or unread (color icons are for unread messages, monochrome icons are for read messages). Messages are indexed by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap on a message to read it and you can respond to that message from the same screen too. That's great because you don't have to worry about where a message came from, you just type a response and it will be sent back through the proper channel. Getting back to the Hub is done either by the Back button in the lower-left corner or by a swipe right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the list of messages is too much of a mess, there's Search or you can swipe right to reveal a list of all services that feed messages into the Hub. You can then filter messages by service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's where the whole swiping business starts to get a little confusing. First, the Hub can also show you your agenda - swipe down to view it. But make sure the swipe starts from inside the screen (think "pull down to refresh" on iPhone). If you start from above the screen, the gesture will bring up the quick toggles instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not the end of it either - a right swipe leads you to the list of all services piped into Hub, a swipe left (or tap on the right side of the screen) brings you back to Hub. BUT if you start the swipe from the just outside the right side of the screen, you might end up on the task switcher pane instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Confused yet? There's a more refined way to filter Hub - the down arrow in the top right corner. Using this interface, you can search for individual folders (e.g. Inbox, Outbox, Missed calls, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a menu button in the lower-right corner of Hub, which brings out some handy options like Scroll to top (or bottom), search, compose, refresh, select multiple. You already have Search and Compose buttons at the bottom of the screen, but the others can be useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message management skills of the Hub don't end there - a long press on a message brings out a long list of options on the right. You can "drag" a message to one of these options in the same gesture or lift your finger and tap the option you like, whatever seems easier. The three vertical dots button expands the pane with options to include labels, not just icons - you'll need that at first, until you learn what icons stand for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More than one message can be selected here, but if you select messages from different sources, only the options that apply are displayed (e.g. you can mark both emails and tweets as "unread", but you can't tag tweets, only emails). The multiple select can be used for mass delete too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Texting and BBM<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messaging is handled by the BlackBerry Hub - the Text Messages shortcut in the app drawer just leads to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're covering texting in more detail because it's used all so much. Messages are organized into threads and use speech bubble UI, both threads and individual messages can be managed by using the long press gesture. You can name a conversation thread, which will help you find it easier later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is no different than on other OSes. The text input area is quite small - it starts off as a single line and grows to only four, so composing longer texts can be a bit annoying. There's no character or message part counters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multimedia and other data (contact info, appointment even generic files) can be attached to the message, turning it into MMS. There's an option to attach a location (either your current location or point on a map) to the message, which is great for giving directions. More than one item can be attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Messenger is one of the hottest features on BB phones. At the base level, BBM can do text and voice chats (over your mobile data connection or Wi-Fi). You can attach multimedia content to a BBM message, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Z30 runs the latest OS, which also adds BBM Video - video calling with a twist. The twist, as you might know, is that instead of footage from the front-facing camera, the phone can stream the contents of its own screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way the other party sees just what you see - a great way to show someone how to do something, walk them through a document or anything else you can think of.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new on-screen keyboard in BlackBerry OS 10.2 is one of the most important features - hardware QWERTYs have always been a defining feature for the brand and the Z30 doesn't have one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry has taken care to make the virtual on-screen keyboard one of the best keyboards around by enabling a ton of advanced features, some of which adapt to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are "frets" between the keyboard rows. These are important as the word suggestions will appear on them. The way suggestions are ordered is pretty clever - they appear over the next letter of the word. For example, if you've typed "th" the word "the" will appear over E, "thanks" over A and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes some getting used to, but once you get used to it, it's a real time saver - when the word you need appears over the next letter you were going to type, your finger is already going there anyway. You just need to swipe up to "push" the word up into the text field. Suggestions work for up to three languages at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard can scan your messages from the past week to learn more on your writing style (similar to Android's popular SwiftKey).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, it learns how you press each key after only 6-8 taps - this can vary a lot from person to person and will reduce the number of typos. To further help with this, the keyboard is multi-touch enabled so you can press the next letter before you raise your finger from the last one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like Android and iOS, the BlackBerry keyboard can use voice dictation to input text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A landscape QWERTY keyboard is also available. It's still a split screen keyboard, which means it doesn't completely overlay the current app like the Android keyboard does.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To get to the dialer, tap the Phone shortcut in the bottom left corner (it's visible on all homescreen panes but the Hub). The dialer has three tabs - Calls, Contacts and Dial pad. We were a little disappointed to find out that you can't swipe between those three (after all, you can swipe between almost anything else).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer has been pushed to the third place and allows you to access your contacts with just a few tpas. Furthermore, the virtual dialer has no smart dial, you have to enter the number manually. There is a feature called "Smart dialing" but it's not the usual "search as you type" thing. Instead, it only automatically applies country and area codes to the numbers you dial (which is useful when you are in roaming and you only have your contacts' numbers stored in your local format).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you're better off using the Contacts tab. It's a list of contacts sorted alphabetically. There's a search field - which is accessed from the icon shortcut in the bottom of the screen. A tap on a contact expands into a list of all assigned phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log features three shortcuts on top - Voice Mail plus three contact numbers. You can add more quick-dial numbers here, but the more you add, the further down the actual call log gets pushed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log itself displays either all calls or just missed calls (there's a toggle). Calls are grouped together to save space, e.g. two outgoing calls to the same contact are displayed as one item with a call counter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook looks a lot like the Contacts tab of the phone app, it also has a search field and it is also automatically activated when you start typing with the keyboard. Tapping on a contact here brings you to the contact info, which is split into three tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first tab is details - this is where all the phone numbers, email accounts, URLs, birthday and other info (including Facebook friends and Twitter followers count) are listed. If the same contact uses multiple services, you can link the entries and have everything in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is Updates. All social networking updates are listed here chronologically, along with automatically generated entries under the Company News heading. If you've entered a company name (or the phone can guess it from the social networking accounts associated with this contact), the phone will search the web for new relevant content and give you a four line preview. A neat feature for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab is Activity, a list of phone calls and messages between you and the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like in the Hub, you can swipe right to view a list of all services that provide contacts - your phone, the SIM card in it, BBM and BBM Video, Gmail, Twitter, you name it. You can use this to browse contacts coming from a specific service only or go into the settings to hide contacts from services you don't need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another trick from Hub is the long press - this gives you an easy access to several options straight in the contact lists. It's especially quick if you do it as one gesture (press and hold on a contact then move your finger to the option and release).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 has a louder ringer than the Z10, which, combined with vibration, should see to you not missing any calls. It got a Good mark, which is a great result meaning missed calls will be a rarity.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>File Manager with Dropbox and Box integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The File Manager is there for more advanced file browsing needs. It shows the internal and external storage as either a grid or list of files and folders. You can sort them by name, date, type and size in either ascending or descending order and if you still can't find what you need, there's the search feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 10 imposes a strict structure at the root level of the internal storage - folders are predefined and you can't change them. Inside those folders and on the external storage (microSD card), you're free to organize sub-folders as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files and folders can be moved, copied and deleted in bulk, renamed or even zipped up into a single file and then unzipped (sending multiple files is easier if they are in a single file).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between the internal and external storage, you do the same swipe right gesture used to filter items in the Hub and Contacts apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is cloud-enabled too, you can add Box and Dropbox accounts. They are treated almost the same way as a microSD card, so copying files between phone and cloud storage is seamless. There's no search option here (but you can still sort folders).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding those cloud accounts is done through external apps (Box and Connect to Dropbox), which is a bit clunky. These apps show the time of the last sync, your storage usage and have a toggle to disable syncing over mobile data (great if you don't have a solid data plan). The Box app also has toggles to automatically upload photos and videos to the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One potential problem with this app is that it only supports one account from each service. To be fair, so do the official desktop clients for these services. Still, it's worth noting if you're one of the few people who keep multiple accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch away from the Manager, its active frame changes to show memory usage on the various storage locations, giving you handy at-a-glance info.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Simple image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery app has a simple three-tab interface. The first is Recent and it displays recently added and recently viewed images (each list gets half of the screen, but you can tap the down arrow to expand them).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is for photos shot with the BlackBerry Z30 and the third is for albums, which shows all folders with images on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple images can be selected at once for mass delete and mass share. There are also options to edit the image, start a slideshow or use DLNA to push images to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing individual images gives you the same options. You can move between images by swiping the current image past the edge left or right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Edit option in the gallery app is pretty powerful. The Transform tab in the editor can rotate and flip the image and there's a free transform tool as well if you want to crop out a specific part of the image. Then there's Enhance with the standard image tweaking options available (brightness, contrast, sharpness, noise reduction and so on), each with a slider for adjustments. There's a simple Auto-enhance option if you don't want to waste time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final two tabs are Artistic and Styles, which pretty much do the same thing - add Instagram-like effects to the image (everyone's favorite Lomo, Sepia and Aged photo effects). There's a cool animation that shows the effect sliding up on the image, giving you a one second look at how the current effect and the new one look side by side.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable video player and video editing options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 came with a surprisingly capable video player. Its interface is very similar to that of the image gallery. It has three tabs - Recent, Camera and Library (which shows all video files in the phone storage) - and can display items either as a list or a grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search for a video, mass delete videos, share them or push them through DLNA to a compatible player. There's also the HDMI port with which you can output the video to any HDTV, as long as you have an HDMI cable with a microHDMI jack on one side (those are more popular and cheaper than MHL adapters).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z30 video player handled all the popular file formats (AVI, MP4, MKV) and 1080p videos easily. Codec support is pretty great too - DivX, XviD and h.264 are ready to go as is Dolby Digital audio. The one thing the player choked on was DTS audio (video still worked).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some competing smartphone don't support anything over MP4 videos with MP3/AAC audio, so this is good showing by the business phone. There's also support for close captions, which was a neat surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that impressed us was the Edit option - it took a 1080p video and offered to trim its start and end points, rotate and crop the video, adjust its brightness, contrast color and sound too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This isn't the only video editor on board the BlackBerry Z30 either. The Story Maker app lets you pick multiple movies and photos and puts together a video slideshow with a soundtrack of your choice. There are several different preset styles, which add an effect over the whole video (vintage, bleach pass, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go back and add/remove items, rearrange them and put them through the image or video editor if they need to be tweaked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, Story Maker saves the final videos in 720p resolution but you can switch to 1080p if you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good music player, sans equalizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The UI of the BlackBerry Z30 music player is pretty similar to the image gallery and video player. It has three tabs, the first of which displays recently added and recently played music. The second organizes the music library by Artist, Album or Genre and the third one displays all the playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is pretty simple with a big album art in the middle, surrounded by playback controls (including shuffle and repeat buttons). If you tap on the album art (or drag it down) you get the current playlist so you can easily jump between songs (swiping left and right between songs doesn't work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no playback controls on the lockscreen or the shade on top of the screen a la Android, you can use the volume keys instead. The volume up and down buttons change the volume for short presses or act as previous/next buttons if you long press them. The middle button is play/pause.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, when changing the volume while there's a track playing, the little window with the volume level indicator does have playback controls and track info and album art. It's an odd place to put them and you have to hit a volume key each time you want to use them - we much prefer using the hardware keys for the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is DLNA-enabled, just like the gallery and video players. There's no equalizer though, it is the one major feature we missed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is a tale of two parts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry did impressively well in the first part of our audio quality test. The smartphone posted excellent scores all over the field and garnished them with nicely high volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the smartphone had real trouble handling headphones and connecting them sent its distortion levels sky high. The other readings were also affected, but the differences were hard to detect with a naked ear. A pretty abysmal performance here and more than enough to bring the overall score down to unsatisfactory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 comes with an 8MP main camera with an LED flash and a secondary 2MP camera. Both cameras can shoot HD video, 1080p for the main camera and 720p for the front-facing one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks pretty familiar at first - not too different than an Android camera - but much like the rest of the interface, the camera app has some handy tricks up its sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 offers three shooting models - Stills, Video and Time shift, the mode toggle is in the top right corner. Below that is the Menu key, which offers several settings including a front/back camera switch, flash mode and aspect ratio (4:3 or 16:9, there's no resolution setting).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is the Scene mode toggle (Auto, Action, Whiteboard, Night, Beach and Snow) and the Shooting mode toggle. The still camera can just snap pics, do digital image stabilization or enable burst shot. Burst shot photos are snapped at 6MP resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get some more settings for the camera if you swipe down - where to put photos and videos (internal storage or microSD card) and geo-tagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos are taken by just tapping the screen, long press to trigger the auto-focus before taking the shot. If burst shot is enabled, then the camera will snap pics in quick succession while you have your finger on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also touch focus on board, though you have to drag the focus point to where you want the focus to be. It can take some getting used to if you're used to just tapping to move the focus point. Digital zoom is available too, it's done through pinch zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 camera UI has two handy shortcuts. A thumbnail of the last photo you've taken is in the lower left corner and you can tap it to go to the gallery. Better still, you can swipe it to enlarge that photo for a quick view of how it turned out, it goes back to thumbnail when you lift your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second shortcut appears in the upper left corner when flash mode is not set to auto. Tap the shortcut to get back to auto flash mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also has a feature called Time Shift, which is hardly unique to BlackBerry. It snaps several photos in quick succession with just one tap at the screen and automatically selects the best one. It also detects faces in the photo (which can take several seconds, depending on how many faces there are).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once that's done, Time Shift allows you to tweak the photo - pick a different photo from the 11 that were captured and for each individual face that was detected, you also get to choose from 11 snaps, so 11 different facial expressions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 has the company's 8MP camera and we were pleasantly surprised by the image quality. There is plenty of fine detail and not too much sharpening going around. There's a bit of noise in the uniform areas of sky, but that's not too much of an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exposure and contrast are good, though the phone does slightly underexpose shadows. With backlit subjects, there is some purple fringing going on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like on the BlackBerry Z10, the Z30's camera outputs oversaturated colors. We know consumer cameras typically boost the colors to make images appear livelier but BlackBerry went too far here and we suspect the oversaturation is at least partly responsible for the noise. We wish BlackBerry put finer image controls in the camera interface, so you can go for more natural colors if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it's a very good camera, one of the best 8MP shooters right now. Given BlackBerry's past record with still cameras, we would have been happy with anything that produces usable images, but the Z30 actually came way better than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took HDR photos with the BlackBerry Z30. Below, you can see the comparison between a regular shot and an HDR one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a macro sample too.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Switching the camera to video mode doesn't affect the user interface, it just changes the options available from the Menu key. You can still enable digital image stabilization and pick from the preset scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During recording, you can move the focus point around (again by dragging not tapping) and you can toggle the video light on and off. There's no way to capture photos during video recording though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main camera can shoot 1080p or 720p videos (720p is picked by default), while the front-facing camera can do only 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos are stored in MP4 files with 16.1Mbps total bitrate. The sound is recorded in stereo and better still using 192Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, video recording is on the high level set by the still camera - the clips produced are smooth at a consistent 30fps and with plenty of fine detail. Colors are again oversaturated but there's no visible noise. To our delight, the video packs a great amount of detail without looking oversharpened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample video recorded with the BlackBerry Z30 that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Enhanced connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike its smaller brother, the BlackBerry Z30 covers a lot of connectivity ground with just one model version, not four. For starters, it packs quad-band 2G and penta-band 3G connectivity with support for HSDPA+ speeds. There's also penta-band LTE on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is fully featured as well. Dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n handles local Internet connections and Bluetooth 4.0 handles accessories. There's also microUSB port for data connectivity with a computer and a standard microHDMI port for TV-Out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board, allowing easy exchange of data. You can use the dedicated app to create tags (e.g. a tag with contact info), which you can send to another NFC-enabled phone. The app also handles reading tags and storing the data for when you're on the receiving end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You don't need NFC to transfer tags either - the BlackBerry Z30 can create a QR code and read QR codes too, which is great for communicating with phones that don't have NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're talking about connectivity, we have to go over BlackBerry Link - the PC Suite for the Z30. The phone has the install file for your computer, just plug it in and install the app. Luckily, you don't need it for the USB data connection to work, you can simply enable mass storage mode from the settings and simply drag and drop files on your storage card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PC Link has its advantages though - once everything is installed, the phone storage will appear as a drive on your computer. You don't even need the USB cable, the phone will appear as a network drive once it's on the same Wi-Fi network as the computer (you can disable this if you like).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Link can schedule phone backups and automatic sync of content (both docs and multimedia). That's great with the Wi-Fi option - it will seamlessly sync your docs at work and then your music at home, you don't need to do anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that is great, but needing the app to install the right drivers is annoying. They didn't even install properly the first time around and we had to go through the Windows' Device Manager to get them to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Link doesn't support file drag-and-drop from regular Windows folders to the app so you should use the computer's file browser option only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We added a test folder with four documents but Link took quite a while to scan the folder before sending it. Scanning phone content when copying on the other direction isn't speedy either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Happily, BlackBerry Link isn't crashing as much as it used to. While there were occasional freezes here and there, the overall experience was pleasant. Kudos to BlackBerry for fixing this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also share the Z30's display with an HDTV using Miracast. Wi-Fi Direct is also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in the end, mass storage is the way even if it only grants access to the microSD card and not the internal storage. Link has been polished, but we'd like to see BlackBerry keep working on it and improve it even further.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser keeps Flash alive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 has a WebKit-based browser with full Flash support. The 5" HD screen is physically as large as the droid flagship, but with that resolution it's not in the same ballpark in terms of sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is pretty straightforward. The first thing you see is the New tab interface, which shows thumbnails of recently visited sites. It's a bit annoying that these can't be deleted. There's no Incognito/Private mode either, so be careful what sites you open, they will get listed there, if you visit them frequently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering URLs is pretty quick thanks to the autocomplete feature, which managed to guess correctly what we're trying to type most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the UI that displays websites is pretty Windows Phone-like - the web page takes the whole screen, except for a line at the bottom (it even covers the status bar at the top of the screen). The line at the bottom holds a Tab switcher button, Back button, URL field and a Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tab switcher button brings up a list of currently open tabs, along with Bookmarks, History and a New tab shortcut. The current page you're browsing is pushed to the right to reveal all those. Instead of tapping the Tab switcher button, you can swipe to the right but the gesture needs to begin at the bottom where the Tab button is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can be a short swipe - just enough for the option icons to show up and get docked on the left side of the screen. That seems like a handy way to keep those options and tabs always visible, but they hide as soon as you tap anything else - a missed opportunity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the browser is very fast and elaborate web sites are rendered without a hitch. Pinch zooming is smooth and there's double-tap to zoom too, but no text reflow. From the Menu button you get access to several more options, including Find on page and Share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool option has the browser remember which tabs were open, so the tabs will still be there even if you close the browser and open it again later (similar to recent desktop browsers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting option is Reader - it strips out the site's interface and leaves only the content, making it much easier to read on a phone's screen. It doesn't work very well with multi-page articles though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 has full Flash support - it's among the last active platforms that do. The dual-core Krait processor had no problem playing a 1080p YouTube videos, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry bragged about how good their browser is, so we ran a few benchmarks on it. At the moment, it's the top scorer at HTML5Test.com (which tests HTML5 compatibility), beating other mobile and even desktop browsers by a good margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While pure JavaScript performance is not quite the best as seen from SunSpider, it did outrun the Nexus 4. The compound BrowserMark 2 test gave it a very good score though, beating the powerhouse that the LG G2 is.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Office documents<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 comes with a full-blown Office document editor - you wouldn't expect any less, would you? It's called DocsToGo and can both view and create Word and Excel documents. It can edit PowerPoint presentations too, but not create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Word editor has all the text formatting features you'll need - everything from the standard bold, italic, underline through text justification, text and background color, font and text size, super and sub scripts, to list and paragraph styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel editor works with multiple sheets, cell formatting and formulas, though we would have appreciated a formula editor of some sort. We're no Excel experts so typing out the formulas by hand out of memory was a real challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint presentations can be edited too, but only for small tweaks - you can't create new presentations from scratch or even add new slides. The Present option is pretty sweet though - it displays the slide through HDMI to the TV/projector, while showing you the notes for the slide on the phone's screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adobe Reader is on board for viewing PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that's great for the Z30, but we do feel the lack of a cloud solution. Sure, you can sync your docs through Dropbox or Box, but Windows Phone has cloud integration with Microsoft's Office 365 and SkyDrive services and Android has Google's Drive. These services handle both cloud storage of files and editing them online in the browser too, something BlackBerry Z30 users might appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the time of this writing, there are no official apps for Office, SkyDrive or Drive integration, though there are third party apps that do support them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer is a big part of every business phone and luckily BlackBerry didn't repeat the PlayBook blunder of not putting a native calendar app (their tablet didn't have contacts or email at first either). No worries though, BB OS 10 has a worthy calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a tabbed interface and several different ways to view your appointments. The first tab is for daily view and it has three view modes - Agenda (a list of all events), People (events sorted by who's attending them) and Schedule (a list of events for the day, positioned by when the start).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's weekly view, which has two modes - show only workdays and show the whole week. Finally, there's month view if you need a broader look of what's ahead. Multiple calendars are supported and they are color coded, so you can easily tell which event comes from where (e.g. your personal Gmail account or the work calendar).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each event has a reminder and can change your status for the duration of the event (Busy, Out of office, etc.). Viewing an event shows you three tabs - event details, who's invited (invitations are sent over email) and emails related to that event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar will warn you if two events are close together and the active frame of the app shows the next event for the day. One problem with the calendar we encountered was that the time and date picker crashes the app every single time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the calendar is good at scheduling things, it's not that great at keeping notes and other info you might need. This is where Remember steps in. You can add items to Remember from the app itself or just flag something in the BlackBerry Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each entry can be assigned to a folder (and folders can be color coded). Entries start off pretty simple - a subject and some additional notes, plus a message if the entry was added by flagging something in the Hub. From here you can add due date info, attach a photo, a voice note or any file. You can tag entries, but there's no easy way to sort entries by tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app features the same clock as the Bedside mode on the lockscreen. You can switch to a digital watch face if you prefer. You only get one alarm, you'll have to use calendar reminders if you need more. The alarm can have a recurrence pattern (in which days of the week it's active) and a customizable snooze time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app also has a World clock, stopwatch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 also has a Calculator app. It's slightly more advanced than most stock calculators with memory, square root and brackets visible by default. Results from your calculations go on a strip of "paper" that gets ripped off when you hit clear. Flipping the phone horizontally brings out the advanced calculator with more functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also has unit converter and tip calculator modes. The tip calculator has undergone a slight UI revamps and no longer displays a ripped paper and we have to say we like the new one better. The clock feels a bit out of place with the rest of the interface that's closer to Windows Phone than early HTC Sense in graphical style, unlike these two apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather app pulls info from AccuWeather and shows the forecast for today and the next four days. You can add multiple cities and see an hourly forecast too. The app switches between a bright blue and black backgrounds depending on whether it's day or night in the selected city.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z30 comes with a full array of social networking apps out of the box, as the company has finally realized that social networking is important for both regular folks and businesses these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook app shows you your wall by default but you can easily check friend requests, messages and notifications. Posting a new status, image and checking in are equally easy. You can access more from the menu button in the top left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're wondering why the app doesn't use the standard BB OS 10 menus, it's because it just encapsulates Facebook's mobile site. Still, it works well enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the same with the Twitter app. It shows you your timeline by default, but you can also use search, see what's trending and so on. Posting new tweets is easy and you can snap a new photo right from the app itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Maps application needs more maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry 10 comes with its own map application with map data coming from TomTom and TeleCommunications Systems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app only features regular maps - no satellite images or street view. It can show traffic information, but there's no public transport or pedestrian navigation support. The database of places and venues isn't nearly as rich as that of Google Maps, but at least maps now load quicker than they did on previous BB 10 phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To our delight, the map content of the app has made a space jump. Whereas on the BlackBerry Z10 most of the world didn't have much map data to show around, the latest Maps app is not only prettier, but also sports a lot more places and feels complete now. Of course, we're sure the app and its map data has been updated for all BB OS 10 smartphones as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps application does have voice-guided navigation though for in-car use. It's online-only (that is you need an Internet connection for that to work). You can tweak the route finding algorithm by telling it to look for the Fastest, Simplest or Shortest routes and to avoid highways, toll roads, carpool lanes or ferries. Night mode can be enabled, disabled or set to activate automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the experience with BB OS 10's Map application is still not as fluid as on its Android rivals, but has been much improved. Here's hoping BlackBerry continues to improve in this department as well. So far we like the progress we're seeing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry World gets a flying start<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry World app is your gateway to over 130,000 apps for your new BlackBerry Z30. While not as many apps as Android and iOS have (or even Windows Phone), many of the major names are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BB World is not too different from the Google Play Store. It shows featured apps on top of the screen, then two featured categories - Ultimate Gamer and Capture the moment. Below that are Trending apps &amp; games, Top paid games and Top paid apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse just games or just apps, which also reveals the Top free items of that category. Speaking of categories, both apps and games are sorted into genre categories, if you're looking for a specific type of app/game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps and games usually come with at least a few screenshots and a description. You can also read user reviews, complete with a star rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before an app installs, you'll be prompted to allow the app's required permissions. It's a bit annoying that you only get to see those after the app has been downloaded (but before it's installed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned that in the beginning of the year the BlackBerry World opened business with a respectable number of apps for a new app store, but a good 40% of those apps are Android ports (BlackBerry handed $100 to devs who ported their Android app to World).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, BlackBerry OS 10.2 now boasts runtime support for Android 4.2.2 apps. This enables hardware acceleration, which in theory at least, boosts performance of ported Android apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've tried side-loading (installing an app via a PC) a few Android apps and failed on a couple of occasions. It's definitely possible and when it works, it does so quite well. The process itself however, is cumbersome and isn't meant for everyone. There are plenty of tutorials online on how to do so, but you shouldn't count any of the apps to run as good as on an Android phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, just like Google's Play Store, the BlackBerry World offers more than just apps - you can buy music, movies and TV shows from here. Or you can just rent them, too. With DLNA and microHDMI port, the BlackBerry Z30 can be used as a serious media player, though popular US video services such as Netflix or Hulu are still missing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This review is hot on the heels of a failed rescue deal and another CEO replacement. No way obviously to look at the Z30 and ignore the dire condition the company is in. Yet, this didn't happen overnight. Things were already going downhill when the Z10 arrived. And it seemed to bring the right kind of hope. Quite unfortunate for the Z30, which is clearly better than its predecessor but has even darker clouds looming over it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not look at the bigger picture for a while though, and focus on the Blackberry Z30 for what it is. Some things could've been better obviously but there's good stuff too. To begin with, the handset somewhat fails to deliver the unapologetically premium look and feel one has every right to expect from a Blackberry. But it's a solidly built and well-handling phone. A bit too heavy perhaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The updated BB 10 OS more than makes up for that. Going by sheer numbers, the 10.2 upgrade doesn't sound particularly promising but it actually overdelivers. And we can afford to say that because the original OS was already exciting and novel in its approach. Of course the flipside is that what we're getting now in 10.2 should've been there already with the Z10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But yes, the lockscreen notifications, instant preview and reply, the priority hub, USB host do make a difference. Heck, it's even things like the reject-call-with-text feature that took Apple a few iOS versions to enable - and they made a big deal out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the complete experience though that counts and the BB 10 is an easy OS to like for being both creative and efficient. The swipe gestures let you interact with the phone in a unique way, and the experience is almost addictive. The Blackberry Z30 is a seriously good multitasker too, and has solid social and communication skills, cloud sync and storage, an office package and a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the ability to run Android apps isn't actually new, v 10.2 does well to bring compatibility with Jelly Bean and enable hardware acceleration. Of course, ported titles aside, side-loading apps could be too geeky for some, but the option is there for those who will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's highly uncertain of course whether the Jelly Bean runtime will be enough of a reason for enough people. It may've simply been the quickest way to make the App World numbers look less embarrassing - clearly not an attempt to beat droids at their own game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we don't mean any sorts of droids - it's the top dogs the Z30 is standing against, considering the price Blackberry's charging. True, the Z30 is probably the most reasonably priced BlackBerry flagship in a while - currently only a little more expensive than some of its most recent Android counterparts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, if the Z30 is not on your budget, you can always opt for the BlackBerry Z10 at half the price. It comes with a smaller 4.2" display with similar HD resolution and even higher ppi ratio, the chipset is slower but BB OS lacks heavy games that could push it to the limit anyway. The BlackBerry 10.2 OS update is seeding to the Z10 devices already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Z10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Blackberry's phones used to be made to measure - they found it out the hard way that it's a strategy that doesn't work anymore against such diverse and potent rivals. iPhones and droids are in the hands of all sorts of users - from corporate through geeks, to the average Joe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple did change the smartphone market in a way Blackberry failed to see coming. Windows Phone adapted faster and better, and managed to push the Canadians off the third place in market share. Of course, WP leveraged the expertise and tradition of Nokia and Microsoft, and the bottomless pockets of the latter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPhone 5s ? Nokia Lumia 925 ? Nokia Lumia 1520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the likes of Google and Samsung leading the line, Android is capable of serving every niche and budget. Blackberry may be doing fine even without the latest in processing power but not being able to match the droids' HD screens is clearly doing it no favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4 ? LG G2 ? HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Blackberry may after all manage to stay afloat, one way or another. Its software and services are still worth a lot, so betting everything on that and giving up on actually making hardware may as well count as a happy ending of sorts - Nokia's the one to ask about that. The Z30 though stands little chance against the kind of rivals we just looked at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As much as most people love a happy ending though, it's not what necessarily makes a good story. You know what does? A strong character. Like the one about the flagship that got caught in a storm.</paragraph>
