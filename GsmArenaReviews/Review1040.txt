			<paragraph>At this point it should be clear that the future of Nokia rides on the success of the Windows Phone 8 platform. The Fins need the second major WP release to work as the Lumia lineup is Nokia's only shot at staying afloat in the long run. Samsung and Apple's onslaught is strong - almost brutal when looking at Samsung's numbers in the Android camp - and a previous go-to manufacturer like Nokia can only have one thing in mind: revenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is the first manufacturer to go all in with Windows Phone, using its mapping and multimedia strengths to help the platform gain momentum. The last quarterly results were certainly encouraging, but we'll have to wait another three months to see if that was actually a blip or a hint of things to come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia will certainly be hoping that the global launch of the Lumia 620 will help it push more WP smartphones in the first three months of the year, despite the weaker seasonal demand, as It makes the platform more affordable than ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, the Lumia 620 holds a less vulnerable position in the midrange market, leaving it to worry about only two rivals - the Huawei W1 and the Windows Phone 8S by HTC. Let's have a look at the colorful Lumia 620's strengths and weaknesses:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 620 is priced at ?250 off contract so it's easy on your wallet. It offers Nokia's full-fledged turn-by-turn navigation Drive app, Nokia Music for offline listening to radio mixes, App Highlights for app recommendations, Cinemagraph, the list goes on. And while there are alternatives in the Marketplace, few are as high quality as Nokia's, while Drive+ beta is only available in three countries for WP devices different than Nokia's, meaning the majority of users are on their own in regards to voice navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 620 runs on capable hardware as well. The 5 MP camera and microSD card support are a welcome bonus, but it's the dual-core Krait chip and ClearBlack 3.8" display that shine the most, while the colorful and almost unibody-like chassis sets it apart in a crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we come to the OS itself. Windows Phone 8 is behind on the quality app count but it's quick to catch up and doing a pretty good job of getting developers interested. It's also a breath of fresh air for all those tired of the iOS and Android way of doing things - swipe-able homescreens, folders, notification areas, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it all up, the Lumia 620 has a nice set of assets to woo newcomers and gather back some of the lost momentum for Nokia - there's only the users to convince and the HTC Windows Phone 8S and Huawei W1 to beat. We'll endeavor to see if the Lumia has what it takes - starting with a tour of the hardware.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail box on the modest side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 retail box is nothing special. You get a standard set of headphones, an A/C adapter, and a standalone microUSB cable. After you've removed the various protective stickers off the Lumia 620, a number of leaflets complete the tally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked a second color option for the back panel or a complimentary microSD card, but given the Lumia 620's relatively low off-contract price, we're happy with the set overall.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 620 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia have done a good job keeping the Lumia 620 grounded in terms of dimensions. At 115.4 x 61.1 x 11 mm the only place where it isn't all that great is the thickness, but that's still easy to live with. Weight is also kept under wraps tipping the scales at 127 g, which is reasonable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In these size-tolerant times the Lumia 620 may even be called tiny - compared to the iPhone 4S it's an almost identical match in length, while managing to add a bigger 3.8" screen into the mix.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 620 is attractively priced so its needs to cater to all audiences equally. We like what Nokia have done to please all manner of buyer, young or old, while the flashy lime green, orange, magenta, yellow and cyan are in keeping with the Lumia line's flamboyant side. For a more professional look, the white and black versions are subtler and more adult-like in their demeanor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ours was a black review unit this time around and Nokia has kept the gloss in the paint shop, leaving this one with a nice conservative matte finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is entirely covered with glass and wrapped around by the back panel. Under the glass hides a 3.8" ClearBlack LCD screen of WVGA (480 x 800) resolution. Under it lies the WP-rudimentary three-button combo of a capacitive variety while above the screen, stacked together in the limited available space, we find an ambient light sensor, front-facing camera, proximity sensor and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side plays host to the single-piece volume rocker and identical power and camera buttons. Distinguishing the camera from power button takes some getting used to, but we caught on fairly quickly. The buttons themselves are nicely clickable but glossy, meaning they tend to get smudgy in contrast to the otherwise matte body.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The left side is completely bare on the Lumia 620<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The top is where the 3.5 mm headphones jack resides alongside the second noise-cancelling microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right at the center of its bottom the Lumia 620 has a microUSB port for charging and data transfers and the primary microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wrap-around back panel employs a two-layer finish, similar to the Galaxy S III's hyperglaze back. There's a transparent layer on top of the base one, which is colored in one of the six colors the Lumia 620 is available in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the panel itself Nokia has placed a logo, the 5 MP camera with a single LED flash and a tiny loudspeaker hole, under which lies the grille itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, removing the back panel is not among the easiest of tasks even for experienced chaps such as ourselves. To get it off, you need to grab the top of the back panel with your fingernails from the front of the device and apply pressure over the camera module with your thumb while pulling back with your fingers. The panel can only slide out from the top as on the bottom the microUSB holds it in place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the panel out of the way, we find the battery, the microSD card slot (up to 64 GBs), and a peculiar slide-out micro SIM slot. We see the latter more and more in devices these days. It seems there's a war going on between manufacturers for the most ingenious SIM card slot, but for now we only see increasingly more ridiculous designs instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have two issues with the battery of the Lumia 620. First, it falls out of its place as soon as you tilt the phone, which isn't ideal for people that like to access their memory card slot often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1300mAh capacity is getting us a bit worried, but we'll have to wait until we've concluded our battery tests on the Lumia 620 tomorrow until we know for sure if that's really a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>UPDATE: Here go the results. The Nokia Lumia 620 got an endurance of 36 hours - that means you'll need to charge the phone every 36 hours if you do one hour of calling, web browsing and video playback a day.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 packs a 3.8" ClearBlack LCD (that's first gen) of WVGA resolution (480 x 800 pixels). The pixel density of 246ppi provides excellent sharpness and the image quality is surprisingly good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness levels are good and make up for the blacks, which are only average, so the overall contrast is excellent for the class. Colors are very punchy and viewing angles are quite decent too. There's a lot of color shifting going on when you increase the viewing angle, but what's on the screen remains legible unless you reach absolute extremes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a microscopic image of the screen's RGB matrix. The pixel arrangement is pretty standard for an LCD unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although we found the blacks and pixel density of the Lumia 620 to be only average we should note that the contrast is very good, particularly for this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone also excelled in our sunlight legibility test, beating much more expensive offerings in the process.

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 is comfortable to use and single-handed operation is quite easy. As we said, it could have been thinner, but having all the controls on one side and a small display certainly helps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not particularly excited about the 11mm profile of the Nokia Lumia 620, which makes the smartphone feel a bit bulkier than it should have been, but it's not too bad either way. The ample space below the capacitive keys at the front could have also been put to better use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the 127g of weight, we think Nokia found a good balance between pocketability and a solid feel. Furthermore, the smartphone's curved sides allow it to fit perfectly in-hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As an added bonus, the matte black finish really facilitates the grip and we'd take it any day over the glossy lime green version we previously had around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone 8 with resizable tiles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 is meant to look the same across all devices but makers still have a way to customize the experience and stand out against the competition. Nokia has more leeway than other makers thanks to its deal with Microsoft, but it also has the most riding on the platform - Nokia doesn't have Android to fall back on (yet). If you are not versed with the difference between the various versions of the Windows Phone OS, make sure you check out our Windows Phone OS version rundown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, WP8 on a Nokia Lumia is noticeably different from what you get from competing makers thanks to a number of exclusive features. We'll cover them one by one, but first here's a look at the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 is powered by a 1.0 GHz dual-core Krait processor paired with an Adreno 305 GPU and 512 MB of RAM. That's close to what the WP8 flagships have (and competitive midrange Androids), so the 620 packs plenty of oomph, especially for such a light OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date, and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. Pushing the volume rocker in either direction will bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device or you can just press and hold the camera shutter key to unlock the phone and jump straight to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft added a lot of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to add notifications and images on the lockscreen. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps get to show more limited info ("quick status").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - one of the installed apps can be set to choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account) or you can let the music player change the lockscreen image to the album art of the currently playing track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI is a vertical grid of Live tiles, which can be reordered the way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 introduces resizable live tiles - when you tap and hold on a tile, you'll get additional resize button to the unpin one. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu). In our mind, the process of resizing live tiles could've been better. In order to switch from big to normal and then small you have to hit the same toggle - it would've made more sense if there were separate ones to make a tile bigger and smaller or resize tiles by dragging like in Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts, but that's oversimplifying things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking, but it takes an iOS-like approach to it. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). But just like iOS, if an app needs to run in the background (navigation clients, messengers, etc.) it can. WP offers both kind of multi-tasking and it's up to developers to choose how their apps operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-tasking interface is the same as in WP7.5 - to switch between apps you press and hold the Back key. You'll get thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to your running or suspended app. You can't "kill" any of those apps from here - to exit one you must bring it to front and use the Back key to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Back key for closing apps has its flaws. If you start frantically hitting the back key, sooner or later you will get to a browser window. And this won't close before it goes all the way back to the first loaded page. Anyway, it seems it's best to let the OS manage the apps and not worry about closing apps manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes. For example, changing the brightness setting requires you to go to the settings menu and scroll all the way down - it's basically a head-banging operation involving multiple swipes and clicks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft has expressed that it's working on just such a feature and that we should see it in a future update to WP 8 but time has gone past and we've seen nothing of the sort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 also can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate or have the phone read text out, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too - Android's got Google Now, Apple has Siri and there are a number of third party "virtual voice assistants" available. The Windows assistant though is still far behind the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features brought by WP8 is the Kids Corner. You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left of the lockscreen. If you've secured it, your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without the password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - a company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info to help them with their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub for contacts and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People Hub is the best phonebook we've seen to date and it's got a great social services integration. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a Search shortcut and an Add Contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to the corresponding part of the contact list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to make the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rooms tab is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. The Rooms tab allows for group chats, but here you can also share a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is that they don't all need WP8 phones to get in - Windows Phone 7 handsets and iPhones can join a room too, though they only get the shared calendar. Android users are left out. Still, Rooms is a great way to keep in touch and get organized, while avoiding the clutter of Facebook and the likes where everyone has too many friends and too many notifications waiting for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions - "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab displays the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, listed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 offered loud and clear in-call sound and we had no issues with signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding specific contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 620 scored a Good rating. The loudspeaker on the Lumia 620 is really powerful and plays vocals and music with a particular oomph to them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. The foundation of all non-email messaging is threads. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are only displayed when the conversation moves across platforms to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which service to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you of what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages and a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them as read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. Unfortunately, there's no vibration feedback on key press and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photos integrates with SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. Apps can integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends and contacts so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo automatically. It's a nice feature but one that produces less than stellar results at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Mix Radio and Music + Videos tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing their own music service called Mix Radio on the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks. While it is mostly streaming oriented, you can make tracks available offline in Mix Radio (they remain on the device only temporarily though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Mix Radio competes with services like Pandora too - you can give it a list of artists you like and it will automatically build a playlist to your taste. Nokia takes pride in real people creating the mixes (including celebrity-made mixes) instead of computer algorithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike competing services you can also browse a specific artist and even buy songs to keep if you like. There are plenty of charts (e.g. Top sellers, Best of 2012, Songs for Fall) if you're looking for something new too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's app has several other advantages - it has several equalizer presets (including a custom one) and it has Dolby Headphones enhancements. Also, if you like an artist, the app will help you look for gigs close to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Windows Phone 8 media players are on-board too. They reside together in the Music + Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to or watch podcasts, or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with Zune. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Since the GDR2 update, the Lumia 620 now has FM Radio support, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since our last encounter. Now it supports XviD (though we had some issues with this codec), DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Average audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 audio output is almost identical to that the Lumia 920. This is to say not the best around, but given that this smartphone isn't burdened by the same kind of expectations as the flagship, it can easily get away with the minor flaws.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Lumia 620 mostly managed good scores with the higher than average intermodulation distortion the only exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones isn't too bad but the intermodulation distortion increases even further. The stereo crosstalk increases very slightly and remains good for the case and the overall output should be good enough to please the vast majority of the users. Audiophiles might need to keep looking, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 boasts a 5 MP camera which is capable of taking pictures of 2592??1936 pixel resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, front/back camera toggle, flash mode setting and the Lens button. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness and ISO among others. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key will wake the phone up with a single press and launch the camera app. The Lumia 620 is not the fastest shooter around and it takes it a couple of seconds before a photo is taken. This is a longer delay than we're used to from modern smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenses are an interesting take at feature add-ons, enhancing the camera functionality without making a mess of third party apps each with its own UI. Lenses are accessible directly from the native camera app (they show up in the list of installed apps too if you want to pin a Lens to the start screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has preloaded the Smart Shoot lens, which is by far the most powerful, and you can also download the Panorama and Cinemagraph lenses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Shoot uses Scalado technology (Nokia owns the company) - it shoots multiple photos and lets you pick which one to save (a sort of burst mode). You can also pick the best face and cycle through each facial expression a person made while the camera was snapping photos. The third option is Erase, which will remove moving objects (e.g. someone walking in front of the landmark you're trying to shoot just as you press the shutter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama does what it says - you press the shutter and then align the camera as instructed (the app will put circles you have to aim for). It's good, but you always shoot right to left (can't switch direction), which is a bit annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although far from the best on the market, the 5 MP camera on the Lumia 620 actually produces photos with pretty solid image quality. The level of resolved detail is great, colors are very pleasant and the dynamic range is decent. The noise is fairly high but the overall result is still really nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are a wee bit dull in most cases but they still look truer to life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The close up mode or otherwise macro is great. The Lumia 620 can focus from a really close distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cinemagraph creates photos that are mostly static, but a part of them is animated. You have to hold the phone steady while shooting. When you're done, the Lens will offer two (sometimes three) areas that can be animated and when you pick an area, you can tweak the animation, trim it, and set the loop pattern.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder fails to gain points<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's and has plenty of features too. You can change the white balance, sharpness and the video resolution among other things. The LED flash can be made to work as a video light, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 captures 720p videos, which are pretty smooth, and have a decent amount of resolved detail for the 720p league. Colors look pretty good too, even if slightly oversaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bitrate is reasonable at 10.5 Mpbs and the framerate is firmly at 29 fps. Sadly, the Lumia 620 captures only mono sound at 98 Kbps bitrate and 44 kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 720p video sample we've uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity - everything's covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 620 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, quad-band 3G with HSPA but lacks LTE connectivity. HSDPA still offers reasonably good speeds at 21Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 3.0. Bluetooth is no longer limited as to what it can do - there's file transfer support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement as to where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to handle a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it to emails, because there is no file manager and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone storage, you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 620 also has NFC connectivity, which is used in the Wallet app. Unfortunately, we won't know whether that has any potential to expand beyond its out-of-the-box functionality for at least a few more months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is still useful for file sharing and it works across other platforms with NFC support. Sending a picture with a number of Jelly Bean devices, for instance, wasn't a problem and the same goes for web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC comes into play with some accessories too - like the JBL PowerUp speaker that automatically starts playing when you put the Lumia 620 on top of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer is smart, fast and sociable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone 8 brings a major upgrade, but kept its old looks. Almost everything Microsoft has done on the IE is under the hood and the end result is close to excellent. The Lumia 620 has a big enough screen for comfortable browsing, but the pixel density is only average, so text can get fuzzy at low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't really lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar is united with the search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share option is interesting in that you can not only send the page address in a message, but you can share it with your Xbox (if you have it set up). This way you can easily transfer a page from your phone to your TV and continue browsing there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected the Nokia Lumia 620 to match the other WP8 phones we've tested in terms of performance in the SunSpider and BrowserMark benchmark tests but it didn't deliver. It secured itself a spot further down the line, way below the likes of the Lumia 920 and Android's top smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Windows Phone 8 has built-in mobile data management tools called Data Sense. Its purpose is twofold - it tracks how much data each app has used and can even help you save data by compressing web pages and images before they are sent to the browser (similar to Opera's Turbo). Data Sense depends on carrier support and doesn't work yet (not even tracking data usage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is working on the Xpress Browser for Windows Phone, which does the web page compression trick independently of carriers, but that isn't available for the Lumia 620 yet. We're slightly disappointed that Microsoft and Nokia promised stuff that we wanted to try out, only to find out it's not yet available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looking glass button on the Lumia 620 brings you to the new Bing search app. At first glance, it's the same app overall - you type in a query and you get search results from the web and there's a pretty background photo with several translucent squares you can tap to learn interesting facts about the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would like to see a Windows 8/Windows RT mode where hitting the search button in any app prompts a unified search within the same app with a context menu to take search further - for instance web, local storage, other apps, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing offers more than just web results though - for example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three search features you can quickly reach from the default Bing screen. The first one is Local Scout, which lets you search for various points of interest around you. There's the camera scanner too, which can snap a photo of text, run OCR and translate it into another language - this is the so-called Bing Vision camera lens. The third one is the song recognition feature that gives you track and artist name and takes you to the music store so you can buy the track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also tries to be a bit of a homepage too - you can swipe to the left to browse top videos, locally playing movies and top headlines.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Store for apps, games and music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store (formerly Phone Marketplace) is still playing catch up with the Apple App Store and the Android Market. The number of apps available is higher than 100,000 now, and while that doesn't quite compare to Android and iOS, Microsoft says that 46 out of the top 50 apps are already available for WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps written specifically for Windows Phone 8 won't work on the older versions but all of the older apps will be compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is divided in three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, a few screenshots and permissions. While the list of permissions isn't as prominent as it is on Android, the Store will explicitly ask you about the important stuff (e.g. location info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (you can list all or free apps only), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia App Recommendations will help you get the best apps right off the bat, including a number of Nokia Lumia-exclusives (things like Nokia Weather Channel, which you might have missed) and categories like Starter pack or Shop til you drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected), just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the trial option, which is available to many games and apps. You can try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Store and right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Store) or the avatar changing app. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps and Drive, other location-based apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is bringing their own mapping solutions to the table and they are more powerful than the default Bing Maps that other Windows Phones come with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Drive is the premium app - it offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Drive you can easily plan routes (all offline, unlike the early iterations of this app) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do miss a few options - like setting a starting location other than your current location and downloading maps for an entire continent. Still, Nokia offer quality maps and offline voice-guided navigation out of the box, which puts them ahead of other Windows Phone makers an even other platforms (both Android and iOS require a data connection to plan the route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app also offers walking, driving and public transport navigation but it only shows a list of instructions. It shares data with Drive so you don't have to download the same maps twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Local Scout app will locate nearby points of interest and it will even show you indoor maps of malls. The app has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from an "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have an exclusive app to help you find things near you too - it's called City Lens and it's an augmented reality app. Basically, it launches the camera and overlays various icons representing the nearby POI (along with distance and star rating), moving as you pan the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch to a traditional list too - you just hold the phone upright and it will switch automatically (it's triggered by the accelerometer). Or if you hold the phone perpendicular to the ground, it will switch to map view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a place will fire up Nokia Maps so you can have a look at the extensive info it offers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great Office experience on mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness of simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right. Each alarm can have its own name, sound and repeat.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Lumia 620 is finds itself in a pretty comfortable position right now. It's far from the hunting grounds of the WP8 powerhouses and yet it provides solid smartphone experience, a very decent screen and a design, which while not as sophisticated as that of the Lumia 820 and 920, has more youthful appeal than either of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might not be the most capable smartphone around, but it can do the basics just fine and it even has a couple of nice tricks up its sleeve. Since there are more casual users than aren't too many power users shopping in this price range, it might even be the most sensible Lumia of this generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let's get down to business - the enemies in plain view. The Lumia 620 costs around ?250 right now and its main rival is the HTC Windows Phone 8S, which seems to match it perfectly in terms of hardware. Imaging is on par with two 5 MP snappers. There are two identical sets of chipsets to power both devices, and the HTC smartphone even offers a slightly bigger 4.0" S-LCD of the same WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pricing is dead equal too so it appears that it's almost too close to call between those two. Except that it actually isn't. The exclusive software goodies like free-for-life voice-guided navigation and Nokia Music make the Lumia 620 a clear favorite here. True, the HTC Windows Phone 8S can also use Drive+, but only in three countries and it only gets a beta version of the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Windows Phone 8S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Huawei Ascend W1. It sports the same dual-core Krait CPU, but it's clocked at 1.2GHz. The camera on the back is also a 5 MP unit and the screen is a 4.0" WVGA IPS unit. It too offers a microSD card slot and it will even cost less money than the Lumia 620 and Windows Phone 8S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Huawei W1 also lacks Nokia's software perks and we find those to be worth the price difference. Feel free to disagree if you don't plan on using them, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Huawei Ascend W1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next comes a contender, sporting Android. The Sony Xperia P has a marvelous aluminum unibody and 4" Reality display of qHD resolution, meaning slightly more pixels. It's not ClearBlack but does feature the Mobile BRAVIA engine enhancement and the White Magic power for improved outdoor visibility. The camera is an 8MP unit and the smartphone is close to a Jelly Bean update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The catch is the Xperia P runs on a less capable chipset and even though it has more internal storage, it has no microSD card for expanding that. At the end of the day the Xperia P will be the more functional smartphone, but the Lumia 620 is the smoother one, and the one to offer the more consistently looking interface, so it's your call really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia P</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the Samsung Galaxy S III mini, which has Jelly Bean out of box. It the same dual-core Cortex-A9 processor as the Xperia P, a 5 MP camera, a Super AMOLED display, microSD card slot for memory expansion and costs the same as the Lumia 620. The latest version of TouchWiz and its Nature UX certainly gives a nice usability and functionality boost to Android, too, though its styling isn't everyone's cup of tea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia chose Windows Phone a while ago. More than a couple of years ago, actually. And looking back, it may have been the wiser choice compared to Android. Today Nokia can price its devices, like the Lumia 620, attractively and hold its WP rivals at arm's length with its exclusive software enhancements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps and Drive play a huge role in Windows Phone but won't make such a big splash on Android where Google provides its excellent Maps app with navigation in quite a lot of countries. On Windows Phone Nokia really has the chance to shine and evade serious internal competition, including the world's leading smartphone maker Samsung. Despite the more than capable Ativ S, Samsung's heart isn't as bent on Windows Phone as it is on Android and is happy to leave the largest part of that to Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until recently Windows Phone was only a bottom-of-ladder alternative to bored smartphone users, which come from iOS or Android. Thanks to the Lumia 620 low price point, it will also be an interesting option to newcomers, who don't have a clear idea which OS is best. So the time is ripe and Windows Phone is approaching the next level and Nokia might finally get a chance to start the fight back and recapture some of its territory.</paragraph>
