			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace can get far with a name like this but it isn?t going any further than its comfortable midrange spot. You know, if you want the best seat in the house you need to move the cat. The Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 is a feline droid ? the black cat in Samsung?s Android portfolio. And it spells bad luck for the competition ? mid-range droids are a force to be reckoned with in the smartphone world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the kind of specs, the Galaxy Ace could have passed for a high-end phone a while back. So, if your processing power and screen estate needs haven?t risen sharply during the past year or so, the Ace will serve you well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, with Froyo on an 800MHz processor, good connectivity and screen size and resolution that were good enough for the first three iPhones, the Samsung Galaxy Ace is looking good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside to the package is the QVGA video @ 15fps. That may be acceptable on a low-end dumbphone but certainly disappointing on a mid-range Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: After a software update, the Galaxy Ace can record VGA videos at 24fps. We've updated the camera section of this review with new samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s what else is going on the Ace?s spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the video is no good, but the still camera should be doing pretty well. Samsung?s refined TouchWiz 3.0 with a document editor and file manager out of the box score good points for the Galaxy Ace too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is pretty compact and we especially like the new rubbery textured back. There?s nothing to worry about in terms of ergonomics or pocketability, but those decidedly iPhone-ish looks are a bit questionable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s about all we can say by just looking at the phone ? and it?s the second time we meet the Samsung Ace. You may as well remember our quick preview from a while back. It?s now time to see how ready the Samsung Galaxy Ace is for the real world and we begin with the hardware.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Galaxy Ace<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 comes in a small box, but the it's quite well stocked. You get a microUSB charger and a separate microUSB cable, a 2GB microSD card with an SD adapter and some manuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a cherry on top too - you get two covers for the back. One is black with a dotted pattern, while the other is smooth, glossy white.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace measures 112.4 x 59.9 x 11.5 mm and the all-plastic handset weighs 113 grams. The edges are curved, which slims down the phone, and the build-quality is good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the compact Star II, it looks much bigger but still reasonably pocket-friendly (it?s smaller than an iPhone).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. We wonder though if the iPhone is pleased. Looking at the front and sides of the two phones you?ll see more similarities than differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs should be pretty familiar too ? a 3.5? screen of HVGA resolution (320x480) for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 has an unimpressive LCD screen. The colors are quite dull and viewing angles are far from perfect. Sunlight legibility leaves a lot to be desired.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness and contrast are not ideal either. Black levels are average, but the maximum brightness is quite low. In turn, the contrast is low too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as touchscreen sensitivity goes we have no complaints ? the screen is responsive enough but not overly sensitive (which can be annoying since it often results in unwanted taps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there is the proximity sensor, which blends well with the surrounding surface. There?s no ambient light sensor though, so the display brightness can?t be adjusted automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there?s an arrangement of three keys, typical for Samsung. The hardware home key is central, with two capacitive buttons on either side ? Menu and Back. The latter two are only visible when backlit ? with the backlighting off, they disappear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The invisible keys make the Galaxy Ace look even more like the iPhone ? of course if you ask Samsung, they would tell you they?ve been after the Galaxy S II look instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left of the Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 there?s the lanyard eyelet and the volume rocker. The volume rocker is quite thin but prominent just enough to use comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key is on the right (as it is on many Samsung phones), which makes it accessible with both the thumb of the right hand or the index finger of the left. This positioning can be uncomfortable for some though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on the right is the microSD card slot, which is under a plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side of the phone is the microUSB port with a retractable lid and the 3.5mm standard audio jack. The USB port is used for both data and for charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone features just the mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung Galaxy Ace has changed since the early version we used in the preview and we really like the new look and feel. The first back cover is black, finely textured surface that?s practically immune to fingerprints and pretty pleasant ? and secure ? to hold. The soft rubbery back cover takes after the Samsung Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second cover in the box is glossy white instead - it's smooth but can get scratched up and covered in fingerprints pretty easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera lens on the back is in the top left corner, along with the LED flash. The lens is exposed and vulnerable to scratches so you?ll have to take care not to damage it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back also features the loudspeaker grill, which has a small nub that keeps the speaker from getting muffled when you place the phone down on a level surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the battery cover is the SIM card slot compartment and the 1350mAh Li-ion battery. It?s quoted at 640 hours of standby (in 2G, 420 h in 3G). Note that those numbers are for standby with Wi-Fi turned off. The Galaxy Ace lasts up to 11 hours of talk time (in 2G, 6 h 30 min in 3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our own measurements show that the Galaxy Ace will last three and a half hours of browsing the Internet over Wi-Fi and just as much when playing video. Standby in a 3G network and with Wi-Fi turned on is a little under six days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs of the Samsung Galaxy Ace are good enough without being top of the line, which is exactly how a mid-range phone should be. The screen is big enough at 3.5? without making the phone unmanageable. The resolution is sufficient for reading text but not too high as to drive the price up and strain the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe that?s how Samsung arrived at roughly the same specs and dimensions as Apple with their original iPhone but still, the design is sure to spur iPhone rip-off jokes. The resemblance to the highly popular Galaxy S II will drive the sales up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Froyo heart, TouchWiz blood<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace S5830 is among the first Froyo-powered smartphones in the Samsung lineup. It comes with the TouchWiz, launcher preinstalled. There are four buttons docked at the bottom of the homescreen, which stay there even when you open the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a short video demo of the Galaxy Ace interface to get us started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The customizations start on the homescreen where you have up to seven panes to populate with widgets but you don?t have to use all the screens all the time. If you need less, deleting the extra ones will speed up navigation. You can zoom out with a pinch gesture to the enter edit mode,where you can add, remove and rearrange the homescreen panes as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area, one of the Android strong points, is the updated variety we saw on the Galaxy S Giorgio Armani - it has five switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and rotation-lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the menu button on the homescreen and then selecting add will let you put more content on your homescreen homescreen (a press and hold on the homescreen does the same trick), add/delete homescreen panes or change the wallpaper. Live wallpapers are supported too, though there is only one preinstalled and you will have to get the rest from the market. The contextual menu has shortcuts too for search, notifications and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically the main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in the vanilla Android). List view is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit the menu just like you do the homescreen: pinch to zoom out and you can add new or re-arrange the current menu panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu has an alternative edit mode, which lets you rearrange and uninstall applications (only those that you have installed and not the preinstalled ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting change in the Android 2.2-compatible version of Samsung?s TouchWiz launcher is the built-in task manager. Complete with a homescreen widget that shows the number of currently active apps, it saves you the need to install a task killer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some benchmarks of the Galaxy Ace:</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The TouchWiz phonebook is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A typical Android smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy Ace has a phonebook with massive functionality and practically unlimited capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset displays the phone memory, SIM-stored and all Google contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you can have all your contacts gathered in one place. You can search the entries by either flick-scrolling the list or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen (courtesy of Samsung and the TouchWiz UI).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace also packs the quick contacts feature, which pioneered on Android 2.1. It lets you use the contact photo in the phonebook and call, text, or email the person with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically multiple accounts for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange, are supported. There are many details that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the main contact list, a swipe to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the message composer. The side-sweep thing is part of the TouchWiz UI and works in other lists too where you have names or numbers (such as the messaging menu).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace handled calls trouble-free. The reception and in-call sound were good and we didn?t experience any dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works like a charm ? the implementation is the same as in every other recent Galaxy out there - it searches both contact numbers and names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is a tab within the dialer. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy Ace. It scored an Average mark. More info on the test itself as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lots of messaging options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS section is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook: a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the name or number and choose from the list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward, delete and lock as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is easy. Adding multimedia content to a text message automatically turns into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or ? depending on your needs ? you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a generic email app as well for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, along with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace comes with the Samsung home-baked keyboard preinstalled. It?s actually much more comfortable (and accurate!) than the often criticized stock Android QWERTY.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you flip the phone on its side, the virtual keyboard automatically switches to the landscape mode, which is much bigger and more comfortable to use. It covers most of the screen however, leaving room for only two lines of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input us also available and works quite good if you are in quieter environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the text input is enhanced by Swype ? we covered it thoroughly in the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S review and we won?t go into so much detail here. Swype is a life-saver on the smaller screens (such as the one of the Ace) ? you don?t have to be very accurate with your swyping, which makes text input faster and easier. It?s only that, much like with any other text prediction method, it has to support the language you want to enter text in.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The gallery still downsizes the images<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace comes with the stock Froyo gallery. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately (again) only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient ? just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you photos can be organized by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go through its folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to multi-touch support pinch zooming is also enabled on the Galaxy Ace but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The player on the Samsung Galaxy Ace can handle 3GP and MP4 video files. DivX/XviD support is missing, but at least we had no problems playing videos at up to WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos wouldn?t play, but that?s overkill on a HVGA display anyway. But you?re not limited to the Galaxy Ace display. Thanks to DLNA you can view photos and videos on compatible hardware ? like TVs or computers with the right software (the latest version of Windows Media player for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface itself is as simple and as it could possibly be ? there almost isn?t one. You can use the Gallery or the My Files app to browse videos. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace has the TouchWiz music player. The sorting options are displayed in a tabbed interface: current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove some of the filters to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Samsung have enabled equalizer presets on the Galaxy Ace along with DNSe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also available. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album. What?s even better, the YouTube search results are loaded straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing missing is the fancy Disc View from the Galaxy S lineup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S5830 did pretty well in our audio output quality test. The thing is great when used with an active external amplifier and decent when a pair of headphones is plugged in, which is better than its price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An active external amplifier lets the Galaxy Ace show its full potential and achieve great scores. Not only is the Samsung smartphone pretty loud, it also has no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the degradation when headphones come into play is pretty severe. Loudness falls down dramatically and the stereo crosstalk raises notably. The intormodulation increases too and the general performance drops from impressive to average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 4 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in to act as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An excellent 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace has a 5 autofocus megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. A LED flash is there to to assist you in low-light scenes. Some extra goodies are also at hand such as face and smile detection and geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is standard Samsung for the most part ? and that?s not a bad thing. It?s easily thumbable and offers readily accessible scene and shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace hasn?t got a proper shutter key so you?ll have to use the virtual on-screen alternative. To activate face detection, you should switch to Smile shot mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is as good as you can expect from a 5MP camera. The contrast is nice as is the color rendering. The amount of captured detail is very high too and the noise levels are kept reasonable. Overall, you get pretty pleasant results with this one, which is something we didn?t expect to see from a device in this class.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the 5MP lineup. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Ace in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace can record QVGA videos at 15fps. This falls into the barely usable category ? OK for MMS, but not much else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the video sample from the Samsung Galaxy Ace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: The Samsung Galaxy Ace received an updated that enabled VGA@24fps video recording. The video quality is decent but not great (it's certainly a welcome upgrade over what it used to be) although the bitrate is low and there are compression artifacts visible. The frame rate holds at a stable 24fps. The videos have mono sound recorded at 64Kbps bitrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample straight from the phone and one we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace is ready for worldwide roaming with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity pacakge offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Buetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo enables Bluetooth file transfers, so there?s little else to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace doesn?t pack much internal memory (158MB is downright low for app installation), but it comes with a microSD slot with supports for cards up to 32GB. Thanks to Android Froyo you can install compatible apps on the SD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Galaxy Ace hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good browser, but without Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is arguably the best available on a mobile device. It?s fast, generally bug-free and easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace browser supports three zoom methods ? dedicated buttons, double tap and multi-touch pinch-zooming. The browser also supports text reflow ? a moment after setting the zoom level, columns of text align to the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is big enough to handle complex pages well, though the text isn?t as sharp at low zoom levels as it is on phones with higher resolution. Regardless, it?s still readable and panning and zooming are fast so the Galaxy Ace scores a good mark in web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the Galaxy Ace is running the Flash-capable Android Froyo, there is no Flash support in the web browser. The situation is quite similar to the LG Optimus One: the processor is either incapable of handling Flash content (or it?s disabled due to performance issues).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace has the YouTube app to partially compensate for the lack of Flash support. Of course, there are plenty of other video sharing sites and sites that use Flash for completely different purposes, but you have to live without them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace comes with the ThinkFree Office pack pre-installed ? it?s a document viewer and an editor combined. It works like a charm and is capable of pinch zooming. Both panning and zooming are fast and the overall performance of the office package is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app is decent and allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. But you don?t have the Stopwatch, the Timer and World Clock options. Still you get a Voice Recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Samsung has included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Few applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung filled the Galaxy Ace with a few of their home-brewed applications and we really appreciate their work. Most of them are quite useful and can be updated via Samsung Apps ? the secondary app repository on your phone. Whenever Samsung updates any of the current apps or widgets, or releases new ones, you?ll find them here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub combines messaging and media sharing ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Your appworld is the Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace is running the latest version of Android and the standard HVGA screen means the phone can make full use of the Android Market (some apps won?t run on low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS the Google way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is on board, complete with Navigation, which can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is still limited though, and it relies on Internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace doesn?t come with a third-party SatNav solution preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace has good features for its price: a decent 3.5? HVGA screen, 800MHz processor, pleasing 5 megapixel camera, good build and, of course, Android 2.2 Froyo. However it fails unexpectedly where inferior phones have been known to deliver: disastrous video recording and poor codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But compromises are always a part of the deal in the midrange. The important thing is to have no regrets about the compromise you made. And the Galaxy Ace is the right phone for the job. It?s also the right phone for Samsung as they seek to update their midrange droid lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace currently costs about 260 euro, which sounds quite fair. And we think you won?t be disappointed if you decide to give it a shot. If you are looking for an affordable Froyo-powered droid, the list of alternatives isn?t too long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus One uses the same chipset as the Galaxy Ace, but its processor is clocked at 600MHz instead. It also has a lower-grade 3 megapixel snapper and a 3.2? HVGA display, both contributing to a more compact body. The Optimus One is also cheaper than the Galaxy Ace and has some headstart.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy 551 is a QWERTY messenger that costs about the same as the Galaxy Ace. It bets on a bit smaller screen with the lower WQVGA resolution, downgraded camera and processor, but comes with a full hardware QWERTY keyboard, which will be appreciated by heavy texters.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Then, there is also the HTC Aria/Gratia (delete as appropriate for your market). Running on Android v2.2 Froyo and keeping the HTC Sense on top those come with HVGA screen, albeit of smaller size. The higher asking price and slower CPUs however makes the HTC duo far less attractive than the Galaxy Ace.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Our last stop in the Android midrange is the Galaxy Mini. A smaller QVGA screen and less impressive camera and CPU will save you a pretty penny. But the Galaxy Mini is as smart as the Ace with Froyo and TouchWiz inside. If you are looking for a cheap droid, the Galaxy Mini is hard to beat.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There?s competition for the Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 outside the droid realm too. The Nokia C6-01 is a similarly priced alternative with a smaller but better screen: it?s ClearBlack AMOLED display. The Nokia smartphone boasts a rich feature set with 8MP still imaging, HD video and free sat nav. Ultimately though, it?s Symbian against Android.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We?ve been all over the Android midrange and the Samsung Galaxy Ace makes even more sense. It?s holding middle ground in an increasingly segmented smartphone market. There?s plenty of space between lower and higher midrange, between a Galaxy Mini and a Galaxy SL. It feels safe to be right in the middle ? and it feels good to have all that space to itself. The Galaxy Ace is not a power player but it?s keen to play.</paragraph>
