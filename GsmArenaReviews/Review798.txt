			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The mobile Firefox OS by Mozilla aims to put the user first, like its namesake web browser, and deliver affordable, capable, open-source phones to the masses. "We're out to make a difference, not a profit", says the project's homepage. A non-profit against corporate giants. A bold statement - but we guess it doesn't mean they are letting Google and Microsoft have it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a number of Firefox OS devices already on the market - both smartphones and tablets - from multiple vendors and carrier deals are in place. So the young OS is already past the baby steps, further along perhaps than any of the other alt-OSes (Sailfish, Ubuntu Touch, the Samsung-backed Tizen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mozilla's mission with Firefox OS is to make the web accessible to everyone. You may not be aware but in developing countries the web is most commonly available on smartphones rather than desktop computers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the main target of Firefox OS is developing markets. The first devices run on relatively low-end hardware, which is surprisingly affordable. The hardware platform of for this review is the ZTE Open C which goes for as little as $70, but our focus is on the OS itself rather than the piece of plastic and silicone, which runs it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Firefox OS is not the only open-source OS in town, market leader Android is open-source too. But you have got to remember that's just the Android Open Source Project or AOSP. What most people call "Android" today heavily relies on a various proprietary Google Play Services, which are anything but open source. Google Play Services is the magic juice behind core functionality you've come to expect from Android - from contact syncing through maps to the app store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android-sans-Google is perhaps usable if you install an open-source app store, but the most popular forks of Android - Amazon's Fire OS and Nokia's controversial X series are both commercial and hence reliant on proprietary tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Firefox OS, on the other hand, is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, best known for the Firefox web browser but also maker of Thunderbird and a vocal advocate of open standards. That's what keeps users from getting locked in corporate walled gardens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OS is built on well-known technologies like HTML5 and JavaScript and Mozilla is working with the W3C and browser makers to standardize the advancements that make Firefox OS possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people-first approach of Firefox OS is bound to earn it some good karma but the market already chewed up and spit out one web-based OS. The legacy of WebOS can be seen in the interfaces of modern smartphone OSes, but WebOS itself is gone. Then there's ChromeOS too, which is confined to laptops but may soon make the jump to tablets with an Android-like UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we look out to the future of Firefox OS, we must first get properly acquainted with it. First introductions are made on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Firefox OS is based on web technologies but that doesn't mean it's like the early days of Chrome OS, just a floating browser window. In fact, Firefox OS looks like a mix of Android and iOS. We're reviewing version 1.3, the latest currently available version but keep in mind these are its Cupcake days (in Android speak) - most smartphone functionality is present, a lot is still missing. What's more important, new features come leaps and bounds. Firefox OS 1.4 is behind the corner, and there is already talk about the Firefox 2.0, which might bring a total revamp of the OS as we see it today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Firefox OS homescreen is based on Everything.me. Everything.me started life as an Android launcher but the Mozilla Foundation is an investor in the project and is using the base tech for both its Firefox OS and corresponding Android launchers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The launcher features multiple pages of shortcuts with a dock at the bottom. What sets it apart from the iOS launcher are the so-called Smart collections - it will automatically group similar apps into categories. Those folder-like groups go in the left-most page of the homescreen (actual folders are not supported).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can hit the "I'm thinking of..." field and type in a query to view all relevant installed apps and web sources. For example, "movies" brings up IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and others. The interface will react to your search, too - the wallpaper will change to something appropriate (say, a movie poster).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what makes this launcher the perfect fit for Firefox OS - it searches not only for apps you have installed, but also lists web sites almost as if they were apps. You can save searches as Smart collections to be readily available later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since native apps are built on the same HTML5 + JavaScript base, a well-designed mobile site will look and behave in Firefox OS just like a native app. And Mozilla is pushing for increased adoption of the new web technologies that enable the advanced features in Firefox OS, which will blur the distinction between a native app and a mobile site even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That promises a bright future, but the current reality is less than ideal. For our movie query we got results like The Hollywood Reporter and CNN Entertainment, which were either broken or nothing like an app. Unfortunately, Firefox OS phones will need to hit a critical mass before site owners put significant resources into OS-specific optimizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we've seen plenty of people comment that they've abandoned Facebook's Android app and use the mobile site instead, so there is some merit to this approach. We shouldn't let a few bad examples taint the whole experience, again these are the early days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Firefox OS has borrowed more from iOS than just the homescreen look. It also relies on a single Home button with on-screen Back buttons that are part of the app. This doesn't work too well because the logic is somewhat erratically applied.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Back button is typically in the top left corner, but sometimes there's no Back button at all. Instead you need to hit a confirmation button (e.g. Done) or an X button in the top right corner instead. Depending on where you are in each app, going back to the previous screen may require some mental effort rather than just an acquired reflex of tapping a specific part of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another gripe we have is that unlike iOS, the Back button is just a small &lt; symbol in the top left and it can be hard to hit accurately. On iOS the target area for that button also covers the label next to it, making it a much bigger target.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's not all, some apps (like Mail) have the "hamburger" menu, which is perhaps familiar to Android users. It's comprised of three horizontal bars stacked vertically in the top left corner where Back usually goes. When you tap it, an additional menu panel slides in from the left. This panel can have a Back button, but it's only for the panel itself and not the app (in E-Mail, it's for navigating multiple accounts).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another complaint we have about the consistency of the UI is that shortcuts don't always use the same icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Firefox OS interface includes a lockscreen. It has a separate wallpaper and a slider at the bottom that either unlocks the phone (right) or launches the camera (left). It shows the date and time, plus recent notifications, but there are no widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you've probably guessed already there are no widgets on the homescreen either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A notification area is a must for a modern OS and Firefox has one. It follows what has already become the de facto industry standard - a list of notifications, which you can swipe to dismiss individually or all at once with the "Clear all button". Interestingly, the event notifications are listed from top to bottom, while some recurring notifications start at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a new notification arrives, it's shown at the top row of the screen, similar to Android L notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also at the bottom are four quick toggles and a Settings shortcut. The toggles are Wi-Fi, Background Data, Bluetooth and Airplane mode, there's no way to change or rearrange them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app switcher is another essential part of the OS interface. It uses large cards that preview the contents of the app. There's a small X button in the top left to dismiss an app but you can also just swipe up to dismiss them. This switcher also needs work, right now the currently selected app takes up almost the entire screen. You can see tiny portions of another couple of cards to the left and right but not enough to tell what those apps are until you swipe to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One cool feature we found in the Developer options is to switch between apps directly by swiping from the left or right edge of the screen. WebOS had and iPad iOS has a similar feature. Note that here the gesture works with only one finger (it's four in iOS) and also doubles as a Back button in the browser (as in iOS).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Performance is determined by two things - the hardware (obviously) and the software environment. Firefox OS is still a very new platform so cross-platform benchmarking will be difficult so we'll stick to browser benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all, Firefox OS apps are based on web technologies. That isn't to say they are slow - the ZTE Open C we used for this review is based on Qualcomm MSM8210 Snapdragon 200, which managed to move the UI with acceptable fluidity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset itself is nothing much, two Cortex-A7 cores at 1.2GHz and Adreno 302 with as little as 512MB RAM. The Open C represents sort of the Firefox mid-range. As we mentioned in the intro, Mozilla wants smartphones as cheap as $25 to ensure everyone can afford one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those will run on an even less capable hardware - the bottom is set at an 800MHz processor and 256MB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Sony Xperia E1 and Nokia X2 are powered by the same chipset and represent the kind of phone the ZTE Open C aim to replace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Open C performed fairly well in Kraken 1.1, a JavaScript benchmark. It was slightly behind the Motorola Moto E, another low-ender powered by dual Cortex-A7, but it beat the Nokia Lumia 630 hands down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hardware performance aside, we ran an HTML5 test to see how much coverage Firefox OS has over new web technologies. It's close behind the desktop Firefox 31 browser but lags a bit compared to Chrome 36 on Android (tested on Nexus 5).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTML5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The base of Firefox OS is founded in web technologies but version 1.3 added two important features - WebGL and asm.js.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WebGL is a wrapper over OpenGL ES 2.0 (the 3D platform used by Android prior to KitKat) so web sites - and web-based apps - have the same degree of control over the GPU as native apps. The Epic Citadel demo has already been ported to WebGL proving it's possible to have great graphics generated by the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asm.js is a bit more difficult to explain - it's a special subset of JavaScript that can be compiled straight into machine code, similar to how the bytecode of Android apps is compiled to native code. The goal is to reach near-native speeds of execution. Browsers that don't support asm.js can still run the code but without the performance benefits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asm.js code isn't written by hand, instead it's generated by tools like Emscripten, which take code written in C and transform it to asm.js-compatible JavaScript. This means developers can use existing C code bases when developing their apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of speed, Mozilla published some benchmarks a year ago showing asm.js getting close to native speed and outperforming Dalvik, which was Android's runtime of choice back then. Of course, Android is transitioning to a new, faster runtime (ART), which is optional in KitKat and already mandatory in Android L. Asm.js has progressed since then, too.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Contacts app feels very familiar if you come from Android. It lists contacts with a photo, names are indexed by letter. There's an alphabet scroll and a search field. Contact display options are limited, you can only set contacts to be sorted by last name instead of first name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact details however are as extensive as you can imagine. You can add multiple phone numbers and emails, addresses (home, work, etc.) and comments. Identical contacts can be linked together, there's an automatic option to find duplicates to help with that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your contact list can be synced with Facebook, which is the only sync option available for now. You can import contacts from Gmail or Outlook, but this is a manual process - you have to hit Import each time you want to update your contact list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not manual in the sense that you have to do much, you just enter user name and password (you'll also be asked to authorize the connection).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can import contacts stored on the memory card too, but that's about it. You can back up contacts to the memory card or send them over Bluetooth, but there's no option to pull contacts from your old phone via Bluetooth. There's no way to push new contacts back to Gmail either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're used to "the cloud" (be it Google's or iCloud or other) syncing our contacts automatically across multiple devices, but we can live with the Import from Gmail option for now. It's even better if you use Facebook. Still, we would have preferred "Sync with Google" over "Sync with Facebook", if we had the choice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dialer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer has smart dialing but it only looks for matching phone numbers and not names (which would have been the more helpful option). If multiple contacts match, the number of matches is displayed along with an arrow to view all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is a tabbed app so you can just jump into the contacts list, however tapping a contact just opens an info screen rather than dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into the Call log tab, which is split into two sub-tabs - All calls and Missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of version 1.3, Firefox OS supports dual-SIM, dual-standby devices but there are none on the market just yet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging app handles both text and MMS and has a design copied straight out of Android. It shows a list of threads with a name, contact photo and time of the last message but there are no extra options here besides mass delete threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you go into an individual thread, the UI becomes more powerful. You can tap the name of the contact, which brings up options to call them or view the full contact info. Just below the name is the phone number and number type (i.e. personal, work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS messages can be created with attached photos, videos and music. MMS support has been improved since its introduction in Firefox OS 1.1, now everything works as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on an individual message lets you delete or forward it. Delivery reports can be enabled in the settings menu and you can have the phone auto-retrieve MMS messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The E-Mail app supports IMAP and POP3 (since OS version 1.3) and setting up our usual Gmail accounts was trouble-free. Multiple accounts are supported but there's no combined inbox. You can view all folders for the email accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can batch-delete messages, flag, move or mark them as read/unread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's no push email support so you have to set up a sync period for each account (manual sync is also an option).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some instant messaging apps available for Firefox OS too. An official LINE app is available as an instant messenger, but little else on the official side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going the unofficial route, there are apps like Loqui IM that promise to handle WhatsApp, Google Hangouts and Facebook Chat messages. Still, we (as users) are a little wary of handing over our account passwords to unofficial apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Twitter client is available right out of the box. It just looks like the mobile site was packaged into an app but it works well enough. The Facebook "app" is actually just a browser shortcut, which is pretty disappointing (we expected more, given the presence of the Facebook sync functionality).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Firefox OS supports third-party keyboards but the default one is the only usable keyboard for now. It supports word suggestion and auto correction, but there are none of the Swipe-like goodies that come as default for Android, iOS and Windows Phone keyboards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add more than one input language but the selection is pretty thin right now - Western Europe is somewhat covered but that's it (essentially Latin letters plus diacritics where necessary).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that bugs us about the keyboard is that it's always in all-caps. We prefer Android's approach of switching between upper and lower case. The long press is underutilized too, it's only used for characters with diacritics, but there are no numbers or punctuation signs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major flaw of Firefox OS's editing options is that you can't select text - that means no copy/paste either! Those are usual growing pains for each OS, but the competitors already went through this stage, so Firefox needs to catch up and quickly at that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera and gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera app is quite basic, it has separate photo and video modes and can store geotagging information but that's it. If the hardware supports it, the Firefox OS camera can do Continuous autofocus too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI has an interesting feature - it shows the photos you've snapped since you started the camera as a film strip on the left of the screen. Those are cleared when you exit the app. Tapping a photo thumbnail opens it in the gallery, there's an additional gallery shortcut below the on-screen shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app is fairly basic - it displays a grid of thumbnails, sorted by month, with shortcuts to the camera and multi-select mode. You can delete or share photos one by one or in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a photo adds the option to edit photos but the editor is pretty barebones. It can adjust the brightness of an image, crop, apply color effects or do an automatic enhancement. Basics like rotation, contrast adjustment, sharpening and so on are not available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the Camera and Gallery, the multimedia apps of Firefox OS provide the basic functionality and little else. The Music player sorts your library by artist or album, it also supports playlists including several automatically generated (recently added, most/least played, highest rated).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art covers most of the now playing interface, the only options here besides the regular playback controls are repeat and shuffle toggles, plus a rating bar for the track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the music player is on there are controls on the lockscreen and in the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no DLNA support or an equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio, if available on your hardware, has a simple but fairly unintuitive UI. You can star your favorite stations, they will appear in a list starting at the bottom of the screen. This list lets you quickly switch between them but be careful to tap on the frequency text as tapping on the star next to it will remove the station from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no RDS support but the radio can play through the loudspeaker (you still need to have the headphones connected, their cable is the antenna). Note that lack of RDS could be due to the hardware.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player interface lists available videos sorted by date, just like the gallery. Once again you get the option to mass delete files or share several at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Codec support will obviously heavily depend on the hardware that Firefox OS is running on. The ZTE Open C we used for this review handled sub-HD MP4 files but that was it (some had issues with the sound).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Firefox OS supports dual-SIM, dual-standby connectivity as mentioned earlier but there are no such devices yet. Support was added only recently with version 1.3 but given the platform's focus on developing markets dual-SIM phones can't be far away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi features include Wi-Fi Direct for file transfers and hotspot functionality. Firefox phones can also share their internet connections with a PC via the USB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is supported all the way to version 4.0 and it's possible to send files over Bluetooth (that took certain OSes more than one major generation). NFC is also supported for easy paring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port on Firefox phones is used for data transfers with a computer too. It connects in mass storage mode, making file management quite easy. Practically all recent Android phones use MTP, which doesn't work as smoothly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This, however, means that apps can't access the phone's storage while it's hooked up to a computer. The internal memory and the microSD card have separate options for USB sharing so you can connect only the one you need and leave the other available to apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Firefox OS uses the eponymous browser, which is a key part of the platform. Unlike its desktop and Android versions, however, the browser does not yet support add-ons, which is a Firefox staple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is streamlined and it looks just like the Android version of the browser. There's an URL bar on top with the tab switcher in the top right corner (it shows the number of open tabs). The bottom row of the screen shows the basic controls - Back, Forward, Share and Favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New tabs show thumbnails with recently visited sites, but there's no option to remove unwanted ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser lacks many other features too - there are no incognito tabs, no find on page, no saving pages for offline use, no Flash support, not even an option to sync open tabs with other devices (the Android app has it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only options in the Settings menu are clear browsing history and cookies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall we were pretty disappointed as the Firefox OS browser feels undercooked - the Mozilla team already has a feature-rich mobile app for Android, while this one lacks key features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The pre-installed app selection is spotty but it does cover the basics. The calendar app can sync with multiple online accounts from Google, Yahoo! and others (as long as they support the CalDAV protocol). The Month view splits the screen between days of the month and an agenda for the selected day. Calendar accounts are color-coded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the phonebook, the calendar app is capable of sending information back to Google's servers so it's not a one-directional sync (and it's automatic to boot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app keeps things organized into separate notebooks. You can attach multiple images to each note. Hitting the Share button creates an email and copies over the text, unfortunately attached images do not go through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app has analog and digital views and lets you set up multiple alarms. Each alarm can have its own ringtone, snooze and repeat. The app also features a timer and a stopwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Firefox OS has co-opted Nokia's HERE Maps for its default mapping solution. There are both map and satellite views available and you can also enable public transport and live traffic views (where available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Maps can plan routes for cars and pedestrians, public transport routes are also supported in some countries. Keep in mind this is just route planning, there's no voice-guided navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline use. Before you hit the Download button, HERE Maps will show a preview of the maximum zoom level. This feature doesn't download the full map details, but even so the download can run into tens of megabytes per city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have only one offline map saved at a time and you need an active data connection to plan routes even inside the saved area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One app that will certainly be useful going forward is Software update. It automatically checks for updates (you can do it manually, too) and handles download and installation. The update history keeps track of installed updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Firefox OS has a Power Save Mode, which can turn on automatically at a preset battery charge threshold (5%, 15% or 25%). This mode disables data, Bluetooth and geolocation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Firefox Marketplace<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A rich app store is one of the most important features of every smartphone OS. The Marketplace is where you get Firefox OS apps and the good news is you don't need an account like with other app stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default view shows featured apps and a list of popular and new. You can also browse the store by category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app selection is slim at the moment, but some high-profile apps are already available. We've covered Twitter and Line already, but we also found Box (the cloud file sync utility), Airbnb, Soundcloud, games like Candy Crush and Cut the rope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app store also offers an Office document viewer (which supports Office 2007 files), a file manager and voice-guided navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before installing apps there's no list of permissions, but you will be asked about individual permissions as they are required by the app. A nice feature lacking in Android and iOS is that you don't have to grant permanent permissions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can review app permissions from the settings menu where you can change the previous settings. You can set them to Grant, Deny or Ask. Overall, Firefox OS provides great granularity when it comes to permissions, but we still think it would be more user-friendly to see the permissions required by the particular app before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another privacy-minded feature is Do Not Track. This feature tells apps (and any advertising platforms they might use) that you do not wish to be tracked. Keep in mind that this feature doesn't guarantee your choice will be respected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If we have to bluntly summarize this review, we'd say that Firefox OS is still undercooked but capable enough of serving a light user. Remember that version 1.0 of the OS was released in February last year, it's a toddler compared to iOS and Android, even Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interfaces of the three major smartphone OSes are converging - they share the concepts of notification areas, functional lockscreens and more. Firefox OS is no exception, it feels like Android with heavy iOS influences (MIUI comes to mind).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OS has been evolving at a fairly rapid pace, but it remains to be seen how it will handle updates. Android phones often get left behind whether it's because their makers, their carriers or their chipset vendors lost interest. Unfortunately, the only way to find out is wait a year (or two, or three) and find out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another big issue is the app store - the Marketplace already has a couple of high-profile apps, but many are still missing. The "mobile site as an app" approach is a band aid but, as we found out, not cure-all. Again, at less than two years old, this is not unexpected but the Nokia X app selection felt richer at launch (even though Microsoft recently flushed the platform down the drain).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, Mozilla isn't trying to get everyone on Instagram with $25 phones, instead the goal of Firefox OS is to provide vital access to the Internet, the information hub of the 21st century. Whether it's accessing local market prices, reading Wikipedia or staying in touch with friends at home and abroad, there's certainly a place for a highly affordable but capable smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia was trying to push Asha as the platform for "the next billion" but Asha was never as good as Firefox OS is now - not the hardware it ran on, not the web browser, not even the app selection. And Asha, much like Nokia X, is dead as part of Microsoft's new strategy for mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is part of the promise Mozilla is making with Firefox OS - it's open source and developed by a non-profit, meaning it won't (at least it shouldn't) be bought off and killed off by a corporation for the sake of financial interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The open source, Linux-based Ubuntu OS was trying to break into smartphones but it hasn't made a splash, especially with securing hardware manufacturers and carrier deals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mozilla Foundation has those in place and devices out in the market - smartphones and tablets, soon maybe Smart TVs too. With over 1 million Firefox OS phones already sold the platform is a modest success (the target for 2014 is 10 million). While it will never put commercial OSes out of business, it sure has a shot at a bright future.</paragraph>
