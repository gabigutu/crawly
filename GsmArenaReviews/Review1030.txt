			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Modern smartphones are essential tools for urbanites, but they are usually left behind on a trip to the great outdoors. Not the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 though, it will gladly join in the adventure and isn't afraid of a few knocks or a dive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What sets the Galaxy Xcover 2 apart from most other phones is the IP67 certification. The first digit, the 6, means that the phone is completely dust tight and won't let anything inside, even if you take it through the dirtiest, dustiest places. The second digit, the 7, is for water resistance. The Xcover 2 can survive under up to 1m of water for as long as 30 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xcover 2 will make the dive worthwhile too - it can take 720p underwater footage @ 30fps with its 5MP camera. Here are the rest of the highlights of the phone, plus some low points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs are not top-of-the-line, especially considering that the sleek Sony Xperia V and Xperia Z are also waterproof, but you wouldn't want to risk an expensive flagship in the wild anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean at launch. It has TouchWiz 5.0 and Nature UX on top of that so you basically get the same great software package that the Samsung Galaxy S II has right now (and very close to that of the Galaxy S III).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A notable, but easily overlooked feature is the Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity. This Bluetooth revision represents an ultra-low-energy wireless connection, designed to stay constantly on. If you haven't figered it put so far, it is really popular with the latest batch of training body sensors. The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 comes with an app to track your workouts with a Polar Bluetooth heart rate monitor, but other sensors - heart rate, cadence, etc. - typically come with free Android apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other important considerations for a handset with such an outgoing personality (pun intended) would be the sunlight legibility of the screen, the battery life, the beefy storage for a large music collection, and GPS positioning, too. That's because the Galaxy Xcover 2 is more likely to be used for hiking, running, at the beach or even at a construction site, rather than at the cozy confines of an office (where something like the Galaxy S III mini would be the better choice).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first two, screen and battery, we'll be looking at in the following hardware chapter and only then we'll see how good the Xcover 2 is in handling its more sophisticated smartphone alter ego.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>No specialty tools in the retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung included only the essentials with the Galaxy Xcover 2. There's a charger, of course, plus a microUSB cable and a single-piece headset. Good thing that the phone is self-reliant, because it's not getting any special accessories.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S7710 Galaxy Xcover 2 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7710 Galaxy Xcover 2 is not the most compact device, even with a 4" screen. At 130.5 x 67.7 x 12 mm, and a weight of 148.5g, it's bigger and heavier than a Sony Xperia V, which has a 4.3" screen. Guess that IP67 certification takes its toll (the Xperia V has IP57).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 is a rugged phone and it looks the part. Almost every surface besides the screen is textured or ribbed for extra grip, making sure the phone won't slip even off wet hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It probably won't be voted the best looking phone ever, but it's attractive in its own way, especially if you're tired of Samsung's recent trend of recreating the Galaxy S III design in all possible sizes. More importantly it's practical, it has more physical keys that we're used to seeing lately and those will work even if your fingers are wet or covered in gloves (which capacitive keys and screens will not).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fingerprints are not a problem for the Xcover 2, instead it has to worry about dirt getting caught in all those patterns and grooves. It's a good thing you can always run it under the faucet and rinse it clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To ensure that the phone is watertight, every port is covered by a special plastic flap that plugs the hole to make sure the contacts inside are safe. The back of the phone even has a lock that keeps the back panel securely in place - you'll need a coin or something similar to undo the lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would have been easier to seal the battery altogether - in fact, most other water-resistant phones go this route - so we commend Samsung on keeping the option to swap out the battery and giving easy access to the miniSIM and microSD card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, back to the buttons. Below the screen there's the standard trio of Menu, Home and Back. They are physical keys (so they work with gloves) and their patterned surface will keep your finger from slipping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we have the earpiece, as well as a proximity sensor. There's an ambient light sensor too to control automatic brightness. There's a VGA front facing camera as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece grille is watertight, which has a slight effect on the audio quality, but sound during calls is good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is at the top of the phone. It's covered by a protective flap that you'll have to open when you want to use a headset - an unavoidable consequence of the phone's water resistant qualities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom are the microUSB port, covered by a similar flap. There's a tiny slot here used for removing the back cover. We found that it's easier to do with the flap open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 are made of metal and are ribbed to improve your grip on the phone. The volume rocker is on the left and the volume up button can be set to turn on the LED light (volume down turns it off or you can have it turn off automatically after a set period of time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key and the camera shutter key are on the right. Those are important as capacitive screens do not work under water. Instead you can snap photos and videos with the shutter key and lock the phone when you're done.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality (contd.)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera lens is on the back, a single LED flash and the loudspeaker grill at its sides. The camera lens is slightly recessed, but it still might get damaged if it hits an edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the rear cover and the battery itself are the miniSIM and microSD card slots. The battery is a 1,700mAh unit - we would have fancied a larger capacity, but our tests show that even this one does a reasonable job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our array of battery tests on the Samsung Galaxy Xcover and gave it an endurance rating of 48 hours. In the individual categories, it lasted just over 10 hours when calling on a 3G network, a bit over 6 and a half hours of web browsing over Wi-Fi and 7 and a half hours for video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get more details about the Xcover 2's battery performance at our blog and find out more details on how we test the phone's battery life over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rounded corners make the phone comfortable to hold and we already mentioned the grip-enhancing patterned back and ribbed sides. It's not a small device by any means, nor is it lightweight, but you should have no problems pocketing the phone (especially if you're wearing a comfy pair of pants).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not something we'd strap on an arm band and go running though, so wireless headphones are a good idea if you want to listen to music while you jog. A wired headset is also an option, if you don't mind the wires sticking out of your pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 has a 4" LCD screen of WVGA resolution. That gives it a reasonable pixel density of 233ppi (the Galaxy S II and S II Plus have 216ppi). The glass covering the screen is scratch resistant but not Gorilla Glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped a photo of the display with our digital microscope. It shows a standard LCD RGB matrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has good viewing angles - colors are unaffected, while contrast suffers only at extreme angles. Unfortunately, neither colors, nor contrast are particularly good on this screen to start with. Colors aren't very saturated, which further brings down the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is very reflective, which is a problem for outdoor use. Indoors, the contrast is not bad actually, but bright light has a negative impact on the sunlight legibility.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nature UX ready to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean out of the box, skinned with the latest TouchWiz launcher, dubbed Nature UX. The user interface is basically identical to that of the Galaxy S III mini and the S II Plus: they have the same Android version and screen resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the obvious benefits to the user experience compared to stock Android, a clearly midrange handset takes advantage of the same premium combination that powers the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've shot a brief video showing off the user interface here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a standard "tap and drag in any direction to unlock" affair and there're ripples accompanied by water-drop sound as you drag your finger. There are a number of unlock routines to choose from: motion, face and voice among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're three customizable lockscreen shortcuts (down from five on the big S III and Note II), and you can drag one to activate the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock at the bottom of the homescreen fits five custom shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one always opens the app drawer, but the other four can be set to any shortcut or even a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and manage homescreen panes - add, delete or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use widgets that cover an entire pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is quite feature-rich and offers quick toggles for Wi-Fi, GPS, Silent mode, Screen rotation, Bluetooth. You can swipe to the side to get even more: Mobile data, Blocking mode, Power saving and Sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the brightness slider (there's no automatic brightness toggle here though). There is also a couple of other useful things like the Settings shortcut in the upper right corner, the time/date to its left and the carrier name at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Jelly Bean, notifications can be expanded to show more info. They can be expanded and collapsed with a two-finger swipe and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer accommodates both app shortcuts and widgets. Unlike stock Android, you cannot move between tabs by swipes - you have to explicitly hit the widget tab. Some will find this more logical (scrolling past the available apps to find yourself in the widgets is not as intuitive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using pinch-to-zoom reveals an overview of the pages and lets you rearrange them, but you can't create new ones. Hitting the menu key reveals some more options, including hiding apps or enabling tap-to-uninstall mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has three view modes: a Customizable grid (where you can freely rearrange icons), Alphabetical grid and Alphabetical list (this one makes shortcuts easy to hit, but isn't very space efficient). You can also view just the downloaded apps by hitting the Downloaded apps icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jelly Bean comes with a selection of widgets, with some custom additions by Samsung. Some widgets are resizable too - a feature we've seen in some custom UIs is available natively in Jelly Bean. Widgets automatically move out of the way when you're reorganizing the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a Ice Cream Sandwich-style vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. A sideways swipe removes the app from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three buttons at the bottom of the list - one to bring out Samsung's home-brewed task manager, one to launch Google Now and a 'Kill all apps' button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nature UX on top of Android 4.1 looks great and the Galaxy Xcover 2 does pack most of the cool software tricks of the flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And despite the lack of a quad-core chipset, the Galaxy Xcover 2 handles the heavy Samsung skin equally well. It wouldn't choke on a heavy live wallpaper either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 packs roughly double the processing power of its predecessor with a dual-core 1GHz processor (Cortex-A9 cores), 1GB of RAM and Mali-400MP GPU. It also enjoys the benefits of running Jelly Bean with Google's optimizations to the graphical stack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already know that Cortex-A9 isn't the speediest processor core, especially at just 1GHz. It's no match for Krait-based designs, but it can still effectively compete against phones in its price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compound benchmarks like AnTuTu and Quadrant put it in the lower mid-range, which is what we expected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mali-400MP is usually good enough for WVGA resolutions and both NenaMark 2 and Epic Citadel show framerates of over 30fps (both render at screen resolution). Epic Citadel in particular is based on the Unreal Engine 3 (Unreal engines are fairly popular among phone game devs) and it shows the real-world performance to be expected of the Galaxy Xcover 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark 2.1 and 2.5 run the tests off-screen (at 720p and 1080p resolutions respectively) so the physical screen resolution doesn't matter and we can compare raw GPU power. The Xcover 2 doesn't do too well here, but with a WVGA screen it won't have any problems (unless someone makes a game that's more resource-heavy than Epic Citadel, but we think that's unlikely in the near future).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has room for everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook packs an incredibly wide range of features and virtually unlimited storage capacity. There are four tabs on top accommodating the Phone app, Groups, Favorites and Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has kept the swipes in the phonebook, enabling quick dialing (right swipe) or sending a text (left swipe). The Quick contacts feature is there too, displaying, upon a tap of the contact picture, a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all available details, across two tabs. The first one is the About tab, with the person's photo on top. If configured, the right tab displays their latest updates from social networks or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. If the phonebook finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt joining them. Furthermore, there is a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has even added a built-in reject list. You choose a specific vibration pattern too as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like in the previous version of TouchWiz UI 4.0, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes any unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from those sources as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with smart dialing, voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call quality of the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 is reasonable, considering the IP-certification has had an effect on the audio. The earpiece is one of the potential weak spots in a gadget that claims dust-tightness and water resistance. Reception is problem-free though and we didn't suffer dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works as advertised - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature that the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 offers is Direct Call, which lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message. Smart alert will vibrate the phone when you pick it up, if there are any missed calls or messages. You can, of course, use the old flip to mute gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Xcover 2. It managed a Good mark, so it should be loud enough for most situations. The vibration could have been stronger though. More about our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call. There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box grows as much as it needs to - it can fill the entire screen (above the on-screen keyboard that is), expanding up to 10 lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can schedule a message to be sent automatically at a later point in time. There's a list of all scheduled messages in case you need to cancel or send a message ahead of time manually. You can also mark certain numbers as "spam", in case some automatic promo texts get pushy, and lock messages to prevent their deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox. Another cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online and messages are displayed as usual, or you can switch to a Gmail-like conversation view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Xcover 2 also features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each email account, the app gives you security options (e.g. encrypting outgoing email and signing it with a private key) and a sync schedule, which can be set to check for new mail more often during "peak schedule" (you can pick the days of the week and start and end times when "peak schedule" is active).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. There's also Samsung's own ChatOn service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input - keyboard, gesture and voice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 comes with several text input options. You have the traditional QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode (which is a little cramped) and landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a handful of clever tricks that this keyboard can offer. You can swipe left and right to switch between letters and symbols or you can enable "Continuous input", which lets you input words by swiping over the keyboard (yes, like Swype).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like swiping your finger around but Continuous input isn't your thing, you can try using the handwriting recognition. It's quite accurate too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 has very advanced text prediction features to minimize typos. If you allow it, it will scan through your emails, Facebook posts and Twitter posts and learn how you write (which words you use more often and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option shows you a list of all recent items in the clipboard (both text and images) that you can quickly paste. This is great as it lets you juggle multiple copied items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, use voice input and, since the Xcover 2 is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, this will work even if the phone is offline as long as you have downloaded the required language package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock gallery with a pinch of TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 comes with the default Jelly Bean Gallery which, as you'd imagine, has been treated to some TouchWiz flavor. It opens up in Album view, which is what we're used to seeing. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Album view, photos can also be sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces) and Group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the bottom of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, as well as customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a photo with people's faces in it, the Galaxy Xcover 2 will try to detect them automatically (and you can manually highlight faces where it fails). Buddy photo share will use your contacts' profiles to try and recognize people automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social tag makes sure that whenever a face is recognized in the photo, their status message appears and you can easily call or message that contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with SoundAlive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Xcover 2 employs the same TouchWiz-ed music player as the Galaxy S III. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. The company also uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music is sorted into various categories and one of the options, called Music square, is quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony Ericsson phones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and places those tracks on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to skip songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Xcover 2 player is DLNA-enabled, so you're not limited to tracks on your handset - songs on devices connected to your Wi-Fi network are as easy to get to as locally stored songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've enabled the Motion gestures, you can mute and pause a track by placing the phone face down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Okay video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which lists DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Xcover 2 features Pop up play - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone with the video on. You can pinch-zoom the video window to adjust its size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three view modes for how the video fits the screen (fit to screen, fill screen, 100% resolution). The SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung droids usually have excellent video players, but this one wasn't quite up to par. It can't play 1080p videos, but more importantly, it lacks support for MKV files. It sticks to MP4 and AVI (and some XviD files didn't play smoothly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you tweak the viewing experience out of the screen by adjusting video brightness, Auto play next, play speed, SoundAlive and enable subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 did win some points for its subtitles support. It scans for all available subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS, broadcast recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Xcover 2 is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 12 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it acts as the antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Express did quite well in our audio quality test. The smartphone couldn't impress us with its volume levels in either of the test scenarios, but it had a nicely clean output, which is still a good achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier the Xcover 2 managed very good scores all over the field, with the average volume levels the only thing that might make you frown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There was next to no drop in quality when we plugged in a pair of headphones either. Stereo crosstalk increased and an undetectable amount of distortion crept in, but the rest of the readings remained quite good. The volume levels remained low though, though, which is the only thing about the Xcover 2 output that might make you frown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very good 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7710 Galaxy Xcover 2 comes with a 5MP camera that shoots stills at up to 2560 x 1920. It has an LED flash to assist it in low light scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is virtually the same as on the Galaxy S III. On the right there's the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, you get several controls and the good news is that you can pick any four shortcuts to put there - its let you easily have all frequently used features just a tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fifth shortcut always points to Settings. You can also move the icons around to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Xcover 2 has an extensive set of features: touch focus, smile shot, continuous shot, panorama and can snap photos during video recording (but at only 720p resolution, basically a frame from the video). What's missing is HDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's in line with what the Galaxy S II Plus and the Express have, but the Xcover 2 one ups them with Aqua mode. When you turn it on, it reminds you to close all flaps and that the touchscreen will not work under water. After that, you're free to shoot photos and videos with the hardware shutter key. Just make sure you don't go too deep or stay too long (the official promise is that the Xcover 2 will survive at up to 1m of water for up to 30m).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>5MP doesn't sound particularly exciting, but the Galaxy Xcover 2 has one of the better 5MP shooters we've seen. It will give even some 8MP cameras a run for their money. The level of detail is great as is contrast. Highlights tend to get overexposed but nothing out of the ordinary. Colors are too subdued for our liking, but you can adjust that from the camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 has plenty of 5MP shooters to compete with in our Photo compare tool. The tools page gives you info on what to look out for. You'll notice a big pink spot that's quite visible in the first chart (you can see it in the second chart too). The third chart under artificial lighting looks okay.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface of the Galaxy Xcover 2 is nearly identical to the still camera's - you get the same customizable panel on the left with five shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera tops out at 720p resolution at 30fps. Videos are recorded in MP4 files with 12Mbps bitrate and mono sound (128Kbps bitrate, 48kHz sampling rate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera left a good impression and 12Mbps is plenty for 720p (some phones try to cram 1080p in that much bitrate), but the overall results are less than stellar. Fine detail is on the low side and there are jaggies on diagonal edges. Still, videos are smooth and quite usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do wish Samsung had included a 60fps mode, which would be great for action-packed mountain biking videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here's a sample of what the Galaxy Xcover 2 can do in video mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out this untouched video sample, straight from the phone - 720p@30fps (0:16, 23.5MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 enters the video quality comparison tool as an HD-capable contender. The pink spot is back (check it out in the third chart). Low-light shooting isn't the Xcover 2's strength as it turns out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 has the standard set of connectivity features - quad-band 2G and dual-band 3G with 14.4Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers b/g/n with Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA is also part of the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 LE, which builds on Bluetooth 3.0 with the efficient Low Energy mode. It has better range and uses less energy than previous iterations and is becoming quite popular with training accessories (like heart rate monitors and cadence sensors), elbowing out ANT+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xcover 2 has a built-in A-GPS receiver that also works with GLONASS. With both global positioning systems, you get more satellites available, which improves lock times and accuracy both in the urban jungle and in an actual jungle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tweaked Jelly Bean browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 has a tweaked version of the Jelly Bean Android browser, but Chrome also comes pre-installed, if that's what you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the default browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. You can also switch to a more minimalist UI, which currently is in a Lab stage. It disables most of the browser's user interface and gives you a quick five-button layout to access the basics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 comes with a number of cool apps preinstalled. The one glaring omission is an Office document editor - perhaps Samsung finally came to terms with the sheer amount of free office editors available on the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner is a skinned calendar that is easy to use with your fingers. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, month, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner app can sync with multiple calendars and you can switch off individual ones to reduce the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled its new S Cloud service on the Galaxy Xcover 2. It can sync contacts, calendar and S memos and back up logs, messages (SMS and MMS) and the wallpaper. You can choose not to back up some of those things and you can set up automatic backups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app features is laid out across five tabs, each with a different function. The first tab lets you create multiple alarms (each with a distinct repeat time and ring tone), then there are the World clock, stopwatch, timer and desk clock tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator features big buttons, but you can enable one-handed operation to make things more manageable. The text size is adjustable and if you flip the phone horizontally, you get some advanced math functions too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app lets you browse all the files in your phones' memory or on an attached microSD card. The app is launched automatically when you hook up a USB mass storage device (a USB drive, another phone, an SD card etc), which we find to be a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 comes with the Cardio Trainer app preloaded. The app can track your workouts by using the phone's accelerometer and GPS. And it's not just running - you can do anything from walking, through biking (even stationary biking), to aerobics and badminton. The app can connect via Bluetooth 4.0 to a Polar heart rate monitor to get better data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It automatically shuffles all songs in your music collection to provide a soundtrack for your workout and can track you on a map or pull stats like distance, steps, calories and so on. At the end of the workout, it will show how much you've burned by comparing it to the energy value of food.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stats about your workouts can be uploaded to noom.com. They are protected by a pass code that you can only get on your phone, so your personal data is safe.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps with offline caching<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start (it supports GLONASS for faster, more accurate locks too). You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android Jelly Bean, the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 has access to the latest apps and the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space. Keep in mind though that some apps might have issues with JB at first, but those should be ironed out soon enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7710 Galaxy Xcover 2 is a niche product - sitting at the intersection between people who need a rugged phone (be it for work or for play) and the people who need a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a major upgrade over the original Galaxy Xcover and since it's been nearly two years since that came out, users might be more than willing to upgrade. New users shouldn't be deterred by the Xcover's focus on toughness - the Galaxy Xcover 2 is as capable as a smartphone as the Galaxy S III mini and in Samsung's books the latter was good enough to carry the Galaxy S brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're willing to take the extra bulk, the Xcover 2 can take the role of your primary phone and do it well. And when you take it to the beach or up the mountain, you won't have to fear the elements damaging your precious smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a phone called Galaxy Rugby Pro I547, which is very similar to the Xcover 2. It has a MIL-STD-810G certification instead of IP67, but those are roughly equivalent. The Rugby Pro ups the processing power with a 1.5GHz dual-core Krait processor and the 5MP camera can shoot 1080p video. The screen is still at 4" WVGA, but it's a Super AMOLED (PenTile) instead of LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The faster CPU and better video recording sure sound sweet, but the Galaxy Rugby Pro is unfortunately available only on AT&amp;T in the US and there's no global equivalent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Rugby Pro I547</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo A660 is a direct competitor to the Galaxy Xcover 2 and isn't locked into a carrier. It has an IP67 rating, a 4" WVGA LCD screen, a dual-core 1GHz processor and a 5MP camera. It only runs ICS, but it's pretty cheap - you can find it as low as $200 and that's a great deal for this sort of specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Lenovo A660</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has an IP67-certified phone too - the Xperia go has similar processing power under the hood, a 5MP / 720p camera and is noticeably lighter and more compact than the Xcover 2. That's partly due to the smaller screen - it's only 3.5 inches. With HVGA resolution it's not as sharp though and the Android version is lagging behind (stuck on ICS for now).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia go</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're willing to take a step down in the IP rating to IP57 (still water resistant, but not as dust resistant), Sony also has to offer a trio of Xperias that go from upper mid-range to flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First is the Sony Xperia acro S with a 4.3" 720p screen, 12M / 1080p camera and a 1.5GHz dual-core Scorpion processor. Then the Sony Xperia V steps up to a 13MP / 1080p camera and 1.5GHz dual-core Krait processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's Sony's reigning flagship, the Sony Xperia Z. It has a 5" 1080p screen for a whopping 441ppi pixel density, a 1.5GHz quad-core Krait processor (more RAM and better GPU too) and a 13MP camera with HDR video mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia acro S ? Sony Xperia V ? Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can see the Samsung S7710 Galaxy Xcover 2 doing well in the construction business and the like. In this day and age, email has to be checked constantly along with all the other means of communication and a rugged feature phone won't cut it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's great for the dedicated camper or beachgoer too, who would appreciate a phone that saves a lot of hassle being dust tight and water resistant. Just don't let it end up like that fitness gear you bought and only used once.</paragraph>
