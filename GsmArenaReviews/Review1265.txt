		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket all set on the launch pad. Announced together with the HTC Vivid, the smartphone is among the first LTE enabled devices, compatible with AT&amp;T?s all new LTE network. The smartphone is certainly a welcome addition to the U. S. Samsung Galaxy S II lineup, as LTE was the only connectivity flavor missing in the lineup so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you find the device looks somewhat familiar, there is a good reason for it. The Skyrocket is almost 100% identical to the T-Mobile Galaxy S II, which we came to like quite a lot. The handset has the same size and uses the same hardware, save for two major differences. First, the Skyrocket does not have NFC connectivity out of the box, even though it is capable of it. The second is much easier to notice ? it is the LTE radio on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Galaxy S II purists might scoff at the presence of the Qualcomm-made CPU on board (the Exynos is still the fastest dual-core silicon we have seen), we must point out that it is the reason why the smartphone is capable of working on 4G networks. As always, you will find the rest of the Skyrocket?s key features below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can probably notice above, the phone has more than one can possibly need in terms of sheer specs. The only major letdown we can think of is the WVGA resolution of the Skyrocket?s screen. At a time when HD screens begin to pop up with increasing frequency, we do believe that an Android flagship should be offering more than 800x480 pixels of resolution. The Super AMOLED Plus unit of the Skyrocket however, still trounces most of the competition with superior contrast and viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, we are now going to kick things off with an unboxing and a hardware inspection of the Galaxy S II Skyrocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket is as complete as it gets these days. Inside, you will find a charger and a USB cable, a pair of high quality earbuds, and the usual booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microSD card is missing but, given the massive amount of built-in storage, it is an excusable omission.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket has kept the measures of its T-Mobile relative. At 130 x 69 x 9.5 mm and 130 grams of weight, it is not the smallest device out there, but there is a lot of smartphone packed in its body. In our experience with it, we found it to be quite pocketable and light for its size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Galaxy S II Skyrocket is on par with the rest of the Samsung made, upper echelon Android devices. High quality plastic is predominant, with a metal bezel surrounding the edges, and a Gorilla Glass covered front of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One unpleasant surprise we encountered was the lack of texture on the plastic back cover of the smartphone ? a well known Galaxy S II signature. This makes the device quite slippery and accident prone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all black color scheme of the Skyrocket makes it look pleasantly understated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.52? Super AMOLED Plus screen of the Skyrocket is business as usual. Gorgeous colors and great contrast, along with superb viewing angles come with it. The only drawback here is the low pixel density and the WVGA resolution. The simply do not fit the rest of the spec sheet these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an upside however, to having a lesser resolution screen - it results in better performance of the handset, as the CPU has less pixels to deal with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the large screen, you will find four touch-sensitive buttons ? just like in the rest of the U.S. lineup of Galaxy S II devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece, ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the 2MP front-facing camera unit are located in the area above the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket features the volume rocker. The volume keys double as zoom lever in camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, there is no dedicated camera button on the right side of the smartphone. We believe that a camera unit this capable surely deserves one, as the virtual shutter key is far from perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there is a 3.5mm audio jack on the top of the device. In addition to it, you will find second microphone which is used for active noise cancelling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port at the bottom is used for both data connections and charging. Not only does it support USB host but it also comes with MHL enabling HDTV-out connectivity with the proper adapter. The mouthpiece completes the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MHL is a way of using both microUSB and HDMI through the same port. It makes sense, especially provided an HDMI port could?ve been near impossible to put in a phone this slim. The downside is you need an adapter to use a regular HDMI cable with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Skyrocket is where the 8 megapixel Full HD-capable camera lens is located. Right under it is the LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grille is also on the back of the device. It is located on the slightly elevated chin at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the paper thin battery cover reveals the SIM compartment, the 1850 mAh battery and the microSD card slot. The card slot can take microSD cards of up to 32GB, which can give you a maximum total storage of 48GB. Interestingly enough, both the SIM and microSD cards are hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1850 mAh battery made it easily through a day of heavy usage which included about an hour of web browsing, an hour of phone calls, as well as a serious amount of video game play. Lasting for two full days is a bit of a stretch if you are a power user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Skyrocket is a pleasurable experience most of the time. Our only grievance here is the lack of texture on the back of the device. We found ourselves being extra careful when playing around with the handset.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Android Gingerbread and TouchWiz 4.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket ships with Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread, dressed in TouchWiz 4.0. Ice Cream sandwich has already been confirmed as an update, so the device is as future proof as it gets in terms of software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video of the Skyrocket in action. See it below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen can be removed by swiping in any direction, rather than just sideways. The cool feature where missed events (messages, calls etc) get their own unlock patterns is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen got plenty of tweaks too. You get rectangular design for the widgets and a lot of functionality. The process of adding widgets is visually enhanced too with attractive transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen panes is business as usual ? you pinch zoom-out to display an aggregate view of all panes, which you can then easily rearrange, delete or add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the proprietary Samsung widgets allow you to edit them directly on the homescreen. We find this feature to be particularly neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panels serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher allows you to create folders inside it (though given that folders are enabled on the homescreen we don?t see much use for that here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is pretty easy stuff ? in edit mode you drag the icons you want over to a blank folder icon at the bottom of the screen. Then you drag the folder to the screen on which you want it to be placed and pick a name for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly redesigned in TouchWiz 4, compared to previous versions, but there aren?t any changes to functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager, which Samsung has preinstalled, offers a lot of functionality. In this version the RAM screen has been modified, compared to, and there is a single Clear Memory button now, instead of the two in the previous version. Now, with 1GB or RAM and with the new Gingerbread policy of keeping resource-hungry background processes in check, we are not sure you will need to enter the task manager all that often, but it doesn?t hurt having it. It also comes with a handy widget which shows you the number of active applications straight on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a dual-core Snapdragon S3 CPU on board, and a gig of RAM, the Skyrocket offers a pleasurable and lag-free experience. Now, we are about to see how does the Qualcomm creation fare with the benchmarks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks: no slouch as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With two Scorpion cores, clocked at 1.5GHz, and 1GB of RAM, the Snapdragon S3 will handle any task you throw at it with ease. It does however go a bit easier on the benchmarks than its Exynos packing siblings. We have put together several for you. See them below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keeping in mind that synthetic benchmarks have little to do with the way you will use your smartphone every day, we can attest that the Galaxy S II Skyrocket did show a miniscule amount of lag, compared to the rest of its Exynos sporting Galaxy S II siblings. It is however, faster than anything else on the market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is as capable as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have moved a few things around but the phonebook is pretty much the same as it was in the original Galaxy S. It has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One odd thing we noticed is that the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket cannot display SIM contacts ? there?s simply no setting for that. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can?t display them alongside the phone memory entries. We?ve seen that on other high-end phones as well (cough, iPhone 4, cough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you?ve created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The Samsung-specific swiping gesture is here too ? swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from the social networks too. If you don?t need that, you can still opt for the phonebook to augment your existing contacts info with stuff downloaded from the social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard ? one displays the person?s contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff ? status updates and the contact?s online galleries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket had great in-call quality and the sound was crisp and loud. Reception was good and we didn?t suffer dropped calls though, in areas of very poor coverage, the sound would naturally break up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is fully covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger ? as big as can fit on the screen, no more viewing only 2-3 lines of text from your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. Support for video calls is also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of text entry, the Skyrocket offers you the impressive three options out of the box. First, you have the standard Samsung QWERTY keyboard, which offers very big and comfortable keys. In landscape mode, the keyboard takes up most of the display and the even bigger keys make it one of the most comfortable virtual mobile keyboards around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the above choice, you have the stock Android keyboard at your disposal, as well as Swype. All in all, you have a keyboard for every mood and occasion. Plus you can download more off the Android Market ? there are both free and paid alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser are at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Skyrocket uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you ? aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there?s nothing new really. And don?t you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two-finger tilt zoom works much like the name suggests. You touch the screen with two fingers and as soon as you start tilting it, it will zoom in or out according to the tilting motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but functional file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image editor is on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You also get an image editor and a video editor preinstalled. The image editor handles the basics like image rotation, cropping (no resize though) and adjusting brightness/saturation/contrast. You can also make selections (using a smart tool similar to the Quick selection tool in Photoshop). It?s not nearly as accurate as the Photoshop tool though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can apply effects too but the one feature that caught our eye was Context fill ? similar to Photoshop?s Context-aware fill tool but, again, not nearly as accurate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz-ed music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player has a lot to give<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There?s 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitles sync (adjust them back or forth a few seconds) but there?s no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it ? starting with WMV through AVI (DivX and XviD) and MP4 to MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn?t a problem either ? the Samsung Galaxy S II played Full HD files just fine. Large files of over 2GB worked as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 8MP camera doesn?t disappoint<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Skyrocket, like the rest of the Galaxy S II family, comes with an 8MP auto-focus camera for photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixel resolution. It comes with an LED flash but nothing in the way of lens protection or physical shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks pretty familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls by default but the good news is that you can pick four shortcuts to put there ? commonly used features need to be one tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of features, the Skyrocket offers pretty much everything ? touch focus, scene modes, face/blink/smile detection, effects, geotagging, digital image stabilization and manual controls for ISO, metering mode and so on. There are other features too; we?re only listing the most interesting ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II Skyrocket makes some nice pics though the weather conditions didn't quite allows it to show the best of itself. The noise levels are well controlled and the contrast and resolved detail are fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full HD video camera is up to all tasks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one. You get the same customizable panel on the left for four shortcuts. The video camera can record video using the front facing camera too (resolution is limited to VGA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Full HD videos are top-notch, full of detail, low in noise and generally, nice and smooth. One annoying thing we noticed is the continuous auto focus tends to hunt quite a lot during video recording which can be a bugger if there are lots of moving object in the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A peculiarity is that when shooting Full HD videos you have a narrower field of view than that of the still camera. Perhaps Samsung are using the same trick as Apple in the iPhone 4: the camcorder uses only the center of the 8MP sensor instead of shooting with the whole surface and having to scale it down to 1080p putting extra strain on the CPU. In 720p video capture mode however Samsung are making use of the whole sensor and as a result you have the same wide field of view as the still camera (about 30mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this means for the occasional videographer is 720p videos might turn out the better option in low light as the process of pixel binning used for downsizing the information captured from the 8 megapixel sensor down to 720p actually benefits the suppression of digital noise too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The longer focal range in 1080p mode also makes for a shakier video so you might want to look for a support for your hand while recording to get the best out of the smartphone?s Full HD camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder features continuous autofocus, which is smooth though a bit slow at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than those peculiarities, the video quality is very good at 1080p ? the .MP4 files come with 17Mbps bitrate and have a lot of detail. The framerate is quite consistent ? there are no dropped or duplicated frames. Keep in mind that Full HD videos gobble up a lot of storage ? a minute of video will easily top 100MB of file size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are nice and smooth too, but obviously short of the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few videos Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket for you to enjoy. The last one was shot in 720p resolution, while the first one is in 1080p (don?t forget to select 1080p mode when playing it and certainly open it full screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched 1080p video clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity will overwhelm you with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket starts off with the basics ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G (T-Mobile?s AWS band is missing though). There?s HSPA+ with 21Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink too, which some carriers brand as ?4G? even though it?s technically not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real deal in terms of connectivity options of the device is the inclusion of LTE capability. Sadly however, New York City is still not among the areas covered by AT&amp;T yet. It should happen any moment though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there?s Bluetooth 3.0 with High Speed, which promises transfer speeds up to 21Mbps. Wi-Fi Direct is a similar technology, which offers simple pairing of two devices but blazing speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also NFC support too. We have the strange suspicion that the NFC chip might be integrated into the battery as it carries NFC sign. A dedicated app however, is notably missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed, the hardware specs of the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket propel it to great heights of user experience. The large, sharp display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum ? that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung offers you a couple of Hubs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hubs are not just for Windows Phone ? Samsung, at least, seems to think so. They?ve added two Hubs to their Android powerhouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we?ve seen before ? it combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn) and IM accounts (Gtalk, MSN and Yahoo! Messenger) and shows all incoming messages as one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There?s filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Hub lets you buy or rent movies or TV shows. Its interface is neat and intuitive, while its setup will take you no time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There is an office editor out of the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Skyrocket comes with Quickoffice preinstalled. It?s one of the most feature rich mobile editors we?ve seen. You can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and there?s a PDF viewer too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer like a Swiss Army knife<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a YouTube app although it?s really irrelevant here. It cannot match the resolution the in-browser flash player can give you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU and powerful new graphics, the Galaxy S II Skyrocket can run every Android app designed for phones. The OS version is 2.3.5 so you won?t have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After its recent major overhaul, the Android Market has become the place to go not only for apps and media, but also book, movies, etc. Its interface is simple and intuitive. The search function at the bottom right corner will assist you in finding anything you can possibly need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kies Air turns your phone into a web server<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you a URL to type into your computer?s web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone ? from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who?s connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the addition of an LTE enabled Galaxy S II to the U.S., Samsung has literally a version for every possible taste out there. The Galaxy S II Skyrocket however, is clearly the best equipped for the future with its spanking new radio on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AT&amp;T?s 3G network has seen quite a lot of strain in the past several years, mostly due to the demand for the iPhone and the explosion of use of network data. When the LTE network starts rolling out however, the users of the capable devices will have it all to themselves, since the iPhone 4S is simply not equipped for it. This should be considered as one of the strongest arguments in favor of the Skyrocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regarding the device itself, one must be extremely picky to find faults to it. Our main grievance is the low resolution of the gorgeous Super AMOLED Plus screen ? it is simply not befitting of an LTE flagship at the end of 2011. The rest of the phone is rock solid despite its year old platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II Skyrocket is priced extremely aggressively by AT&amp;T at $149.99 with a two year commitment. For this kind of money, you will need to search really hard to find a better alternative. As always, we took the liberty of taking a look for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest threat for the Skyrocket comes from within AT&amp;T?s own ranks again. The HTC Vivid is also LTE capable and sports a similar spec sheet to go with its 4.5? screen. The latter has a higher resolution than the Samsung offering at qHD. However, it is not Super AMOLED Plus and, believe us, it does make a difference. The Vivid costs the sweet $99.99 on a two-year contract with AT&amp;T.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We can?t talk LTE without taking a look at the impressive smartphone lineup of Verizon Wireless. The largest U.S. carrier also has the luxury of operating an already established LTE network in the United States. The downside is that its executives think that charging 300 bucks for a device on a contract is fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The abovementioned price will get you a Galaxy Nexus, a Motorola Droid RAZR, or an HTC Rezound. All three offerings have massive spec sheets to go with their LTE flavor. The Nexus will entice you with HD Super AMOLED screen and the latest Google experience. The RAZR is super thin and beautifully built, while the Rezound has some serious multimedia credentials, along with a retail package to die for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If money is not an issue for you, the above three must be on your shopping list. As always, the folks at Samsung won?t mind if you pick the Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Nexus ? HTC Rezound ? Motorola Droid RAZR</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course Apple iPhone 4S has plenty to offer as well. The same can be said about the rest of the U.S. Galaxy S II lineup. If LTE is not something you are after, each of the devices is worth taking a look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options are plenty as you can see. In terms of sheer price/quality however, the Galaxy S II Skyrocket is really tough to beat. Its pedigree which goes back to the mighty I9100 should not be forgotten as well. The addition of LTE in the case of the Skyrocket makes one already complete package, even better.</paragraph>
