		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>They shall come in wave upon wave. Or so it seemed in the beginning. Samsung certainly wanted a strong start for their own Bada OS and they had it. It is usual for sequels to be questioned and belittled. That?s one thing the Wave II doesn?t have to worry about. It?s bigger and heavier than the original.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wave II over original Wave<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Yep, we know, it?s not a great update. Plus the first three differences over the original Wave are about to be washed away once it receives its due software update to Bada OS 1.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II may not be the upgrade that all users have been waiting for, but the phone runs the latest version of the Bada OS and has kept all the great features of the original: from the powerful CPU, to premium connectivity and HD video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And all this is delivered on a larger 3.7-inch display. Sure, it?s no SuperAMOLED screen but Samsung promises the LCD screen is not your ordinary screen, too. You see, good things come in limited number and Samsung is pressed to supply enough SuperAMOLEDs for their Android and Windows Phone 7 operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bad luck for the Wave II, we guess. Even worse for the original Wave ? this phone will be as good as discontinued when the stocks run out. The Wave II will take over and that?s that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Samsung are probably not giving up on their Bada OS. If it eventually becomes the base platform for all their midrange touch phones, they will be extremely well positioned to adapt to the new market reality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not about the business benefits or the multitasking ? it?s as simple as apps. Users love to have them and makers love to sell them. Imagine being able to do that on all levels ? from the most basic feature phones to the top-of-the-line smart devices. That must be enough reason for Samsung to keep their commitment to Bada.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 28.07.11: We've added an overview of Samsung Dive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like it or not, the Samsung S8530 Wave II is just a step in the process. We?re about to see whether it?s as compelling as its predecessor. As usual, we start with the design and hardware, and then put Bada 1.2 under the microscope.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S8530 Wave II 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II is obviously bigger and more masculine than its predecessor. It?s built around a different screen, so it can?t help it. Other than that, the two phones are virtually identical: the same finish and the same layout of controls. The handset?s styling is economic and effective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 123 x 59.8 x 11.8 mm the Wave II is still reasonably compact and pocket-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone weighs a good 135 grams. The weight is great to handle though, the solid feel and durability an added gain.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It was obviously the design team?s day off. They hardly had anything to do on the S8530 Wave II. The goal was clear ? don?t change anything just make the phone bigger to accommodate the larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only difference in terms of design is the navigation deck up front. The buttons below the screen do look nicer this time but are not as comfortable to use. The call keys are set on a rather thin plastic strip, which doesn?t quite make sense against the added width of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the buttons are OK to use ? just not as clicky as before. The other thing is the phone is now taller and heavier ? it doesn?t allow as secure a grip, while reaching to the buttons at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slim metallic body is very elegant, and just as solid. As before, the only part of the handset to have fingerprint issues is the touchscreen (despite its anti-smudge coating). The rest of the sleek Wave II body is resistant to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the screen, the Call and End buttons are either side of the central Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The End key doubles as a power button. It will terminate the currently running app and take you to the homescreen wherever you are in the interface. Pressing and holding the Menu key launches the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the earpiece and the video-call camera, along with the proximity sensor. The Samsung S8530 Wave II has no ambient light senor to automatically adjust screen brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left-hand side of the Samsung S8530 Wave II we find the volume rocker, which, however thin, is prominent enough and with distinct press. It?s suitably placed to allow comfortable use as a zoom lever in camera mode ? it falls right under your left thumb, just like your right index finger sticks to the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the right side of the phone features the dedicated camera key and the lock button. Both are pretty tiny knobs but properly raised and tactile. The shutter key is soft and responsive, with distinct half-press position. The camera launches almost instantly and that?s another point in favor of the Wave II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top accommodates the microUSB port hidden under a neat plastic lid that slides softly in and out. The uncovered 3.5mm audio jack and the loudspeaker grill are also there. At the bare bottom you?ll only see nothing but the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the Wave II rear we only find the unprotected 5-megapixel camera lens. There is a small LED flash next to it to help in low-lit scenes. They once again chose to stick to the original Wave styling. Both the lens and the flash have the trademark diamond shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brushed aluminum surface of the battery cover is very pleasant to touch. The whole thing is quite usable too ? the rear cover will pop softly up when you pull the latch at the bottom. Underneath is the 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the microSD card slot and the SIM compartment are under the battery. The memory card isn?t hot-swappable and that?s one design decision we?re not happy with. It was the price to pay perhaps for the extra slim metal unibody. On a positive note, the phone handles a 16GB microSDHC card trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II is the successor that the circumstances have forced on the original Wave. These are virtually two identical phones: the attractive styling and solid build go without saying. The Wave II is just bigger and manlier that the original ? a guy?s gain is a gal?s loss we?re afraid. But in the end, it all boils down to the screen ? and we don?t mean size this time. It?s Super Clear LCD against SuperAMOLED. We have the score on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display: size matters, but so does quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The greatest change that the Wave II brings is the new 3.7? Super Clear LCD screen. It packs the exact same resolution as the 3.3? SuperAMOLED unit of the original but the technology used makes a big difference in image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LCDs are simply unable to provide the same contrast as SuperAMOLED, which is the key feature of a display indoors. We did like the saturated colors of the S8500 Wave unit more than the slightly colder hues of the S8530 Wave II. This however could simply be a matter of taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SuperAMOLED unit has wider viewing angles, its colors remain unchanged to the very edge. The Super Clear LCD on the other hand tends to lose some contrast when looked at a wider angle and this is certainly a step down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the new Wave?s sunlight legibility is still spotless and you will easily see what?s on the screen even in the brightly shining sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?d still pick SuperAMOLED over the new generation LCD any day. It?s a pity Samsung were forced to make that change. By the way, we think Samsung?s Super Clear LCD is just a more personal name for Super LCD that we?re about to see more and more of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Wave II is trying to cover its image quality losses with sheer size. The extra 0.4 inches of diagonal should make at least some difference. It?s obviously a matter of quality vs quantity here and we are afraid it?s a choice you?ll just have to make. At least for as long as the supplies of the original Wave last in the stores.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bada OS goes 1.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave II runs the latest version of the Bada OS. The user interface has been designed by scratch by Samsung and they have even ported it as TouchWiz on their recent Android phones so you?ll find they have a lot in common with the Bada user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bada OS itself has borrowed some system elements and logic from Android OS too so all in all Bada is as easy or even easier to pick up than Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The novelties brought by v 1.2 include some performance tweaks and Over-the-Air software updates. You also get the new T9 Trace, a Swype-like text-input method.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the Bada OS still looks just like TouchWiz at first glance ? the one we?ve known from all the Samsung feature touch phones so far but with even more eye candy and with the option of running native apps on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a demo video to see it in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are as many as ten homescreen panes full of widgets. Each homescreen is like a part of a single panoramic desktop (clearly a cue from Android). When scrolling the homescreen panes, icons move against the background image creating a feeling of depth and added dimension.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are pulled out from the tray at the bottom of the screen and you can stash them back there when they?re no longer needed. Turning the Wave landscape while editing the widgets allows you to add or remove homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is has been borrowed from Android too. It's is a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info like battery, time and switches for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. When you pull it down you get a list of all recent notifications and music player controls (if it?s running in the background).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada OS is a proper stage for real application multitasking, so naturally, you get that with the S8530 Wave II. The task manager is accessed by a long press on the Menu button so you can easily switch between currently active applications or terminate them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is flat, all available items and applications initially spreading across three screens of icons. If needed, you can add up to 7 more. Icons align in a 3 x 4 grid and you can change their order the way you like, you can also move icons from one screen to another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the homescreen, you can add or delete menu pages when you turn the phone landscape while you?re in edit menu mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the menu screens is looped, so when you reach the last one you don?t have to sweep all the way back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you lock the screen while playing some music, you can easily access the dedicated music bar with a single tap. You?ll notice a small CD icon at the top of your lockscreen which opens &#x430; set of music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave comes with around 2GB of internal storage divided into three partitions and, unfortunately, you may use only two of them for storing general files (those are the ones that appear as a drive on the computer in Mass Storage mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the user accessible storage (390MB) and the 800MB reserved for installing Bada apps, you also get another 500MB for messaging (these aren?t user accessible though). We can understand reserving some storage for apps, but 500MB for storing messages is just too much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wave II phonebook has rich functionality and practically unlimited capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset displays the phone memory and SIM-stored contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you really can have all of your contacts gathered in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search the entries by either flick-scrolling the list or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen. Gradual typing search is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada OS have another cool feature in the phonebook, which is also available in the Android OS on Galaxy S. In the main contact list, a swipe to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the New message interface. The side-sweep thing works in other lists too where you have names or numbers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II caused us no trouble during calls. There were no reception issues or in-call voice quality drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is some kind of smart dialing on board but it?s not exactly useful. Once you tap in some digits the Wave II shows the contacts in your phonebook whose number contains them. Now, we don?t know if you have the habit of remembering the numbers of your contacts but we certainly don?t.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include muting, using the keypad, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log can be activated with the call receiver key. It shows all the dialed, received, missed calls or messages in one list, but there are also different tabs for easy sorting the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the S8530 Wave II. It snatched a Below average score. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two major sections in the main menu - Messages and Email. The Samsung S8530 Wave II supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers folder (tabbed) view and conversation. The first one shows all your folders as tab at the bottom, while the conversation groups you messages by sender.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to email, setting yours on the second-gen Wave is hassle-free. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you can tweak. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported and you can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL encryption too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client looks exactly the same as the messaging one ? it uses the folder (tabbed) view. Multiple accounts are also supported. You can switch among them any time and this time there is also a shared inbox for all your emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maximum attachment size for both outgoing and incoming mail is 10 MB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All sorts of text-input options are on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Capacitive touchscreens usually won't give you handwriting recognition but the S8530 Wave II is among the few exceptions. And while the original Wave came with a smallish display, the new Wave sports a large enough screen. And handwriting on it is a real pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer typing to drawing, go for the on-screen keyboards. You get diverse options - a portrait numpad and a landscape full-QWERTY keyboard with or without the T9 Trace enabled. The Nuance T9 Trace text-input method is similar to the highly popular Swype software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You tap on the screen and move from letter to letter without lifting the finger in the air until you?ve gone through all letters building the word you?re writing. Just like Swype, T9 Trace recognizes the word you?re trying to write (even if you weren?t that accurate while selecting the letters) and puts it in the text above the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That should allow you to write up to 40 words per minute. Now, that?s fast typing! Plus, if you prefer the old way of typing letter-by-letter it?s still functional.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple yet useful gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery or Media Browser, as Samsung call it, is basic - all images and clips are displayed all at once as small thumbs. When you select a file you can see it in either portrait or landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch zooming is also available here thanks to the Samsung S8530 Wave II multi-touch support but you can also double tap on the screen to zoom in and out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still the best video player up to date<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Multimedia is certainly a S8530 Wave II forte. The large Super Clear LCD screen is great for watching videos. The interface of the video player follows the logic of whole UI. Settings and options are a tap away, otherwise hidden when not needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave II supports DivX/XviD files out of the box. And what is even more impressive, subtitles are welcome as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search for a specific scene using the "Mosaic search" feature. It breaks the clip down to parts and displays the first frame of each to help you find the scene you're looking for. Strangely, this feature won?t work with all videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance with higher-res videos is great ? it played 720p videos like a champ. Not a big surprise considering it can record 720p videos, but still impressive for a mobile phone. We threw everything we had at it ? DivX, XviD, MP4 and even MKV files - all in 720p resolution. The Samsung Wave II handled them smoothly and hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is fine as well. Tracks are sorted by albums, artists, genres, composers, etc. You can hide some of those sorting options if you don't use them. At the end only those that you've marked will be displayed on top of the screen (as tabs) while the ones you have unmarked will be gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface starts looking even better when you use the music player in landscape mode. Comparison to iPhone's Cover flow is inevitable with some important differences. Browsing albums or tracks is pretty standard in portrait mode: you get a list of all songs or albums, each with a small thumb. The list is smoothly scrollable with impressive kinetic effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're browsing in landscape mode you'll be getting an album art arch of virtual CDs. Tapping on a CD will expand it to show all the tracks within the given album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, sweeping down across the screen (from the arrow above the central CD) will display a virtual dial to let you search the albums or tracks alphabetically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer presets and sound effects are also available. The Samsung S8530 Wave II comes with Samsung?s proprietary DNSe sound enhancement technology that lets you pick among Wide, Concert Hall, Music clarity, Bass enhancement and Externalisation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Part of the music player is also the traditional Samsung music recognition feature that lets you record a few seconds of a currently playing track and it gets back to you with the name of the track and artist.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 6 stations as favorites that are accessible straight from the main screen. The rest of the available radio stations is still a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also listen to the FM radio on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM audio recording is also available. The recorded files are stored in decent MP3 format in your music folder.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8500 Wave was one of the best performing devices in terms of audio quality and we are glad that its successor, the Wave II, doesn't disappoint either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's especially impressive when used with an active external amplifier. In such situations the Samsung S8530 Wave II is an amazing performer with no weak points whatsoever. With wide dynamic range, perfect frequency response, no distortion and excellent noise levels the Wave II is just perfect. Oh, and the thing is pretty loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, when you plug in the headphones there is a significant drop in the audio output quality. Frequency response got worse, stereo crosstalk increased quite a lot and intermodulation distortion got bad too. Not to mention that volume levels took quite a significant plunge too. The starting point was so high that the overall output is still decent but it's nowhere nearly as impressive as without resistance applied to the line out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A nice 5 megapixel sharpshooter with HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like its predecessor, the Samsung S8530 Wave II is capable of taking 5 megapixel photos and capturing 720p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8530 camera viewfinder is quite reminiscent of company's recent cameraphones. The comfortable interface is nicely touch-optimized and has all you need on the two vertical bars on each side of the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the bases are covered - ISO, white balance, default storage, stabilizer, face and blink detection, geo-tagging etc. You can switch the default storage between the main memory and the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to use the touch focus feature, you need to touch-and-hold on the area you wish to focus on and then use the camera key to take a picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave II produces nice photos for a 5-megapixel cameraphone. The amount of resolved detail is good enough, noise levels are kept under reasonable control. Only the contrast seems a bit low. Here go the Samsung S8530 Wave II samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is one of the first reviews in which we'll offer you the benefit of our latest Photo Compare Tool. You can see how the Samsung Wave II image quality compares to that of some of the other handsets we have reviewed. Clicking any of the following three images will take you to our dedicated page for some pixel-peeping pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8530 Wave II compared to Samsung S85o0 Wave and Nokia N8</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II captures 720p@30fps videos. The resolved detail is excellent, contrast is good and the noise levels and compression are amazingly low. The price of the lower compression affects the file size ? 20 seconds of video take 30 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality of the Samsung Wave II is among the best there is in the cameraphne segement and it's no worse than that of the original Wave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a 720p@30fps video sample from the Samsung Wave II.</paragraph>

			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones are usually well-heeled in terms of connectivity and the Samsung Wave II is no exception. All kinds of network connectivity are at the user disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSPA. The GSM/EDGE networking of course comes in quad-band flavor and the 3G in dual-band - 900/2100MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the S8500 Wave, the S8530 Wave II supports the still fresh Bluetooth version 3.0. Naturally, A2DP is also supported. To activate Bluetooth (and Wi-Fi), you can use the dedicated control hidden in the notification area on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some apps like the Samsung Store, Facebook or Twitter require a configured packet data profile and an active SIM card to use Wi-Fi connectivity. Still those services don?t actually use packet data instead of Wi-Fi, they just check if it?s available. Strange indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of Wi-Fi connectivity, the Wave II is also among the few phones to support the latest Wi-Fi 802.11 n connectivity standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi with WPS is also at hand. WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected Setup and it's a hassle-free way to pair a wireless device with your secured network. As long as your wireless router supports the feature, pressing the dedicated button on it allows it to pair with the Samsung Wave II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Mobile AP you can also turn your Samsung S8530 Wave II into a wireless hotspot for connecting up to three Wi-Fi clients that will use its HSDPA connection for Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8530 also packs a standard microUSB port. You can choose from 5 connection modes - Media player, Modem, Mass storage, Samsung Kies and USB debugging. Samsung Kies is the new software used to connect your Samsung mobile phone to a computer. In Mass Storage mode the phone mounts its internal memory (390MB) and the inserted memory card as removable drives on the computer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A nice Flash-capable web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8530 Wave II packs the same Webkit-based Samsung Dolphin Browser 2.0 found on the S8500 Wave. You can have multiple pages opened at the same time and there is Flash video support on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser interface is reminiscent of the elderly Samsung S8000 Jet. There's multi-touch support, so you can make use of the pinch-zooming feature. That's only one of the three available zooming options, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also double tap a block of text or an image and the handset will automatically zoom in on it. Another double tap and you are back to the previous zoom level. And last but not least, there comes the one-finger zooming which works flawlessly as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser also offers kinetic scrolling and fullscreen view mode. The text search option is also there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no text reflow (dynamic refitting of text to match the width of the display port). Its job is to make sure the text won't run too wide, so that each line of text will fit horizontally on the screen (hence no need for horizontal scrolling).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave web browser also sports auto-complete when typing the address of already visited websites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned the browser has Flash support and the YouTube videos run even within the webpage itself. Of course, you could always watch YouTube videos using the pre-installed YouTube app instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature of the web browser is the Quick Translate option. Tap and hold to select some text and then click on the translate button. You will be redirected into a new tab with opened Google Translate and loaded with your result. Nice one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II comes with the Picsel Viewer on board. It works like a charm and is capable of pinch zooming. Both panning and zooming are fast and the overall performance of the Office viewer is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8530 Wave II features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. It also hosts the world clock, stop-watch and timer functions. There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. Oh, the Wave II packs a voice recorder as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The System Manager is the first telltale sign the Wave II is actually a smartphone. It consists of four tabs. The first one shows the device information (model number, firmware version, MAC addresses), the second one displays the battery info, while the third and the fourth inform you on the CPU usage and the memory status, respectively. Along with the CPU usage you can also see the currently running apps and you can start the Task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with only text, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub is the messaging and media sharing Holy Grail ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also added native Twitter and Facebook clients on the Bada OS. They are nicely touch optimized and have similar looks and functionality as the respective apps for the iPhone and Symbian.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Search works on everything in your phone ? contacts, images, music, videos, emails, history, apps, etc. It works excellent and helps when you have lots of content. It also offers internet search with Google or Bing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two full games pre-installed on the Wave ? EDGE and Parachute Panic. You also get the Tumbling dice application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tumbling dice app uses the built-in accelerometer. Shaking the phone for an occasional roll of the dice is a fun way to try your luck, and while it's free, it's not practical or particularly entertaining.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EDGE is a very simple game, which also uses the accelerometer to control a cube over a space platform. Your goal is one - to make it to the end of the level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Parachute Panic is very cute game ? some guys jump from planes and you must open their parachutes and help them land on the ships below. The game has very nice paper drawing styling and is quite fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a bunch of demo games. They give you only about two minutes of gameplay each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Bada OS is still very young and its gaming potential is yet to be revealed in the future.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The Samsung Apps store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Bada OS offers a native application repository from its start ? the Samsung Apps. Samsung Apps is very similar to the Android Market. It has three tabs ? featured, top and category view. There is also a download section and search option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the time we reviewed the original Wave we found only 60 apps over at the Samsung Apps store and now a total of nearly 3000 applications (both free and paid) are at your disposal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while this growth sure is impressive, the Samsung Apps store is far behind Apple?s App Store, Google?s Android Market or even the Windows Marketplace of the recently launched Windows Phone 7 platform.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation comes at a price<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled navigation software on the Samsung S8530 Wave II can easily turn the handset in a fully functional SatNav system - especially thanks to the sensitive GPS receiver on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wave II comes supplied with the Samsung LBS app, which is based on the ROUTE66 mobile application. Though its maps graphics have somewhat outdated looks, feature-wise there's really nothing missing. It has voice-guided navigation and a huge number of additional features, but the extra features come at a price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation software comes with 30-day trial license for voice-guided navigation (drive and walk). After that you?ll need a subscription, which is quite expensive. All other goodies require some extra payment and the whole package will cost you a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no native Google Maps at this stage, but we hope the app will hit the Bada OS application store soon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Dive locates your device, remote wipes it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Competition between phone makers is getting really heated, so they're offering more and more free services to lure in customers. Samsung Dive is a prime example - it's a phone finder/remote wipe service, something which used to be a premium, corporate-centric feature back in the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The officially supported devices currently include the Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S II, along with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Tab 8.9 and the Samsung Wave. That's it, even the Galaxy S Plus isn?t listed. An exception we found is that the Samsung Wave II is supported too even though it's not on the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star of the show here is the Remote Controls feature (actually, it's the only feature). It can locate your phone or you can set it to track the phone for 12 hours on, recording its position every 15 minutes. If you?ve only misplaced your phone, say, it?s behind the couch or your dog?s been using it as a bite toy (true story!), there's an option to ring the phone out loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if it turns out that the phone isn't in the house you have the option to lock the phone, wipe its memory and check the call logs to see if there were any calls made from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Locking the phone lets you enter a message to display on the device (up to 100 characters) and you can enter a phone number, which will be the only number callable from the locked phone (you'll also get an SMS to that number if the SIM card is changed). A 4-digit PIN is also required, which can later be used to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that if you choose to wipe the device, you'll no longer be able to use Samsung Dive on it. You can re-register if you find it, but tracking will no longer work, which means remote wiping is your last resort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When trying to locate your device, you have two options - Find my phone and Track my phone. They may sound alike, but they do differ a bit. Track my phone records the phone's location in 15-minute intervals over a period of over 12 hours and plots the locations on the map (Google Maps is used).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, for it to work, the phone needs to have a GPS lock - the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning won't cut it. So, if the phone is in a building or in another area with poor GPS signal, tracking won't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find my phone works fine with the less accurate options but it only shows the phone?s current location and it won't record past positions. The nice thing is that even if all location options were set to off before the handset was misplaced, those will be enabled automatically as soon as you start looking for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike HTCSense.com, Samsung Dive is purely for locating your device or remote wiping it. There are no options to view/manage contacts or messages or anything like that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have the feeling the Wave II came out of nowhere you?re not alone. This is not your usual upgrade ? it?s an emergency response to what might one day be known as the 2010 SuperAMOLED crisis. Just kidding really, but we guess it always helps to keep good humor when things don?t go quite as planned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a nutshell, the difference between SuperAMOLED and Super (Clear) LCD is about the same as that between Superman and Super Mario. The major novelty is in fact a major liability for the Wave II and it?s not the phone?s fault. A 3.7? Super Clear LCD touchscreen can?t match a 3.3? Super AMOLED but Samsung had no choice but try and make this work. The Bada OS is by the way not the only casualty of the AMOLED shortage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So yes, we do think losing the SuperAMOLED screen was the worst thing that could happen to the Wave II. But in all honesty, they did try to make the whole thing less painful. Making the screen bigger seems the right thing to do. And other than the screen, it?s the same phone with the whole set of top notch features intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the same 5 megapixel still camera and HD video recording and a complete connectivity package including Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 3.0 and TV out. There?s the impressively fast CPU and premium finish. And not least, the Bada OS has just been updated to v1.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8500 Wave</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave II is a solid package but it sure needs every bit of ammo to stand its ground. Nokia is a growing threat on the touchscreen field and some of their latest smartphones will want a piece of Wave?s market. The Symbian^3 powered Nokia C7 and Nokia C6-01 boast AMOLED displays, take HD videos and are just as well connected as the Waves. They have access to more apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia C7 ? Nokia C6-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the Android crowd, that?s where the choice is even bigger. The top-rated droids are too much for the Wave II to handle perhaps but with a price tag like that (350 euro) it's aiming at the high-end, that's for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smartphones such as the HTC Desire, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 and the Motorola MILESTONE XT720 will probably be among the main considerations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Desire ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 ? Motorola MILESTONE XT720</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems the Wave II is well out of its league against Windows Phone 7. AMOLED screens or not, they?re just too expensive. Maybe the likes of the HTC Trophy and the LG Optimus 7 come close enough. And with Microsoft starting from scratch, the two platforms might just have more in common than you might think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Trophy ? LG E900 Optimus 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A fact?s a fact, the Wave II is not here to build on the positive momentum, to maximize the original Wave?s potential. It?s an emergency substitute, a late change of game plan. Samsung will most likely continue to promote their Bada OS. Only they?ll have to regroup and start fresh under a new flagship.</paragraph>
