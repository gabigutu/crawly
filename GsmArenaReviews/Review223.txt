			<paragraph>In-phone GPS is no longer the next big thing in the industry. All right, it may not be run-of-the-mill just yet but it's where it's heading. The point now is how many extras will top the GPS and give users a bigger and better treat. Well, the new Nokia 6210 Navigator even tries not to make it a Dutch treat with a 6-month navigation license prebundled. On top of that, there's A-GPS, Nokia Maps 2.0 and a digital compass for pedestrian guidance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GPS aside, Nokia 6210 Navigator is running on the latest Symbian OS 9.3 with S60 3rd and FP2, and packs a good 3.2 MP autofocus camera, accelerometer, stereo FM radio and a 2.4" QVGA display. Smartphone expertise and GPS go hand in hand with superb communication skills: quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and HSDPA support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next generation Nokia Navigator sounds as a nice upgrade, but it's still a few trial laps away from becoming a recommended upgrade. Hop on and buckle up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator is a direct successor of Nokia 6110 Navigator, which got us pretty impressed back in the day. The new 6210 doesn't appear to be a great step forward. For one, navigation is entrusted to Nokia Maps 2.0 instead of the superb Route 66 we had the pleasure of in the original Navigator. Nokia Maps 2.0 is quite alright, but is definitely not our first choice here, mostly in terms of interface. The cheapo plastic under the display is another thing, but don't get us started on that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, the accelerometer for auto rotation and the compass are a boost to usability in Nokia 6210 Navigator. Plus, the full-fledged smartphone boasts the latest user interface version: Symbian S60 3rd with Feature Pack 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, we know that the Nokia 6210 Navigator is not a high-end all-in-one multimedia device but it still puts up a good fight, so you are welcome to join us as we explore it right after this small jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6210 Navigator unboxed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The box contents of Nokia 6210 Navigator are standard. Along with the phone itself, you will find a wired handsfree, a USB cable, a CD and a DC charger. A manual, a quick start guide and a 1GB microSD card are also in the box. Just as a reference, the first Navigator ships with a 512MB memory card. An in-car holder is optional, which is a bit of a downside considering the targeting of the device. We can't help reminiscing of the Asus P750, which comes with a whole bunch of accessories including a windshield mount holder.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6210 Navigator 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first thing to notice about the new Navigator is the trimmed-down waistline. Nokia 6210 Navigator is 14.9mm thick, keeping pretty much the same height and width at 103 x 49 mm. We have the same volume of 89 cc, but weight is down to 117 grams. And that tells when handling and using the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone feels surprisingly light in hand, while the build quality is commendable. The slide mechanism feels very sturdy and reliable, even if not as smooth as in the hi-end Samsung U900 for example. Using the D-pad and the adjacent controls with the slider up is a different issue though. There's a tangible wobble and pressing any of the mentioned keys makes the whole upper part of the phone clatter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3G enabled Navigator features a video-call camera in the top right corner. Right next to it is the ambient light sensor. The earpiece is centrally placed right above the Nokia logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.4" display follows, with the large soft keys right under it. They are placed on each side of the D-pad and above the Call and End keys. The End key also acts as a Power key, for the lack of a dedicated button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smallest knobs in this user-friendly layout are the main menu (Symbian) and C (clear) key. They are conveniently lifted up, so size doesn't hurt tactility. And finally, there is a dedicated key for navigation at the very bottom of the slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding up unveils the alphanumeric keypad, which takes the entire lower deck of the phone. Keys are amply sized, well defined and solid to press. Mistypes are quite unlikely, and we are very happy with the build quality and the comfort of use. The only issue is the utter lack of headroom for the top row of keys, which are crammed into the slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the keypad buttons and the main controls around the D-pad are slightly curved and quite tactile. By the way, the Nokia 6220 classic has virtually the same keyboard and soft key layout, only in the bar form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not really happy with the plastic used on the front (counting the keyboard too). It looks cheap - much like a Nokia 3500 classic. Pressing any of the navigation keys gives out an audible squeaking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side of Nokia 6210 Navigator you'll find two apertures - a charger connector and a 2.5 mm audio jack. It seems 2.5 mm is the standard Nokia pick, leaving the 3.5 mm for the high-end multimedia devices only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset hosts the volume rocker and the dedicated camera key, which is exactly the same layout as with the old Navigator. Even though the phone has lost some good 5mm in thickness, the controls are still big enough and comfortable to operate. Their size and elevation are great for touch orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning to the left, we come upon two essential elements. The microUSB port is placed closest to the top, its plastic lid, keeping the phone looks intact. The same holds true for the memory slot, which is halfway down the left side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bottomside, we find the battery cover latch, the mouthpiece and the neck/wrist strap eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our shape-and-looks tour with the rear. The new Navigator has lost the camera lens cover but has gained some on looks. The back panel is made of matt plastic, which is fingerprint-proof. The dual LED flash is right above the lens. In the top left corner is the loudspeaker grill: another loss for the new Navigator is the stereo speakers of its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the battery cover is a formidable task, quite unlike the original Navigator. The rear cover is so tight you can hardly deal with it. Underneath you'll find the BL-5F 950 mAh battery and the SIM bed. The battery wasn't exactly a great asset of the old Navigator and, given the pretty similar standby and talk times quoted by the manufacturer, we fear the successor won't be much of an improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the 6210 Navigator through our usual GPS battery test to see how far you can get with it in GPS mode. We left the device at a standstill position with GPS satellites locked and the display constantly on. The 6210 Navigator kept going for 4 hours straight, which is nice - it's on par with the Samsung i900 Omnia for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have no reason to complain with the build quality of the handset but we can't say either that it outdoes the old Navigator in terms of durability and solidity. The phone still handles nicely and the reduced thickness has quite a positive effect. The plastic casing is not much of a treat in terms of looks and feel, but construction is adequate. The only major downside is the cheapo plastic used on the front, which even has a glossy finish susceptible to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backlighting is very nice and even, and darkness poses no obstacles to usability. The ambient light sensor takes care of the display brightness, so it's never bothersome.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nice display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6210 Navigator screen supports QVGA resolution and up to 16M colors on a 2.4" diagonal. A Nokia trademark, sunlight legibility is way beyond the reach of other phones, except maybe Apple iPhone's gorgeous display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6210 display has grown by 0.2 inches compared to the original Navigator but it still isn't perfect for in-car navigation. The small fonts of the navigation interface don't provide for a comfortable reading when the phone's placed on the dashboard of the car. Another flaw is the lack of an optional landscape mode in Nokia Maps application, which is very strange given the auto-rotate sensor and the fact Nokia N95 8GB has a landscape mode</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calling around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may rest assured that communication is well taken care of in the Navigator. Reception is crystal clear on both ends of a call and we experienced no reception issues for the time of testing. Thanks to the accelerometer, users can enjoy the turn-to-mute feature in Nokia 6210 Navigator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Nokia 6210 Navigator stacks against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. It is certainly louder than its predecessor, but still falls behind some of the great performers we've encountered. More info on our test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Steer on Symbian<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator runs on the Symbian 9.3 OS with Series60 3rd edition UI. Feature Pack 2 is aboard, bringing both visual and performance upgrades.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing to notice is the new Active standby screen, which now allows quick access to a lot more features. The standby toolbar can display in vertical tabs with the D-pad used for scrolling. Other than that, its functionality isn't greatly modified.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby is a convenient way of bringing shortcuts to all favorite applications to your home screen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access. The two soft keys' functions can also be varied as users prefere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager has also received visual enhancements and is now appearing on every pop-up menu. It is actually placed on top of every list, which can sometimes be too much. In addition, you can still use the well-known shortcut by pressing and holding the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the S60 UI Feature Pack 2 brings some graphic improvements as well. Animations are now available when browsing the menus. Fading in and out of the camera viewfinder looks very cool and really is an eye-catching touch to the camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the phone has only 64MB of RAM compared to the 96MB of RAM in the old Navigator, OS performance is unaffected. Memory Full warnings are not something you can expect on the Nokia 6210 Navigator screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Navigating the menus is fast with instant response to user commands. The blue circle next to the icon of a running application is a well known Symbian indication reminding users to quit unwanted applications that are still running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator has 120MB of built-in memory, which is a decent count. The included 1GB microSD memory card comes in very handy but you can go for an even higher capacity card if you like. Our test showed that Nokia 6210 had no problem handling an 8GB microSD memory card, which is the limit in the official Nokia spec sheet. Accessing applications or files from the memory card is quick and you probably won't notice a big difference compared to accessing content on the phone memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customizations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6210 Navigator main menu offers four different view modes. The well known 4 x 3 grid and a simple list go without saying. In addition, you can enable icon animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two available modes are the 3D V-shape and Horseshoe views. Visually appealing though they might be, those are not really the most user-friendly we've seen. Font sizes are also configurable depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, you can change the currently active theme. There are four preinstalled themes on Nokia 6210 Navigator. The rest is left to the imagination of the user, as many other themes are available for download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Superb phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its Symbian nature, Nokia 6210 has an excellent phonebook with virtually unlimited capabilities. There is storage place for practically unlimited number of contacts and fields, with all the available memory potentially usable for the purpose. Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. We personally find it quite a challenge to think of something Nokia has missed here. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log application, although not exactly a part of the phonebook, is also one of the usual Symbian strengths. It holds up to 20 call records in each of the tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls. These are all accessed by pressing the Call key on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you enter the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers. The period can be shortened to save some space but you are quite unlikely to do that, as even with a huge number of calls the log only takes a few kilobytes of storage space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typing is comfortable with Nokia 6210 Navigator. The phone supports all common message types - SMS, MMS, audio message and email. The SMS and MMS share an editor. It is the well known intuitive application from previous Symbian S60 smartphones. It has a counter of characters left to the limit of 160. There is also an indicator in brackets showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes without saying that a delivery report can be activated. The reports pop up on the standby screen and are subsequently saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu. When you are exiting the message editor without having sent the message, the editor prompts saving it to the Drafts folder or discarding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All it takes to convert a common SMS into an MMS is insert some multimedia content. A nice feature allows resizing pictures automatically for sending via MMS. Nokia 6210 Navigator also features the dedicated audio message editor.You can either record the message on the spot or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also the time-tested Symbian performer. It can download headers only, as well as entire messages. There is also support for attachments, so Nokia 6210 Navigator can meet almost any user requirement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music to go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is another noteworthy Nokia 6210 application. It has a huge number of supported audio formats, including MP3, AAC, eAAC+ and WMA. The M3U playlists are also managed flawlessly and files are added to the music library by simply choosing the Refresh Music Library option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sorting your songs by artist, album, genre and composer is automatic and searching tracks by gradual typing of the desired name is also available. Tracks are transferred to the phone via Bluetooth, USB or by simple download. You can also use a card reader for that purpose and transfer them directly to your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon completing a USB transfer, the phone automatically prompts scanning for new music tracks and, if allowed to do so, adds the new ones to the music library. The player comes with five equalizer presets. If they still seem insufficient, you can edit them or create new ones in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case a tab appears on the stand-by screen indicating the currently running track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator also comes complete with the A2DP profile support. This means that you will be able to listen to your music on a Bluetooth stereo headset. We had no problem pairing the phone with a set of third-party headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator features a Real player for video playback. The video player works in both portrait and landscape mode, which are switched automatically thanks to the built-in accelerometer, and can also display fullscreen. When in full screen, the softkey functions are hidden so that they don't spoil the viewing experience and only pop up when a key is pressed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia 6210 Navigator has a nice simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support, as well as the proprietary Nokia Visual Radio service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It's a really nice camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 is equipped with a 3 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. It sports auto-focus and LED flash but no lens protection whatsoever. This means that the glass covering the lens is prone to finger smudges. However it's recessed enough to evade scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trimmed down camera settings may lack the ISO sensitivity setting, but there are 5 scene presets, auto-focus control, flash control, self-timer (10, 20, 30 seconds), night mode, automatic panorama mode and multi shot. Color effects (sepia, negative, black and white), along with white balance, contrast and brightness levels are to be found here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, geotagging is not an option with the Nokia 6210 Navigator, which is a downright waste considering the built-in GPS receiver. There is no option to apply gridline to the viewfinder either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Navigator pulls off good image quality, comparable to Nokia N78. The colors are precise and the noise is kept low, except in shadow areas. There is also more than enough detail and even foliage seems to come out well with the Navigator's camera. The sharpness levels are adequate, with slight traces of oversharpening at the edges or in contrast areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at the sample photos made with the camera of Nokia 6210 Navigator:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for video recording, the new Navigator camera shoots in VGA resolution at 15 fps captured in MPEG-4 format. Although this is a decent achievement, the quality is not that impressive. The modest frame-rate is taking the fun out of the nicely sounding VGA resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator offers a regular image gallery, with some nice improvements courtesy of Feature Pack 2. Browsing is now improved with the speed of browsing your pictures increasing if you hold the direction buttons on the D-pad longer. This allows quick skipping through tons of photos in a blink of an eye. Besides, the gallery has a much more conveniently placed shortcut for accessing the picture details. The pictures can be viewed in both portrait and landscape mode and can be zoomed in if you wish to see more detail. There's also quite a good range of features in image editing. Browsing images is flawless; zooming in and out also doesn't suffer lags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager of Nokia 6210 allows you to do almost anything you can think of with your files. Copying, moving, creating new folders - you name it and you bet the phone can do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an application manager to take care of the installed applications on the Navigator. Not much to talk about here, as it is identical to the one in any other Symbian device. Its functionality boils down to providing details about installed applications, removing them and keeping a log of movements in either direction.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connected<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfers are duly covered in the Navigator. Almost every common data transfer medium is supported, Wi-Fi the single exception. USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP are supported. All kinds of network connectivity are also on board - from quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE to dual-band HSDPA 3.6 Mbps support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card slot comes in handy if you have a card reader at your disposal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing the internet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Web browsing with the phone is a pleasure as with all Nokia smartphones. No matter how elaborate the web page, it fits perfectly on screen and looks almost exactly like on a PC. A mini-map can be activated to help finding your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required. Zoom levels are also adjustable at the expense of only a few key presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto screen rotation is another benefit in web browsing. The in-page search looks up text, phone numbers, VoIP address or email. Sadly, the web browser does not support fullscreen view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, if you prefer a third party web browser, you can easily install it on the Symbian smartphone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The time-management skills of Nokia 6210 are really top-notch. Just name the application and you can count on it that the handset has it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start exploring the rich application package with the calendar. It has three different types of view - monthly, weekly and to-do view, and four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Every event has its own unique fields, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word and Excel and PDF files seamlessly. Unluckily, editing documents is not supported by the included version of the Quickoffice. If you would like editing enabled you will have to purchase the complete application at the Nokia Download center. The final ingredient here is the included ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator has a dictionary preinstalled. You can choose a source and target language for a word to be translated. Other options include setting the font size and turning on word pronunciations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other included organizing and time-management applications are a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. We are not going to get into detail with them, as their functionality and performance are familiar or at least self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm application allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Navigator has three games preinstalled: Marble, Jelly chase, and Brain Champion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jelly Chase is an accelerometer-based game, which honestly confused us with the chaotic movements of the Jelly that seems to be the main game character.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third game is Brain Champion, which is our favorite. It's a series of quizzes in different areas and that's definitely our kind of stuff.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Satellite meets compass<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Obviously, GPS is the essence of the Nokia 6210 Navigator. Software-wise, it's equipped with Nokia Maps 2.0 - the latest Nokia application that provides electronic maps, as well as voice guided turn-by-turn navigation. Hardware-wise, the Nokia 6210 has got an illuminated GPS key that gives you one-touch access to Maps, as well as lights in blue one you've got a satellite lock. There's also a built-in compass - a novel feature that comes in handy for pedestrian use - the map view automatically rotates according to where the handset is pointed to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Navigator was equipped with Route 66 software for maps and navigation. The only frown here is we liked the Route66 interface better, the navigation functionality however isn't hurt at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps 2.0 can either download maps interactively as you go much like the Google Maps or you can download all needed maps on a PC and load them to the handset via Nokia Map Loader. Either way, turn-by-turn navigation and voice guidance comes at a monthly price called license. The 6210 Navigator comes with a complimentary 6-month worth of that so you are covered at least in the beginning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps 2.0 has extensive settings and functions but the accelerometer is of no use in this application (unlike Nokia N95), so don't go looking for auto rotation (there's no a manual screen rotation either). Furthermore, the font is quite small and using the phone for in-car navigation is not that comfortable. But the Nokia 6210 really shines when used for navigating around on foot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A-GPS is available using data connection for quicker initial satellite lock. Be aware that it involves a few kilobytes of traffic, so if you don't want to pay for that, you might prefer to switch the A-GPS off and rely solely on the GPS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPS receiver of the Nokia 6210 Navigator is doing its job with commendable accuracy. The sensitive GPS receiver will find you practically anywhere. Tall buildings are not that much of a problem anymore and, in most cases, you will get pretty exact bearings even in urban areas where these are a common sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In-car navigation with Nokia Maps offers turn-by-turn voice and visual guidance with extensive route-planning options including traffic information and dynamic re-routing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Maps 2.0 comes with four different map modes: Map, Map 3D, Satellite and Hybrid. If you're driving Map 3D will probably be the best choice, while simple Map should be best for pedestrian use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Points of interest are a definite asset of Nokia Maps 2.0 but turning them all on could be a bit bothersome. Depending on the scale of view, a map can get really overcrowded with POI icons. Of course, the highly customizable software allows you to define which icons should stay on, and which won't be visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the many categories in POI we found particularly curious is Internet/Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Favorites menu offers extensive options for storing places, routes and collections, along with the history of recent trips. Trip distance and duration are measured too, opting between total and average values.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the typical Symbian GPS applications onboard is the GPS Data application, which gives you raw satellite data (coordinates, time, latitude, etc). It also allows you to setup basic navigation routes - to either an already stored Landmark or to a set of GPS coordinates. It doesn't offer a map of voice guidance, as we said, it's pretty basic. It also integrates a Trip Meter, which has some pretty self explanatory functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To summarize, our experience with the core functionality of Nokia 6210 Navigator was excellent. The display size and the lack of autorotation in navigation mode are among the few downsides that however hinder only in-car usage. As for pedestrian purposes, the Nokia 6210 Navigator is an excellent choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the 6210 Navigator through our usual GPS battery test to see how far you can get with it in GPS mode. When you are in your car, you can always charge it on the go, however power autonomy is important when you use your handset when you are out and about on foot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We left the device at a standstill position with GPS satellites locked and the display constantly on. The 6210 Navigator kept going for 4 hours straight, which is a good result. You should bear in mind that if you are on the move, the expected battery life will be lower. Here are the results from several other GPS-equipped devices that we've tested:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6210 Navigator was announced a year after its predecessor and brings a number of improvements in functionality. Nokia's Navigator line stays faithful to the slider form factor and design is a mixed bag of improvement (larger screen, notably thinner, matt rear surface) and decline (cheapo plastic, no lens protection, no stereo speakers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all fairness, Nokia 6210 Navigator is no more than slow and quiet evolution and that might not be just enough in a niche that seems to get crowded faster than ever. The compass, the accelerometer and the excellent 3 megapixel camera are questionably the right features to motivate an upgrade from the original Navigator. Wi-Fi would've definitely made a lot more difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Navigator still has its strong points (excellent pedestrian use) and it still is an impressive GPS-enabled package. One thing must be considered though. During the year that divides the two Navigators, a handful of competing GPS-enabled devices have made a strong claim that leadership in this segment will be much contested. We hate to say it, but the 6210 Navigator will have to find its way through a more hostile environment than its forerunner.</paragraph>
