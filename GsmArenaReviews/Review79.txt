			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's business as usual on the WinMo front and all the action seems to be around the upper end of the pricing scale. Impressive as those top PocketPCs may be, they are hardly the stuff that makes the sales meters tick and bring the profits that fuel the R&amp;D machine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE is one of the very few that dare to try and bring Windows Mobile to the masses. Budget PocketPCs are not unheard of but what makes OmniaLITE different is WinMo 6.5. The compact full-touch handset has the essentials perfectly covered, and sprinkled with a few nice extras too. But most importantly, the price tag won't make you wince.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of them Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE specs are quite a good match for the original Omnia. There are some differences of course but in the eyes of the potential buyers they just can't be make or break we think. And besides it's a pretty fair trade-off considering the asking price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doubled RAM and standard microUSB port come at the price of a smaller screen and a downgraded camera. But those differences are not really enough to pull the two devices that far apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess the LITE version looks quite a bargain - at least on paper. But don't think Samsung have suddenly become charitable. The thing is the original Omnia has produced an impressive offspring. And the strong lineup is so segmented and the market so evolved that users can enjoy a high-end feature set at a midrange price. But the important question is will the B7300 OmniaLITE survive in the shadow of its near-iconic sibling that easily tops our all-time popularity ranking of Samsung handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual when such questions arise, we try to provide the answers. For starters, we'll check if the build quality and ergonomics of the B7300 are up to the high standards of its elder brother. So, hop on to the next page where we kick it off nicely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Standing at 107 x 51.8 x 12.9 mm, the OmniaLITE is just about what you'd expect in a full-touch handset with a screen that size. The 12.9mm thick OmniaLITE doesn't impress with girth but the handhold is fine. It will slip comfortably in most pockets too, just don't expect anything near a Nokia E52 feel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design is where OmniaLITE departs considerably from the original Omnia. The original was an exquisite device, as suited its high-end (in its time) standing. The low-profile OmniaLITE on the other hand looks more easy-going perhaps and somewhat juvenile with the strange mix of design elements it offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shiny silver plastic, glossy black panels - patterned at the back - and the red top and bottom maybe don't go together all that well. The design mix is perhaps too bold - there are edges, ovals (and hexagon patterns at the rear). We're either much older than the intended target or it's the original Omnia that still holds strong, but we're not impressed. The cheapish looking plastic doesn't help much either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have all the right to disagree of course and be madly in love with the OmniaLITE. And feel free to think whatever you like about our aesthetic judgment. Just take note that we don't encourage emails informing us of our poor taste...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyways, at the top, right next to the earpiece we find the secondary video-call camera of the 3G-enabled Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What follows is mostly the 3" touchscreen, with the platform's usual 65K-color support. It's the resolution though - WQVGA (240 x 400 pixels) - that tells the OmniaLITE's midrange position. We were starting to get used to WVGA (480 x 800 pixels) on recent PocketPCs and we hate to say it but the picture quality on the OmniaLITE isn't up to scratch. Then again, we are talking a much cheaper handset here and WQVGA is quite standard for the class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the brightness of the display is quite good. It's the pretty poor contrast that sets it apart from its high-end relatives. Well that and sunlight legibility. But frankly, we didn't expect too much here anyway. It's really hard to see anything on the display outdoors on a sunny day, and finding a proper angle for working with the phone is a real challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not like we aren't used to seeing less than perfect screens from PocketPCs so we are almost willing to let that go. It's no worse than the original Omnia anyway and that didn't stop it from becoming a great success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last thing to note at the front is the Back/Close key squeezed in-between the Call keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE sports the volume rocker, the menu key and the reset pinhole. The buttons on this side are pleasingly tactile and responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the OmniaLITE we come upon the microSD card slot, surrounded by the lock key and the dedicated shutter key. The really bad part about the camera key is that it only has one press. No half-press-to- focus-full-press-to-shoot routine with the OmniaLITE resulting in dramatically worse shooting experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All there is at the bottom of Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE is the mouthpiece. There's no stylus slot on the OmniaLITE so if you like poking your phone's display with a short stick of plastic you better look elsewhere. It's not that we miss it too much but some parts of the Windows OS are still not finger-friendly enough on a 3" screen and that in turn causes issues with the usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the standard microUSB port and the lanyard eyelet. The connectivity port is covered by a plastic lid to keep dust away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OmniaLITE rear hosts the 3 megapixel camera lens and the loudspeaker grill. There is no flash of any kind here so one can easily tell that photography is not the Samsung B7300 element.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the huge 1500-mAh Li-ion battery that powers the OmniaLITE. The generous capacity, combined with the economic WQVGA screen, give the Samsung B7300 great battery life. The manufacturer quotes it at up to 650h of standby time and up to 9h of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is quite impressive no matter how you look at it and our real-life experience came to affirm it. The handset easily lasted more than 4 days of moderate use (20 minutes of talk time and 1 hour of using the other phone features a day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, we are quite pleased with the construction quality of the Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE. The materials look sturdy and it's that cheapish look only that bothers us. On the positive side, we heard no creaks or other disturbing sounds for the time of our review and we guess the OmniaLITE will hold up against wear and tear. Again, the LITE has nothing of the impressive appearance of the original Omnia and that's more or less implied by the price tag of 270-300 euro. We're not too impressed with the design mix but the handset will perhaps connect with the younger, less conservative audience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Widgetized Windows Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE units produced after October 6th (the official release of WinMo 6.5) come with the latest iteration of the Microsoft OS preinstalled. The older ones are running WinMo 6.1. However, since they are all eligible for a free upgrade, it's not a really big deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, if you happen to like the Samsung home-brew TouchWiz UI you may as well forget which version of Windows you are using. The changes brought by TouchWiz run so deep this time that you hardly ever see a default Windows screen. Anyway, TouchWiz is there and it's optional - it's up to you to enable it or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz gives you three different homescreen panes that can be alternated by finger sweeps. They are then free to be filled up with widgets. You can also assign different wallpaper to each homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets are numerous mini applications or shortcuts to different parts of the user interface, sitting in the tray on the left side until dragged onto the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available widgets vary quite a lot - from a digital clock, through a mini image browser and profile manager, to the CNN news application. You can also download additional widgets via the - yep, you guessed it right - Download Widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is even a shortcuts bar that you can customize to lead to applications of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The customized Samsung "main menu" (that's launched by either the Start button or the Menu key) extends over four different screens that you can alternate with sweep gestures. The total number of screens is limited to 10 but you can freely reorder icons just like you would on an iPhone. You can also give each screen a different name to stay organized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, this whole Main menu has a really flat iPhone-like structure, in line with Samsung's recently released feature-phones. This approach gives you a simpler what-you-see-is-what-you-get interface but at the price of a bit complicated navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colorful interface offers the same two sets of icons as the Samsung I8000 Omnia II, the default set being the better-looking one in our opinion. You can of course also change the color scheme if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touching the status icons on top of the screen opens a set of large thumbable virtual buttons that give you quick access to the connectivity manager, detailed battery status and the system volume control. You can of course control volume levels with the volume rocker on the left but it doesn't hurt to have it here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also preloaded the device with a nice and thumbable TaskSwitcher that obviously allows you to switch among applications and end some or all of them should you need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key difference in the TouchWiz overlay of the OmniaLITE and Omnia II is the Cube multimedia interface, which isn't available in the Samsung B7300. Since it only brings a design boost we don't consider it a great loss.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What lies underneath<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned, only after you switch off the TouchWiz you can get to the underlying Windows OS. If you have been keeping track you would know that it isn't at all that different from its predecessor 6.1. Microsoft mentioned that the whole 6.5 thing wasn't a part of their plan and really didn't go into it wholeheartedly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will have a quick glance at it here, but if you want a more detailed version of this part you can also check out our Windows Mobile 6.5 review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first change introduced by the new OS is the scrollable homescreen. The different items in the list are also scrollable sideways, giving you more functionality per line. For example, scrolling the Getting started item sideways allows you to set the clock, email account, device password, Bluetooth, custom wallpaper, custom ringtone, upload music and finally even remove the Getting started item for good once you're ready setting up the essentials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next major change is the new Windows Mobile Main menu. It comes in the honeycomb pattern that so many people can easily recognize thanks to numerous official and leaked screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the new main menu you've got all the installed programs plus shortcuts to the settings menu. Unlike the Omnia II, where the settings menu looked just like the main menu, on the OmniaLITE it is always covered by the Samsung TouchWiz and looks exactly like on any of the company's feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The perfectly flat structure of the Main menu can surely get a bit clumsy in time due to the huge number of icons piling up, but still we'd prefer that over the confusing experience that so many Widows Mobile new adopters have had in the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also some other minor changes such as larger font that allows for more thumbable operation in most menus and the option to alternate tabs by simple finger sweeps wherever Windows offers you tabbed screens. You no longer need to aim for the tiny titles at the bottom of the screen as on the WinMo 6.1 handsets - you just sweep your finger across the screen and the next tab opens instantaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ARM 1176-based CPU by Samsung clocks as high as 667MHz and allows the OmniaLITE to offer some great performance. However, this is in no small part due to the lower screen resolution, as it means there are four times less number of pixels to draw on the screen. Nonetheless, the speed and response of the OmniaLITE are certainly among its key assets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To prove that we used the Spb Benchmark software to test the Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE performance. It achieved some pretty good results easily outdoing the original HTC Touch Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mid-range OmniaLITE even outperformed the much more expensive  on some tests, where memory access speed was crucial (writing and copying files). However when raw processing power is required (whetstones tests) the OmniaLITE is obviously no match for the 1GHz Snapdragon CPU.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even way back when the WinMo phonebook was one of the ugliest platforms one could imagine, the phonebook did an excellent job. Contact management has always been one of the strong points of the OS having its roots heavily in PDAs with the unlimited phonebook capacity and brilliant synchronization options - but it's all the more sweeter now that it has the looks to match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook application of the Samsung OmniaLITE has a nice and simple interface and it is clear that it was developed with touch-operation in mind. The graphics are nice and navigation is intuitive enough to make sure your work with it is trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for the OmniaLITE displaying either the SIM card or the phone memory contacts or both at the same time. Moving, copying and deleting contacts is available both one by one or in bulk. It goes without saying that you are practically unlimited in the number of contacts or fields for each name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search your contacts by either dragging the scroll bar on the right, by kinetic scrolling of the list itself or by gradual typing on the virtual keypad. The last one of course, was our least prefered option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the HTC offerings, editing contacts is also completely covered by the TouchWiz UI. It gives you a nice and simple interface, similar to the company's feature phones. You have a plethora of available info fields but no option to rename any in case something has been missed - not that there ever was an occasion when we felt that was the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact there is a shortcut in the context menu that takes you to your recent calls with the person in question. You can also add it to the reject list or the speed dial numbers straight from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you are into grouping your contacts - the B7300 OmniaLITE has that covered too. The first four groups are pre-configured, the rest left to your imagination and specific needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: nothing missing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung made it clear with the previous Omnia handsets that telephony was never compromised, despite the fact that the extra features are somewhat becoming the main reason for buying a mobile phone. OmniaLite sticks to this trend and offers excellent in-call sound and clear reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application offers Smart dialing, which means you will hardly ever need to go to the Contact list in order to dial a number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in accelerometer gives the OmniaLITE the cool feature to mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no proximity sensor to switch the display off when you hold the handset next to you ear so you should be careful about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log on Windows Mobile devices offers practically unlimited entries. Samsung also pimped up the looks and added the nice extra sorting options. You can sort the entries alphabetically by name or by frequency of occurrence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also conducted our traditional speakerphone test to round off the phone part of the OmniaLITE review. You aren't likely to miss many calls with it, as it scored a Very good mark, ranking pretty high on our list of tested devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No landscape QWERTY is a no-go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging on the Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE is well heeled in terms of software. The handset can manage SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a nice message editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email editor has also been nicely skinned by the TouchWiz UI but there are no major changes in terms of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up your email is easy as it is on most of the latest mid or high-end phones. You type your username and password and all the other fiddly options are configured automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We now come to the available text input options on the OmniaLITE and unfortunately the handset fails to fully deliver here. Samsung have equipped the device with a proprietary virtual keyboard, which is way better than the Windows default one but that wasn't much of a challenge anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem is that the keyboard doesn't work in landscape mode, which makes typing on it quite a challenge. After all, the short side of a 3" display hardly is the perfect place to fit 10+ keys. On the positive side there is nice haptics, but it isn't really enough to convince us that typing is what we want to do on the Omnia LITE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So we relied most on the handwriting recognition of the handset, which we have to admit is remarkably accurate. The phone does a marvelous job of recognizing the letters and symbols we scribbled even when we used nothing but our fingers. Not the easiest thing to do without a stylus but it was the fastest input method for us.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Arc-gallery rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE is equipped with an elaborate picture viewing application called Photo Album. It sorts the photos by month and offers a nicely customizable slideshow. You get to pick the transition effects, the direction and the time for each separate photo to stay on screen. Naturally, scrolling images is easily done with finger sweeps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can opt for grouping the images in folders, whereby each folder containing pictures appears on screen in alphabetical order and with an automatically assigned thumbnail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone sideways brings the third viewing mode available. All of your photos are displayed in a 3D arc and they slightly overlap, much like a deck of cards. You scroll them with a sweeping finger gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second arc of thumbnails crossing the current one represents the photo folders instead of individual shots. Dragging them up or down changes the current folder quite naturally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an alternative in landscape mode where the photos are again sorted chronologically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the gallery is perfectly smooth and responsive and is definitely one of the coolest ones we've seen lately (though perhaps not as practical as it is attractive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap on an image within the arch, it loads in single view where you can zoom or slide to the next one. Zooming in is extra easy thanks to the one-finger zooming that is now becoming customary on Samsung touchscreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You simply have to hold your finger for a second over the part you want to zoom in on and drag upwards. A similar gesture downwards will zoom out. You can also zoom in and out by double tapping but that way you have no control over the level of magnification applied.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, going from portrait to landscape mode is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Thumbs up for the custom Media Player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have wisely decided to give users a new touch-friendly media player and spare them the inconvenience of installing a third-party one to make up for the poor Windows Media Player. It used to be called Touch player on previous devices, but on the OmniaLITE it goes by the name of Media player. It handles both video and audio files, supports playlists and has the standard album/artist/tracks sections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three main views available in the Media player. The first one is the Library - at the top you have six tabs: all music, albums, artists, genres, videos and Now Playing. Turning the handset to its side switches to the cool album art view mode. You can then browse songs by simple finger sweeps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch into play mode, you see a simple and clean interface. It has the standard music buttons you would expect - volume, skip, play/pause and shuffle, while the album art fills most of the screen above them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options menu further offers faster/slower playback or setting the track as a ringtone. Audio effects can be applied to both videos and audio tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Playing videos is very simple - it's done the same way as an audio file. The player interface looks the same, but tapping twice turns on the fullscreen mode. It has the same control buttons as the standard one, but everything is meant for landscape orientation and there is no taskbar at the top or empty black spaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Player can easily handle DivX and XviD videos, making the OmniaLITE as capable a video player as most users will ever need right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE performs excellently at near VGA-res XviD video playback - we played an XviD encoded DVD rip for PC playback and, luckily, there were no skipped frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos with resolution slightly lower than VGA and bitrate of up to 2.5Mbps were no problem for the handset. As our experience shows this is about as much as most of the users will ever need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice widescreen display earns the OmniaLITE another point as it is much better suited for watching videos than, say, common QVGA screens.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio is good to go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on the Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE has a really neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you travel during reception, the OmniaLITE should take care of auto-switching to the regional frequencies of your selected radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset also supports radio broadcast recording and of course can be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is room for only six shortcuts for your favorite stations on the radio app screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of the Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE is somewhat of a mixed bag. The extremely low noise level and stereocrosstalk as well as the excellent dynamic range are the strong points of the OmniaLITE performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is good for most of the range but the cut-off bass frequencies aren't allowing us to qualify is as anything more than decent overall. The total harmonic distortion is the worst part about the OmniaLITE audio output, going several times higher than usual. It's not that it is too disturbing but we are used to seing a lot better from most other handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see how the OmniaLITE compares to some of its competitors:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE vs HTC Touch2 frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unimpressive camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE is capable of taking 3 megapixel photos with a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. There is no flash of any kind and no two-step shutter key, so you should probably lower your expectations right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B7300 camera viewfinder is familiar to us from the Omnia II (and most other recent touchscreen Samsung handsets for that matter). The comfortable interface is nicely touch-optimized and has all you need in the two vertical taskbars on each side of the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a good number of configurable options here - ISO, white balance, default storage, mettering method etc. However, extras such as Wide Dynamic Range and image stabilizer have been omitted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least there is geotagging support on the OmniaLITE allowing you to record current location in the image EXIF. The list of extras is competed by smile shot, and a dedicated panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not particularly impressed with the image quality of the Samsung B7300. While the amount of resolved detail is decent we find the noise levels higher than usual. The colors also look pretty dull. At least there is no loss of fine detail in the photos and no traces of oversharpening.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the OmniaLITE can offer VGA resolution (640 x 480 pixels) at 15fps. Needless to say, this kind of specs are nothing to cheer about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So despite the decent camcorder interface we doubt it anyone will consider taking videos with their OmniaLITE seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is fully covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity, the Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE is pretty much as well geared as a handset can be - HSDPA 3.6 Mbps, Wi-Fi, stereo Bluetooth. There is no HSUPA but we are willing to let that one go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The network connectivity options of the touchscreen handset include quad-band GSM support and dual-band 3G (900/2100 MHz). In case you are wondering what bands your regional 3G network supports you can check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 is supported as well through a microUSB port. When connected to a computer, the OmniaLITE automatically connects in either ActiveSync or Mass Storage mode - whatever you preset in the Settings menu. Unfortunately, there's no option to be prompted every time you pair the handset to a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OmniaLITE has a hot swappable card slot too. If you have a microSD card (up to 16GB) and a card reader ready at hand will certainly give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing: lack of Flash is a deal-breaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE comes with a couple of pretty decent browsers preinstalled to make best use of its rich connectivity. You get the new version of Internet Explorer Mobile with the WinMo 6.5 update, plus the Opera Mobile v9.5, which is also preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Opera browser is extensively touch-optimized and draws inspiration from the iPhone's Safari. The browser has matured since its first reincarnations and now exhibits no rendering bugs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mobile v9.5 is heavily optimized towards vertical scrolling you can scroll through complex pages without missing a beat. Panning sideways is a little slower - a checkerboard pattern appears for a moment before the content is drawn, but this lasts for only a moment so it's no big issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in and out is also very fast. You can use the one-finger zooming pattern that we described in the gallery but its implantation isn't as smooth and responsive as it was the Omnia II. Double tapping is also very accurate as it zooms in to where you tapped, eliminating the need for much panning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WQVGA resolution of the ample display isn't as good for web browsing as the WVGA of the Omnia II so you will need some more panning with most web sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a landscape mode which we prefer when there's more reading involved. The browser orientation is changed automatically of course, thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the OmniaLITE couldn't handle Flash videos, making anything but the mobile versions of sites like YouTube a no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer Mobile web browser has also been blessed with some touch-optimization but we still find there is a lot more to be demanded from it. Still, the inclusion of kinetic scrolling is a nice move forward for Microsoft.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five available setting for the text size and there is a mobile view mode. Still we are far more comfortable using the desktop mode as web pages look much more natural that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming though is a lot chunkier with the IE - the very convenient solution of the Opera browser doesn't work here. Instead you either have to access the zooming mode from the menu or hold you finger over the screen and go through the context menu to make a slider appear. You can then use it for controlling the zoom but there is no Fit-to-screen mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The double tapping is also present here but it was pretty buggy on our unit and only worked about a third of the total time we tried it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A flaw of the IE browser is the fact that it doesn't automatically rotate the pages with the built-in accelerometer. One would think that this is the easiest thing for the developers to do but they obviously saved themselves the effort here. There isn't a setting for manually switching to landscape mode either, so like it or not - portrait is all you get. We saw Internet Explorer Mobile happily auto rotating on the Acer neoTouch, so we guess Samsung may fix that with a software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess that and the handicapped zooming is exactly what dooms the Internet Explorer Mobile of remaining second best to the Opera Mobile even after the major overhaul it has received.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with desktop MS Outlook. In the OmniaLITE you mostly get the standard Windows interface for the calendar. It has been slightly modified in the new version of the OS and doesn't look as dull now but there aren't too many changes in the functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly and agenda views but there are no different appointments available for setting up. Instead you get a single appointment item that you can place in different categories but you always get the same fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is support for cutting, copying and pasting of events and you can also filter them by categories if you wish. Any of the available view modes can be set as default and you can choose the first day of the week to be either Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get the Touch calendar with the OmniaLITE, which has much better looks and is better optimized for finger use but slightly lags behind in terms of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tasks application allows you to add tasks and assign them priority. The Notes also come in handy, as you can either type or directly write the text down on the screen. The Audio Note and the Calculator need no explanation - their interface is only slightly polished, compared to previous-generation WinMo devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Memo is an application that allows you to take notes by writing directly to the phone's screen. You get different colors and brush sizes plus you can zoom in and out of those notes. You can even save them as JPEG files or send them over MMS, email or Bluetooth if you want to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock allows you to set a vast number of alarms to act as either wake-up or reminders. The dedicated wake-up alarm has three slots, which should allow you to wake up at different time in the different days of the week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can however set as many additional alarms as you want, each with its own name, repeat pattern, snooze time and ringtone. You also get to pick the volume and whether or not the alarm should power on the phone if it happens to be switched off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other extra features of the clock application are World clock application that can keep you updated with the time in as many time zones as you want, a stopwatch and an anniversary list. In the latter you can enter as many anniversaries as you want and optionally set up an alarm for each one to act as a reminder on either the day of the event or up to 7 days before it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final item in the organizing package is the neat and simple converter (fancily named Smart converter) that offers weight, length, area, volume and temperature conversions. There is also a currency converter and a neat Tip calculator.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Document editor as good as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of Office Mobile, you also have the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only are their very good for viewing your office documents straight from the phone, but they also offer editing too. There are no extra charges - you are good to go straight out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Adobe Reader LE, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. We are extremely pleased with the performance of the OmniaLITE in this area, as opening and handling PDF documents is usually rather slow on most handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications are plenty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE has got plenty of preloaded applications, outside its organizing and multimedia packages too. There's the regular stuff such as an RSS Reader and a Streaming Media manager for a start but there's some new cool stuff also.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RSS Reader application is rather self explanatory. It gives you quick access to RSS feeds for staying on top of the latest news and content on your favorite websites. The Podcasts application allows you to subscribe and download video and audio podcasts of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Digital Frame application allows you to use the B7300 OmniaLITE as a digital picture frame with content of your own and highly customizable styles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have music playing in the background too and, if needed, event alerts such as incoming message or alarms can be suppressed when the Digital Frame is running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application is the rather handy Search Phone, capable of searching throughout applications and the whole file system. You have the option to set filters so that the application searches only in the places you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the OmniaLITE is equipped with two search applications - the other is named Smart search and adds some nice graphics and transition effects to the whole searching thingy. Oh, and it's pretty good at actually finding what you are looking for too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MSN duo of applications - Money and Weather - is also here. Those are convenient tools for retrieving weather and stocks updates straight from you handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE arrived with a pre-loaded app called Application Download, granting you access to Samsung's app store. Of course, there's the inevitable comparison to the App Store as the structure and concept is quite close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications are displayed into several tabs - Recommended, Hot and Category. You can also see all downloaded items or to search for new ones. Before you download an app you can read its detailed description and check its rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also found the Microsoft's own Marketplace in the Main menu. The application distribution solution should help third-party applications find their way from the developers to the users handsets by basically cutting off the middle man.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the new Marketplace application is pretty straightforward - it gives you shortcuts to the most popular applications, the most recent ones and category view. There is of course a search box too to make things easier as the number of applications grows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of now, there are only 102 apps available within the Marketplace, which is almost twice as much as there was when the service launched. The number of free ones however remains disturbingly low with the prices for most ranging from a few pennies to 50 US dollars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace is nicely setup as well, offering user reviews, screenshots and, as usual, individual ratings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS would be better off coupled with a satnav app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE features a built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS support. The assisted GPS allows for much faster satellite lock upon cold start thanks to current satellite data downloaded over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no navigation software preinstalled on the OmniaLITE so you will have to get one on your own expense. We downloaded and tested the free Google Maps app just to see if the GPS would have any issues with a third party app. Google Maps had no issues recognizing the receiver also we guess using it with a third-party app of your choice will be as easy as cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, GPS navigation software is a regional thing and on your local market the OmniaLITE can be pre-bundled with some sort of satellite navigation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile has long been flirting with the midrange but PocketPCs are not so keen to go down?erm? the ranks. HTC would drop an occasional lower-end handset but it's not really what they do best. But we guess the market situation is now forcing manufacturers to reconsider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung are quite eager obviously to update their fleet of WinMo devices and the Omnia lineup is trying to cover the whole range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE may not be as impressive as the top dogs in the Omnia family but its purpose is equally essential. The handset has the potential to introduce WinMo to a wider range of users and - more importantly - to communicate Samsung's vision of how the platform is shaping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the original Omnia did great in its day and is now deservedly praised for the legacy it left. But we're on the Omnia II and OmniaHD chapter already and as long as the OmniaLITE is aware of its place in the ranks, it has no reason to fear misleading its users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i900 Omnia</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should remember though that we can only properly judge a handset (especially in the mid-range) when we measure it up to its rivals. You can take a look at the HTC Touch Diamond. The former HTC flagship is now settled in the midrange and has the price to prove it. Not only will it save you a few bucks but it will also spice the display up with VGA resolution. However the size of its screen is a bit smaller, it offers less RAM than the OmniaLITE and runs WinMo 6.1 - not 6.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch Diamond</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are not yet sold on the Windows Mobile platform you can also check out the Android-running HTC Magic and the Symbian S60 pioneer Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. Both of them can match the rich connectivity of the OmniaLITE and offer an altogether different user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Magic ? Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is clear though that the Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE will face the toughest competition from HTC Touch2, which we have to admit, scores way higher on looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, performance and screen size are both in favor of the OmniaLITE. Not least, the price of the Samsung handset is obviously lower and that's quite a head start for the OmniaLITE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, whether it will or will not be more successful than the Touch2 is not that important after all. The statement the OmniaLITE makes is more than clear. Samsung are willing to take the battle on all ends and aren't giving an inch of their ground without a fight. Not a particularly good time to be their rival now, is it?</paragraph>
